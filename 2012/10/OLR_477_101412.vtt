00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
George, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 477 for October the 14th of 2012.

00:45.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at vognetwork.com to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
Sadly not with us tonight, yet again, DarkSakura, not here in studio, which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Well that's the magic of the internet you see. She's sick today. She caught Disneyland plague or something. She caught the gay.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Anyhow, with us tonight in studio we do have Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? I'm alright. I have a cold.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
You have a cold, but it's not the gay. It's not the gay. Alright. The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think.

01:36.000 --> 01:46.000
I know, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
Anyhow, also say hello too. We have a guest host here. We love it when he's available and on standby. Say hello to Alan.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It's me again. How are you again? I'm good. What's new with you since the last time we talked to you?

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
Not much. Working, working a lot. I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work. My amazing boss got me the day off.

02:08.000 --> 02:19.000
You gotta make the money. There you go. And so actually it looks like your horrible terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words. Not kidding.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm giving him a hard time on purpose.

02:22.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, um, let's see. What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show? Oh yes, be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:36.000 --> 02:48.000
Or VOG Network dot com. Home to a variety of great geek shows. Not just video game shows. I think that's important to point out is that we do have some awesome video game shows obviously with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hardhouse.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
We also have some non-video game shows. Things like Understation Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Out of My Jam Session, etc, etc. Lots of good stuff.

02:58.000 --> 03:09.000
So it all goes down at vognetwork.com. I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight, but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit, my voice is shot tonight.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.000
Because, and I think a lot of other shows on the network have been talking about this, Understation Live, and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before, and I think I mentioned it on here too.

03:19.000 --> 03:31.000
I was asked, I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the Return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento, and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
I also emceed the show. So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people, and it felt really good.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
It's not like what I do.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Kind of. Kind of. On this show every week. Except I could see them. I couldn't hide from them.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I could see them too.

03:49.000 --> 04:01.000
I knew you were going to lose your voice, so get damn close to it, because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally, like, you blew your voice out. Like, we could hear. That sound wasn't like...

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, no, and I think I even cracked a joke, like, oh, I didn't mean to go into puberty on stage or something like that.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, it was like, he's not going to enjoy that the next morning.

04:09.000 --> 04:20.000
It was bad. It was bad, but we're okay. Well, I have a crazy idea for a topic, okay? Here's a kickoff topic, my crazy last minute topic tonight.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So we know that this is the season for video games to become movies, because I don't know what it is, but every October, well, I do know what it is.

04:29.000 --> 04:41.000
It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films, which usually includes the video game movies. Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October.

04:42.000 --> 04:52.000
We're getting Silent Hill, and I'm not saying these movies are crap, but Hollywood kind of views them as crap, because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Exactly, so most video game movies end up coming out in the October season.

04:57.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, I think, you know, if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January. I think that it's just a good time. I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies, sort of. I mean, Resident Evil's more of an action movie, but...

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever, and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out.

05:19.000 --> 05:33.000
Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually. Although, technically, it's a November movie, and I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean, here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph. I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right? Because it's Disney and it's video games.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
So, obviously, there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph.

05:42.000 --> 05:53.000
But I think for... I'm not sure how it's gonna do in the mainstream. I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney, so I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
But it's kind of that odd little place. It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear. I don't think that'll actually happen.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Or it'll catch on and be able to sustain itself through Thanksgiving, because that's sometimes what a lot of family movies do.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
Family movies don't always have the huge opening weekend and then disappear off the map like October movies, like Paranormal Activity and stuff do.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
These movies tend to have consistent... They're not number one, but they're number three or something four weeks in a row.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
And that's kind of where I think Wreck-It Ralph's gonna end up. At least I hope the movie does well.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I think it's gonna do better than that.

06:32.000 --> 06:41.000
The funny thing is I think it's gonna be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both, and there's a lot of people that are excited about that.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph. What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game movies and so forth,

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
I just finished doing a stage show. So what video game do you think deserves a stage show? What video game deserves an adaptation?

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style. What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off-Broadway production?

07:17.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, they've already kind of done this as a video, but Buggy Saints Row. Because that video was hilarious. Because it was done Broadway style. And it was hilarious.

07:31.000 --> 07:41.000
So I'd go for that and have a bunch of people doing the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being buggy.

07:42.000 --> 07:52.000
Or you can even do Buggy Driver 3 because Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy. I want new music for that though.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Maniac Mansion.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's probably almost too easy of an answer.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
It was a TV show at one point, right?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah. Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
It'd be like Ice Capades. Someone comes out in a dolphin suit. They're swimming through rain.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Hey, hey, hey. Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate? Because I want to see that.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
Alright, let me get some answers from our chat room. I'm gonna go with the I can't believe Alan didn't say this answer.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Mass Effect? Hello? Should Mass Effect be a musical? Come on.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You can't do those effects on a stage. That needs a movie.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
That would be amazing.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It would not be amazing.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

08:59.000 --> 09:07.000
Wicked says Final Fantasy 6 the opera scene. I think that's a very, you know, well, I mean technically it was an opera.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
So it's like now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
That's like Street Fighter 2 the movie the game type of thing.

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Dark Sakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land. How would that work? Somebody would just pole dance on stage.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Irritating Stick. Katamari Damacy.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
It's like Lion King right there. It's like some crazy, crazy stuff.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Someone like they're going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something? What happened to that?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Stan in our chat room says Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Now there you go. There is a great musical idea.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
That could actually work, which is kind of sad.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.000


10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Sad in an awesome way though.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Let's see, SSG100Matt says Parappa the Rappa.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
Let's see, Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario Burlesque show. Same with Zelda I think.

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
That's just cosplay strippers. I mean come on, that's all that is.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
Burlesque show. Okay fine, let's just add some class to that. It's a fucking cosplay person stripping.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Hey now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Good, I aim to offend everybody.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You are so rude.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, here's the thing. At least you can say this, if the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it?

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
Drag queens. So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show?

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows. What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city?

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
They were all really amazing actually. One time I went they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night. It was amazing.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
That's why San Francisco is more alternative.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Oh, excuse me. San Francisco's hipster drag apparently.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
The whole cabaret, the greatest love of all, you're not going to find that there.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Rama in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Burlesque stripping, fine. Are we really just going to like...

11:41.000 --> 11:52.000
Are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing? It's the same thing.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Alright, let me get to a few more answers here in chat.

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
Frisbee says they've already done a Phoenix Wright musical in Japan. There's that movie coming that I keep forgetting is like a thing.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
So I hope I get to see that soon.

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
Let's see if there's any other... Jessica Harper from Understation Live says, Crazy Taxi. It's one hell of a taxi ride.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Can I have a Crazy Taxi musical? There you go.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I want to change my answer.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, what do you want to say?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Out of This World?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You know that French game?

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, I think Jamie did that as a classic game once, yeah. Good answer.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Awesome. And DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Actually, I got to say the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions. I've seen that.

12:45.000 --> 12:54.000
So, there you go. Thanks to the wonders of the internet. Whenever a dude dresses up as peach, it's always on the internet the next day.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Alright, there you go.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
So in our kickoff topic, we managed to talk about burlex shows, drag queens, musicals, and offend people.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
There you go. I'd say kickoff topic well done.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
Alan, I usually let Dark Sakura start. She's not here. I'll let you start. How was your gaming week?

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Good. Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out, I've been playing the hell out of that.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
You guys talked about it a little bit last week. The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and seven unlockable character.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
Pineapple Toaster Oven? Awesome! I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens. Sounds amazing.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you? So you don't have to.

13:59.000 --> 14:11.000
I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit, but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
Mass Effect Infiltrator, because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone. I now have a Galaxy S3.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
So I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it.

14:28.000 --> 14:36.000
It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like...

14:40.000 --> 14:49.000
If you've ever had someone, like you show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto and it's someone who does not play video games and you have the controller and you're like,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
okay, here's how you move and here's how you get in the car and then you just drive off a cliff.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
The first thing you do is they just die because they don't know how to play games.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
And I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said that he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
And he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit. I can't believe I beat it all the way through.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I really wanted to like it. There's a lot to like about it. Like for a phone game, it looks really good.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, it looks like Mass Effect. It's an over-the-shoulder action game.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Because it's all with your thumbs. You just swipe to... it's horrible.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Stop trying to make touch gaming happen. Like it sucks for some of these hardcore franchises.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Well, Fruit Ninja, yes. For whatever they're doing in that game, no.

15:39.000 --> 15:49.000
That's really it, I think. Oh, and Tiny Tower. I know a lot of Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
I had the Blackberry equivalent of the Nokia brick. You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
And the brick is fine. I had the Blackberry equivalent of that. And now, so going from that to this Android ice cream sandwich.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah, in Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names. The laundromat is called the Stank Panties.

16:20.000 --> 16:29.000
I've got... the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say. So it's porn studio because of the name I gave it.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
So yeah, it's good times. Good times killer game.

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out?

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
To be pragmatic about it, you represent the Apple portion of this household, which is fine. I'm not hating on that.

16:53.000 --> 17:03.000
But it's like, if we want to be, you know, the ultimate geek duo, we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions, they can ask me the Android questions.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
If I want to be pragmatic about it, make sure all of our braces are covered.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
That is the best possible answer you could have given. Good job. This is why I keep you here.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So I will investigate whatever it is that you don't like.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5? Because it's new! You gotta get the new thing.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever.

17:31.000 --> 17:43.000
So let's see. This week I played some Vita stuff. That was also another thing. I wanted to play games on the Vita because I haven't been and it was sorely neglected.

17:44.000 --> 17:58.000
So I tried out a couple demos I had. First, Gravity Rush, which was pretty cool. Just not really something, I mean, it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now.

17:58.000 --> 18:11.000
I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a unique looking game. It was fun. So I played that. I played Little Big Planet Vita. Well that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this but then I played it and it's Little Big Planet.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
It's great but it's got, you know, the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there and I was just kind of like, eh, it's another Little Big Planet game. Probably won't play this so I'm not going to get it.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
That's kind of a bummer.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Well no, it's not that at all. It's a good game. It's just, I have Little Big Planet 2 that I haven't played. Why am I going to buy another Little Big Planet game that I probably won't play?

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
I need to finish other games first before, you know, I'm just trying not to get into that mode of like, I need to get all these games because they're good.

18:43.000 --> 18:50.000
Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff is going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that.

18:50.000 --> 19:01.000
I ended up, you know, there's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet like 3D Dot Game Heroes. I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It's a good game.

19:04.000 --> 19:13.000
It is a good game. I know it's a good game but that game came out around the same time as like Red Dead Redemption or something and it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption, you know, and I just kind of lost track of that.

19:13.000 --> 19:25.000
We have a new story coming up later and maybe I'll mention it to them but there's this really good, really, really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games and they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money I could like catch up on three years worth of gaming.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
And for that amount of money I think it's a good deal even if you don't play them because that amount of money for one of those games is so-

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
We're getting ahead of ourselves though, sorry.

19:41.000 --> 19:50.000
The game I actually did want to play and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first was Retro City Rampage.

19:51.000 --> 20:01.000
I've been looking forward to this game forever now and they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita so I bought it for my Vita and it's fantastic.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
If I didn't have a cold, you know, at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
If it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything.

20:17.000 --> 20:29.000
It's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but it's a fantastic game.

20:29.000 --> 20:40.000
It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says the developers love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played and stuff like that.

20:41.000 --> 20:50.000
It even has modern references and stuff in it but the story is just throwaway. It makes no sense whatsoever but it's got everything and it's seriously a great game.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3 hopefully but on the Vita it's still pretty awesome.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Although the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller like in different sections of the map and stuff like that.

21:03.000 --> 21:13.000
So playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV but on the Vita the screen gets really small so that might be something that might turn people off from it but it's a fun game.

21:14.000 --> 21:23.000
Especially if you like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 it's very much like that but even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto it's still a great action game with all sorts of crazy stuff in it.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
From Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future. It's great.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
And then of course more Minecraft. I played a lot more Minecraft. I fished up my castle basically.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't know. Come join the server if you haven't yet.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
And then Call of Duty we bought Map Pack 2 so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we were playing.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
Once again tried doing another streak week. Missed it by another game. Oh well.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Getting close. Getting close.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
And what else? I think that was it actually. I think that was all the games I played.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
So Alan you'll get a kick out of this. You know how the live listeners will understand this. Podcast listeners I apologize for a minute but we're having these stream dropouts.

22:12.000 --> 22:21.000
It looks like it's happened twice. And yeah we just so you guys know we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
The cable modem and the router off for an hour.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight. Now we're on 2.

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
So it's like it is not in this house. Like the problem is not in this house. The problem is Comcast on their end.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Spell hey you know why you guys keep dropping our stuff.

22:45.000 --> 22:56.000
Well I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
Because if Comcast goes down then our net should stop working. I should get booted from IRC. All of that should happen.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
So that makes me wonder is it our stream provider that's really having the issue.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
But it doesn't happen to Bobby.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
That's right it doesn't happen to Bobby.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
He's on it for an hour.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
So what the hell is the problem?

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
Could be our is he where is sorry forget it all. Where's where's where's it located. Where where are we piping to right now.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
That's a good question that I don't know the answer to that maybe Bobby does.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
Because if it's in the Midwest or the South it could be our connection to there and he's you know Anna.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
It very well could be. Let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to because I'm actually not sure.

23:38.000 --> 23:38.000


23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I know but you know what deal with it.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
He says New Jersey so you would be infinitely closer.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Oh yeah so for us if we're piping in New Jersey then there's yeah it's probably the stream weird to us.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
This is New Jersey so no wonder the streams oh stop it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
We're still early and we haven't even started story.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
You've done burlesque people.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
New Jersey not saying there's anything wrong burlesque burlesque is awesome.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Because it's once again women stripping off their clothes which is you know that's fine.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers the strippers kind of go all the way whereas burlesque is more of the teas and stuff.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah but they're still stripping off their clothes.

24:19.000 --> 24:26.000
They're just they're just like you know skin Amex strippers versus you know the stripper strippers.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I guess.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Oh boy all right.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Who spilled Jager and spray tan on the server rack.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
Moving on to my gaming week.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I had a very dark soccer week.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
My gaming week was very dark soccer.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Does everybody know what that means.

24:43.000 --> 24:43.000


24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
That's right I played him.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
No no no that's that's dark soccer circa 2009 gaming week.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
My gaming week this week was I played a lot of wow.

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
I did some dailies and you know just I shouldn't say a lot of wow because I didn't play a lot of wow but I played you know because I've had weeks where I played a lot of wow.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
But this is not one of those weeks but I played enough wow to do like a few dailies here and there and so forth.

25:06.000 --> 25:16.000
And then I played Mass Effect 3 because as Alan mentioned the new DLC went up the multiplayer DLC and it's very well rounded.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight the collectors from part two.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
So that breathes new life into it.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
It has some new classes.

25:26.000 --> 25:35.000
It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my premium specter packs but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
It's called Cerberus Adept and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips and you're just like Hulk smash Hulk smash everything and it's great.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Vanguard's like that too.

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah it's awesome. Like we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends and one of my friends was like who sent the body flying out the window.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm like me. So yeah Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun and I like that they've staggered this content a bit.

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
So like what is it every Tuesday we're going to get just a handful of new things right? Every Tuesday for a little while? That's awesome.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
I don't know if they're doing it because there's 16 new kits where a kit is a character within a class.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
So we got four of them. There's supposed to be 16 so that's only a month's worth if they're going to do four a week.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
They should probably do every other week.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Maybe every other week. That would make it.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
Because next weekend should be the next scenario challenge because they do that every other weekend.

26:34.000 --> 26:42.000
And the other big thing they added is they have kind of like mini achievements now. Like it kind of runs on a similar system to like achievements or trophies but you're not unlocking official things.

26:43.000 --> 26:50.000
They're not game achievements. It's within the multiplayer. Like you've used biotic charge 30,000 out of 50,000 times.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
So when you hit the 50,000 and then you can unlock titles that appear next to your handle in game lobbies.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
So kind of similar to like Street Fighter IV has that kind of similar idea there.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
So that breathes some life into it too because it's like oh now I have all these things to work for.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Because if you've been a person that's been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer since launch which there is a lot of people that have been.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
You've probably got all the other achievements by now. I mean there's not a lot else to work towards.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Alan, heck you haven't even been playing since launch but you're in seven score is what 800 and something now?

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
It's like 820 now. It would be higher but when I do golds and silvers I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
Oh okay. I see. Gotcha. Alright. Alright well that was my gaming week. So let's move into some housekeeping.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
We are on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We are on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards.

27:49.000 --> 27:59.000
So please for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now and I think they end either tomorrow or Friday.

28:00.000 --> 28:07.000
So please consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast. If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us that's cool.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least bare minimum support Indie Podcast.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And then Stitcher I believe it's every day or every day you can vote.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
You can nominate for Stitcher every day. You can. So podcast award is just one nomination.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced.

28:29.000 --> 28:39.000
Remember you know usually I hate the whole begging for votes thing but it really is good exposure and these guys you know as much as some of these big podcasts are fine.

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
The NPR podcasts are great. Like wait wait don't tell me he's a great show. The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
But the problem you know they don't need the additional exposure. They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff so we really want to see the indies succeed in these.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too. Just like there's good indie games.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
Anyhow let's move on to the news. Oh wait no one other thing I got to plug. Very important.

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest. And I was a guest this week. I don't know how I fit this in this week but I did.

29:19.000 --> 29:31.000
I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network their gaming show. It's episode 54. I don't think it was on their feed yet when I checked because they are having some website up seas and down seas but it will be you know very soon.

29:32.000 --> 29:42.000
Nerdgasmnetwork.com so take a look for episode 54. I was on it. And I felt really bad because I had to go before they were done but it was just that kind of week last week.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
So hopefully they'll have me back at some point because we had some funny in-jokes that were going on there so I had a good time.

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
So you'll hear more about putting it all out on the table and I'll just leave it at that. Alright let's get into some gaming news.

29:56.000 --> 30:04.000
And Burlesque Top I guess. Yeah yes. Actually very similar to Burlesque but in a different way. Let's move on to gaming news Loki.

30:05.000 --> 30:18.000
So it's another year so another Microsoft game has been leaked. Hurrah! Apparently Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
And you know there's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play blah blah blah.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
It's already leaked. Yes it's absolutely 100% been leaked. It's out there.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
And of course you know they're like well we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked. 100% it's been leaked. Okay.

30:43.000 --> 30:54.000
Has it been leaked? It's been leaked. I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good.

30:55.000 --> 31:08.000
And also I guess some other information. Apparently the game is going to be on two discs. The second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc.

31:08.000 --> 31:15.000
Kind of like Forza 4. Now Loki help me understand something. How are people able to play this game before the release date?

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Uhhhhh. Piracy. Oh. Okay.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
But piracy is bad. It is bad and they will get banned if they go online. That's it. And Microsoft called the po-po.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh yeah. They're really investigating it. They're asking for it.

31:35.000 --> 31:46.000
Look. Obviously they're going to say you know they're going to invoke the police because and you know it is a crime. You can poo poo it all you want but stealing shit is a crime. Right?

31:46.000 --> 32:03.000
So but what will the police really do to investigate you think? Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program? Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked.

32:07.000 --> 32:21.000
Well then the police aren't doing a very good job. I hate to say it but let's see Gears of War 3 leaked. Halo 3 leaked. Like every big Microsoft title leaks. Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar?

32:21.000 --> 32:31.000
No. Any title like out there. Any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out. And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers.

32:32.000 --> 32:45.000
They usually get stuff you know Monday prior or you know if it's you know direct retail partners like say GameStop and Best Fies and stuff like that. They're getting their product probably the week before on Wednesday or something.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
Now here's how I think this happened. And this is totally speculative. I have no...

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
This is not the week before. Halo's not supposed to be out till like for like three weeks.

32:56.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah exactly. Here's how I think it happened. Well a couple of ways. One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it. You know an actual copy out of the duplicator.

33:05.000 --> 33:21.000
Or this happens occasionally. The warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early. Like way earlier than they were supposed to receive it in.

33:21.000 --> 33:36.000
For example you know personally we had some Skylanders stuff you know for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been. Like about a week earlier. Which is usually unusual.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Well lucky you. Some lucky asshole got me Halo 4. You got Skylanders.

33:41.000 --> 34:01.000
No no no. We're not doing anything with Skylanders. But I'm just saying it happens. There's been Microsoft released games in the last few weeks. We had Fable and then next week we've got Dance Central 3 and then we've got Forza Horizon. So there's going to be a lot of Microsoft shipments in the next few weeks.

34:02.000 --> 34:17.000
So perhaps one of those got out and somebody unscriptedlessly bought it or got a copy and put it out there. Or who knows. It could have just been somewhere else. An employee. You never know. Because it's one of the biggest games.

34:17.000 --> 34:33.000
This and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are going to be like the ones. The scene groups out there fighting each other. Who's going to be able to release it first. And you know it's all bragging. All E-peen bragging rights basically. Like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not. So that's it.

34:34.000 --> 34:42.000
So here's the question I have to ask. How can Microsoft stop this? How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening?

34:43.000 --> 35:00.000
They can't. They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game. Just the whole handling process of it. The way other publishers do it. At least they try to prevent street day violators is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains.

35:01.000 --> 35:23.000
So we're talking like you know getting a day early instead of a week early. That type of thing. But obviously it's something like this. This hasn't even. I mean as far as we're aware this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet. This is just some screw up somewhere where something either got shipped way earlier than it was supposed to or someone internally leaked it out.

35:23.000 --> 35:42.000
That's the problem. But the team they have they've had problems with leaks just in the last few years all the time. I mean was it last year there was Gears of War 3. Remember that game got leaked down the Web. You know by Microsoft or I'm sorry it was a third party review company or some garbage that they were saying.

35:42.000 --> 36:04.000
But basically the actual source code and I or it was like the source code in something was leaked out and you can actually download it off of an unencrypted Web site or something. It was just ridiculous. So yeah it's not good but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end. I mean they're still going to sell a buttload of those.

36:04.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah I mean the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth. Am I the type of person that sits there and goes aw every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or you know so forth. Yet I'm not allowing said company to make money. You kind of can't have both right.

36:33.000 --> 36:52.000
Now I don't think people have to get paid. Yeah I don't think that's fair though. I think what you're basically saying though those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff and some of it has nothing to do with you know how well the game sold for they need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would not necessarily because piracy ate up you know hundreds of thousands of copies.

36:52.000 --> 37:11.000
I mean because once again that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly. I bet you a lot of people that pirate the game are probably just they want to play it early and they're going to still buy their preorder when it comes out or you know they were never going to buy the game in the first place and they would have pirated it when it came out.

37:11.000 --> 37:28.000
You know normally it's just that's once again you can't the industry can't just assume that each one of those is a lost sale as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place.

37:28.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm going to tell you this much. They only download it because they can. Exactly. And you know I I did with grant the thought of four grand thought of four came out it leaked down the Internet one week before it came out. I still bought the game. I want to play it right now. I want to play it as early as possible and so I did. I played it a week early but who cares. I think I've more than paid for it. I bought what six copies of the game when it came out and it's six copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and six copies of the first deal.

37:57.000 --> 38:10.000
See before you know the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out. I think they got my money. So I don't feel so bad about you know playing the game a week early. I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution.

38:10.000 --> 38:21.000
I think this is why you see some companies may be rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy.

38:21.000 --> 38:33.000
It won't stop it but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the disks and the going gold and shipping and the problems there. You're cutting that all out.

38:33.000 --> 38:46.000
No leaks out even earlier than games like this. Xbox Live arcade games. Wow. They leak out even earlier. No why. Why have access to partner net still people download them off partner net and they put them out.

38:47.000 --> 38:59.000
They crack it and put it out. Yeah they crack and put out so digital distribute the people are going to find ways around everything. All they want to do is to cut out the mailman with that stuff so that means more profits for them. It's not going to curb more piracy people are going to find a way no matter what.

38:59.000 --> 39:13.000
I mean no matter what they put out there people are going to find a way. But a game like you know Halo 4. Yeah it's going to get part of it. I mean all the games get pirated but I don't think that they're going to sell like it's not going to be like oh crap.

39:13.000 --> 39:36.000
It didn't sell at all. That's not going to happen there. No one's going to shut down 343 studios because it didn't sell because of all piracy. It just ruined the whole game. No it's not like that. There's not that many people you know compared to the millions of people buy that pirate games is such a small section but they would want you to think it is because you know they got to blame their loss of sales on something.

39:36.000 --> 39:52.000
Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies. No because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and the same people will pirate it.

39:52.000 --> 40:11.000
Rama in our chat room says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps. I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can.

40:11.000 --> 40:28.000
I mean if you're given someone the option to get some free versus paying for it. Why wouldn't you get it for free. I mean I understand that there's this whole morality of oh well if I don't pay. I mean they try to push this shit on you even in legality. You are taking a risk. I understand that but it's just OK.

40:28.000 --> 40:47.000
It's it would be like I don't know it'd be like walking into a department store and all sudden there's like hundreds of looters inside there and they all scatter in every single direction. Good luck catching every single one of those. I mean it's a risk but you know the officer is not going to be able to catch every single person.

40:47.000 --> 41:05.000
It's kind of the same way piracy. Yeah people get nabbed every now and then but there's so many people and so much piracy happening that you know it just has a hole like over everything that you can't catch everybody. The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place and then there's nothing for them to pirate.

41:05.000 --> 41:15.000
You know what though I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say you would never catch me down there being one of those looters. I just think it's wrong.

41:15.000 --> 41:26.000
And like I would never participate in a looting event like that and I really believe that about my character like and I'm not trying to say like I'm better than anybody else or whatever but I know like they had a situation like that happen in Britain.

41:27.000 --> 41:37.000
Not that long ago like there were these huge riots and all these things and there were these looting and you know a bunch of kids got caught went to jail and all this stuff and I remember looking at it going what a bunch of fucking thugs.

41:37.000 --> 41:50.000
I wouldn't be one of those thugs. That is ridiculous that stuff. I mean my analogy was that there's how do you go after everybody. You can't. Yeah because yeah as a literal metaphor I don't really think that's the best comparison.

41:50.000 --> 41:59.000
There's a huge difference between the plausible deniability of maybe downloading a torrent from the privacy of your own bedroom versus throwing a chair through a storefront window.

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
Of course once again the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing.

42:06.000 --> 42:15.000
Yes. The great debate that will never end. But maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it. We'll make our money other way.

42:15.000 --> 42:26.000
No seriously that's a great idea. As long as you could secure DLC. But that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirated as much as one gives me copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it.

42:26.000 --> 42:36.000
And that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try because it's free there. I if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know.

42:36.000 --> 42:52.000
And that that's why I think it is a good way to go. But then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free to play model for their paid games and that just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just going to not only am I going to pirate this game but I'm also going to pirate all your DLC.

42:53.000 --> 43:00.000
Alright well moving on. This piracy debate will never be settled so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news.

43:00.000 --> 43:10.000
But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated. Let's be real it wasn't very good. No I'm kidding. I'm trolling I'm trolling.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this too. It's Street Fighter X Tekken.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I'm sorry you can't pirate something that's already on the disc.

43:22.000 --> 43:30.000
There's a whole nother argument we could save for another day. Is it piracy when it was on the disc anyway? We'll save that for next week.

43:30.000 --> 43:40.000
Alright but moving on. This wasn't on the disc what I'm about to talk about. It's a free what they call hefty like the trash bags hefty update later this year.

43:40.000 --> 43:48.000
It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals.

43:48.000 --> 43:58.000
Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth. Including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia and so on and so on. Lots lots.

43:58.000 --> 44:09.000
Also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita. I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
But that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Didn't that game flop?

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
I think flop is a strong word but I think it.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Just perform as well as they'd probably hope.

44:23.000 --> 44:31.000
Word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews are like this is not very good.

44:31.000 --> 44:40.000
What I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I think it's still a long way away.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Namco just started working on it this year.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Wow.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Like began.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
They already had their we're gonna Tekken tag too so.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Maybe they've been kind of developing them side by side.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
They have the engine now they've made the engine so it's been.

44:54.000 --> 45:00.000
This wasn't the their joint project for this was announced what two or three years ago right.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
I think when they did the press release the Namcom is making one and Capcom is making one.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Yeah that was two or three years ago.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
But yeah no.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
Namco has only just now started even designing the game.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
So maybe next year or the year after.

45:14.000 --> 45:23.000
We'll see maybe maybe it'll be on the next generation of consoles maybe this is a PlayStation 4 game troll troll.

45:23.000 --> 45:31.000
Although yes they were busy if they wait too long it's going to have to be if they wanted to sell but anyway let's move on.

45:31.000 --> 45:39.000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase crown.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Do you live in the Seattle area.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
If so no.

45:45.000 --> 45:52.000
If you do you might want to head over to a valve software's website and take a little play tester survey.

45:52.000 --> 46:00.000
And see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
They haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it has a fridge.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
So yeah and if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area is it is that right.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
They're looking for hardware testers and there's just it's a questionnaire.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
How long have you been gaming.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Are you a completionist are you an achievement hunter.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
How often do you unlock hundreds of everything.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
How often do you beat like it.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
You would be qualified for this Rob.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Shut up.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Well you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Up through the teeth.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And you can expect that those will be broken.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Wait.

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
So from whatever however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
They have an alpha clearly that they are they want people under lock and key to go check out.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Very interesting.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Whatever their steam box is.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I look forward to what leaks out of this.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Moving on Loki.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Alright.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
So of course remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
And so now Gaikai's website they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
You see images of living planet as well as uncharted and looks like kill zone in there as well.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
They have some skills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

47:28.000 --> 47:37.000
And you know they didn't really say you know what any additional details or something.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
But obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon.

47:43.000 --> 47:50.000
So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement E3.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Nothing else.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Unfortunately around the same time though.

47:55.000 --> 48:04.000
So Gaikai they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit on a Delaware company called T5 Labs.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
They filed a suit against them.

48:07.000 --> 48:19.000
I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing and graphics processing unit between plurality of programs.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
That's the patent.

48:25.000 --> 48:31.000
Now I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
But I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent company.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
So they have no comment on it but there is the lawsuit in place.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Is this what really put on live out of business.

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain it would have been you know one of the other companies that deals in this you know same technology.

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
I just you know I'm willing to bet the T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You probably can't even find them on the Internet.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I'm going to even check that out right now.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Let's see T5 Labs.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
Let's see are they even a part of the Internet.

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
Here we go. T5 Labs dot com and.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
And yeah it looks like they've got some just crappy flash animation on here.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.000
But it's implied that it has to do with games because.

49:24.000 --> 49:33.000
Because they've got static TV and it's tied to a server and what games do they make.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
Oh good. They have these the whole Star Wars scroll on here because that's not annoying to read.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set top box.

49:44.000 --> 49:54.000
There's the service operates on the video on demand client type system and says T5 Labs patent pending technology allows the system to work on the ultra low latency.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
We call it instant gaming.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
So it well that does sound like it does seem like.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Well it does seem like then that they are actually making something it's not a patent troll company.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
So I guess I am corrected.

50:10.000 --> 50:16.000
All right. But that is is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
All right well moving on.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
I guess I'll troll you all by talking about Mass Effect because you know we don't shut up about that on this show.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I know you're a big fan of this.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
Well Alan are you looking forward to the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Why are you so excited about that.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Because it's Carrie-Anne Moss.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
She's going to fucking shoot bitches in the face.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
She's like fuck you. I'm Carrie-Anne Moss.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Like Carrie-Anne Moss was in the Matrix which was cool like 12 years ago.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
She was also the mom in that Shayla Buff movie and I saw that.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
Oh and she I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well actually.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Okay.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Yeah I think she's one of the crazy cool I think she plays the villainess I think.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Yeah.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
So where was the Borg Queen last time. This time it's Carrie-Anne Moss.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
There you go.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
Well anyhow I suggest you do not fuck with Aria in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan.

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
It really wasn't.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
Now Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Yeah Lair of the Shadow Broker was great.

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got into.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Yeah.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
That would be great.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy.

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
Because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of, oh I'm blanking.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
Harrison Ford in the 80s. Blade Runner.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
A lot of Omega is based off a lot of the scenes in Blade Runner.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
And the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in 3.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Also the big news about this DLC.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
Female Turians for the first time you're going to see.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Yeah.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Now.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Fans are wary.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
But the first time in the game is certainly a big deal.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yeah.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
The fans of course want to see.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
When you say the fans you mean who?

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Tumblr?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
BioWare forms?

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
All of that.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
The fandom.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
How do Turians have sex?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Because clearly they're all men everywhere.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
People are worried that they're just going to put a Turian head on tits armor.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
And be like, there it is.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
They're fucking reptiles they shouldn't have tits.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Thanks BioWare.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I'm interested to see what they do.

52:49.000 --> 52:54.000
And when you're talking about all of it you've researched the fandom through extensive online research right?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Yes.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Have you ever written a fanfic?

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
No.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
No I don't.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Have you ever read a fanfic?

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
I've read some hot M. Shenko stuff.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
What was your favorite M. Shenko?

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
I think it was Caden was jogging through the citadel in booty shorts.

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
And everyone was catcalling him and Shepard was all flustered and offended.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Caden was like, I don't know.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I can't believe you actually had an answer for that.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
That's great.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
Anyhow, just trolling you live on air.

53:39.000 --> 53:47.000
Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Masani,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
is supposed to return in this.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I don't remember him being in 3.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
No, he was in 1 quest, wasn't he?

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Yeah, he's in the quest with the little Volus from 1.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
That's right.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
And he's in the refugee camp.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
You can talk to him.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Yes, Zaid sucked anyway.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Sorry, this is my opinion.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
$15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end of Mass Effect.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Absolutely.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Is that more than Shadow Broker was?

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
Was Shadow Broker $10 or was Shadow Broker also $15?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I think it might be $8 or $9 now.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't know how much it was back in 2011.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
Well, it's going to cost you $15 now, so hopefully there will be enough to substantiate that.

54:22.000 --> 54:27.000
Now, if you look at the multiplayer, even if you don't play multiplayer at all, which,

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
if you don't, I do think you should give Mass Effect 3 a shot.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
If you're scared that like, oh, I'm going to suck at multiplayer or whatever,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
or I don't like first person shooters or whatever, I do urge you,

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
give Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a shot because the fact that it's all co-op based

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
gives it a much different feeling than playing Halo or Modern Warfare Online.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
I've never had a bad experience, but I'm on the PC model,

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
which is probably the smallest base of all the multiplayer because they're not integrated.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
PS3's got its own thing and XBLA's got its own thing.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
Believe it or not, on the 360, I've never had a bad experience.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
Go figure. Outside of connection issues, but it's better on the 360 than it is on Origin.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.000
But that's another story. Anyway, the new DLC gives you a great idea

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
of probably what you're going to see in this Omega expansion.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I mean, I can't see how they're not going to use the collector stuff.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I mean, if they've done all the work to put them into multiplayer,

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
I can't see how they're not going to show up somehow.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
It'd be very easy to justify in the lore.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm sure there's a way to work it.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
And Cerberus... I'm going to get so nerdy in the ending of 2.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
Cerberus took the remnants of the collector base at the end of 2,

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
even if you blow it up, they still have it.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
So they could be controlling the collectors now,

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
or the collectors show up and ambush both you and Cerberus.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Either way.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
Shane Alinko in chat says they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up?

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the collectors are there too.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
The Illusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps,

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer, though.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Not originally.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
But you definitely see some multiplayer maps,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps,

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
but it was just kind of different.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
Anyhow, all right, enough Mass Effect talk. Loki's getting bored.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
All right, hater, let's move on.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Remember Darkstalkers?

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
2D fighting game, really creative characters,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
really underrated franchise.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Well, Capcom is bringing it back.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic-Con this past week,

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
and it is a HD cleanup of Darkstalkers 2 and 3,

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
and it's bundled together in one pack, similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
And also, if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen,

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
it's going to be a package like one of those.

57:25.000 --> 57:32.000
And it's going to be, I think, 1200 Microsoft points or 1499.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So, yay, Darkstalkers.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Were you a fan of Darkstalkers?

57:35.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh, I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn, and I imported Darkstalkers 3.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Nice.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Because it used the 4-meg RAM cart for the people that played X-Men vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn,

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
if you remember that.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
It supported the 4-meg RAM cart. It was arcade perfect. It was gorgeous.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Do you think you'll be picking this up?

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
I'm going to say no, just because how often do I turn on the 360?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Seriously.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Fair enough. Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
maybe you'll have a reason to.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Yeah, it's possible.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
Mass Effect 4 Xbox exclusive, what are you going to do?

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
What are you going to do?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I'm just kidding. I'm trolling them.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game, or was this all the announcement was?

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
I think they were teasing that something was going to happen,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
and I think this is that something,

58:26.000 --> 58:32.000
but obviously I think it's trying to either get people talking about Darkstalkers again,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
or to gauge interest for a new Darkstalkers.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I kind of think this is where Capcom's going.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I think there's interest to get this franchise revitalized,

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
and I'm sure this is a big step in either getting the awareness out there

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
before a possible E3 announcement, or gauging it in the first place.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
A lot of people don't realize,

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard,

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
where you do the zigzag across all six buttons,

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
That's the engine that they did that crazy combo system in.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Wasn't that also Killer Instinct? You could kind of do that too?

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
Those were weird, like Link.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Those were very specific things you had to do.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
When you say zigzag combos with the six buttons, that's honestly what I think of.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
All right, well, let's travel around the world

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Let's start with the US, Loki.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
All right, so let's see here.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
This week, we have quite a few things coming out,

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
starting off with Rocksmith, guitar and bass.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Technically, it's like the first game with the bass expansion,

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
as well as bundled with an electric guitar.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Also, let's see here.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000
We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
What else here?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Noomba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Jeopardy on PS3 and 360.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Man, that's been delayed forever.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
That's finally coming out.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
That was delayed quite a bit.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Maybe they made it better.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I certainly hope so.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Let's see, what else?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I do know that one week from today,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and I think that's it.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Also, they're going to have a portal owner's pack

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
in case you think about the first game.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So that would be it.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
All right, let's travel to Japan and look out there.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
when are they going to do a rock smith for keyboards?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Like, keyboard smith.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
If they do that, I am so there.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Like, I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar, honestly,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
but I used to play the organ,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
like the double-decker pianos with top and bottom.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I used to play that when I was younger, like way younger, like 5 to 10,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but if they were to do this so I could, like, refine my skills,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I am so there.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
If I could, like, you know, because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I really do.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Remember the keyboard main that they had for the actual keyboard?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It was on PC?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah, I do. Yeah. I didn't own it, but...

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Did you ever play Rock Band 3?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Of course I played Rock Band 3. I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and that was fun, too.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That was always my favorite of the Moana games,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
even though it was horribly neglected.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That is also, I guess, coming...

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live Points you can get, too,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I guess, for some of the transactions in the game.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Oh, okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Again, those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Interesting about Dance Central 3, I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I don't think they localize for the area or whatever,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
so don't get excited if you're a J-Pop fan.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I don't think there's anything to look for there,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
or just Dance 4.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Let's see, going to some of the handhelds.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and The Legend of Heroes Zero no Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Just saying, if you haven't bought the Vita version of FIFA 13,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
you may want to hold off.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Why is that?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's exactly the same as FIFA 12.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Oh, I thought that was the Wii version.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Both of them.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Oh, no.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Bastards.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
That's pretty awesome.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Those are your Japanese release dates.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Sure.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And UK-ish?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000
October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
October 17th, we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and The Unfinished Swan on PlayStation 3.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Dance Central 3 on the 360.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
because movie tie-in games are always phenomenal,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Those big cross-platform juggernauts.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
RockSmith on PC.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And that is it.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Just a few more news stories for you guys,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Dark Soccer isn't here, so we're taking over.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
See what we picked in a minute.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
But first, Loki.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Apparently, SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you get some songs,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Shut up.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Hey, don't be a jealous hater, because I have SingStar Abba, which is awesome,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
SingStar Queen, which is awesome,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And how many songs a la carte that you've bought?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Enough.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Enough to have a party.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
but when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
we used to have SingStar parties, and we had a good time.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I bought SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like eight bucks.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
How are you going to say no to that?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And it was new.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It was brand new, still wrapped.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
but I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
as a free download very soon.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And apparently they're going to offer that as a download,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and then you buy the song separately, I guess.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Which I think that's kind of cool, because if you think about it,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
they did something similar with the PSP version of Rock Band,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
where they had a demo that you can get, and it came with a couple songs,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and then you just build your own rock band library.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Instead of paying 40 bucks or whatever for the game,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
you can save that money and buy 40 bucks worth of songs that you want to sing.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Maybe you don't like all of ABBA's songs.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Maybe you only like a couple.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
You buy a couple ABBA songs, and you buy some Britney Spears or something.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I'm sorry.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
get out of here.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Good idea for Sony?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I think it's a good idea.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Might as well.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
They haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I think it's a good idea, because it's going to get more exposure for people,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I mean, they really don't.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
They don't?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
No, they don't.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I bet they do overseas a lot better.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
They probably do overseas, but honestly,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
karaoke games don't do very well.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But everybody's got a USB microphone,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
They work on pretty much all systems.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So you get one of those in a throwaway game,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
like Truth or Lies or something like that.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I don't know.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And you've got a SingStar mic.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Well, actually, no, those SingStar mics are different.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
for, like, dirt cheap somewhere.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm sure that, like, a GameStop or Walmart or something

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
has them in their dump bin.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Just go looking for it.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
All right.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Well, let's move on to one more story about, you know,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
this always pisses people off when there's content on the disk

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
which, you know, we started using the term pay-to-unlock content

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
instead of DLC for certain things.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
has some things locked away on the disk,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Pay-to-unlock DLC.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
But apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disk,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
including no hope difficulty level and co-op for Ada Wong's campaign,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So no word if they only made it free because they got caught.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Or I actually, you know, all trolling aside,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I can see the value of doing free DLC

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
because it extends the life of your game past the first week,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
especially in the very busy holiday season

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
where there are so many games competing for your attention.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I can actually see the value of this.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So, you know, I can't believe I'm about to say this,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
but good on Capcom in this case.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's just so they can release a gold edition of the game later on

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
with the actual stuff unlocked already.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
That's what they did before with Resident Evil 5.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Remember they had all that, like, PlayStation Move updates?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Just reprint all of it and put it in the new gold box?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
We'll put it in the gold box and we'll sell it again and people will buy it.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I mean, that's what's going to happen.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
but it will not already be on the disk. It's coming later.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So, all right.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I don't think when this game originally came out.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Maybe one was out. I don't know.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
There was.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
There was a 1. All right.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But, okay, back when the Resident Evil series was good.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
There was no download content.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
That's right. There was no download content.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64. Remember that?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Oh, yes, I do. I do.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
It's a classic game of the week.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Dark Soccer. She ain't here again.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So we've snatched her pick away from her

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and we've picked an awesome game in her place

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
that we think you guys should be playing this week.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And we gave it to Alan this week.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So, Alan, what is your classic game of the week?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Well, usually when I do this segment,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I do, like, old Sierra Online PC games or, like, LucasArts.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So I wanted to give consoles love this time.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And I wanted to do something handheld

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So I chose Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
for the Game Boy Color because they are super awesome.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Legend of Zelda, Seasons, and Ages came out together, obviously,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
that you then plug into the next game and then you continue the story.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And once you beat both of the games,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss,

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
and then you get to see Zelda proper and you get the real ending.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And one of the big deals about this game

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
They let a subsidiary of Capcom, called Flagship,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And I think that may be one of the first times

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
be in the hands of someone else.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Now it's not that rare because Sega has done stuff

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000
This game came out in the US in May of 2001,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
which was the month before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
before that generation was phased out and the Advance took over.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Yeah, so if you play one game,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
some of the items that you get are upgradeable in the second game.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
There are a lot of little side quests and little...

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Look at these little cartoony cut scenes too for Game Boy Color.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Yeah.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
So if you play both games, depending on which order you play them in,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
you can upgrade certain...

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Like the hookshot and bloom ring, certain items you can upgrade

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
to a tier that you couldn't normally get

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
In Oracle of Ages, there is a time mechanic

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
where you speed up time or slow down time to get past...

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
To solve certain puzzles in the dungeons

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
In Oracle of Seasons, you have a rod that will...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
If there's a river, you'll make it winter

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and the water will freeze so you can cross the river.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Stuff like that.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
or was that one of the other Game Boy games?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
That was Link's Awakening DX, wasn't it?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
One of them you could plug into the Game Boy Advance

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and then there would be this special...

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Actually, maybe it was the Advance Shop.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I think it was something...

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Because you say this one...

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Because I remember playing it

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
and this was right on that cusp of when

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
the Game Boy Advance first came out, right?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Yeah, it was a month before.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So, you know what? I think it was this game.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Because I think I remember playing it on the Advance

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
and the Advance had some special little thing in it.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I'm not sure about that.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Maybe I am.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Somebody in chat will correct me.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
That's the lovely part of doing a live show.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
is that...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Nintendo, Miyamoto has even come out and said this.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
In the handheld Zelda games,

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
on the console versions.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Because the console ones are obviously the big deal.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Now with Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
even Wind Waker,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
they still find ways either with the art direction

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
or the werewolf mechanic.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
They're always coming up with stuff to keep the series fresh,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
but you're always going to have the three medallions,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
you're always going to have the Master Sword,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
you're always going to fight Ganon.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
There are these staple things that are always in those games.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages' Minish Cap,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
that's when they really get super creative

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
with the world of Hyrule

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
and the stuff that you can do.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
They usually introduce a lot of new characters

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
that you'll never really see again in the handheld games.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Link's Awakening, with the fish or whatever that's sleeping,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Do you know it? Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Yes, I do.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Yeah, so that's just an example of how Zelda really shines

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Now, I did some research, and the Advanced Shop was

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It was a shop. It was not a dungeon.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I think I called it the Advanced Dungeon at first.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
That's probably what confused you.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
When these games are played on a Game Boy Advance,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
there is a shop.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
They have two seed rings and a gasha seed.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Depending on the game, it's either the GBA time ring

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
or the GBA nature ring, while the other is a random ring.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I remember it's right here in the article.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
the graphics were also much improved.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So they had obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to be read by the Advance.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That's awesome.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
So, yeah, if you look this up on YouTube,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
try to find the Advance run-throughs.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the first Zelda game, you know, overhead,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
big expansive map, you go into dungeons,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
because the items that you get in the dungeon,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
the treasure is what you'll need to solve puzzles

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
in the dungeon after that, and so on and so forth.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I think the double witches could be wrong there.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's been so long since I've played this.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But, yeah, there are these...

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
The oracles are these ladies that you meet

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
when you're transported to these new worlds.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
These games don't take place in Hyrule

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
like a lot of the handheld games.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
So, yeah, they are in danger, and there's...

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
So you rescue them, and then as you progress through,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
you beat the one game and you play the other one.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
and the Triforce factor into it.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
They're a lot of fun. If you're a big Zelda fan

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
and you haven't played these, you're missing out.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
All right, good pick. Your classic game of the week,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Two games for the price of one.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Yes.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
All right, thank you very much, Alan. Good pick.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I think Jamie would be happy.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
All right, well, that's going to do it for Part A of our show,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
as we get back, including some rapid-fire news,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
the FUGO Question of the Week, and some interesting rumors

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
about Miyamoto's new direction.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And an event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
We'll talk about that. It's not our event. It's somebody else's.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
We'll talk about that a little more when we come back

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We are live with the 477th episode of our show

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
here at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And looking at the chatroom during the break there

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
at live.vognetwork.com, looks like Bobby's talking to some of the people

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
in there about his experience with the drill

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
and some of the band stuff that he does.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I know he does a lot of that stuff professionally.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Little-known fact, I did marching band in high school, too.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I played the clarinet and did a lot of those field shows.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And it had me thinking about that video.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And surely you all have seen this by now.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It was all over Facebook.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Even people I know that aren't that into video games were posting this.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Did you guys see that Ohio State marching band show

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
where they were doing the tribute to all the video games?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Surely you guys saw this.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Logan, you see this, Allen?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
No.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
You didn't see it?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
When they did the Galloping Horse, it blew my fucking mind.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I know. It was really amazing, some of the stuff they were doing.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this, too,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I'm sure we're not the only band nerds

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
that happen to be into video games and all that.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But it is a lot of work,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
because you not only have to memorize songs,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
but you have to memorize where on the field you're going.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's not the hardest thing in the world.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I thought it was easier than memorizing lines for a stage play.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But it's challenging.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And I have even more respect for that video after seeing it.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
That was an amazing little piece.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And it also made me super jealous that we didn't get to do that

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
when I was in high school.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Amazing.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Jessica Harper from Understation Live is in our chat room

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
at live.vognetwork.com and says,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I was, however, the drum major my senior year.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I feel like she's told me that before, and I forgot.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And that's awesome, because I tried out to be drum major,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
but I wasn't picked.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Somebody else was picked.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I'm a drum major reject.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And now look at me. I'm on a podcast about video games on the internets.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Anyhow.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Drum major reject.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
That'll be the title of my first album, Drum Major Reject.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
All right.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well, I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
All right.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I apologize again for my voice, you guys.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I am kind of struggling through tonight's show.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat-coat cup of tea,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and then I go back to,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
My voice has got to scratch.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
So I will do my best.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
or not next couple hours, but next hour or so,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
of the show for you guys,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That is correct.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
that they've got on Amazon right now.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It's a bunch of Square Enix games,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
and I think it's a great deal.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It's 10 bucks,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and you basically get Deus Ex, Human Revolution,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Augmented Edition,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Just Cause 2, Just Cause,

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and The Last Remnant.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
For $10.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And the sale is running through October 20th.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
It expires at

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
11.59 PM Pacific Standard Time,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
so go get it,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
because, I mean, that's

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
seriously a great price.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
and I gotta say, kind of once, actually.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Square Pack from Amazon.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And these are all the PC?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
All PC.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Yeah, The Last Remnant, which, you know,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
was their exclusive RPG for the 360,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
which was a huge pile of shit,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
if you have a good PC, it plays fine.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So the technical issues that it had

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
on the 360 are on PC,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
and you should actually play that game, because it's good,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and no one would ever know, because it was so awful on the 360.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So, overlooked,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Square RPG.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Agdeft in our chatroom says,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Amazon won't let me buy it.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I wonder if that's the Mexico thing.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
That kind of sucks for those

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
that are in other countries. I'm sorry.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't know what else to say.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
It sucks.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Actually, you know what?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
It may not be available anymore. It says currently unavailable.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Maybe it sold out.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Maybe so many people jumped on it.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And here's the thing, too.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
The DRM on it was Steam,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
so you were getting some sort of codes or something.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
For a lot of games.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Oh, wait, wait.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I see it right here. Actually, no, I'm sorry.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
It says unavailable, but then there is this

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
buy and download thing.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Let's try clicking that, just out of curiosity.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Just come on.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
No, it will not let me.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
During some of Steam's

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
really insane 99 cent sales,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
this happened with GTA 4

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
and Ballad of Gay Tony.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
They had a note.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
We don't have codes.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
We ran out of all our codes,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
so we have to contact Rockstar Games

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
for 20,000 more codes.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
That could be the issue that's happening here.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Well, they may have had limited copies,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
and then once they hit all the blocks, then...

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Well, that sucks.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
AlphaCananagram in chat is saying

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
don't know if Loki said, but

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
feel free to use the code

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
S-Q-R-L-U-V-I-O

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
to take $2 off any digital video games

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
purchase. Code will expire

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
when this product becomes available for purchase again.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I wonder if that means Amazon

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
didn't intend for this to happen

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
or something weird is going on.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I don't have that code either.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Very strange.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
These bastards.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Alright.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I bet you're mad for waiting now.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Check tomorrow.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Oh no, I do see that.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
It says currently out of keys.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Back in stock soon. $2 promo.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
There it is.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Just give it some time

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
and keep checking back, I guess.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Great deal.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Either way.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Either way.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Alright. And then, of course,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
we have to talk a little bit about

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
some DLC and Sleeping Dogs.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
They're going to have quite a bit of

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
DLC soon. Starting next week,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
they're getting some

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
street racing DLC. It's going to add

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
some new street races

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
in the game, I guess, for $4.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
That's what's going to run you.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It's going to have three new races across

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
land and sea. And also,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I guess, there's some new street

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
racer DLC that they're

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I guess they're adding a new motorcycle

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
as well.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And a new outfit

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
that boosts, I guess,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
defense against gunfire and accidents.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Then there's also going to be

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
some DLC on the

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
30th that's

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I guess it's sort of

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
similar to like, they're kind of

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
comparing it to Undead Nightmare for

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I don't know if there's zombies in it or not, but

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
it's supposed to kind of tie in

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
with Hong Kong Cinema.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I guess the beginning, it's Nightmare

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
in Northport.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And it'll be some

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
horror-themed thing that says

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
with the DLC we can

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
explore other aspects of Hong

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Kong Cinema.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
So, no idea what exactly

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
that is or how much it's going to cost,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
but that's going to actually be story DLC

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
that's going to be coming pretty soon.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And last but not least,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
DLC for Borderlands,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
which by the way, if you haven't heard

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
yet, that free DLC

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
that if you bought the, or pre-ordered

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
the game and you got the premier club or whatever,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
they actually released the

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
extra character class early.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So that came out last week, so that's

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
pretty awesome.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Another game I really need to go back and play some more.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But first piece of DLC

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
coming on the 16th,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
so this Tuesday, it's Captain Scarlet

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
and Her Pirate's Booty.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
And that's coming for

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
10 bucks,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
or if you want, you can buy a season pass

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
for 30 bucks and you get four pieces

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
of DLC, so, you know, 25%

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
off. And really,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I mean, if you played the Borderlands 1

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and played all the DLC in it,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
you know it's going to be good. So,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I'm sure that

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
the DLC will be pretty awesome. I'm still waiting

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
to hear on

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
how it goes and maybe I'll have to

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
plunk down the 30 bucks for a season pass.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Alright.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Well, going into

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
news on a game that I really should

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
check out at some point because I did love

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
the old series and I hear it is kind of

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
a, you know, newer version of that.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I just haven't had the time this week to

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
pick it up, but it is XCOM

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Enemy Unknown. The revival

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
of XCOM. Well, there's a pretty nifty

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
in super soldiers. You can

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
put in certain names and they

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
activate XCOM Heroes.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I don't know, for some reason it makes me think of

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
NBA Jam when you could put

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
in certain combinations that would unlock

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Bill Clinton and Scorpion

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and shit. That was awesome.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So, I don't know. But here's the type

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
of people you can unlock here.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Sid Meier.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Ken Levine. I think

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Joe Kelly and Otto

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Zander are apparently all super soldiers

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
so far.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Apparently the one little trick to it

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
is that once you summon the heroes,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
the achievements are turned off.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
So if you want to go for achievements

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
don't use this little cheat.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
But maybe once you've beat the game

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and got the achievements you want, go back

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and play as Sid Meier. For the lolz!

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Moving on

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
to a Street Fighter movie

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
that apparently is not being made

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
in Japan.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
This is a Brazilian

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
artist. That's pretty cool. Victor Hugo.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
He's a real big fan of

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Street Fighter and he wants to do

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
this movie that he calls somewhere

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
between next gen fighting game and Hollywood

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
animated movie.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
He's teamed up with an animator friend to make

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Street Fighter 3.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
It's a fan flick

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
and it looks really, really

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
nice. Especially in these little

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
posters. It looks even better

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
than like

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
in theaters. It's a really neat art style.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Kind of impressive that it's

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
only these two guys.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Even more impressive that Capcom hasn't

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
in Brazil makes it complicated.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Good luck to them.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I really would not have

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
brought this up because I hate giving this

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
attention but it is a slow news week

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
so I will quickly say

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
PETA put out their little spoofs this

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
week of Pokemon Black 2

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and White 2. It was a little spoof

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
game that they put out. Here's their statement.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Enjoy this

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
from PETA.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Much like animals in the real world

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and used for things as human entertainment

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
and as subjects in experiments.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
The way the Pokemon are stuffed

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
into Pokeballs is similar to how

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
and let them out only to perform

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
confusing and awful painful tricks that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
were taught using sharp steel tipped

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
bull hooks and electric shock prods.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
If PETA existed in Unova

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
our motto would be

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
They exist for their own reasons.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
We believe that this is the message that should be

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
sent to children.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Now Pika Pii!

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I just want to remind

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
you guys PETA is clearly trolling

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
with this. Look at that statement.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Over half of the

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
statement had nothing to do with the

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
game they were putting out. They used

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
half that statement to talk about the whole

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
circus and the elephants and all that

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
stuff. It is all about

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
attention. I mean clearly

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
they play Pokemon.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
They understand Pokemon because they know

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
about like the Pokemon world.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
They said if PETA existed in Unova

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
they didn't say if PETA existed

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
in the Pokemon universe or if PETA

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
ruled Nintendo. These people

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
know what the fuck they're doing by getting

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
attention. Congratulations.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You picked the right

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
week to do it at least if nothing else.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Alan. I

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
played PETA's Cooking Mama game

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
from Thanksgiving and

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
whoever they contract to do their

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Shockwave games, some of them are actually

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
kind of good. That almost

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
is the reason why these things are worth

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
covering because as much as they are

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
trolly and it's like

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
you just roll your eyes at PETA

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
they are really

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
high quality trolls.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Yeah, because the Cooking Mama

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
one was how to make a Tofurky

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
in the vegan Thanksgiving.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
You click and drag the food ingredients. I'm like

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
this is a pretty well done little Shockwave

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
game.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Do you

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Because I do.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
The sequel ToeJam & Earl and Panic

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
on Funkotron are going to hit

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
the PSN and

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
XBLA online stores on November

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
6th and 7th respectively.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I never played this because

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
at the time I was at the age where

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I was really kind of butthurt.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
It's basically

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
a 2D side scrolling platformer

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and the original ToeJam & Earl

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
was like an overhead sort of adventure

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
game.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
So yeah, if you're a fan of ToeJam & Earl

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
and want some vintage Genesis

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
nostalgia, pick that up November 6th

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and 7th.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
God of War Ascension

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
which is the next God of War game because you know

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
they're not going to let that franchise die off.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
The demo is going to be in the Total

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Recall remake.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
The one with Colin, whatever his name is.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
That comes out on

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
December 18th.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
So get the Total Recall

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Blu-ray, play God of War Ascension

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and that is going to be the only way to get

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
that demo until four days before

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
the game comes out. I think like March

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
8th is when they're

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
on March 12th of next year.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
look really like

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
disgustingly awesome.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Very God of War-ish.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Finally

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
the game Injustice

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Gods Among Us which I will admit I don't really know

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
much about. It's being put

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
out by NetherRealm. They are

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
has a DC Comics character

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
in it. It's going to be Green Arrow.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Who some people might remember like you know the show

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Supernatural which finally ended after like

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
It's the Green Arrow I think is

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
best known. Wait, Supernatural's not done.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Still on the air, isn't it? Oh, I meant Smallville.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I'm sorry, Smallville Superman.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And now there's an Arrow series

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
on CW that like just either it

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
just started last week or it's starting this week.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Oh, is it a spin-off of the same actor? Yeah, I think

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
they're trying to make Smallville Lightning Strike twice.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yeah.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
a character in Injustice Gods Among Us.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
There you go.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Yeah, and it's the

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Justice League outfit I believe from

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
the Cartoon Network show. Shane

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
in chat says, different actor sadly.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Oh, well that's just

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
unfortunate.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat, I want to go back

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
to the PETA thing for a minute. Remember, they're delayed

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
as animals eating other animals?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Again, this is

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
proof that they're trolling because

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
you know obviously Tokyo Jungle

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
is the game to take issue with but they know

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
No one curr about Tokyo Jungle.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But what's a game that everybody talks about?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Pokemon. Anyway, I'm giving

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
this story far too much attention. I just wanted to

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
address that comment because it was worth

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
commenting on. I don't think they really have a problem with

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
people or with animals eating other

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
animals because that just happens in the wild but

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
as long as it's not people eating

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
other animals, that's really the issue

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
there. So by that logic,

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
would they be okay with

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
people eating other people?

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Yes.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Because they're only for the

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
ethical treatment of animals. Nothing about

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
people. Oh, okay.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Just wanted to make sure that was clear.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Unfortunately,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
doesn't exist. Well, you know, we need a people

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
for the ethical treatment of people.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
That's what we need. That's the foundation we really

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
well, I sound like such an asshole

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
and that's not really what I'm saying.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
But I think we should

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
have a, you know,

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
what about how we treat each other? Isn't

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
that important as well?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Anyhow.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Again, giving it far too much credit.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
You know what deserves more credit on our show?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Our Facebook and Google

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Plus fan communities.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It's the Fugal

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Question of the Week. Take Facebook and Google

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
and put it together and you get Fugal.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And the Question of the

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Week this week.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Kind of a little

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
play on the fact that I've been on vacation

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
for a little bit.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
What is the worst thing you've

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
missed in real life so you

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
can stay at home and play a video game?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
launch? Did you stay at home

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
to raid on World of Warcraft instead

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
of going to your friend's birthday party?

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Excuse me. Pick up.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Bad time.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Worst nightmare for a radio person.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Did you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
going to your friend's birthday party?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Let's go to some of the answers on Google.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Starting with actdeft. I don't recall

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
missing anything serious for a video game.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I have come close though. Like

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
almost missing class to get a Dreamcast

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
on Black Friday. Remember I'm from

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I think the most serious one was when I

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
offered to help in a DDR tournament the same

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
day I had agreed to help some friends with

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
a political party's elections.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
But forgot they were the same day.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Since I'd agreed to the former first, my friends

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
didn't mind and let me go to the tourney though.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
So no harm done.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Sean F. replied on Google Plus.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Yes, there are people on Google Plus.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I have to say that every week.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And said I wish I had

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
a terrible secret to reveal. But I think

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
the worst I ever did was I took the day off

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
in 2005 when I got a PSP

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
at midnight release. Wipe out

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
pure and luminous. Good times.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Indeed

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
good times. Let's

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
go to Facebook and get some answers

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
to the question there in our Facebook community.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Starting off with

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Where'd the post go? Here it is.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Critical Myth says

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I've been far more likely to miss things like

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
company Christmas parties to see

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Lord of the Rings premieres.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But a friend of mine skipped his own

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
performance review to stand

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
in line for the 360.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
He still got promoted.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Skipped his performance

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
review at work to get a 360.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
That's a pretty good one. He must have known

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
with his boss.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Degenerated Johnny says

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I was leading my first raid in

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Molten Core during Vanilla WoW.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Unfortunately the raid was during the time

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I was supposed to pick my mother up from

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
the airport. She was coming

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
back from a trip to her homeland of

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Scotland. This resulted with her

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
being stuck at the airport for two

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
hours. As punishment

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I had to act the role of being her

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
personal chauffeur for an entire

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
month. It wasn't all bad. It allowed

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
us to have some good times with each other.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
This proves that sometimes gaming

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
experiences can help push families

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
closer together.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Even if it was through force, right?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Haseo Sumeru

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Excuse me, sorry

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
guys, the voice is going. Haseo Sumeru

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
says it's funny that you

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
mentioned the Final Fantasy launch thing because way

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
back when I first started playing Final Fantasy

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
X, I faked getting sick

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
so I could stay home from school.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I went all out, had a heater

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
in my room, aimed at my face to fake

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
the fever and water bottle with ice water

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
for cold sweat. And it was worth

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
it because I managed to make my way through the

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Zanarkand ruins all the way up to the final

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
fight, I think.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Dark Tetsuya says I actually skipped school

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
the day I got the original PlayStation.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Ironically ran into my high school

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
tutor at the time who didn't seem to mind.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Yes, I did graduate.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
says, never happened.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
In real life is always

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
more important than a game. The game will

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
always be there, but real life

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
experience only happens once.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Oh, you.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
What a party pooper answer.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I'm just kidding.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
That's something we probably should remember.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Anybody in here with a story to

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
share? What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
life to play a video game? Allen?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Um...

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I did some

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
all-nighters when I was in high school

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
where I just didn't go to bed. I just

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
because when you're 16, 17, you can do

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
that shit. Your body's like, fine, I'll be up

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
for, you know, 36

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
hours until eventually you can crash.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
But as far as missing,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I mean, I

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
when the PS2 came out,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I got up, I went to bed at like

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
eight in the evening, got

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
up at one or two in the morning,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
walked, I think, two or three

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
miles to Target, got in line

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
at Target at like 4 AM.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
There was

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
already a line. I got PS2

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I think 38 out of 43

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
so my timing couldn't have been any more

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
flawless from wanting

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
to actually avoid camping the

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
entire night out. And then I went

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
into work. Once I actually

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
to say 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
my boss the night before, so...

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I've never been

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I've never done anything that scandalous.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I've never, I don't really think I've

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
taken a, have I taken a day off work

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
to play a game?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I don't, I, if I did, I honestly do

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
not remember. I took a day

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
off work to play World of Warcraft.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Yeah, because Pandaria, that used to be, yeah. But

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
to be fair, I ended up having a Disneyland

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
trip and I would have taken the day off anyway.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
True. So,

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
but the, I guess my

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
real answer would be that I cut

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
a lot of class in

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
college to play Final Fantasy 7.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It was real

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
good and I was really into it, okay? I was more

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
into it than some of my classes I had at the time.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
You weren't really into college that much anyway.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I really wasn't, so I, I skipped

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
a lot. I probably cut class

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
to stay home and play Puzzle Fighter 2

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
with friends, so, or

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
excuse me, Super Puzzle Fighter 2

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Turbo or whatever it was called. I probably

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
cut class to stay home and play that with friends and it

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
was worth it, I don't care. Low-key.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Um, I

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
skipped work, well I took time off

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
for, um,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Grand Theft Auto, well, recently

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
it was, well actually it wasn't that recent, but

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Grand Theft Auto 4, to try to

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
get 100% on everything so I could get the keys

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
to the city, which I technically

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
did within the time frame that they had

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
in the whole contest thing, but

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
registering the information correctly. There was a

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
huge delay, so, I unfortunately

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
didn't get the keys to the city, but

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
um,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
got the achievement for 100% though.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I took time off work when Final Fantasy

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
11 came out. I remember

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
that, I was so jazzed for that game,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I totally took the day off when that came out too.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
That was years ago.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I didn't skip work, I just took the day off.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So I guess it's not as

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
bad if you planned it in advance, right?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
In the future.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
In the future, planning for 2013.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Alright, we have some more news stories

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
for you guys, and then we'll get your

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Skype calls here in a little bit.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Alright, so there's this

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
new patent from Sony for

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
a controller.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
a Playstation Move controller, but apparently

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
it's a controller that allows

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
the user to feel

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
temperature change. So,

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
for example, the controller could get

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
hotter, like if your

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
gun overheats, or you get hit by

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
a fireball, or you're in an area where there's

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
fire, or something like that. Or,

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
if you're in a

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
icy area or something.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
It's kind of like a temperature

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
feedback, as well as how they have

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
the force feedback and stuff.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So, neat!

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I don't know if it's necessarily something that

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
they're going to be

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
implementing into a Move controller or something

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
like that soon, but

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
it's kind of cool to have this technology

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
around for whenever you may

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
use it in the future,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
for some new controller or something.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I don't know if it'd be a big deal,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
like, you know, a controller got cold

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and went into an icy area. It'd be kind of,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
haha, that's neat! I'd like to

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
leave it cold all the time, you know.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Sometimes your hands get sweaty.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Maybe it should detect whether your hands are sweaty, and then

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
cool off. There's a third-party

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
company idea right there.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
If Playstation

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
had indie games,

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
somebody would release an indie game that's called

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Hand Warmer.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
And then the

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
sequel, Hand Freezer.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
You know who needs this technology?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Microsoft for the Xbox 360.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Why?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
So the system doesn't crash.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Oh, okay.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I see what you did there. That's good.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It's just water-cool everything. I don't know.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Well, it wouldn't be hard for the Playstation controller

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
to get hot. They could just put in there whatever

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
they put in iPhones,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
because the iPhones get really hot if you're, like,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
using it too much.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
When it's really straining

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
for a signal, I notice it gets really hot.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
That's how they could do it.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Maybe they could

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
implement this into the iPhone.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
You know, when you piss off Siri

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
melt down into your hand.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
You'll just...

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I'm gonna burn your hand now!

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Wrong answer.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Punishing games.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Kinda... dumb.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
This would be something that you'd add to, like,

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
haptics later on, but let's get the haptics

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
thing out of the way first, you know.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I think more people would be interested in

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
touching things rather than, ooh, it's cold now.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
First off, actually, challenge number one.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Getting people to buy the move.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
That's challenge number one.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Challenge two, implementing, you know, temperature

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
change in there, and having people

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
be interested. And seriously, how is temperature

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
change gonna come in handy in, like,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Just Dance 4, or, like,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I don't know, Archery

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
in Sports Champions, or...

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Maybe this is why the last Guardian got

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
delayed. Maybe he's guarding temperature.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I don't know.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Maybe it's because it's gonna be a launch

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
in another system or something.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Alright. Or maybe it's nothing.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Maybe it's just somebody

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
had the idea and it was like, you know what,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Well, this is an interesting

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
little rumor that's going around.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Take it with a grain of salt, because it's

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
spawned from a NeoGaf post, but

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
you never know. Sometimes where there's smoke,

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
there's fire. Sometimes.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Rumor is,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Shigeru Miyamoto is expected

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
to leave Nintendo's EAD division

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
by December. How many times has his

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
rumor been around? I mean, seriously, there was

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
another rumor that he, this was like a couple

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
months ago, that it was the same

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
damn thing. Apparently, Miyamoto is not

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
happy, because the EAD

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
general manager overshadows the

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
content that's created by new producers

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
and directors at Nintendo's largest gaming division.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
New Super Mario

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Bros. producer Takashi

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Tezuka is rumored to take his place.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Other changes,

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
boy, where

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I said there's smoke, there's fire.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Where there's wank, there's a lot of wank.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
A major

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
shift in Kyoto development sources

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
involving three research and development

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
buildings.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
New groups and new producers being

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
announced for EAD Kyoto and

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
SPD Kyoto. A Tokyo

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
expansion of EAD and

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Mashihiro Sakurai possibly

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
joining EAD Tokyo.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
New division led by

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Miyamoto with younger staff

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
focused on smaller scale games.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Miyamoto's

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
departure inspiring new IPs

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
for the EAD Kyoto division.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And Cliffy B

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
going to EAD Tokyo.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I added the last one myself.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I added that one myself.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Come on.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I had to throw my own wank on there too.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Why not? Everybody else is.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Maybe that's a list list.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Nintendo

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
wank. Best Nintendo wank.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Come on. Let's make up a Nintendo rumor.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Come on. Come on, Alan. Make up a Nintendo rumor.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Total legit source. Come on.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Wii U

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
will use points

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
like XBLA

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and have DRM.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Yes, it probably will because

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
there's this thing called Wii points that already

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
exist. I know you've never played a Wii.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Come on, Loki.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Add your own Nintendo wank. It's fun.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Nintendo wank. Let's see.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
don't know. This is tough.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
It's tough to come up with something stupid.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
People pull this shit out of their ass all day

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
long. I know, but I have to be

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
selective when I pull out of my ass to make it

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
that pull stuff out of their asses.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
That's the thing. That's why I was giving it some thought there.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
So, Loki, the man who works

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
next? What are you posting to me after tomorrow?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
system to create an artificial demand.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
That's not a rumor.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Oh, no.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Did you hear what? No, this actually didn't make our show

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
but did you hear what their fucking excuse was? There was a

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
fire in a production plant, I guess, that lowered

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
their amount of units that they're going to put out by

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
a million or something. Isn't that the same excuse they used

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
for the gasoline prices going up?

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Goddamn, Wii U's were there. Why did we store them

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
next to the oil?

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
AlphaCananagram in chat wants

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
to remind me they did get rid of the points

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
because the Nintendo 3DS eShop

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
does use regular money for currency.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Yeah, they got rid of those cards.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Whatever. You know what they're going to do?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I have a Nintendo rumor. Okay, yes, thank you.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Their online integration is going to be really mediocre.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
These aren't rumors!

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
3DS Micro.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's small enough to fit in your pocket, man.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And to take inspiration from Apple,

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
they're going to make their next 3DS

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
super wide so they can have yet

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
another attachment for the stupid

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Have you seen the... was it the LL and the XL?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Have you seen the...

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I was like, okay, okay, we made it bigger.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
We could have put a thumb pad here, but no.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
We're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
and make it even wider than it was.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Is that really happening?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Yes, it's really happening.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Is it out yet?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
It's very soon. They have pictures of it.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And it's not Photoshop. It's like, this is an official thing

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
because, you know, you want the larger...

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I mean, seriously, it's just...

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Let me just add another, like,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
half of a laptop right here

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
and I'll put just a giant, like, analog...

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I should do that. You know, make a project.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
It'll look like that Tetris game

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
at Golf Land with the gigantic

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
joystick that you use to move the pieces.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Have you seen that? The Sega Tetris?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
It's like a, you know, home thing.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Could be fun.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It could be fun.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Alright.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Let's move on. Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Kickstarter.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I said legitimate.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It's going

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
live in the UK on

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Halloween. It's gonna be a part of the same

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
site. There is not going to be some,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
you know, Kickstarter-UK.com.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
It's just Kickstarter.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
But if you're within the UK, you can now,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
you know, put up your project.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Obviously, the

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
currency available is going to be

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
listed in pounds. Doesn't say anything

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
about euros here.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Yeah, you can set your goal and your stretch goals

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
and I imagine if you're in the US and you

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
want, you see something awesome over in the UK,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
you can bid on it like you can

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
in any other Kickstarter. But, yeah, they got the

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
payment and the

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
those sketchy, you know, legal financial

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
stuff sorted out. So, yay, UK, you're

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
getting Kickstarter. I'm sure they're all very excited.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
That's all. That's all I got.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
There you go.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I guess they got their legal

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
stuff worked out, but there was already, you

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
know, the other. So, whatever.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
or hating on it or whatever

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
side of the fence you choose to be on.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
As diverse as we are on this show.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Have fun with that, UK.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
It's a borderland, so a lot of copies.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
How many copies? Oh, shit.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
1.4 million copies. That's a lot of copies.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
That's a success. 60 bucks

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
a pop. That's a lot of money.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Exactly. And, of course, you know, also

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
that, um, I believe it sold

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I can't remember what percent more than

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
234% more than the first game.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
So, at launch,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
that's pretty awesome. Not

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
so awesome, NBA Baller

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Beats, which sold 3,000 copies.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Total. Wait a minute. You mean

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
there wasn't a market for basketball

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
and music fusion games?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Basketball, yeah, exactly.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
game that requires you to have a floor

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
that's, you know, that you're not in an apartment

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
and that the floor is, like, hardwood

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
or something. Here's the ironic

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
twist. Now it's a collector's item

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
when it sells that few copies.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
No, it's not.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
That's like saying

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
that the eye of judgment is a collector's item.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
It's not. It kinda is, in a way.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
The, uh, Borderlands, that

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
is only hard copies

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
of the game. I think this is saying, uh,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
digital distribution is not in that figure at

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
all, so that's even more awesome for them.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Yeah, that's awesome. Unfortunately, the digital version

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist, so

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I can't use that to inflate

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
the numbers there. Bobby Lackwolf in our chat room

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
at live.vognetwork.com wants to

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Twitter followers. Remember that whole thing?

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So how did they only sell 3,000

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
followers? It was... Do you mean to tell me

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
they had fake Twitter followers? It wasn't

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
50,000. It was 500,000

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Twitter followers.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Yeah, it was 500,000 because I think they

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
have 100,000 for, like, Call of Duty

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Black Ops 2 or something

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
like that. Yes, they bought their

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Twitter followers. Wait, wait,

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
wait, wait, wait.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
You mean to tell me

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
that they bought

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
all those Twitter followers?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Yes, they did. There was an article

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
on the Penny Arcade... 449,631

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
followers

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
and they sold 3,000 copies of the game?

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yeah, because all those guys

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
are really legit.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And you know what's great is even

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
after all that they're like, we didn't

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
buy those followers.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
You know, people are really excited about

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
this game, okay? Really?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
You know what game sold

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
better than NBA Baller Beats?

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
President Cat.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
The Eye of Judgment.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
The Eye of Judgment.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Sold better than NBA

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Baller Beats. Oh, I feel like this

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
is a game on, like, the $25,000

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
pyramid or something.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Family Feud or something.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Name a game that sold more copies

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
than NBA Baller Beats.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Ready? Go.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Barbie Horse

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Adventures 2.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Probably not yet, but we will hit that

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
mark. Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
better than NBA Baller

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Beats.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Baller Beats. Oh, I'm sure it already has, yeah.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Let's see.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
The game with the pink anus on

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Steam has probably sold more than 3,000 copies.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I'm trying to think, what

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
was the worst game I can think of that's

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
a paid game? Worst

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
game ever.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Night Trap sold

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
more than NBA Baller Beats.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I was going to say

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Baller Beats. Master Chu and the

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Hell, even

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Steel Battalion, that last one

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
that came out, sold more

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
than that. And it was fucking

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
broken.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Beatmania sold more copies than

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
NBA Baller Beats.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Burn!

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Pop and Music on

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Xbox Live Arcade or what was it called?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Beat and Groovy sold more copies

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
than NBA Baller Beats.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Do you remember that song

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
that was really obnoxious and horrible

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
last summer, the

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Louie Louie Gucci Gucci Fini Fini Prada

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Basic Bitches Wear That Shit So I Don't Even

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Bother. Her album came out. It's the worst

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
album sale that sold

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
like, it's not quite a record

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
but it sold 3,900 copies

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
in its first week. That's more than this game.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Creation.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
What's the single called?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Gucci Gucci. Gucci

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Gucci. Hold on, I want to look this up.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
It was just the single.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Please don't play it. Do you really hate your listeners

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
that much? No, it was just

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
a single last year but she actually

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
put out a full album

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
with that song and no one gave a fuck

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
but more people gave a fuck.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Okay, so more people

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
gave a fuck about this song.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
No, that's not it.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Oh, this one.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Okay, more people bought

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
this CD than

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
bought Baller Beats.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Wait, what's the chorus?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
This is so awful.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
This is really badass. This is too long. Where's the chorus?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I can't make it to the chorus.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
You probably picked the worst part of the song, Dev.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Whatever.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
So there you go, the worst part of the worst

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
song. Worst part of the worst

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
song and that, and yeah, and Dartusuya

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Let's see, Act Dev says more people bought

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
ET on the 2,600 than NBA Baller

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Beats. Jessica Harper said

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Britney's dance beat probably sold more

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
copies than NBA Baller Beats.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Oh, Rama. Oh.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Burn. This, oh.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Ouch.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Rock Revolution sold

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
That's a fact.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Oh, ouch. Oh, you

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
win. You win an internet.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
This story's over.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Marissa. I love Marissa.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I really do and she's in our chat room

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
and she just said, this bitch

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
just rapped about Adderall.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
By the way, does this still work?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I just want to point this out. I want Marissa to know

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
the show. Okay, you know how Google, Google

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
has the predictive search feature, right?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Okay, I want to show you something. Go to Google

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
and type orange

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
lounge

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
radio

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
and oh, of course,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
the one time I do it, oh, you know why? Because I'm not doing

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
global research.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
But I swear to God, I did this the other day.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I typed in orange lounge radio

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
and in the predictive search, the

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
number two thing that came up said orange lounge

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
radio Marissa.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Not orange lounge radio

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
chat room, orange lounge radio

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Loki. It was orange lounge

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
radio Marissa. Swear to God, I was looking

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
in a good way because I love Marissa. But it's just

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
funny that, well, how long ago was it she was

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
on this show?

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Alright, anyhow,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
let's move on.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
An appropriate story

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
to follow that last story is

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
about a game design

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
jam called Fuck This Jam.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
It will, uh,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I have no, who is putting

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
this on? It's on a website. It's called

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
FuckThisJam.com. Well, that's appropriate.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Oh, okay, here it is. It's

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
organized by Rami Ismail

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
of Vlambeer

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
and independent designer Fernando Romalo.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Uh, Fuck This Jam

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
apparently was basically

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
an inside joke. It came out of a conversation

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
that they had when they went to an arcade

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
in Austin, Texas. It will take

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
place from November 9th through the 17th.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Well, why

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
would you care about this besides the cute name?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Well, because

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
the participants in this little

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
contest or whatever, they

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
will be tasked with creating a game

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
in a genre or style

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
that you would ordinarily have

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
disdained for. So, in

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
you know what? I hate sports games.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
You know, I don't want to play sports. I never play sports

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
games. Then your job in the jam

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
would be to design a sports game.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
You gotta design a first-person shooter. I hate

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
retro games. I hate role-playing.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
So, I actually

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
think this is a really neat idea to

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
encourage people to get out of their comfort zones

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
because this is where some of the best ideas come from.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And you know it's gonna lend itself

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
to crossover

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
potential. I bet something out of this ends

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
up on Project Greenlight or something. Just you wait.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Just you wait.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Good luck to everybody that's participating

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
in that. Fuck this jam.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Alright, well let's go to the mailbag.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Every week you guys send us emails

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
and we

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
live on air. Dark Soccer

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
is not here to read them tonight.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
here to read the emails. It probably helped that

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
there was only one. Yes.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Now there's one

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
email and I

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
really empathize with this

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
person who was kind enough to write it in

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
because when I write stuff I'm often

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
very verbose and go on about something

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I care a lot about. It's a Windows 8

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
rant email and this person

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
did say how long it is.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
And it is long enough that we're not gonna read the whole

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
thing on the show. It's not personal.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
So it is

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
from

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
13X

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Forever. And he writes

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
a Windows 8 email and he says,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
have an empty mailbox problem so I finally took

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
my time to write about that Windows 8 hate

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
show two weeks ago. First off, I

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
love that our show is now a relay

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
to Bobby as well as just like

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
blast us with an email

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
and hope Bobby gets some splash damage

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
from it all.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It's an AOE attack. Exactly.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you have an

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
empty mailbox problem so I finally took my time

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
to write about that Windows 8 hate show

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
two weeks ago. Yeah, this mail will

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
be long so maybe you should skip it

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
for the show. Sorry. Also, I have to apologize in advance

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
if I trail off topic or go

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
on rumble for too long.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
And then, first

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
of all, I highly recommend to

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
with a link. Interface changes

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
and Rafael Rivera's

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
post on the

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Minecraft certification debacle and

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
optionally his own rant

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
or the person who wrote this in

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
on Google Plus on this topic.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
And then it goes on and

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
unfortunately we can't read all of it but

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
he did include, thank you

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
writer, a TLDR

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
summary.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Smart idea when you send in a long

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
email. Include the too long, didn't read

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
portion. So

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
TLDR summary. You should really try it

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
for yourself before judging. Sometimes to

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
build something new you have to break something old and

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
people will hate you for it. All

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
from a few articles published by ignorant writers

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
to get more clicks for their websites.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Desktop experience is the same as for

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Windows 7, only much more polished. Plus

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
you have Metro which is mostly

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
optional. Notch is

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
fighting some illusory

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
threats of software freedom on

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
commercial OS 2 in most unconventional

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
ways. Yes, Windows 8 will sell

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
worse than Windows 7 and everyone will

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
point and laugh. You're probably biased

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Russian neighbor 13x

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
forever. So I'm wondering maybe

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
if I'm on the vlog article

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
for when the podcast, this episode goes up

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
maybe we can include that email. Perhaps.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
On the forums. On the forums. Yeah, I would say

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
make a long post on the forums. But I

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
will tell you this. I did read the email in its entirety

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
off air. And it was, you know, the

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
TLDR does sum it up pretty good because even

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
though it was through kind of some fanboy

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
filter, I did sense a little bit

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
of that in there. There was

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
a good point that was raised that is essentially

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
don't knock it until you've tried it.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
You know, many people are sitting here bashing

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Windows 8 just because

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
they've seen some screenshots and

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
they don't like the fact that there's something

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
different. That they're presenting the start menu

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
and it's different. And the kind of,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
the message I took from it was essentially

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
change is gonna happen.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Change is inevitable. Change has

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
to start from somewhere. If you like

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
the start menu, didn't the start menu

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
start somewhere, right? So

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
why is everybody hating on this

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
when many of them haven't tried it?

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Granted, some have. But many haven't

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
and they're just looking at these screenshots going

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
oh, I hate this. I hate this because it

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
looks like an Xbox. And I

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
say this being guilty

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
of being someone who usually

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
crawls up Valve's ass at every

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
opportunity. But it wasn't Gabe Newell

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
but someone, there's the whole debacle with Notch

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
bitching about it. But someone at

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Valve, not Gabe Newell

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
basically said we've messed around

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
with the Windows 8 kit and

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
he was like, personally he didn't want to design

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
So whenever someone from Valve says something

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
everyone like

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Valve says Windows 8 is garbage

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
and then it just echoes through the whole

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
internet which is not really

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
what they said. Right.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
The whole game of telephone happens. Yeah.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So, interesting. Now I will say

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
there was also a portion of the email that really

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
addressed the whole Windows certification thing

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and the fact that I think people are reading

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
too much into it and it's not that Microsoft

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
wants a cut. That was a huge part of what

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
the Valve complaint was too.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
But it's not that, just to be clear, it's not

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
that Microsoft wants a cut of it. It's

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
that Microsoft wants to certify it

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
and I'm assuming it's similar to

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
how they might certify

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
like I know because I've done

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
some of this development at work, like

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
it's harder to run macros

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
and even like access in Word if

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
you don't like certify your

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
content because of the

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
illegitimate stuff that's out there. So like

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
imagine expanding that bubble to include

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
software. That's kind of where it's going.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
official seal of equality where they had to play

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough?

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
They don't do that anymore because

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
of course the Wii is the biggest shovelware

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
console in like 10 years.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Well and also people got around

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
the Nintendo seal of equality. Like it worked for

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
a while but then when it was

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
because Atari

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
and Tengen as it was won that lawsuit

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
where they tried to stop that

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
from happening. They were able to keep

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Tetris off the shelves because that was

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
a particular circumstance but they

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
specifically or if it was one of the other companies like

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Color Dreams or you know

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
one of them back in the day but Nintendo tried to stop it.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
They lost so there was nothing they could do about it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
So I think at that point they kind of gave up.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
But yeah Nintendo,

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Nintendo put those locks into place because they were

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
trying to prevent another video game crash.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
The other big big big thing they did on the NES

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
remember this. Yeah because a lot of the games on the 2600

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
weren't even designed on proper

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
development kits. They were trash. Yeah.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Well publishers could only put out three games a year.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
If you paid for these development kits

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
or whatever you could only put out three games a year.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
So that's why, well you had these publishers

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
start to put out, just invent

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
subsidiaries to get around it. That's where

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Ultra Games came from. Ultra Games was

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
just Konami. That's all it was.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
It was just Konami and it existed solely

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
to put out you know

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
more Konami games on the NES

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
like Metal Gear

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
or Ultra Games. Yeah.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
But it was Konami. So anyway

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
that was a

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
total tangent that that emailer was not

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
expecting at all whatsoever but there you go.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
So at the end of the day let's go back

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
take a step back. What about

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
the course part

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
of the argument I think what I

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
took away from it was

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
don't knock it until you've tried it.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Alan is it fair?

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
That's fair. You haven't tried it so should you

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
be knocking it? Yeah.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Windows, well it's, I made a joke once

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
that Windows OS's are like the

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Star Trek movies, the original ones that every other one

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Because

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
XP Professional I ran

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
for years because it was rock solid.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
When Vista came out

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
they tried to drag

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
gamers over to Vista by saying if you want

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
DirectX 10 you have to use

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Vista. I'm like DirectX

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
fine it's 9 for me I'll stay on

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
XP. And now 7 is so

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
fucking good I can't imagine why I'd want to leave

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
7. 7's great.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And the bummer

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
is like it's not like you can just like try

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
8 out and then go back. Oh yeah it's a total

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I don't

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
think you can. No I don't think you can

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
down rev Windows. So

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
it's either all in or out.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Alright well thank you very much for the

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
email even if it was a little long.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Hopefully we covered the points

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
to your satisfaction and we you know

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
either way we still appreciate the

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
other perspective. It is the show

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
where every gamer has a voice. We

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
get to disagree sometimes.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Alright let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Uh

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Loki why don't you start us off tonight

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
with your FU. Uh an FU to

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
uh e-machine shop

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
for their fur I'm not working

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
nicely with uh Google Sketch

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
unfortunately. The wonderful

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
painstaking process of creating

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
the part of the

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
beat gear pad or whatever

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
um it came out nice

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
so they can't import it at all.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
So and I tried recreating it

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
in their stupid cat editor

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
and it sucks.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
So fuck that.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Um

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
you know despite all the stress I went

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
through in the past week I had a pretty good weekend

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
so I can't complain too much although I will

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
say FU to my voice.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And FU to the fact that I'm getting

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
old. That part kind of sucks

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
and uh yeah I did I didn't just

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
do rock the something keep in mind I didn't

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
just do Rocky on Friday.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I actually helped out with another performance

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
piece that um some of the gals

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
on cast asked me to do.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Uh just play a really quick walk on roll

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
in and I did it so I had to do that last night.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
But it's part of that performance I'm

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
supposed to die on stage which means I have to take

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
a stage fall. Yeah

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
totally bruised my knee during doing that

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
yesterday. So that part sucks.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
So FU to getting old where my

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
bones are old and frail and I can't

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
take falls like I used to be able to.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Wah.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Alan you're FUs of the week.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Um things are going pretty well for me. I got

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
a second day off this week. Um which I

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
wasn't expecting. So the

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
apartments all clean.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Uh I hate

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I get paid

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Friday. And you know sometimes when you're like

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
really really really broke waiting for that payday

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
to come up. I'm kind of like that now.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Sometimes you can avoid it

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
sometimes you can't.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Alright. There it is

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
the FUs of the week.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Two more stories and then Twitter topics

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
and the Skype line. So

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Loki. Alright.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
So there's going to be some price discounts

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
pretty soon for the Xbox 360.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Coming in the form of their holiday

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
bundles. They're actually going to have two bundles

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
out that um actually look pretty cool.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
There's one that's going to be

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
the Connect 4 gig

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
um well actually I guess the Connect 4 gig

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
um bundle.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And they have a 250 gigabyte

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
just regular bundle. Um

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
for 250 you can get a

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
uh holiday bundle which is the

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
250 gigabyte Connect. And

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
those are usually 350 bucks.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
And I guess the bundles have

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
different games packed in.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
They've got DLC codes for everything from

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Forza 4

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
um Connect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Halo Reach. And

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
also um they're going to have

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I guess codes for a digital copy of

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Skyrim. I actually saw that in one of them.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Um

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
let's see here. So

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
yeah you can get a 4 gig console for

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
250 or just a regular

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
um

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
system without a

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Connect bundle in there. Um

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
for 250 and that comes with

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Forza and Skyrim as a digital

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
copy. And then also they have

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
a 4 gig Connect

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
um bundle that's going to

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
have um

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
what was in there? Connect Adventures

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
and Connect Disneyland Adventures.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Well that's kind of stupid. Why would you

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
buy

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
the old one?

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I don't know. For whatever reason I guess

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
seem very smart to have the old bundle

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
with less stuff in it for the same

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
for you know more than what it is

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
with more stuff in it. But

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
apparently they still have it at the same price.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So you can get the holiday bundle

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
without

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Connect Disneyland Adventures. I guess if

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
you really hate Disney and you just

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
um

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
you can do that. So those are three bundles

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
that are available. Um

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I guess now. So you can check that out.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And then um

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
some older holiday bundles too. They've got

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
one with Halo Reach and

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Fable 3. That was the old one.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
But I guess that's not available anymore.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Cool.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
No surprise there. Price drops in time

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
for the holidays. And for Wii U.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Maybe that it's yeah true competition

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
there and maybe to you know just encourage a few more

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
copies to move after Thanksgiving. Honestly though

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I mean if you don't give a shit about

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Connect which honestly

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
nowadays you probably shouldn't

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
give a shit about Connect Lisa's console

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
generation. The one with

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I mean those are pretty awesome games.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Good tip.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Alright one more story

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
for you guys and this is about what could have

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
been uh Blizzard

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
had once planned a version of Diablo

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
for the Game Boy Color.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Can you even imagine that?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Ew. Right?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Like Starcraft on N64

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
you remember that? Now this

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
was uh in a statement from

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
well I shouldn't say a statement but it was more of an

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
interview of Blizzard biographer

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
David Craddock uh in

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
speaking with Shaq News.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
It was called Diablo Junior.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
It was intended as a single

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
player only prequel to the original

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
game. Taking a page from

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Pokemon's book the team wanted to

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
release three cartridges

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
each packing a different hero in the

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
warrior rogue sorcerer vein

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
as well as items that players

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
would have to trade for in order to

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
collect.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Development was only with a

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
handful of staff. They started

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
working on Diablo Junior after the

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
release of Diablo 2.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
It could have been the Game Boy Color or the

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Game Boy Advance or both

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I guess just due to the timing of all of

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
this. Um

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
pasture because of the steep production costs

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
associated with developing handheld

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
games. Uh

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I guess there is a book coming out

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
or a project called Stay Awhile

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
and Listen. It's an unauthorized

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
history of Blizzard based

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
on the testimony of 80X

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
employees. This

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
gonna be good.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Wow I didn't know somebody was working on

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
something like that. That sounds like it's gonna be amazing.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Uh apparently there

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
was also another Diablo 2 expansion

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
that never saw the light of day.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Uh there was um uh

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
it was gonna have guild halls for multiplayer

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
clan meetings and two other character

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
classes that also came out of that.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Weren't there also a bunch of

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
around the time Warcraft 2

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
between Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 there was gonna be a bunch of

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
orc based side story

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
games? I remember seeing

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
clips of that yeah. And the animation was

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
very, they kinda look like the Zelda CD

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Phillips CDI games. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Same style.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
They did they did. I wanna know what

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
happened to Starcraft Ghost. I hope we

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
get the low down on that. Yeah.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Ooh.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I like this. The uh unauthorized

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
look. Or they're really awesome franchises

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
from the 90's they haven't touched.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Like Lost Vikings.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Or Blackthorn. Or Rock and Roll

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Racing.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Didn't they also do the shake, rattle, and

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
roll? Was that Blizzard? I don't know.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
They got more franchise.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Snake, rattle, and roll. Who did that?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Is there

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
is more out there than wow

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
and Diablo

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Blizzard.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Or they could come up with something new. I know

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
that's a uh

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
whatever. Whatever Titan is.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Whatever Titan is supposed to be completely unique

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
IP. Oh I'm an idiot. Snake, rattle, and roll

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
was just straight up rare.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Why did I think that was Blizzard?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Am I really that

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
dumb? I guess

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
so.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Whatever. Shut up.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Alright let's go to the

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Skype line at

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
1877 game OLR

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
where our username on Skype is

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
open right now.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And while we're waiting for

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
some calls to come in we will do some

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
tweets. Tigerclaw

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
sent in a few tweets tonight. See

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
we've got more stories coming in thanks to

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Twitter so I appreciate that. Tigerclaw

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
on Twitter with a story EA apparently

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
accidentally gave away thousands of

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
free games. Yeah.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
How the hell did this happen?

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
They had a code that was

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
I think it was for reviewers or something like that

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
for Origin where it gave people

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
$20 off. Yeah it said it was a thanks

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
for completing a survey and it allowed them to

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
download a free game from Origin

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
but the code could be used by

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
anybody. It was an unlimited use

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
code. That's the

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
problem. I'm reading it here on the story. This code

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
is not secured. Someone made EA lose money

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
they're gonna have to commit seppuku in a conference

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
room. Oh my gosh. Alright.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Apparently it ended up on Reddit.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Alright let's go to the phones. We got somebody

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
waiting. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
It's Shane. Hey Shane. How you doing?

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I'm good. How about you guys?

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I'm good. What's on your mind?

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
So I want to talk about

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
a little game called Mass Effect.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I have never heard of this game.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Why don't you tell us about it?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Okay anyway before

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
the new multiplayer

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
stuff came out and the mega DLC

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
stuff got announced

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Mike, I think it's Gamble

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
posted something about how the upcoming

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
DLC is kind of like

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
the shape of things to come

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
and I'm wondering

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
if this DLC

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
is kind of

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
pointing at a more

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
massive multiplayer

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Mass Effect game.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Because now with the introduction of the

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Volus class. Here we go.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Mass Effect MMO. Hold on.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I'm justifying it.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Alright. With the Volus

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
class apparently it's

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
pretty much just a support class

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
like I mean you can still

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
kill things and be really awesome

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
but it's primarily for

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
support so if you've got a support class

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
your vanguards can take

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
hits like really well

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
and everybody else can do you know shooty

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
things why not something in the

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
vein of like a PSO style game where

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
you have centralized hubs you can

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
still do like

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
massive story missions but

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
it's just all

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
like the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Okay. So

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
okay sorry. Run this by me

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
again. How is this going to impact the single player

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
side of it though with the expansion?

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
It doesn't. They were saying that

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
the stuff that's coming out

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
is kind of like the shape of things to come

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
for the series. So you're talking more

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
the DLC that came out this past week

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and not so much the Omega DLC?

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Correct. Oh okay. I don't know why but I was

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
saying when you started this whole thing I thought you meant the Omega DLC

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
and I'm like I don't see where that's going.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Okay but yeah I get it with the Volus

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
support class and all that. Allen?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Yeah I made a comment

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
to Rob earlier that

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
even if the Mass Effect

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
MMO never happens

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
pretty much

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
as limited of a model as

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
it is the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
might be the closest that we ever get simply

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
because if you have a favorite race

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
with the exception of the Elcor you can pretty much be

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
everything now.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
And who knows if the Elcor and the

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Hanar don't show up sometime

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
down the line. I could see

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
something happen. Also

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
a Volus. I have one

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
if you want to. We can do a match

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
together after the show if you want to see how they play.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Would be terrible

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
support for a Vanguard because

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I couldn't

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
stay close enough to you. They can't

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
hop over cover so they have to actually

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
run around the map. That's

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
kind of adorable in a

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
really weird way. So yeah if a Vanguard

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
biotic charges and fucks

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
off I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
and that's not going to work. And that's all I

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
do as my Vanguard. I just fly around.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
But you with my Sentinel

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
worked out alright actually. Yeah we did.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
We duoed what? Wave 4? Wave 5?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Yeah now my Sentinel was only level 4 so that was

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
pretty good. Yeah it was collectors too right?

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Yeah it was.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Which are super fun. They're bastards.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Commander

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Shepherd just joined our chat room and said

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Hi I'm Commander Shepherd and this is my favorite

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
If only.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
You jerk. Alright.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
It'll happen eventually. Is there anything

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
non, well actually

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
let me ask you this question because

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
whenever people bring up Mass Effect

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
podcasts in chat Black Wolf

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
likes to chime in and say there's not enough

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
content out there to substantiate a weekly

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
podcast. That's a lie now though.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
It's totally a lie. That's a

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
valid answer because

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
every like

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
there is fan fiction

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
there's fan works

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
like art, music, there are

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
books that have been out, comics

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
that have been out, multiplayer updates

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
that come out. Always speculation

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
going on for the next games.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
There's enough content there for

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
weekly episodes. For sure.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Well then you need to produce a pilot sir

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
and prove everybody wrong.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
But how

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Mass Effect and wow. Alright.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And watch Once Upon a Time in

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Walking Dead. You just gave me

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
an excellent opportunity to transition away

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
and I know that you are a

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
almost 30 year old

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
playing Pokemon

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
games. You even, one of the original

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
VoG articles is about your love of Pokemon

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
and how you know you're a little

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
old for it. So how

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
are the new games and why do you still love

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
this series? I'll never

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
not love this series. They're just really

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
fun RPGs and

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
the Pokemon for the most

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
part are adorable and who doesn't want to

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
collect adorable things?

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
That

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
game was really fun. I played it.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
They're good.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
They contract good programmers. They really are

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
good.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
No, there's just, I don't

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
know. It's just fun. In fact

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I'm going to see my

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
friends up near Kansas City this

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
weekend and we're going to have a Pokemon

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
tournament. I was just informed and I was like

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
oh heck yes and they're my age too

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
and they're all excited.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Alright. I love this comment

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
from Frisbee in the chat room talking

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
about Shane's Mass Effect podcast I'm

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
assuming. Frisbee says

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
there's fan fiction, fan art,

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
fan wank, fan

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
dango, etc.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
There are Skyrim podcasts that are

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
still going just because of all the mods

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
that you can talk about. Alright, alright,

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
alright. BlackWolf says

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
five weeks in a row.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Five weeks in a row. You got to have

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
a show that's got five episodes and then

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
What if I make five episodes

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
in one night and then spread them out over five

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
weeks? Some people do that.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
You don't say that's what

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
you're doing in advance, dummy.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
That was hypothetical. Why would I

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
cheat like that?

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Alright. As I write this down.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
What else

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
was I going to ask you because you brought up, oh yes,

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
with Pokemon I know you play in a lot of WoW.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
How's pet battles going for you?

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I have stopped pet battling because

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I'm trying to level things and get gear

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
but it's like

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
a terrible addiction

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
and I'm trying to cut myself off cold

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
turkey at the moment and I still think about it

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
every so often and when somebody posts that they

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
got a new pet I'm like I wonder how that

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
would be in battle but I'm

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
just not doing anything with it.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Before we let you go for the night

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
is there any message you want to give to Horde

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
tanks out there that might be listening?

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
That's what I was going to say anyway.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Glad you brought that up.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
So if you're a Horde tank

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
preferably a paladin or a warrior

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and you would like a

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
fun laid back raid group that

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
wants to do content

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
while it's current, please

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
please please

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
server transfer to Proudmoore

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
and get a hold of somebody in

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
the guild Malevolence

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
and we'll find you a home and we won't

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
make fun of you much, I promise.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Alright.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
That's it.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Anything else before I let you go?

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Probably not.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Oh, except I was very sad because

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Alan you talked about

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Kayden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
read yet and I don't know where to find it.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I think I can

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
dig it up.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
And now I don't have any

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
fix saved to a folder on my hard drive

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I just know what time my user wrote it.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I don't have any fix

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
but I definitely have fun awesome pictures

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I found that aren't porn.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
So I have to make that distinction before

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
it gets a little out of hand.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
As long as no genitalia

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
is showing it's not porn.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Oh, there isn't. No. There's none

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
whatsoever. I think that would be weird anyway

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
to have. Alright. I'm ending

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
this conversation before it gets awkward. Bye.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
I'll keep it awkward. Bye.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
1877

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
GameOLR. Our username on Skype is

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
I think there was another Twitter topic.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Do you have any last minute stories Loki

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
while I bring this one up? No.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I had the EA one but

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
somebody took it.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Somebody took it. Well we got another call coming in

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
so hooray for that. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
who's this? Hey hey it's Rama. Hey Rama

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
how you doing?

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Ow. My feet.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Ooh you're calling in to talk about New York

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Comic Con I bet. More or less

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I was actually calling in to kind of

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
agree with the whole pirating thing because

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
even in my fandom we have to deal

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
with it. We call the people

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
that bootleg the anime and so forth

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
we call them spoiled entitlement

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
bitches. Ooh.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And just because

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
they're spoiled and entitled? They

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
feel that because

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
it comes out in Japan they can download

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
the fan subs and watch all the episodes

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
and decide not to buy it

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
when it comes released here because they

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
feel that I already have it why should I

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
go out and buy it?

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Okay I can feel that

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
because I was about to say when you started your thought

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I was like uh oh cause I was kinda

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
like that for a while cause like

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
and I've admitted to this in the show in the past

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I have downloaded games that were

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
released in Japan only because

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
I feel if the game companies

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
aren't gonna bother I've also done it with games

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
that were only put out in Europe before they were

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
announced for the America because my thought

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
is if the game companies are not going to

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
put the effort into putting the game

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
out here I'm not gonna pay those

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
import fees and mod my systems

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
and all this stuff or whatever just to

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
uh play the game

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
you know so uh I

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
you know at least could cut the cost

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
out of it and play the game

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
anyway now to be fair

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
uh I did this with Dance Dance Revolution

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
games that came out of Japan but when they released

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I mean I'm guilty of doing that too

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
and when I released the or

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
when they released the American versions of

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
DDR I bought every single one of them

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
so did I so you know to be fair

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
so it's a little different than your scenario

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
because you're saying they watch it and

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
then when they release it in America the

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Americanized version or I mean I guess

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
not really the Americanized version but the

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
you know whatever they end up putting out here they

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
fuck off but also on the same token

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
they do it because they can

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
and let's say

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
the series just comes out in the

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
US and the DVDs are like

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
40 bucks for an entire box

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
set people will go and buy

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
that flight on a box set rip

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
the episodes and put them online

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
they'll even put the full disc

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
online and people will find them

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and download them because they can

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
well

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and we that's the same thing with games

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
right some pirates do it because they can

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
yeah and it's like I said if

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Halo 4 comes out at $19.99

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
it'll still be pirate because

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
they want to save that $20 and

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
that same person that doesn't

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
want to drop $19.99 on a game

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
will go buy a spindle of blanks

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
to spread to make copies

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
to give to the French

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
what's this comment you just made in chat Alan

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
that's somewhat on topic with all this

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
oh I was just saying

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
back in the early late late 90s

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
early 2000s I used to order fan subs

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
from anime all the time

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I don't know if that's what he's talking about

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
specifically Sailor Moon

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
yeah partially

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
and it's become where the companies

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
will contact the fan servers and ask them

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
not to continue with this

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
a lot of them will be like sure no problem

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
some of them are like you know what

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
fuck you we're going to continue to fan sub

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
because we do a better job than you can

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
yeah well a lot of times when

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
a fan sub got a cease and desist

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
that was great news for the community

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
because the only reason why the company was doing that is because

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
we bought the rights to this

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
show it's coming out next year and then the community

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
would be happy because yay they were finally

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
getting it

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Alan to also go with that

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
same thing happened when Full Metal Alchemist came out

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
since Square Enix

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
pretty much helped put it out in Japan

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
when Funimation picked it up

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Square Enix told them you got to translate this

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
pretty much word for word

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
you can't mishap anything here or there

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
they're working on setting up the C&D

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
so all the fan sub are selling them oh they can't

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
do this, they're like sure

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
we'll lay off, we'll step back

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
some of those fan subbers will go behind

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
their backs and continue

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
fan subbing the series under a different title

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
and the C&D goes to them and so on

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
and so forth and so forth

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
well Rama

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I don't want to burn all the time talking about piracy

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
well no it's fine

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
and Critical Myth I think was there too

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I didn't see Critical Myth

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
but I did front it to the

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
one and only Travis Donovan

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
did you? was that the first time you met him?

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
yes, he freaked the fuck out

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
when I walked up to him with my big old

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
afro

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
hahahaha

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
amazing

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
so what did you do and see in New York Comic Con?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
what was there to do?

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
I mostly went for the cosplays

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
the exhibition hall was ginormous

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
there was a few indie games there

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
but big games that were there

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
was the Capcom booth showing off

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Darkstalkers Resurrection

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
and then there was the Halo 4 booth

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
and then further down there was Square Enix's

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
new

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Tomb Raider game

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
oh wow I didn't realize they were going to be there

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
that's cool

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
and unfortunately I wasn't able to check out any of these games

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
because Comic Con decided to give

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
just me, press, and the rest of my staffers

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
no press access at all

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
don't

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
and the lines were like 3 and 4 hours long

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
I couldn't even get up in there in time

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
to try out the Wii U

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
aww that sucks

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
sorry to hear it

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
it is what it is I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
well since I know you're all about the cosplay

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
which I know the listeners can hear more about

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
on Anime Jam Session

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Tuesday nights on VOG

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
what was some of the good cosplay you saw?

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
believe it or not

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
I see some pretty good

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
My Little Pony cosplays

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
oh god

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Comic Con is just comics, manga

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
pop culture

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
everything all together

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
that's what it's come down to

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I did see a couple of good

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Master Chief cosplayers running around

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
and the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
oh nice

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
yes

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
very cool

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Black Wolf in Chat says Rama's met two VOG people

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
for the first time in the span of a month

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
because you met Bobby last month huh?

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
yeah when I finally got to the hotel

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
and rested up

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
and chilled

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
as long as I'm still your favorite

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
oh you know that

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000
oh and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
is that always the case you know?

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
PAX East is coming up

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
you know one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I just realized

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
but we should probably address

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
well here's the thing we can talk about it

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
PAX East badges went on sale

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
and then we can mention

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
oh but they're already gone

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
don't get me started on that

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
why? didn't you get a ticket?

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
yeah my brother got me a ticket

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
and when I got home I got Jovi's ticket

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
that was the only way

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
but the people behind PAX

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
let people buy as many badges as they want

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
and then they went directly to eBay

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
that's why the three day ticket sold out in 24 hours

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
oh lame

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
that's pretty bad

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
I mean if you want to go

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I'm telling you

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
you're better off getting a Friday, Saturday, Sunday

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
because I don't know about you

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I don't think you want to go on eBay

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
and try to drop three bills

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
on a three day badge

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
yeah that's not good

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
it really couldn't have happened

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
on a worse week for me

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I didn't buy a badge

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I am crossing my fingers and toes

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
that our existence can justify at least one media pass

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
exactly

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
I will be more than happy

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
to interview developers

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
and have vog articles and coverage on the shows

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
and YouTubes and all that stuff

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
just hopefully that'll work out

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
because otherwise I ain't going

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
but this was just like

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I spent a disgusting amount of money

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
on Rocky Horror, just ask Allen

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
although it might be a little bit of a stressful point

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
but I spent a lot of money on that shit

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
so I didn't have money for badges

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Rob, I understand Rocky Horror

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
that's your fandom, that's your baby

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
that's your pride and joy

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
I can't say anything about that

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I would have done the same thing

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
I spent a lot of money on vog too

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
and these podcasts

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
every podcaster on this network

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
spent a lot of money on what they do

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
but we're not saying that in a

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
pity us

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
we are begging for money

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
we just say it in a

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
it's our hobby, it's our passion, it's what we do

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
we do it for what we love

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
go back to PAX East real quick

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
before I move along

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
they're not even putting the media passes

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
registration up until February

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
that is so weird

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I know

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
so weird, but alright

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
it is what it is, it ain't my con

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
it's a good con, when the con gets here

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
everybody that gets to go will have a good time

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
look, the main

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
the most important part is the fact that

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I secured two rooms

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
for everybody so we have a place

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
to stay, that was the most important thing

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
and we got hotel space from

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Thursday to Sunday

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
you're the bomb, if I'm able to get a media badge

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
I'm gonna be like, Rama

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
and in that case

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
when you come down, me and Jové

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
we'll head on over to the airport and pick you up

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
oh, you're the bestest

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
we try

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
alright, take care bro, thanks, bye

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
bye

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
see, Rama's got my back

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
cause I'm his favorite, we already established this

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
take that Bobby, just kidding

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Bobby's gonna be at PAX too

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
I know he's going, so

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
who knows, that's kinda cool

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
because since PAX Prime

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
is the same weekend as DragonCon

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
is less than PAX Prime

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I like the timing of PAX Prime

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
I like the timing of PAX Prime

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
a little more than PAX East

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
if I get to go

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
anyhow, I think that's gonna do it

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
I think that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
cause those are some long calls

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
but thank you guys so much

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
to those that called in

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
if for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
do send us an email

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
cause we're always short on emails

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
mailbag at orangelaundry.com

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
one more Twitter topic here I want to read about

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
and it has to do with Wing Commander

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
so it's worth mentioning

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan?

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I know I was

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
well get this, and this is another tweet from Tiger Claw

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
didn't we talk about those earlier?

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
did we?

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I forgot about it if we did

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
it was in chat, I don't think we talked about it on the show

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
I think it was on Bobby's show

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
at the end, but it wasn't on our show

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
anyhow

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
oh well, then I'm saying it twice, it's Wing Commander, deal

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
um

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
it's a Kickstarter

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
it's a crowdfunded game

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
but you know

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
it's already raised

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
$455,000

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
with the crowd funding, that's crazy

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
so

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
it's probably going to make at least a million

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
so you can look for the return of Wing Commander

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
even though it's not called Wing Commander

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
but it's from the same guy

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
and obviously it has a spaceship based name

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
so it's going to be the next evolution

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
of that series

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
hopefully it will turn out better than the movie

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
you know, I almost backed that Obsidian one

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
so I was like, fuck that

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
that is a long way away

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
not gonna wait

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
alright

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
that wraps up, if you have no other

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
I don't have any links or anything

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
but I have something quick

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
for those who are in my

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
age group who remember a show called

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Siffle and Ollie on MTV

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
yes!

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
they're back, and they're on the Machinima

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
channel reviewing fake

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
video games, and it's like they never left

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
I don't

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
because I think this happened a couple weeks ago

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
brought it up on the show or what

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
but yes, it is hilarious

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
because in the mid and late 90s, you know, MTV

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
did stop showing a lot of music

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
videos

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
for original content, but back in the mid and late

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
90s, that content was actually good

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
because there was

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
liquid television

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
and all this really weird indie shit

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
that kind of honestly paved the way for

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
a lot of the shows on Adult Swim

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
where you're like, do I need to be

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
smoking weed to be watching this shit?

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
what the hell is this?

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Siffle and Ollie was one of those shows

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
and yeah, they're back

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Liam, the guy who

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
invented them and wrote them and does the voices

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
was on the Nerdist podcast

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
and he was talking, Chris Hardwick

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
was like, I wish the Nerdist channel

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
had snagged him up

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Siffle and Ollie are on Machinima

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Nice. They're good for lulz

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Let's see, episode 1 has

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
92,000 views, not too bad

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Not too bad

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Alright, well thank you very much

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Thank you guys who tuned in and support

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio tonight, whether it be through the podcast

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
or on Stitcher

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
or wherever, and if you're

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
tuning in live, a big thank you

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
for sticking through all the upsies

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
and downsies of the stream, it looks like we've been okay

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
for the past hour, people stopped complaining

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
in part B, so I guess it was just for

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
30 minutes there or so, it was a little rough

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
but thank you guys for sticking with it, we really appreciate

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
you guys, you troopers

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
all we ask is help spread the word

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
about Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
or any other site, wherever you heard

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
of this show, there are plenty of other people

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
looking for something like

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
this, so word of mouth is great

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Let's

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
go around and get everybody's final thought

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Alan, as always, thank you for pinch hitting his host

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
tonight, especially on such short notice, really

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
appreciate it, glad we could have you on

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
even if you do live here, and you know

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
you usually get picked on anyway, but

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
you're always great to have on. Do you have a final

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
thought for listeners tonight? No

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Bye

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I'm tired, I'm on a nap, but you can't nap at 9 o'clock

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
that's called going to bed

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
and then you're like a senior citizen

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
You wanna go to IHOP and get a senior citizen

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
special, one piece of bacon and a pancake?

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
I guess an under sedation person

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
after Rocky on Friday

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
was asking Jessica where

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
the big after party was, like

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Denny's, you know, we're gonna get coffee and chicken strips

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
and it's like, remember when we were all 23?

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
That's not happening

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Actually, actually

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
you know what's funny, I got invited

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
to go to Mel's by one of the cast members

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
and I was like, I'm sorry

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I gotta go home

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
It felt bad

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Our whole lives are ahead of us

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Let's be until 4

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Oh, you kids

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Alright, let's see

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I don't know

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Hopefully play some Borderlands 2

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
this week

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
My final thought is, hopefully

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I'll play something besides WoW and Mass Effect

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
this week, not that those are bad games

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Also, my other

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
final thought is, it is nice to finally

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
be honored with the Golden Lotus

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Damn you dailies

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Alright

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
We really appreciate you guys

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Let's all hope Jamie feels better and she'll be back next week

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
That would be fantastic
