Tonight, September 30th, 2012, EA cancels a major sports title, DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros.
2, and can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?
DarkSakura
Hi.
How are you doing, Jamie?
I'm caffeinated, thank you.
Yeah?
You had two cups of coffee.
Yes.
Coffee!
I've made a new rule, by the way.
The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.
What's your thing against sports ball?
Some people like sports ball.
Boring!
We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.
Boring!
I like rugby and I like real football.
There was a comment that Actdeft made this week.
I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG Network post, but he said, yes, I am a hater and I am hating.
And that's you right now.
I agree with that.
I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.
All right.
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
How you doing, Loki?
Doing good.
Awesome.
What's new with you?
Minecraft.
Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?
Yeah, and I played no Minecraft.
I played Borderlands 2.
Okay.
Which is, sadly, the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
My wife's been occupying TV, so I've been occupying Minecraft.
Well, not a problem.
It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.
Yeah.
There's actually people on now.
I see people when I go on there.
Nice, nice.
And I hear they've been defacing my house.
My little... Or my shack, should I say.
We haven't been defacing it.
We've been...
Applying temporary tenants.
Interesting.
Would you fill my house with creepers?
No.
That would be destructive.
All right.
Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.
So, yeah.
What else do I want to say?
Oh, this poster came, right?
Yeah.
This was from that guy who called in last week, right?
Yeah.
I think it was.
Can I see it?
Can I open this?
Yeah, go ahead.
No, Rob, you're physically incapable.
Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.
It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.
It's stuck in there.
Hold on.
Open the other side.
That's still awesome.
I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.
Okay.
Okay.
I call it Disco Panda.
And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.
And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mists of Pandaria.
So it was Disco Pandas.
That poster's rad, by the way.
Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
I guess.
Our little picture feed.
What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
I can do that in a minute when we get into Gaming Weeks, so just give me a little bit of time.
Let's see.
Before we get into Gaming Weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic, as we usually do.
A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral and it wasn't really intentional for that to happen but apparently a lot of media companies for whatever reason aren't really covering this because it has to do with the indie community and I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community but this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.
Now remember when XNA Games first came out I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA and
and there's been some good and there's been some not good.
In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.
Obviously, we're a little partial to YYR and some of his efforts like bungee ferret tossing and so forth.
I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.
I made a game with zombies in it.
Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.
The Breath of Death and all that started on XMA, right?
Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was pretty good.
There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.
Right, and then there's the bad.
There's the controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Here's the deal.
Here's what's going on.
There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com.
Very well done from Bobby.
He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.
So he spent some time shedding a little light on it for people.
And it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.
Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.
They used to be able to generate 50 review codes and it's broken.
No press release saying they took it away.
Maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.
I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Bungie, Ferret tossing, what's this?
You know, and then they check it out and that's how YYR can make sales on his game but now a lot of that is stifled because Microsoft has this bug on the site.
It's not just affecting him.
These big indie games
or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing, which is the indie answer to Microsoft's Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree or whatever the hell they call those things, which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.
Remember when Microsoft said, oh, yeah, we're going to promote XNA games?
Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chatroom, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be Says, not just for review, but for giveaways Ever wonder why VOG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferret Tossing?
Perfect example, we can't give it to you for free Although, seriously guys, it's one fucking dollar And it is a really fun game, so You probably have the points left over in your wallet
But yeah, and SH100Matt says You would think they want to get this fixed It's promoting games that they profit off of And that's the weird thing It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this But, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games Or selling it Well then do something about it Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games Oh, is there too much crap indie games That's bogging down the system So people don't want to go find the stellar indie games Fix it!
This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console.
I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.
It would be a little sad if that was the case.
Or maybe it's... I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and of course they don't want people developing apps for it.
Probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow.
Wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?
Indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam.
One more sales there.
It's just a bummer that it had such potential.
It had such potential to be so awesome, to let people kind of control what was going on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side, and it's just kind of gone.
So, Breakman in our chat says, there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games.
There are.
It's...
What's what went wrong with this?
Why is this not doing better?
Loki, any thoughts?
Because they haven't done anything with it.
They haven't really they haven't promoted it.
They hit it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.
So it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out.
They did.
SJ100 Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.
Well, but like YYR, he's been doing bungee ferret tossing for two years.
And two years ago, XNA looked a lot better than maybe it does now.
So it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.
I've always thought though, and I could be wrong.
I am not a developer.
I've not made games.
I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff online.
from XNA on Xbox to PC.
Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?
I think so.
Because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that it's probably pretty easy to port it over.
I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC.
Like, for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the Gibb tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.
So the programming there is pretty much the same.
I used to love editing files.
I remember Civilization 1 on the PC.
A bunch of the scripting ran off text files.
There were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were within the boundaries, you could get the Queen of England to, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.
I'm going to declare war on your ass.
You could change things.
And to a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious.
Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.
Anyhow.
Going to more comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com because, of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.
there's articles there too there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life but there will be more very soon meanwhile Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort let's see WhatUpG says by that I mean the big budget games the ones that seem to get more press etc Microsoft is more about the AAA games is the comment that preceded that so maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games I don't know
DarkSakura
and PlayPandas.
I've made Rob over 10,000 gold selling gems in less than a week.
So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion.
It's been slow, slow, slow.
And I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level, which is fine.
I mean...
I do have other things going on.
But yeah, it was a lot of pandas.
It was pandemonium.
Yeah, that's it.
and Garrus.
I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit, which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly.
But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City and just hands out Justice stuff?
You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.
Okay.
That's stupid.
So it's going to take a little time.
Well, I mean, I can see why they did that because they said there's not enough to do at 90.
So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do.
There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.
I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90.
I've had too much going on in my personal life.
I can't sit there and just grind to 90.
I'm just 88.
I know, I know.
And Shane's already got a 90.
Yeah, most of my rating guild already has 90s.
Some of us have lives.
I don't like to say it that way because I know Shane has a life.
But you know what I mean?
But we have other stuff going on that isn't Oh My God Pandas.
Some of us have Mass Effect to play.
Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.
Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog.
I want a corgi bull.
You're silly.
All right, let's move on.
I'll talk about... And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.
I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my evening week.
But Loki, go ahead.
so I played Borderlands 2 last week well kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show so I've been playing that and leveling up you know my assassin and games pretty fun I'm digging it wish I could play it a little bit more I want to play a bit more this week take a little break from Minecraft since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week
of course we switched the server over to creative so it's been fun everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things I finished I haven't really finished my castle but I'm taking a break from it I think it's pretty much done I've got like all the grounds done I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens and I built a underground blacksmithing thing and
Farmer Loki had a farm E-I-E-I-O
Alright, My Gaming Week.
I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.
So, you know, when I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year.
I mean, that's at least the goal, is to do Disney Detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.
If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.
But anyway...
as far as video games I have been playing I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time I love the music I love the scenery I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast there's so much to do
I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.
In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit is I don't like that they made it not possible, really.
I mean, you can, but they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it, but they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that, so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore, which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it, but...
Horde House www.hordehouse.com
Another game that I checked out this week, though, for a little bit.
I only played this in between the time that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.
And that is Torchlight 2.
Torchlight 2 is released, and it is available on Steam.
And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam and probably other places, too, that I'm not thinking of.
I just own it on both places.
It's basically Diablo 2.
Torchlight 2 is out Torchlight 2 is out
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thumbs up.
And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet.
And you can also be in the same room and do internet that way.
There's the LAN is in there.
None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.
That is a great word.
Fuckery.
Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word, too.
That was total fuckery.
And this had very little fuckery.
Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day, but it didn't really ruin the experience.
It was a good time.
Actdeft says, Internet multiplayer?
Wow.
Well, the first game didn't have it.
So, there you go.
Uh, let's see, and Ray Deer in our chatroom says, I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now.
Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.
So, uh, yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.
So...
If you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.
It's going up and down a little bit, so I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off so that way we don't hiccup.
But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.
Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.
I closed Dropbox, right?
Sometimes big files come in through there.
Yeah, that's closed.
So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on.
Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.
Torchlight 2 and Pandaria.
And Disney games.
Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, DarkSakura?
Because in chat, Breakman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland.
In my country, we have a word for you.
Liar.
And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.
You know what, Rob?
What?
I have faith in you.
And if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.
I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.
Okay.
Oh boo hoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here Oh stop, alright Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio We'll get to the Fugle question of the week a little later But before we get to that, some news Loki starting us off with the gaming news this week
Alright, so this is a little shocking, not entirely shocking I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA and this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday?
Yeah, I think so, yeah, on the 27th.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.
They took a break last year and then this year they're going to try launching again with NBA Live 13.
Once again, they just canceled it before it even got a chance to get sent out and this was...
Literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website, their Executive Vice President Andrew Wilson just wrote, Hey, it's canceled and here's why.
Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.
So...
I don't know.
It's interesting, but I think at this point, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game, and from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying, hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.
Thank you for watching!
I don't even know if they were able to catch up with their market share.
I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally a new NBA game?
You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.
I did like it though because...
I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.
One of the first comments I read on the esports.com site was like, I'm going to kill your family.
I'm going to kill all the employees.
I'm going to burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA life.
Call the po-po on that.
Why do people feel like they can just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?
I'm about to go down a much bigger path.
on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get, or, well, there's Facebook too, but I hate the anonymity that the internet gives us sometimes.
Like, really?
You're gonna kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game?
Really?
Really?
Really?
Jeez.
Why don't we just set them all on fire?
How are you being any better by saying that?
Calm down, woman.
Hey, I said it very calmly.
Anyhow, I don't know.
I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.
They're just like, eh, not surprised.
And honestly, I'm not surprised either.
I kind of thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet.
And the game was scheduled for October.
Kind of thought that you would have a little something.
So, yeah, not a big shocker.
I don't know.
Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?
There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision, because if the game was gonna suck, or was just gonna be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then...
Good on them for making the right decision.
Because there's a story later about maybe a not so great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.
I found that comment finally.
It was funny.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
We stuck our neck out for you.
We've been fans of you guys for years, getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.
I swear, if there's no game that... Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.
There's no game that released this year.
I'm killing every employee and EA slash NBA live building dude.
I'm so heartbroken, literally.
I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.
I can't believe we're stuck playing...
with only one game after you guys had three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.
If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.
You need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid wrote that comment.
But I just think it's funny that people think that...
You don't have to play a new NBA game.
It's not like, oh shit, it's not like choosing a president or something like that.
A choice needs to be made.
It's just, you know you can play that same NBA game that you have.
Oh, well I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.
Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?
It's supposed to be fun.
Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.
I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.
We actually got a copy of that.
No, I didn't get a copy of it.
Why not?
Because my boss had one in his office.
Baller Beats!
And I laughed at it.
I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.
I'll play it.
No, we're not.
Alright, I guess this one.
Oh, I wanted to ask about the 2K game.
Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?
Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?
Jay-Z.
Well, I was just talking... I'm looking forward to that.
Well, hold on.
I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.
About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.
Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.
and you know say what you will about her music and so forth but I mean that woman is a well-oiled pop machine she's putting out so many albums she puts out an album a year and all these music videos wins all these Grammys has all these catchy songs written for her you know whether it might be your cup of tea or not you can't ignore that she writes some really or she doesn't write probably but she has some really good pop music that she puts out and
and yet again she's got like another new album coming out this year it's crazy like jay-z is working her and she's a extraordinarily famous woman hey if jay-z work your best hoe if shut up if jay-z can make 2k basketball like if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music i actually think it could be a really good he's not doing shit all he's doing is picking up the soundtrack
Ooh, fucking awesome.
I mean, whatever.
You know, that's cool.
I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.
I mean, that's it.
I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.
Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out and it was like, eh, not so exciting.
Why does the chat room think I said pot music?
I said pop music.
Pot music would be like... Foghat.
It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews band.
That's pot music.
Foghat.
and maybe a little bit Journey too.
I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once and damn, I think I got a contact high.
Anyway, back to games.
Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way because you know Motorola, although it is really Google, they...
They got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s among some other Microsoft devices.
This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.
It's actually owned by Motorola.
It's licensed for use in MS devices.
Now here's the interesting thing.
It's been ruled in the U.S.
that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.
Well, now, why would the U.S.
talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?
Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the U.S.
So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the U.S.
law.
And the court's ruling says, quote,
so if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here you're okay so like if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three year warranty you're okay, you can still get one phew well technically they wouldn't be selling it they would just be shipping a replacement
No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.
Because you know that's what happens to people now.
It used to be that they'd Red Ring after a week, and that's just part of growing up.
Well, they don't Red Ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of it.
Did you say that was just part of growing up?
Yes.
Because every Xbox... You take the good, you take the bad.
Yes, you take the good, you take the bad, and you take them both, and there you have a 360... A 360...
You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the Robot Chicken thing where they did... Never mind.
No, no.
Okay.
One chick's on Survivor.
Which one?
Tootie?
Blair.
Oh.
On Survivor.
They are really, really stretching for celebrities.
You and your reality shows, Rob.
I know.
What can I say?
I'm a whore for trash reality shows.
You have a problem.
I have a commercial for the next Xbox.
The 720?
The 720?
Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.
What?
Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.
What was her name?
I just remember she was Tootie.
I like this name in the chat room that I'm probably going to horribly mispronounce, but it's Entitle-itis.
Inflammation of the entitlement.
Entitle-itis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.
You never forget.
Did the red ring come after the blowjob?
No.
That would be a whole other problem.
That means you need to go see a doctor.
Yes, Kim Fields.
That was her.
Thank you, Ranma.
I knew Ranma would remember.
Alright.
Moving on.
DarkSakura.
So there was a big Horkin interview about the PlayStation 3 and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.
And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.
So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.
Not visual, the casual... Casual visual...
It rhymes.
Don't give me that look.
More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do with games things that are a little bit more reflective of that, and that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.
As far as how well the Vita's doing, they said they're not going to reduce the price this year.
That is probably going to be sometime next year, so it's not a matter of if it's when, but definitely not this year.
and this so really it's just more of what we knew I think it's just I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses that you don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fucking TV and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to you know
Have their friends see it.
I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week for like $199 or something.
Really?
I know, I was like, kind of want.
Were they teeny?
We saw, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.
I guess that didn't do too well, did it?
Yeah, who's going to buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price?
Sure.
Which it may have.
I should check back.
I don't think it's been down that.
Also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK, there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now and then a 12 gigabyte version that's going to be out on October 12th.
But that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.
It's the shops that are setting the price.

You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know, re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?
same damn tracks oh does that not fit into your plan of you know releasing one track with you know half a car and you have to buy the rest later so just throwing this out there it's still on sale on Best Buy site $179.99 for the TV, Motorstorm, Apocalypse and glasses and a little cable give it more time
You think you can get even lower.
Black Friday's right around the corner.
There you go.
Don't remind me.
I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.
Since I'm not working retail.
Yay.
All right, let's move on, Loki.
All right.
Well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV... No, actually, I'm not.
They were kind of cool, though.
I've got to play on those a few times.
So they have this new Xbox Live reward thing where they're allowing people with high gamer scores to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.
and it's a whopping, I know you're getting excited here, it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.
That's right, 2%.
Woo!
Woo!
I'm getting excited already.
And of course, also, apparently, if you have a gamer score of over 3,000, you get a special gift during your birthday month, which, in the fine print, says is only worth 25 cents.
Here's a quarter.
Call somebody who cares.
What about... It's probably going to be some stinking avatar item like a birthday cake.
It's stupid.
I mean, seriously.
1% back?
Okay.
So you buy $100 worth of fucking Microsoft Point stuff on the Xbox Live Marketplace and you get a dollar.
That is fucking stupid.
the 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom it's a fucking birthday hat I guarantee you it's a birthday hat that is it for your avatar so that everyone can go hey look he has a birthday hat on cool I want them to send me a quarter I want them to mail it to me
If it has a value you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.
So how is it that they can assign a value to that?
Because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter.
Well, I always thought it was akin to like... Have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?
Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.
They're always like one one-hundredth of a cent or one-tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.
Maybe that's the actual cash value of a 40-point item in the marketplace or something.
It would be 25 cents.
That's just stupid.
Cool.
Thank you for the money back, I guess.
But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.
I don't know who this Entitle-itis is, but I like the comments from this individual tonight.
So I have 7,000 points.
What do I get?
A coupon from Arby's?
No, no.
The idea is to get you to be loyal, not to scare you off.
A lifetime supply of horsey sauce.
Who's going to spend $100 on DLC in a month?
I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game that comes out and a whole bunch of DLC.
I mean, those people are going to have to be really sipping the Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.
That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.
because, you know, that's the new thing now is free-to-play mechanisms.
Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers.
You get some money back.
It's not so bad.
Hey, I got all this money stolen from me, but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back.
Sweet!
It's not so bad anymore.
And a birthday hat.
Yeah!
Maybe the hat's a fucking sign that says, Sucker, you spent all this money.
You're an idiot.
Oh, boy.
All right, let's move on and talk about something in the PlayStation camp.
The PlayStation 3.
You might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3 is going to be a PlayStation brick and it won't really be useful for anything anymore because, of course, the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.
But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.
All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.
Well, when did the system first come out?
2006?
This is about a nine year window.
So I guess that's not terrible.
That's not your fucking ten year life cycle that you promised me.
I want my money back.
Uh-oh.
DarkSakura, did you have a problem?
Your soap spat on my shirt.
It left white foam on my shirt.
It likes you a lot.
I guess so.
All right.
Anyhow, PlayStation 3, good until 2015.
That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.
2016.
That's what's targeted.
Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to reemphasize you're not just buying something that's going to suck in a couple years.
So, there you go.
We're going to continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely, and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long, but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.
Same thing with PlayStation 2.
It's kind of stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch, but there are still games launching for it.
Jon Kohler, GameSpot
One whole game.
One whole game.
One game that's going to be out in Japan.
Ooh, there will be one more game.
And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.
I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.
Adelino Macchio.
Yeah, the English version is something like something of Andolin or something is the English title.
Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name so I can't actually read it properly.
Scroll.
Well, no, it's not working.
Makyo.
Adolin no Makyo.
So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.
It's the one that has like Geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.
Huh!
Hey, Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.
I know.
I can see why people are still playing it.
But we have pandas.
But it's funny that... Pandas in the mist.
It's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.
I am so surprised it hasn't gone free-to-play yet.
Me too.
If it went free-to-play, I'd play it again.
Who wouldn't?
I know a few people who wouldn't.
You know what?
I told you what made me quit that game, right?
Being a white mage.
Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, damn it.
That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.
Fuck this, I'm teleporting hola.
Yeah.
So I was just like, I'm done.
See, after all these years, you still can make jokes like that.
That game had quite an impression.
It's just like, oh, you made a bad pull.
Eh, fuck you guys.
No heel, and I'm out.
I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.
Subligar Leather underwear Bite my ass please At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online
Port, port please, port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.
Port prompt please.
Hey, pretty impressive, though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?
And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013?
Although, let's be real, it's like there's been one game this year and one game next year.
It's on life support at this moment.
But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.
You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.
And I'm never gonna.
Hey, it's not that bad.
You know, I have it.
And I should sit down and play it.
You should.
It's a good time.
But I also have Pandas.
Balthier and Fran?
Pandas.
You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.
Pandas.
Fran's a bunny.
So?
Alright, let's move on.
Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.
Alright.
This week, actually, there's a few things coming out.
I know that there's
Resident Evil 6
Vita... No.
No Vita.
But PSP for some goddamn reason.
Go2k for supporting PSP still.
Because no one else is.
And PC.
And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.
Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.
And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.
I think that's what it's called.
Including a penis!
It said everything.
Nice!
I think it's lessons for everyone.
But yes, you can draw everything.
That's basically how I'm calling it.
Including a penis.
Including a penis.
And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.
Courier Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.
And what else we had here?
Let's see here.
Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.
17 Command & Conquer games in there.
Holy fuck.
That's a lot of Command & Conquer.
That's too much Command & Conquer.
Ours is over 17 years worth of Command & Conquer.
I can't read the cover there.
Nope, 17 games.
Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.
50 bucks and you get like all of the Command & Conquer games, all the Red Alert games, Generals.
Wow, that's pretty sweet.
Ranma says, 17 Command & Conquer games?
Shut up and take my money.
You'll never get through it all.
I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.
I think I played one game for two seconds.
I did that with the Doom pack.
XCOM is fucking great though also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty editions of Resident Evil NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil they have the archives and anthologies which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3 including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1 3, 4, it's like all these random ones in there
MXC1 to clarify in our chatroom 17 games but they're all digital even if you buy the box you just get codes that's stupid I hate it when they do that now thank you Origin thank you thank you for sucking fucking awesome that comment and more in our chatroom live.vognetwork.com oh and of course you know I should mention a week from today there's uh
Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.
Someone might be interested in that.
No one I know likes that game.
Okay, I have to digress for a moment.
Have you done any pet battles?
Yeah, they're pretty fun, actually.
I went and did that for like an hour.
But they will not let you, according to our guildie, Gwen, they will not let you name your Phoenix Hatchling, Fox.
Legion Legion
Oh my god.
Yeah.
So I named it Geth Legion.
Still.
For the record, Rob, I did actually prove you wrong from something on Horde House.
What?
I got Jane Shepard on Proudmoore.
Good for you.
Just saying.
Have a cookie.
Going back to Jamie, I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.
What'd they do?
This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy XII.
SJ100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.
No, Garrus isn't in it.
Actdeft says Tellard has Panda Corgi Garrus.
Ew!
That's just wrong, no.
Although, did you see the ferret effect?
Uh-uh.
Oh, yes I did!
That was awesome.
I was like, was that a listener of OLR?
I guess we can't take all the credit for it.
No, it was in our Mass Effect secret community.
uh fifth dream uh about the World of Warcraft expansion in our chat room says mist of pandyria is what my wife and I have been calling it that's pretty good I'm gonna use that on our house I'm gonna call it mist of pandemic mist of pandyria by the way do you know what name I got for my uh tauren monk I'm really excited you told me Calvain that's awesome I told Dan and he just rolled his eyes
You know what I got?
What?
I have Sunny Gummy I love that name From Gummy Bears And I have Shampoo But spelled X-I-A-N-P-U Ah
Oh hey, let's travel Japan and check out release dates over there.
Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012, both on the Xbox 360.
There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know, to try and like sell some Microsoft Xbox 360s, I guess.
I believe there are full consoles coming out too.
There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition, which
Oh no, this is the one with the jacket, isn't it?
Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?
$1,700 if you want to get this.
This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.
Remember that?
That's happening in Japan this week.
But not a full metal jacket.
No.
Sorry, I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.
They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.
Yeah, the jacket's pretty freaking rad.
Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.
It's cute.
Thank you.
I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.
Yes, we know.
Alright, going to the PlayStation 3.
It matches most of the same shit.
Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.
You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your PlayStation 3 with Biohazard symbols.
So your PlayStation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.
Won't that be awesome?
F1 2012 and... You alright over there?
No, they just made me laugh.
Because I had mental imagery then.
World Soccer Winning 11 2013.
Well, they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes.
And so because of that, they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.
I know.
Now you can't unsee that.
Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick blowing a giraffe.
You can't unsee that now that that's been said.
So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go.
You're welcome.
How about on the Nintendo 3DS?
Coming out this week, nothing.
But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.
I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.
There you go.
That's the Japanese release dates.
How about the UK, DarkSakura?
Oh, a few things.
On the first, which already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.
And then on the second, Resident Evil 6.
Oh my god, you are so correct.
Right?
Well, I've tried.
I've kind of been ignoring it.
Try the unseen, but you can't.
Because, did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?
What?
For the release of that?
Yeah.
They did like a fake human meat market.
Ew.
For Resident Evil 6.
Ew.
In East London.
It was all raccoon.
Ew!
No.
Haven't you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?
No.
No.
Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid I didn't watch it again for like two years.
It's really gross.
I almost put it in show role, but it's really, really gross.
I'll just link pictures.
They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and... Here.
The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kitten Mittens, was the episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.
That was my favorite.
I haven't seen that one yet.
Oh, it's fantastic.
But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically for helping amputees.
Well, I guess that's cool that it had a good cause at the end of the day.
So, back to the releases.
What were you going to say?
I was going to say, actually, I do think I did see that episode where they were all in the U-Haul trailer or something like that.
Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?
Yes.
Okay, okay.
That was hilarious.
Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah!
Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.
And the 4th is Anno 2070 Deep Ocean.
And the 5th, NBA 2K13.
So something every day this week.
All right.
A couple more news stories for you guys.
And then the classic game of the week where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.
But first, Loki.
And it's of the week.
So Notch, the wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to...
and perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in Windows 8 so that it would be on their closed platform.
They even asked, hey, you can help certify Minecraft for Windows 8.
He said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all rather than to play along with what Microsoft wanted.
and basically said I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms around.
If Microsoft decides to lock down Windows 8 it would be very very bad for indie games and competition in general.
If we can keep open platforms around there's going to be a lot of very interesting games in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.
I think it would have been what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.
They're certified for it in Minecraft.
Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but he doesn't want to do that.
Why would you?
Basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because it's their closed App Store versus...
He sells the game off his website.
He gets all the profits for it.
So why... Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason.
Of course he's going to say no.
It's a little different when you're putting your game on the Xbox 360 where no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.
You just can't do that.
Ranma in chat says, Oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.
Windows, the operating system that is pirate-proof.
No one pirates Windows.
Please.
If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.
I don't buy operating systems.
I actually don't think I've paid for one in like 20 years.
Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.
Same here.
Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Fugo Question of the Week a little later when it comes to Windows 8.
I'm still really torn on it.
I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.
There's a lot of mystery around it, too.
Let me put it this way.
If there's anything that people find about Windows 8 that they really must have, someone's going to fucking develop a program that runs on Windows 7 that does the same damn shit.
I mean, it probably does it better, so...
No, no thanks.
Not into it.
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, danger.
Alright, well, if you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe you're on Linux.
And of course, Linux is going to be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form of Steam.
Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.
1,000 users will be testing the client.
They also get one Valve game with that.
It's probably going to be Left 4 Dead 2 because that, of course, is the game that they already said would be on Linux.
The beta will support, and please forgive me if I mispronounce this because I'm not a Linux user, Ubuntu.
Is that how you say it?
Yep.
Ubuntu 12.04 and above.
It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.
So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.
Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to the user install experience.
Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?
Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?
Yeah, I think so.
But I'm not like an in-depth programmer or anything like that.
Right.
So...
I might see if I can't get into it.
What was your logic for using Linux Mint again?
First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.
You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.
On top of that, you have basic immediate root access to anything in your system.
And on top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.
It's respected, it's versatile.
And the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for anything.
And it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.
And what's specific about Mint?
It's just a really easy interface.
Do you just like the name Mint?
Because it's minty fresh.
It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.
It's a really good introductory into Linux.
Minty fresh scattles.
You remember that.
A 10-year-old joke from Understation Live.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Bringing it back.
Hey, no.
On my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.
I'm going to find it now.
Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?
I probably did.
Actually, I think I made it before I had LiveJournal.
Or your Zonga.
I never had a Zonga.
Never had a Zonga.
Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week and I was like, oh yeah.
I'm gonna go find the Mitzcattles.
Hold on.
You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.
Have you seen the new MySpace?
They're trying.
You mean Pinterest?
Yeah, it's basically Pinterest.
But like, no, here's the thing.
Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.
But I was looking at the new MySpace.
I'm like, oh, okay.
So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.
That's what it is.
Still won't use it.
I kind of use Pinterest.
Do you?
What do you pin on Pinterest?
Usually like recipes and Supernatural and Mass Effect.
You're such a girl.
All right.
You know what?
I love the car.
The car really makes me happy.
Alright, going a step further here with Steam.
Did I get the... Oh, yeah, sorry.
There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game, McPixel.
It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.
It is now... Excuse me, Steam Greenlight.
I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.
Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.
It is now available for $4.99.
It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by using available tools.
It's awesome.
It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.
It's really awesome.
Is it?
It's ridiculous.
Yeah, did you play it?
Yeah, I beat the whole game.
I have it on my phone.
Nice.
And yeah, I paid for it and it was ridiculous.
It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.
It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games.
MacGyver, and something really retarded.
I don't know.
It's just like the guy's just... A lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people in the nuts.
That's so noted.
OMG, spoiler.
Spoiler.
Well, if you... Which puzzles, though?
I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in the nuts.
When in doubt, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.
See if it works.
Yeah, seriously.
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time.
A time when kicking people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.
It's the classic game of the week, a chance for DarkSakura to take a trip down memory lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this, shut up.
Seriously, by the way, I did post the Mint Scattles picture in chat.
You found it that quick.
I did it.
It was on my DeviantArt.
Duh.
I did it a long time ago, though.
Along with your Garris Shep pics.
You know what?
I haven't done any Garris Shep pics.
I'm actually getting... When did I do this?
Like... Years ago.
Anyway.
Here we go.
Classic of the week.
What'd you pick, DarkSakura?
I picked Donkey Kong Country.
Good pick.
So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.
How many of us cheered when we heard that?
Yay!
Oh, rare.
Oh, rare.
Also, I have to say it's funny because I do actually use Wikipedia for some of my references.
And I'm like, DKC redirects here for the genetic disease.
See, Diskeratosis Congenita.
It just made me laugh for some reason.
I was like, what is that?
It sounds like something to do with skin.
Anyway, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare and it came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.
It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.
It was done by Tim Stapler, by some dude.
This game was really cool.
There was so much going on with this one.
It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.
The Game Boy Color version had 41.
And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by Kremlings.
So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines, you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls, you can do all kinds of stuff, and you can spell out K-O-N-G, and get extra life balloons, you can do all kinds of stuff.
I love the rhino, and I like that you can ride a barrel and just notch it over while you're riding the barrel.
So, you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew, Diddy, and you can switch between them.
Diddy is more agile, but not as powerful.
And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the Rhino, Espresso the Ostrich, Engard the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot.
I want to know who thought of those names, because those are some dumb names.
Okay.
You have two player mode, so you can do contest or team.
So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.
And team, you play together.
You work together.
One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.
And you can track your progress through the map.
You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.
And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.
I want to know where he got that name.
Now, Bobby Blackwolf in chat is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music, so here you go, some underwater music.
Oh, I love this music.
There you go.
so anyway it was really it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed so it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it and it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong and that's pretty much become a standard now um
So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.
So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.
It was lots of fun.
There were different ways to play through each level.
You had secret rooms that you could get.
You had all kinds of different things that were going on.
You had all the balloons you could... Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.
I'm actually just going to hang up on him.
I'm hanging up on you.
Who was it?
I don't know.
800 number.
But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.
It had really fun music.
In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like bopping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.
So that was pretty funny.
Um...
So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was, it was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.
and Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.
So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006 and in Europe on December 8th and North America on the 19th of February, 2007.
There were sequels.
There were other ones.
There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.
There was three Dixie Kongs, Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64 and Donkey Kong Country Returns.
So, that was it.
This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.
Yeah.
Nice.
Not bad.
So is it.
There you go.
Your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Country.
That's what happens when you try to say all those words too fast.
Oh, good times.
Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.
Please.
I found an NPC called, like, Chef Yon or something.
Or Cookmaster Yon.
So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yon.
And Yon can cook.
But it was Walk with Yon that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.
So I've actually been... Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.
There you go.
All right, I think it's time for a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.
The recent shows have been very long, but hey, it happens sometimes.
But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
You know what?
The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.
That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.
That's all fixed tonight, so I'm sure people will be getting in.
Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.
If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night of course at vognetwork.com.
Be sure to join us and chat live.vognetwork.com and Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.
Alright, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about, and I don't, I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is, but Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.
and of course one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go and that is coming.
They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.
That's pretty awesome.
DarkSakura.com
Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble
That sounds like a winner.
And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.
So, it's pretty sweet.
And I guess it's, you know, you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.
Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?
Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too.
I think they added some more games to that.
They did.
You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.
Wizorb.
Oh my god, I already bought all these games.
Yeah, Wizorb.
I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.
Oh, well, I can't be too upset.
I mean, I paid money for really good games.
Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.
No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use... Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.
oh nice okay yeah you should give one away it's a good deal one day left by the way and last but not least a game I'm very excited about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week and not to be outdone by that D3 of America decided hey guess what Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US fuck yeah Loki was very happy
Yes, so that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.
Oh, that's a... Oh, okay, I was like, winter 2013?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Remember, it's considered fall, you know.
Yeah, yeah.
So... Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.
No, no, not at all.
That's good.
And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.
A reason for you to own a Vita.
And apparently the people that played it at Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.
Like they actually added physics this time around and the details a little bit better.
Wait, they're trying to legitimize.
No, seriously.
I don't care.
It doesn't matter.
It's Sandbox making the game.
It's going to be awesome.
I have no doubt it's going to be awesome.
But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.
That's something that doesn't happen very often.
I still need to get a little Big Planet Vita.
Yeah, me too.
All right, moving on with some rapid-fire news over here.
I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.
It's dated Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams.
The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers, like really, really similar.
They kind of had a point.
I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.
Yes.
And I don't know if you've, they show it a little bit in the trailer about these shifting between different worlds.
Yeah, yeah.
And the music changes when you switch too.
Ah, that's pretty cool.
So they're saying it's like a platformer Garuga almost.
Okay.
That's kind of a neat concept and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.
They have a demo out there you can check out for free.
I actually backed it so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.
Nice.
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013, which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there.
Very cool.
Congrats to the team there for getting that out.
The final title was voted upon by the community.
Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.
Yeah, I totally missed that.
After getting the initial amount The 1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal Because, quote, we are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky And are currently discussing ideas for this project Which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse So there you go, the original game dates all the way back to 1994
Well, that's pretty cool.
If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project, Final Fantasy VI.
It's Overclock's Remix Final Fantasy VI album.
There was a Kickstarter for it.
It was shut down.
And it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.
It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.
Hmm.
But apparently all those issues have been worked out.
The fundraiser is back.
Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI Celebration, but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.
It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.
The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes or at events or what have you.
It's apparently trying to raise $30,000 but with 29 days left to go they are looking pretty good.
So there you go.
You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.
Let's hope for Actdeft's sake there's another Chocobo wrap on it.
That would be phenomenal.
Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.
Chocobop.
There's a whole little I love this song he wrote about or I love this song?
This song's okay.
Fantasy Star Online 2 is free to play on the Vita.
Yay!
It needs to be free to play on PC.
Well, free to play on the Vita.
Hopefully that's here too.
Why must arcades close?
They don't make money.
Shut up, that's no excuse.
I think this particular one, that wasn't the case though.
The guy had been running it for 30 plus years and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.
So I actually don't think in this case it was a money thing.
Yeah.
But it was a landmark arcade.
I mean, it was a big deal.
Yeah, one of the big ones.
But it was a big home for fighting games too.
Because I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.
Right.
And then Prison Architect.
Basically, they had a paid alpha version and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.
The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.
Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one because apparently everybody's making money on there.
Just kidding.
Maybe you are.
Ha ha ha ha.
Okay, that's it.
Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities and we answer them and read the answers for you here right on the show.
This week it's all about Windows 8.
The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.
With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?
Is it something you're picking up?
Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?
Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows because I knew if I did that, somebody would say, fuck Windows, I'm on Linux.
Fuck Windows, I'm on Mac.
So there was kind of a two-part question.
Well, Mac, you don't have a choice.
You just have to upgrade when they come out with new ones.
Otherwise, your computer will stop working.
Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too, what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?
Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?
So let's go to Google Plus first.
I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E. I used to know him when he lived out here.
he answered the question saying I use Linux for many reasons but games are not one of them I'd say however that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OS's but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux and of course all Android devices run Linux but that's a different world of gaming
Now, if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.
I do want to add something, actually, Rob.
You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.
Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.
That's cool.
Flaco Jones responded on Google+, saying, I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.
I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs, and I can't stand it.
Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.
I love all the Mac OSes I've used.
There isn't a lot of variation between them, but they are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.
Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.
I do wish there were more games for Mac, because whenever I do play on a Mac, it feels a lot smoother than the PC version, even though my PC has slightly better specs.
Actdeft replied on Google+, saying the Win 8 Metro UI is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.
That interface is made for a tablet, and it would totally work for that really well, but not for a keyboard and mouse.
Also, considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them, Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture if your internet connection goes down or something.
I'm currently using Win XP.
I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.
Facebook, I love this nickname, I am super lazy, replied and said, it's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.
My thought is that it works best as a media center PC, but as a traditional PC, it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.
There might be better options.
Codeman said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs, but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.
You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.
What happened to the Windows XP days?
The good old days.
The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it and if you use Steam, you're really shit out of luck.
You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.
Of course.
I'm not looking forward to it.
VX, Jason, XV Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.
Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe and Notch have talked about will eventually set it up and if they don't already, quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface and then it's Windows 7 again.
Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the surface.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet, but from what I've seen, it looks messy.
I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.
I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.
We only just migrated to Windows 7.
Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.
And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.
I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on even back when I had a PC.
Macs have World of Warcraft.
That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.
I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.
Tiger Claw says, personally, I don't think you would notice any performance increase going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.
Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.
Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro-style UI that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard in Windows Phone.
I hate though actually about the UI real quick is the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.
Really?
Yeah.
Because remember it's made for tablets so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.
Fuck that.
Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.
Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.
Apparently from the way I understand the story is that he fears that with Windows 8 will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's funny because last time I checked, his game is freely downloadable off his website and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.
But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores that you have to go through a certification process to get your app on there in the first place?
It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.
I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game from the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go and it's right there when I start the PC up?
Hell, last time I checked, you are not being held up at gunpoint to buy Windows 8.
Interesting point.
But I think the thing is, though, is for all those three platforms that you mentioned, there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.
Like, he cannot sell you a copy from his website.
Maybe you can for Android, because then you can do third-party apps and stuff like that.
But for everything else, you cannot buy straight from his website.
Right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?
And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.
Microsoft charges for...
and updates on your games.
And how often is Minecraft updated?
About once a week.
Granted, those are beta updates and stuff like that.
You don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.
So why would he want to pay money to do that?
That's the same reason why his game's on Steam because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.
Fair question.
Okay.
Just a few more answers here from Zethers.
Windows 8 is like Vista.
Every other release of Windows have been bad for the past few years of show.
I'd rather wait for Windows 9.
So they're like Star Trek movies.
Seriously, it is.
Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.
DarkSakura,
No, no.
Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?
No.
I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.
Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it, so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.
But after the little bit I've watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.
They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson Nice Alright, Hitstun says Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2 and PC users will certainly skip it and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting What the hell?
UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting?
Really?
Yeah
And lastly, Sean L replies saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.
I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down and I write software for a living.
If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?
I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two maybe.
Wow.
Very interesting.
Alright, that's it.
The Fugle Question of the Week.
How about you guys?
Windows 8?
Yes?
No?
Maybe so?
Never.
Never?
Why?
Unless they make it like Windows 7.
Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000 into whatever the hell one came after that.
Xp or Vista?
I really like Windows 7 because it took the stuff that was good in Vista took actually a few bits and pieces for memory management from Linux and it's pretty solid on top of that I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users
and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.
The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5 because I used 6 at school.
That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.
I mean, it's a really good OS.
A lot of people use it.
It's got great graphical management, clearly, because I mean, that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.
However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually...
It's basically going to be the PC for idiots.
except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and try to figure out how to do things and it's just not working.
It's... I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.
Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off.
That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.
Yeah.
I just... I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.
It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.
Loki?
Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs like back in the 90s and the 80s?
I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.
I mean, seriously, it's like, come on.
The people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.
Kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs.
But yet, why are we like,
You know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use.
I know, because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit.
I guess that's it.
They've got that retirement money burning a hole through their pocket, I guess.
And Ranma, no.
A PC for idiots is not a Mac.
A PC for idiots is Windows 8.
End of story.
You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use a Mac OS.
Um, and no, I would not buy it.
I'm not getting Windows 8.
I'm gonna take the wait-and-see approach that somebody else said.
Um, I'm gonna be honest, this is gonna make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.
Uh, the fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.
Shut up.
Let's put it this way.
If...
For once, I'm not judging you.
If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go replacing it?
Just wait.
Wait for Windows 9 or something else.
Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.
Good job.
So there you go.
If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's get back into some news.
Loki.
One thing.
Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.
Alright, so there's a word out there, a phrase out there that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community.
It's called fan service.
And what do fans want?
Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.
Amen to that.
Team Ninja, they were saying that earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.
Where's the fun in that?
However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.
but the fans who had played the early demos we got a lot of feedback from them that said we want bigger breasts make the characters more like that that was kind of surprising giving the suggestions to tone down the sexuality and so Team Ninja being Team Ninja
Look, Team Ninja, props for trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.
Gold star, you tried.
Let's be real.
Dead or Alive is all about excess, and if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.
Then you have Virtua Fighter.
And a really shitty volleyball game.
No, no, no, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit.
I hate Virtua Fighter.
I love Dead or Alive.
Now, how do you feel about Bigger Boobs?
I'm all for it.
There you go.
Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio.
Even the women want bigger boobs.
Can you imagine Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts?
Fuck that.
Nope, not buying it.
But hey, you know what?
I don't want small-chested women to feel... There's fan clubs for that too.
The Itty Bitty Titty Committee.
There's fan clubs for that too.
But in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.
It really is.
I really think we should ramp up Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 3 with hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.
Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress up for dudes.
I've already got the butt floss string.
Yes, but you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.
I really want there to be a part three with pillow fight mode.
I think that would be a lot of fun.
Wait, wait, wait.
As you're doing pillow fight mode, like pieces of clothing just, oh.
Pillow fight mode?
Uh-huh.
Using the Kinect.
No, we don't have panda boobs.
Shut up.
Why are they talking about Pandaren in chat?
I don't know Furry boobies That might take you out of the experience a little bit Alright Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5 Moving on
This is the story that just won't go away.
Remember 38 Studios and how they closed and how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?
Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits because, you know, that's what happens.
Those things never leak out.
Or what?
Yeah.
and they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.
Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.
We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.
Here's something kind of scary, though.
I mean, if you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.
You license a game from... So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying, hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us?
Yeah, we need those back.
You licensed it, so you need to send them back.
Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have?
Yeah, with the license up.
Yank.
Fun.
But yeah, seriously, those XTKs do get out there.
I would know from personal experience.
And how much, approximately, would one set you back?
Not very much anymore, because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and JTAGs are pretty out there, there's not much use for XTKs anymore.
Like, 300, 400...
Oh, that's not too bad.
I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.
Interesting.
All right, well, moving on, DarkSakura.
Well, I was actually playing with my iPad.
Yeah, I can tell.
Pay attention.
Hey!
I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class.
You can't.
How about a really trippy-ass game called Middens?
Kitten Middens.
Okay.
I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.
It basically is an indie RPG, so it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy-ass backgrounds.
It looks like you're running headfirst through a combination of Dali or even going back to Hieronymus Bosch.
Yeah, I know, I'm going all art history on you guys.
It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.
Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.
Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this.
Because it's really fucking weird.
Well, at least you get a gun.
And you can try it out for free.
I like free.
Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.
Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.
You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.
Oh, that's right.
You're not here next week.
That's right.
I'm going to be... I forgot.
It's all right.
She won't play it anyways by next week.
She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.
No, I'm just playing for Becky.
There you go.
We should start a foundation where, you know... We should.
We should start a foundation.
Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.
We'll play Mass Effect for money.
It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation.
I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.
I don't play 24-7.
I basically play Mass Effect once a week.
Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is... Pandas!
Shut up.
My bad.
Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.
Actually, Bobby Blackwolf is volunteering.
He needs that foundation.
So he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.
That means that he has to come over to my house.
Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.
That's true.
And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.
The Church of Garrus Foundation.
Thank you, AskDeft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos.
Now they're little asses.
um also Alpha Cananogram asked about me having an iPad yeah I didn't actually bring it up on the show Dan traded his transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card power supply and got Borderlands 2 and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad
So he made it up to me.
He traded a Transformer?
Like a doll?
No, he traded his shitty Android shit.
He didn't like it anyway.
I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.
We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.
Alright, I get it now, sorry.
But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway.
Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.
But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it and he was going to sell it anyway so he got me an iPad instead.
What do you think this is, Rob G4?
I'm just a pretty face.
Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day.
I'm like, I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Reb.
The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.
I mean, seriously.
He just sits there and is like, okay, what retard thing can I say next?
Funny joke.
Ha, ha, ha.
I'm funny.
And they're just like...
What the fuck did that have to do with anything?
It's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.
And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android.
I've used it.
I've given it a chance.
I hate Windows tablets even more.
IOS has what I want to do and Wacom loves it.
The end.
DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see.
What is the old saying?
She's a hater and guess what she's gonna do?
I'm gonna hate!
Exactly.
Y'all can bite my tuchus.
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, S3 greater than iPhone.
You know it's hilarious.
I don't care.
You know it's hilarious.
No, this is what's hilarious.
iPhone 5 comes out, right?
My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old-ass BlackBerry.
He has one of the first BlackBerrys a long time ago.
He has an old-ass phone, right?
He finally decides he's going to join the current generation of phones.
So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches?
Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.
Bravo.
Bravo.
Wise choice.
Keeper.
He's a keeper.
Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.
But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile, which apparently has treated him very well over the years, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.
Galaxy.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Because I have a... Well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's... Actually, it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight-up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.
You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is $30 for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use.
And even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data, so...
I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3.
I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever.
The only thing
the reason why I like it is in a whole like you know what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that let me play with that and you can do the same thing with my iPhone right he probably uses my iPad more than I do but the reason the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T we don't get the free text messages and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that so that's the one thing I don't like
I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?
I do.
Well, way to go.
Great provider.
Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.
I have a cheap plan, $30 a month.
All right.
T-Mobile.
All right.
Moving on.
Loki, you got a story.
Alright, Borderlands 2, there's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.
They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on...
I forget what fucking service it is.
It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.
When you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff.
You know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.
So your badass rank goes away.
All your... Not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.
Because the way the badass points work is...
All of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters or all of your characters and then you get perks like plus 1% to your damage or something like that and it's spread across all your characters.
So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people how
It has happened to you that you submit your save so they can take a look at it.
And they're investigating.
MM2K in our chatroom wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?
Yes, it's all platforms.
Uh-oh.
It's because it's tied to... It's not Premium Club, it's... Fuck, I forget what it's called.
They have it on the front page there, you can sign up for it, and it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get, and... Once you've signed up, they give you one additional key...
so they have that honestly if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up I mean I think there's save it throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families because that works so well for other people I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to not that anyone would do that but you can
so and not only does it erase your badass points it's basically everything that's tied to your account so all your skins and faces that you've unlocked and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions are gone so and some of those there are maybe no way to get those back so that kind of sucks
All right.
Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.
There was another one?
There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.
And it was about New Super Mario Bros.
2 and the DLC.
The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros.
2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's, first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.
Wow, they're not late to the party.
No.
Well, you know what?
Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is A-OK arriving late to this party.
But, you know, New Super Mario Bros.
2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra and some of the levels that will be available.
Go Go as Gold Mario Pack.
Three Gold Mario-themed courses up to 30,000 coins.
Challenge the Record A-Pack.
It will post the top scores on the game's website.
Ooh!
and Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels.
Those will all be in the coin rush mode.
So are they like legitimizing Asshole Mario?
Because that's kind of awesome if true.
October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan.
200 yen each.
I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind.
And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.
Once again, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have, crossing Nintendo Mario with LittleBigPlanet.
Can you imagine if they did that?
First-party Nintendo games, but a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, and LittleBigPlanet
Nintendo would never let that happen because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters because people like if Mario like Mario Mario was in Little Big Planet people would be building levels it's like Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that and like Nintendo would never well no it wouldn't necessarily be like that it would be just like um you know you design your own levels
DarkSakura.com
Because there's always going to be some dude out there.
I'm sure there are people they have dedicated their lives to.
I'm going to create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.
I think I have a rule about design.
Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm going to have to run this by DarkSakura.
Are you ready?
Tell me if this is a true statement or not.
This is a very zen statement.
I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria.
Where there is design, there is penis.
No.
What do you mean no?
When there are immature minds, there is penis.
And where isn't there immature minds?
Clearly not in the internet.
The internet is quite mature.
Thank you very much.
Think about it.
I want you to go ask your teacher.
I heard this on an internet radio show.
Where there is design, there is penis.
What do you think?
He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.
That is so true, is what he'll say.
No, he'll roll his eyes.
I know he would do it.
And he'd just go, what?
Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.
I've seen his art.
It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.
Yet.
No.
Where there is design, there is penis.
I sense an art book possibility.
You know, I'm making an art book.
Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.
Thank you!
It will be rated M. There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was guess who drew the penis.
And somebody would take around a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.
And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.
And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.
We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire.
Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama.
Shut up.
Nerd.
We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.
Oh, that game.
Yeah.
Who doesn't know that game?
But I have to tell you, I was at Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.
And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.
There you go.
Mario, Zelda, not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.
That'd be awesome.
All right.
Blackwolf says, Excitebike.
Can you do a penis in Excitebike?
It'll probably be very difficult.
No, because they have, you know, it's... I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.
Well, I remember that you could... I remember that you could draw things in Excitebike based on letter.
Like you would choose a letter and that would be with the obstacle over here.
So you could technically make a corset with penis.
Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.
So think about it.
Think about it.
Or don't think about it.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Alright, true story here.
When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.
So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.
Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.
The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.
We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.
I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the Fry's penis on the Orange Lodge Radio website.
Nobody cares.
It's got hairy balls.
Oh, hooray.
Hooray.
I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.
I've had a really crazy week.
I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.
Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.
DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out an email that she thinks, Hey!
Ew!
Hey!
Ew!
Ew!
I'm going to read this.
It's kind of sticky.
Good evening.
I have to object to something DarkSakura said on last week's OLR.
Well, too fucking bad, Skip.
No, I'm kidding.
Last week, DarkSakura called Dan's reference to the fake game Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition reprehensible.
I find this to be abhorrent.
How is Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference Beat and Groovy The Ike Turner Experience?
Wow.
In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.
Britney's Dance Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent, Ew!
Wow.
Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.

First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.
I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three-month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey Collection when I tried to redeem the 30-day voucher the system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it.
Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?
That's a great question for Sony.
I don't know.
I don't think so because it's auto-renewing.
You could turn that off, though.
You could turn off the auto-renewing.
The catch is they want you to do that.
The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.
Hold on though, because I just tip, get one of those prepaid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.
Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.
Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the McFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?
Fuck if I know.
The answer is, I don't.
I wanted the Sylvanas figure.
That was it.
Because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.
Wargan Death Knight with Swift Griffin Keep having a good show Robert M
Now here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question.
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards.
I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.
Tiger Claw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.
SSJ100Matt says the thing is that by law they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto-charge thing, of course.
So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.
So yeah.
Next email.
And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.
So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping...
Sylvanas Faker.
Oh, Garrus.
Garrus.
I really want Garrus.
Garrus greater than Sylvanas.
Just saying.
Yes, ma'am.
Or a plushie panda.
Actually, I have a plushie panda.
Why not all three?
I have a plush panda no for real okay I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant and when I was in fourth grade my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off so that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck and I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon true story okay
Greetings, OLR.
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
Here's my review of Borderlands 2.
Awesome!
For the PC.
My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.
Then I played it on my gaming PC.
Blood and ashes.
It's incredible.
It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.
The huge levels, the game improves upon the first in every way there is.
The voice acting is great, the dialogue is genius, and Claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.
I highly recommend it.
What system is Loki playing the game on, and has he played it on a gaming PC?
Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.
Xbox 360, no I have not, because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.
You'll wait until a Steam sale anyway, right?
If my laptop doesn't run it, then there's no reason for me to buy it.
Dope.
No reason, but it doesn't mean I won't do it.
Well, I mean, it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought this.
It was like $7 for Borderlands.
And that would be something I'd have to buy the Game of the Year edition.
I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.
Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?
Let's shall.
Alright, that was the last email, right?
Yes.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
And you should, dammit.
I want to get more emails.
Dammit.
And you can read them.
Dammit.
Dammit.
Oh God, please don't.
Oh, this is bad.
Here.
My FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raijan, which I actually still need some kind of money for.
Very...
You weren't able to get that.
You weren't able to get that, find that.
Yeah.
Gone.
I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key.
But I've lost my 18-year-old Bats Maruki chain.
FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.
Done.
Loki...
I don't need the people that drift into other lanes.
Because it seems like all the time, like driving here today, there's like four or five of them.
Like seriously, people, pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.
Like texting or just plain stupid.
Urgh, I'm in another lane now.
My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night, but today.
And headaches can be very disabling, especially when you're really busy.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
so if you did the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland it had nothing to do with Disneyland or work it was all here back at home nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip however everything happens for a reason what does it kill us makes us stronger la la la la la la la la so whatever why can't everything be perfect 24-7 damn it and easy I like easy
and Lazy.
Yes, also had nothing to do with VOG.
That's important.
Thank you, Bobby.
If it had something to do with VOG, you'd know.
Alright, moving on.
A few more news stories for you guys and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line.
Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
Loki.
FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii
Um, they actually, there was an article that was run on, um, Nintendo Gamer, and, uh, apparently, looking at the game, and, uh, I guess Wayne Rooney, uh, they've replaced him, um, or I guess with, uh, one of, uh, Lionel Messi, is one of the examples of just the simple changes that they did in the game.
Basically, the games are identical, except for, you know, the cover star's been changed.
Um, you know, the title's FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.
They've done the roster updates and changed uniforms and added the clubs that they've updated.
Aside from that, the game is exactly the same.
So that's kind of disappointing.
I guess they figured that no one would notice?
I mean, put minimal effort into it.
We'll trick them, wah-ha-ha.
Yes, so very interesting.
And there was, I guess, a review on the official Nintendo magazine, UK, that they were kind of talking about those as well.
And it's just funny.
Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual?
60 bucks?
I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think.
50 or 40.
But yeah, it's still pretty full.
It's not like a $20 game or something like that.
Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year.
So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.
It's just decent.
It's bad.
I mean, that's pretty blatant that they would do that.
All right.
Let's go to this last story here, which is about... And this is one of those things where I'm like, please stop.
Don't.
No.
This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody.
It's going to just kill the industry.
Watch.
It's about Ubisoft.
Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free-to-play games for the marketplace.
Now, that in itself is not a bad thing.
But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions And yes, I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron
on this particular article, yeah.
Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free-to-play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free-to-play model.
The next generation will offer more and more item-based content.
This will benefit our game's profitability.
No, it won't.
When we start rejecting that bullshit...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Do not want.
Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible.
It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character.
Level up a little faster.
And then some of them, this guy's, hey, here's a mission.
We're going to get some more money for free.
You know, if you find these ten things, you get all these money, all these different monies.
and um so yeah that's not a good example of um DLC also EA very notable for charging for cheats one of the one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer like you know to basically cheat and I'm sure those things sell like crazy yeah FIFA
I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the DLC for the other stuff Don't encourage them, bonk
So I bought like two packs.
But anyway.
Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs.
So, yeah, I don't see a downside for them.
People are going to go, oh, those are terrible.
Why are you doing it?
It's going to ruin the industry.
And then people buy them.
So that's why there's DLC in those games.
The free-to-play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.
I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House.
I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount thing.
People pay $25 per amount.
Never have done that.
That's too much.
I know lots of people that have done it.
Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.
And hey, you know what?
It's your money.
Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose.
But I just don't... Like the price of the expansion was $40.
Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion.
I don't get that logic at all.
The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet.
No, there were two charity pets.
And that's it.
That's all I've bought.
I like that.
There's a comment on the story here.
Basically, they coined the phrase pay-to-pay.
So that's what we're going to call these games.
Pay-to-pay games.
Pay-to-pay games.
I like that.
And I think these should be called out.
And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.
Saints Row the Third perfect example of DLC gone wrong if it's locked in the game if it's like locked costumes in the game not additional stuff that they hey we made this new character class or something like that that's just it's bullshit you shouldn't have to pay for that stuff and yes I understand you don't have to pay for it but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want
And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing.
Like, all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing.
Like, really?
Really?
I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight.
We are going to go to the Skype line.
The Skype line is open right now.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We will start taking calls here.
Go ahead and give us a call.
You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about.
That is just fine as well.
Meanwhile, we'll also go to our Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those.
And also, Loki, you'll probably have some last minute news, right?
News?
You don't have last minute news tonight.
No, I don't have any last minute news.
Oh my gosh.
Alright, well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones.
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku here.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing much, just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed, trying to get in one call.
But yeah, I just wanted to bring up the...
A little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week, where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.
We did talk about this in Part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?
So, I don't know, I'm kind of puzzled in the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS...
and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms.
And yet, he's having a fit with Microsoft again.
So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back.
I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others that are just the same.
Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?
Yes, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different architecture, different platform.
Hey Kettle, this is Pot.
Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, that'd be great.
Stop being rude, Rob.
Again, this is Pot.
That's P-O-T.
It's Zaku.
Did you say black or back?
Back.
The Pot calling the Kettle back.
It's the Pot calling the Kettle black.
The phrase.
The saying is usually the Pot calling the Kettle black, but that's okay.
All right, yeah, I get it.
All right, 1L.
But you get the idea.
It's pretty much, it's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically, that's what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is like the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS.
on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.
So, in other words, he kind of likes, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of ass rape while complaining about another.
That's pretty much what it is.
Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed.
I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.
What was that?
I said the iOS platform is not really closed.
I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that, but they're, unless you're Google.
Yeah.
you have a different set of rules in Google Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either he contracted or somebody bought the rights to it he didn't really do it for the 360 somebody else did so is he really supporting the closed platform?
I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand.
He's representing the game itself.
I don't think it's not as relevant the fact that he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform, but in the end of the day, it's still his game, that it just went beyond PC.
It went beyond a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.
Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.
And that's where I see the hypocrisy.
You greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.
and I don't see where it adds up.
I don't.
Alright.
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
Let me see.
This just came in to Kotaku today.
38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG won't be facing federal charges.
So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds.
Even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.
and it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself from what I'm hearing is that Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you or really to do any professional project for you exactly
That's it.
It's like, you know, at the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who worked their asses off at the studios trying, you know, on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.
And none of them have been held accountable.
In that sense, they just walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.
Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?
People's Court would have been better, but... I think, yeah, there's gonna be... I'm not surprised that there'll be, like, lawsuits over this.
Like, Curt Schilling, I don't... I mean, he's off the... He's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.
One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just gonna, like, gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't, like, making payroll...
So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities.
So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much.
Take care.
Have a good night.
Bye.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to call.
Just missed one.
Sometimes people call and wait and hope to get through.
I just missed it.
Sorry about that.
All right.
Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing.
You might have pinged out too.
Yeah, I did too.
For like, oh man, it pisses me off.
I didn't get to see the comments in chat to the call me back comment.
I do see one from Actdeft that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.
Oh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
What up, guys?
It's Xeno from the OKC.
How you guys doing?
Hey, Xenocore.
Haven't heard from you in a while.
How you doing?
You know, staying employed.
Same old, same old.
That's a good thing.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I've been playing a bit of Planetside 2, actually.
Ooh, all right.
How's that going for you?
Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this.
Now, every single base is different.
Tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game's going to be free on release, so why not?
Wait, this is a totally free game?
Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.
Oh, of course, of course.
That's how things are going.
Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?
Well, Ubisoft, I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.
I did not realize that Planetside was originally 2003, the first one.
That's really old.
Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making at E3 2001 when I went.
And it looked damn good then.
You know, just the playability and everything else.
And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?
And here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up.
They got at least three years with the development of this one based on what it looks like.
Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?
It's closed beta right now.
Ah, okay, I gotcha.
But you can buy your way in.
You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.
Right.
And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.
So what is it that draws you to Planet Psy?
Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day.
What is it that draws you to this game versus... Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?
Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly.
I played the first Planetside, played Earth and Beyond.
I played a whole bunch of that, my son.
You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi, planet-y space games.
Is that a thing?
Well, it's one of my things, yeah.
Okay.
Well, no, I think that's cool.
I just noticed that little trend going on there.
Well, what is it about Planetside specifically that draws you to that series?
It's more like a full military...
I can actually use some of the stuff I learned piloting, doing air support, so.
Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.
I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this.
I had no idea.
Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal...
that the sequel's title was Planetside Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.
Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?
I think he's depressed.
Hey, wait a minute.
I have a live journal.
You shut up.
He just recently posted to it too, August 11th, 2012.
That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.
PlanetSide 2, what is it and why do I want to play it?
PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE.
The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.
When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.
All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles with
StarCraft 2
I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry.
It's a very interesting way to put out your press releases.
Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.
Good to know.
Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?
Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC.
I'm really loving FTL.
That game's freaking amazing.
And Dark Souls.
Oh my gosh.
That game is ruthless.
I know, as all games should be.
This Namby Pamby, you know, you level twice so you win bull crap.
Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.
You press the button in time with the music, you win an internet.
Yeah, exactly.
Screw that.
All right, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No, that's pretty much it.
Y'all have a good show.
You too, buddy.
Take care.
Don't be a stranger.
All right, later.
Later.
Let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
It's Shane.
Hey, Shane.
How you doing?
I'm doing well.
Did you have fun on the live hoard house this week?
No, I was too distracted playing WoW.
Aww.
Yeah.
How's WoW going for you?
I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90.
So I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else ever.
What level is your main pet?
I keep rotating all of them out.
I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now.
And I've got like almost 100 pets.
What is the name?
Oh my, you've leveled all of your pets to 5?
I'm starting to.
I've got maybe about 10 of them done.
What do you name your pets?
Do you custom name all your pets?
No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.
I've been naming mine after Mass Effect characters.
Mine are better.
No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?
That doesn't make sense.
Because, I don't know.
I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.
You named your dog Helo?
Yes, but that's adorable.
Now, Rob, did I tell you I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character?
Which one?
Cuddles.
Cuddles, aw.
I named my high gel cub Cuddles.
and didn't, didn't, what was Shane's?
Shane had a cute character name too.
It was like Fluffles.
Fluffles.
That was it.
Yes.
Well maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.
Alright, there you go.
Shane, would that be happy for you?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stop judging me.
What was that?
I told Rob to stop judging me.
I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.
I had a headache.
That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.
I've been leveling my character.
It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.
I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?
Is it D Space?
Whatever.
I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not.
But it was like number six on the list of things it found.
It didn't make any sense to me.
Like it picked up ReRave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.
ReRave's not bad.
No, it's not.
I'm not saying it is.
But DJ Max is better.
Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.
Yeah, I think it just stretches.
But it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad.
But it's just so freaking good.
Like, I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it.
And I can't quit playing that as well.
So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now, too.
I don't want to get yelled at again.
I am not buying this game.
Good job.
Don't buy it.
Don't give in to him.
He's a jerk.
It's free unless you want the song packs and you can get a pretty good deal like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out and then you get some extra note skin.
What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?
I don't know.
It sounds stupid.
Get DJ Maxx.
The little anime chick, she commands me.
The anime chick wants a dollar.
Don't buy it, Rob.
Don't give in to the... I don't see DJ... I seriously... Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps.
I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?
Yeah.
I don't listen to her.
How many years has it been?
Rob?
Okay, I got it.
DJ Max Ray, right?
Yeah.
Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?
Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?
Yes, and I agree three times.
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.
Make sure to create an account too.
It takes like two seconds.
You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise.
And that really sucks if you do that with the purchasing thing.
I don't understand.
I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says the terms and conditions have changed.
I haven't heard that.
The conditions have changed!
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.
There's some kind of dumb over there right now.
Shut up, Rob.
Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.
You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.
By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.
Oh yeah, the Jane Shepard.
Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.
I was actually a little surprised too.
I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.
I can't find the title that I'm looking for.
Oh.
And I have to agree to these change conditions.
And I can't shut down my iPad.
Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.
Shut up.
No one asked you.
I'm actually trying it on my phone.
Raydeer in our chatroom says, it's Tapsonic, but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.
That's exactly right.
And it's got, well, I mean, it's all real DJ Max music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.
Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?
No, it's freaking DJ Max.
Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.
So I think it's that app.
Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.
It's fine.
All right, what else did you want to talk about tonight?
I was mostly going to talk about DJ Max and then some stupidity happened.
Tell us about DJ Max.
Was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Max that you didn't get out there?
Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts and then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability and then there are, I want to say, five more packs
A lot of songs that you can get.
So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.
So it's really, really good.
Everybody should get it that can.
Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.
All right, sounds good.
And I'm still pet battling.
And Pokemon is this week.
And I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.
Well, you're just going to be like the happiest person ever.
It's like Christmas for you.
I know this week is great.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
Not all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.
I wish I was having a good week.
All right.
Well, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.
All right.
Go end it.
Bye.
Alright, let me... Oh, I gotta go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.
Thanks to all those that called in tonight.
If you didn't get through, tough.
Try again next week.
Or send us an email with your thoughts.
1-877-GAME-OLR OrangeRite wanted to point out in the chatroom about DJ Max.
It's key-sounded and that is pretty important as well.
It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music.
Like some other apps that are out there, it actually does have the key sounds in it.
That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.
It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.
TigerClaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight, and he sent us some tweets about this one.
First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.
I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out?
I don't know.
There are quite a few, two this year.
I think two, was there two last year?
I guess there's been a few.
I remember Lego Harry Potter 2 last year, and Lego Star Wars last year.
Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.
Yeah, Lego Lord of the Rings is this year.
Actually, three if you include that Lego City stories.
Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.
And they've already had Lego Batman 2.
Let's see.
Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.
Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute, strategic, and competitive point of view.
And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.
There's always something new.
There's always something different.
We're always looking to add different layers, whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which we'll have the luxury of having over the next few years.
so it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance of fruits and vegetables alright let me see I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here and it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games and the quote he pulled there is you run the company like you're in danger of starving I guess this has to do with the high stress nature of running a game company
Um, let's see.
This was a quote in, uh, Edge Online in the magazine E246.
Um, quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.
I mean, you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.
When Platinum Games started in 2006, it had 50 staff.
Six years, it had 200 if you counted the contractors.
The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer, Capcom.
The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.
But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.
Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4.
Just an enormous amount of people.
Didn't help them, did it?
Oh, snap.
Again, that comment from an article on edgeonline.com sent to us via Twitter by Tigerclaw.
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?
No, I didn't see anything that stood out.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But not next week.
Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over OLR.
Yes, I choose the gay.
And I'm not going this year.
It's kind of sad.
I choose a lot of gay.
Send me pictures.
The Sea of Red.
Have fun.
Your final thought tonight.
I'm actually going to wear my OLR shirt.
Oh, wait.
That's right.
You didn't get the VOG one this time.
I have my red and black OLR shirt that Kristen and I had done way back when.
Because I have hit my first goal.
I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.
Congrats.
Thank you.
Good news.
So my message is actually very important.
Spay and neuter your cats.
Thank you, Bob Barker.
Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?
I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.
You poor soul.
It's a great show.
I did back in the 80s.
You said it back in the 80s.
Well, I didn't remember because I didn't care.
But seriously, rescue a cat.
Everyone go out and rescue a cat.
Unless you're allergic to cats.
Then take some Benadryl.
Rescue dog.
All right, Loki, your final thought.
I've never rescued enough cats.
Had 11 at one time.
It's a lot of cats.
Then I didn't feed them and they went away.
At least I think they did.
I think they're waiting in the shadows.
Waiting to hunt me down.
My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.
Yes.
I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.
We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.
It's really good.
I just had Pinkberry last night.
I don't care.
Let's go get some.
Alright, that's it.
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
