31894	37058	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37119	38820	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
38860	40561	Kind of a special edition tonight.
40962	43144	Although, they're all a little bit special.
43424	47748	Particularly tonight's episode if you're here on this special Thursday.
48008	48448	In the head.
49429	49689	Sock Hop
76474	77755	I refrain from comment.
78176	78336	Right.
78376	86564	That and I hate this time of year because of all of the, do you want to, we want to talk to you about how you don't want to vote for this guy.
87345	89427	Oh, especially at college campuses, my lord.
89507	90989	No, on my cell phone.
91349	91469	Oh.
93431	94352	Good times.
94472	94872	Yeah.
95053	95273	All right.
95313	96974	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
97615	97855	Hi.
98236	100218	Loki, what should I vote for in November?
101618	102159	Your mom.
103099	103980	Pornography.
104080	104741	Vote for your mom.
104881	105621	I'd vote for your mom.
106602	107683	My mom's pretty awesome.
107963	110905	Because your mom would just go, I can't believe you're all doing that.
111125	111925	That's awful.
112966	113487	Rob.
114367	114627	Why?
115008	118770	Rob, as president, I'm going to ban that show, Rob.
119331	120952	You need to save your money.
121212	126916	It's only taken 10 years before I finally started getting the porn spam in the old mailbox.
127416	127656	Only.
127977	128537	Only 10 years.
128737	130119	That is slow for internet.
130199	131660	I mean, it should be like five seconds.
131680	133441	You're just inviting that shit to come in.
133481	133742	All right.
134002	139587	Well, also joining us somewhat in studio tonight, say hello to Dan the Man is back.
140708	141408	Yes, I am.
142069	143290	How are you doing, Dan the Man?
144895	159695	Not average Good to hear Yeah, he's just average He's just, you know, he's alright Dance my means to an end tonight Alright, so if you missed the memo during last week's show And how dare you not listen to last week's show But hey, at least you're listening tonight, so I forgive you
160015	160775	Here's what's going on.
161115	163236	We're taping a little bit earlier in the week.
163296	167018	It's a Thursday night right now, and we are live at vognetwork.com.
167338	168478	So if you're hearing like, what?
168718	170259	Usually I hear music on Thursday nights.
170279	170939	Why is there a show?
171279	171739	We're here.
171819	172980	We're doing this special thing.
173100	176481	It will rebroadcast on Sunday night in our normal time slot.
176781	177482	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
191838	196199	Anyhow, though, still lots of stuff going on in the gaming world, but just the disclaimer at the top.
196659	207063	The news is delayed a couple days here, so there may be some things that have changed between Thursday, the day we tape, and Sunday night, Monday morning, the day the podcast goes out.
207103	208383	So just putting that disclaimer out there.
208823	209384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
229842	230363	Dead Rising 3
247333	248193	Yeah, what's up with that?
248213	251474	Because we had some pretty juicy rumors on that a couple months ago about the story.
251494	253095	I think it's going to be next E3, to be honest.
253355	254915	I think they just weren't ready yet.
255476	257436	It was probably one of those, oh, hey, we're going to show this.
257476	258957	But then they're like, well, you know what?
259417	265359	We still have a couple games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, like Devil May Cry and Resident Evil.
265399	270300	So let's not put Dead Rising 3 out there yet because they don't probably have anything to show for it yet.
270981	272161	But next E3, I bet they will.
273962	275083	E3 seems like the smarter time
296458	299141	Um, let's see, what else isn't it a Tokyo game show?
299161	300622	There was something I was thinking of.
300782	307869	Oh, um, Square, I know they've got some things going on, but I haven't heard a lot coming out about the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.
307889	310391	I don't know if that's still coming, or what's going on.
310411	311352	They showed something.
311553	313634	They had, I think, a new trailer or something.
313775	314095	Did they?
314455	318239	I know there's big Square news we'll get to later, but still no Versus either, right?
318712	319373	No, I'm not surprised.
320293	324116	No Last Guardian other than... Yep, we're still working on it.
324236	324737	It's happening.
324897	325898	It hasn't disappeared yet.
326598	328740	All right, well, we will get into all the news that's going on.
329300	330681	The Last Guardian is versus 13.
331422	332403	Rumor!
332863	337787	Do you guys have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point in your life?
337947	338968	I just want to go to Tokyo.
339548	340469	You just want to go to Tokyo?
340549	342751	Yeah, and if I happen to be at the game show, then nice.
343111	345813	Yeah, you could always plan to be there about that time.
346074	347515	To be honest, I'd rather go to Kyoto.
348106	350333	I want to go to Rockstar New York.
353377	355818	Dan wants to go to Tokyo because he wants to go to Akihabara.
356258	356858	That would be fun.
357918	359099	So he can buy TurboGrafx games.
359399	361539	Who wouldn't want to buy TurboGrafx games?
361559	362860	People who don't have TurboGrafx.
363520	365600	Some folks in the chat, we do have a live chat room.
365620	370902	It's a small turnout tonight because we didn't really announce this because we didn't know exactly what time we'd be up and everything.
370962	375083	So we really have the VOG loyalists at the Voice of Geeks Network in chat tonight.
375223	379544	And ShadowNextGen says, Sony's Tokyo Game Show press conference was horrible.
381132	382933	I want to go to Tokyo Game Show at least once.
383593	387214	I'd like to go at least once, but it's really crowded from what I hear.
387294	392615	That and Gamescom are both really crowded shows because they are open to the public, and I bet it's just kind of a mess.
393036	397557	Probably have to wait in Disneyland-style rides to play anything out there on the floor.
397597	403038	I mean, E3 was bad enough there for a while, especially before the big slim down back in 2006.
405639	407700	Loki, you have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point?
407840	408020	Nope.
408400	408700	Why not?
410151	411011	Don't speak the language.
411712	417815	That would be difficult with the whole language barrier, but does that mean you don't want to go to Gamescom either because that's in Germany?
420216	422117	Strudel.
423557	425578	It's all Europe, so they have some English speaking.
426979	432701	The only thing I'd really want to go see at Tokyo Game Show is G3's awesome booth.
432901	436083	They did a whole recreation of Earth Defense Force in Lego.
436223	436463	DarkSakura,
451838	455560	That won't be there next year, though, unless you get lucky and there's an Earth Defense Force 5.
456720	465264	You know, technically, I mean, if I wanted to import it next week, is Earth Defense Force 3 portable?
465864	466344	Thought about it?
467265	468085	For the Vita.
468425	468886	Thought about it?
469046	469606	In Japan.
470386	471307	Is Vita region free?
471367	471907	Yes, it is.
472127	473387	Oh, I thought it wasn't for some reason.
473708	476469	The digital marketplaces are, but... Ah.
477489	478870	No, the 3DS is not.
479650	480271	Right, right.
480711	481071	Okay.
481091	481191	What?
482051	485474	Oh yeah, so I can't get that awesome game unless I have an import.
485514	487836	Wow, that is the stupidest thing Nintendo's ever done.
487896	488996	I need a Japanese DS.
489237	490818	You didn't know the 3DS was region locked?
491038	492479	After all this, how long has the 3DS been out?
493600	495481	How many 3DSs do you see me owning?
498083	500605	I looked at the hard one and was like, oh, it's the DS again.
501445	503087	Oh, and it's got blurry 3D.
503707	506189	Oh, and they've got absolutely no games I'm interested in.
506909	507750	Okay, yeah, I'll live.
508787	511788	I want that project cross whatever it's called.
512168	514449	Here's the reason why you need a 3DS, okay?
514869	519530	You take 3D pictures of cats and send them to your friends via swap note.
519750	520851	Can the Vita do that?
521291	522211	I don't think so.
523471	526272	Is the power of three-dimensional cats in the PlayStation 3?
527052	528573	Maybe, but they're not unleashing it.
529313	536979	The 3DS is where 3D cat pics are at, sir I think if you have a 3D TV, I think you can view 3D photos on it You shut up!
537279	552650	I could give half a fuck But I'm keeping my half a fuck for when I need it Because I think there are some Sony cameras that do shoot in 3D I guess that is true Stop making points, assholes How dare you prove me wrong
553425	555346	I don't know if I'm... I'm just speculating.
555486	555966	Oh, okay.
556606	560768	But you see, I've got that aura about me that anything I say, people are like, yeah, that's plausible.
560888	561769	I'm going to go with that.
564190	569972	If I look at the comments for last week's show on VOGnetwork.com, apparently you are now right.
570312	572673	I even had to butt in and say, hold on, guys.
572693	572953	Hold on.
572993	573373	Slow down.
573734	575254	Loki's not right all the time.
575434	576875	Don't let his ego get too big.
579096	582421	But apparently Loki is like Miss Cleo now.
582441	583482	He knows everything.
583522	586666	So kind of on a tangent here, but it's sort of.
587968	591312	I just started out of curiosity because I saw someone retweet him.
591413	593696	I started following Michael Patcher on Twitter and
594676	597417	and, you know, he makes comments about things.
597597	600999	And some of his comments, I just have... Famous games analyst, right?
601019	602820	The one that all the news stations call.
602840	603380	He's a game analyst.
603400	609863	I don't like him because he's a game analyst and he does the same thing I do except he gets paid like six figures or something like that.
610183	611003	Games analyst.
611363	614725	But anyways, so he's like... It didn't make any sense to me.
615005	622208	He's basically talking about how he thinks the Wii U is going to do roughly about 50% of the units that the Wii did at launch.
623208	628633	But it's going to have a good launch because it's already established.
628673	633697	You've got the hardcore gamers that are going to buy into it and also because of the lack of units out there.
633957	640223	I'm like, how the fuck does a shortage on the system mean it's going to sell better?
640423	641604	Ask the Wii.
641984	642505	It worked.
643345	646908	It'll sell out because we've only put 10 units out there.
646928	649611	Because it's what's going to make the headlines on the local news.
650697	661564	Crazy motherfuckers lining up to get a Wii U at Kmart, selling them on eBay for six figures, all that stuff.
661584	663245	Nintendo plays that game, too.
663826	668289	Nintendo always does the shit where it's like, oh, there's like ten of them out there.
668529	673572	The only system that I don't think they really did that with was the 3DS, and look how that turned out.
673712	680577	So you know that those things are going to be fucking impossible to find, just because they're going to be hoping that the hype machine takes over.
680777	689386	Yeah, but the problem is the hype machine also didn't have to compete against the whole presidential campaign that's going on around the same time.
689727	691529	I'm going to say, I'm going to put this out there.
691629	696774	I think that they're probably not looking for the same demographic as is paying attention to the presidential campaign.
697655	698536	Sad but true point.
698576	700797	The Wii U is for, what's the word I'm looking for?
700817	702318	Oh yeah, grade schoolers.
703078	705860	The presidential campaign is being run by grade schoolers.
705880	711704	The Wii U is meant for people that already own the Wii, but yet want another system that plays the same shit.
711824	713405	But nobody wants another system that plays on the Wii.
713425	715846	Oh wait, that would be people that own the DS that bought the 3DS.
716006	717987	It's very clear that 47% of Americans don't care about the Wii U.
725416	728817	Alright, is it going to be one of those shows where you just bash the Wii?
755780	756080	All right.
756821	757061	Let's see.
757081	758303	Go into our chat room for comments.
758363	759724	Live.vognetwork.com.
760064	764368	There's some tumbleweed rolling by on this Thursday, but hey, you guys didn't know we were going to do something special.
764969	766791	SSJ100Matt says, supply and demand.
766831	769013	Create a demand for it and there will be a craze.
770274	775960	Blackwolf is pointing out that in the comments for his last show at vognetwork.com, he's getting yelled at.
777897	779338	about some of the comments he made on his show.
779758	786023	I was reading the comments, which is up to, it's up to like double-digit comments right now on Bobby's last show, and this is all I hear.
788484	792207	Sexy party?
792507	793648	Yeah, sexy party.
794148	794348	Sweet.
794908	796830	Who knew that that's what's on at the Bobby Blackwell show?
796950	797210	All right.
797490	799451	That's what they should call the next Microsoft system.
799711	800272	Sexy party?
800592	802673	The Microsoft sexy party.
803134	806356	The Microsoft sexy party that projects images onto all your walls?
806376	806436	Yes.
808832	809372	It makes sense.
809412	815054	If you want to do the whole fucking Wii thing, Wii, it means playing together with our friends and family.
815194	817054	Wii as in multiple people.
817254	824116	Sexy party as in... Sexy party as it looks fucking awesome and you're going to have a party because it's sexy graphics all up on your fucking walls.
826697	827077	All right.
827577	832499	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week, DarkSakura.
834210	834971	I played WoW.
835091	836992	I have a tune at 84.
837553	839694	And I've been playing Mass Effect 3, which I beat again.
841355	841775	Again?
841935	842175	Again.
842316	842736	Again?
843356	843736	Yeah.
843776	844257	Good times.
846258	848880	I love the comment from Blackwolf in our chatroom right now.
849380	853463	Hey, sexy party.
854603	858306	It's not too late to get... We'll buy Xbox style.
858746	860187	You make him the fucking spokesman.
860327	861428	That shit will sell.
861448	861968	Yeah.
862711	864291	Whoever can get that guy to sell their console.
864311	865232	That shit will sell.
866312	869313	Whoever can get that guy to do the dance for the console will sell.
869513	871053	Nintendo, you want to turn this shit around?
871093	873834	You know, like, hey, you know, we would like to play.
873874	878975	It's fucking, it comes up to your door and just fucking breaks it, busts it out.
879475	882916	People are like, I don't even know what this commercial is for, but I'm going to buy it.
885316	887297	I think Nintendo had something to do with it, but...
887816	889817	That is quite possibly the worst thing you've ever said.
891097	892178	Reggie's gonna hear this.
892718	892938	Right.
893358	895999	Reggie's gonna hear this, and then he's gonna be like, we're gonna do that.
896139	897600	And now the Wii's gonna be a big hit.
898500	898960	Good job.
914282	918886	I'm telling you man, you put that song, you put that guy in there, anything will sell.
919187	921649	Alright, stop it now before this becomes unfunny.
930916	932717	Too late.
932997	933518	You shut up.
933998	934278	All right.
935058	935338	Oh, yes.
935559	936119	Gaming Weeks.
936159	936619	Where were we?
936839	939881	Jamie beat Mass Effect 3 again, and somehow that led to Gangnam Style.
941501	941862	Loki.
943102	944103	I played three things this week.
944143	946684	I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.
947044	949145	A little bit of multiplayer there.
949505	955048	I played Borderlands 2, which is awesome because I only had
955168	955748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
976554	979956	But Stallion, his diamond horse, is hilarious.
980056	985020	Or writing in the Claptrap, who gives you a quest to go find his secret loot stash.
985560	990283	He needs you to pick up a few rocks, and then the little checkpoint thing comes up.
990403	991184	Find 133,000 rocks.
991204	997648	Or, you know, you must bring me the staff of the Destroyer of Worlds, and then you must do a dance for me.
1006934	1007534	It's hilarious.
1009315	1010315	I'm really digging that game.
1011395	1014836	Then also, I played a bit of Minecraft.
1015316	1016816	Still playing on the VOG Network server.
1016836	1020197	Going to probably flip it over to creative mode in October here.
1020337	1020897	Can't wait.
1022097	1022857	May do it sooner.
1022977	1023958	Maybe next week even.
1025098	1030459	Just so people can actually build some stuff without getting raped by Endermen.
1031139	1043624	And then I finally played Bungie Ferret Tossing And I was actually, well when I first played it I was actually ranked 4th for normal mode But I'm sure since I've only played it once Is that on the website?
1044144	1055628	I forgot to, you know, I didn't have my phone with me So I didn't get the copy I don't know if you can look up your old notes Yeah, it's not, it's the one you see on the Xbox is local So if you're 4th, you're only 4th on your local words You gotta do the online one You sure?
1055648	1057969	Because I thought it was with friends too Is it?
1058049	1059910	I think it's friends on there I don't know, I thought...
1060730	1088339	I thought you can't do that on Xbox Live but then again I think one of the other indie games I seem to remember in the past did something like that so maybe I don't know I don't know but if there's a way to look up that code again or I'll just do it next time we'll play it one more time and see where we get Bobby says he's waiting for creative mode to come build something he's scared of the creepers I'll flip it over tomorrow good times anything else for your gaming week that was it
1088619	1106100	My Gaming Week, sadly not a lot, I also play Bungie Fairy Tossing, which we've talked about during the show, and right now I'm number one on the internet leaderboard, or at least I was the other day, I haven't checked in like 48 hours, so maybe I've been dethroned, I don't know, but it's super adorable, cute
1106740	1109803	Is it going to blow your mind?
1109883	1112185	Is it the second coming of Mass Effect?
1112646	1114267	Or is it the next World of Warcraft?
1114407	1115128	No, it's not.
1115308	1117710	There better be a second coming of Mass Effect.
1117790	1119412	Well, actually, we'll get into that later.
1119972	1120853	It's funny you bring that up.
1121213	1122034	But it's a dollar.
1122134	1123555	And for a dollar, it's a great value.
1123635	1126318	Very 80s retro arcade vibe.
1126438	1129100	It feels familiar, yet it doesn't feel familiar.
1129340	1132123	Being able to move the helicopter and the bungee separately is pretty cool.
1133304	1139288	But, you know, disclaimer, full disclosure, it was kind of our idea, so of course we're going to like it.
1141230	1144753	And our voices and our logos and our cats are in it.
1145693	1147775	Otherwise, not a lot of new stuff this week.
1147855	1153640	Still playing World of Warcraft because the big expansion is next week, so I'm trying to gear up my characters, get ready to go to level 90.
1154500	1160345	I do plan on getting Torchlight 2, which came out today, for $20, which is kind of the...
1162026	1163667	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
1187439	1205156	So yeah, I definitely plan on getting Torchlight 2 And I'll be able to play that for like a day or two And then Mists of Pandaria is out And we all know Let's not even try to kid ourselves It's going to dominate my week But I hope to get LittleBigPlanet Vita somewhere in there too It's starting to be that season I'm going to fall behind on all these games I've got to play And it's all going to be Warcraft's fault
1205396	1206517	There's only one thing I want to get.
1207037	1210459	Never discussed how costly that is.
1210959	1212040	You want to talk about this on the air?
1212080	1212300	No.
1213141	1213921	Wait for future week.
1214161	1218684	There's a 99.1 billion chance that I'm not going to.
1219725	1220065	All right.
1220405	1222386	Well, maybe we'll get it out of you on a future episode.
1222947	1225228	Dan, what have you been playing this week?
1225268	1226289	You want to tell us about anything?
1227409	1227950	Borderlands 2.
1229371	1229991	How do you like it?
1231392	1231912	It's awesome.
1233053	1233313	Why?
1233333	1233393	Why?
1235014	1240205	Well, it's like Borderlands 1, which was awesome, but there's more of it.
1242009	1242670	Sounds good to me!
1243091	1243713	Yes it does.
1245464	1246205	DanTheMan, everybody.
1246325	1248546	Well, I think just, like, the characters are more developed in the game.
1248586	1252750	Like, they actually, I don't know, it seems like they have a lot more to do, you know.
1253090	1258574	I think that the new characters are, like, way more generic than the original characters, which I don't like.
1258594	1261617	Like, I looked at all four characters, which are basically the same four characters.
1261637	1263718	I know they're supposed to be, like, extra ones downloadable.
1264339	1268682	But I'm looking at the soldier, and instead of now being a black guy, it's, like, you're a generic sort of white guy.
1268722	1269102	And I'm like, okay.
1269122	1270904	It's channelpating, because, you know, you need more...
1271192	1272093	Well, yeah, exactly.
1272253	1280297	I'm like, well, I'm going to go ahead and look around and check out all the different customizable options, which is just mostly different colors and two or three different heads per character.
1280817	1282298	At the beginning, you unlock more stuff.
1282658	1287141	And so then I checked out the Hunter, who in the first game was kind of a cool character, and I started with him.
1287161	1291243	And now he just looks like a generic Raiden, Cyber Ninja sort of guy.
1291263	1292064	And I was like, okay.
1292104	1295606	And then the girl, who's still just a hot girl.
1296126	1299548	And the Berserker, who's now the Gunzerker, and he's like a midget.
1300188	1300869	Channeling Tatum
1318266	1318807	I'm digging it.
1319047	1326073	I'll almost definitely do the Assassin next because I immediately started playing with sniper rifles and pistols and I was just like, why did I choose a soldier?
1326194	1330918	And then I got my turret and I was like, this is why I chose a soldier because the turret is awesome.
1332748	1333809	You want your show back, Rob?
1334991	1354072	Doesn't matter, but I was going to say, in Borderlands 1, the only character I've played, because I'm about five years behind the rest of you, the only character I've played is the sexy lady, and I love being able to press the button and run like hell, so hopefully if the gal is kind of like a clone or whatever, then I hope I can run.
1354312	1354753	Thanks for watching!
1365771	1367873	Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
1367993	1369494	So, I don't know.
1369554	1378502	And then also, they had like an interview today or something that they said that they've built it where they can add more character classes later on DLC because they already announced the fifth one that they're going to do.
1378723	1381085	Right, it wasn't like the... Mechromancer?
1381105	1381886	The Mechromancer.
1382166	1384408	And then they've got more that they could possibly do later.
1384428	1387030	I mean, here's the thing that's weird about Gearbox.
1387250	1389352	Gearbox and Borderlands are fucking just awesome.
1389372	1390633	It's just like a great game.
1391514	1393175	And then they also did Duke Nukem Forever.
1393215	1394937	They didn't do Duke Nukem Forever.
1395437	1399120	All they did was take what was done, make it work, and put it out.
1399180	1401522	So you can't blame Gearbox for Duke Nukem Forever.
1402443	1403483	And it had to be released.
1403744	1405405	There's no way you couldn't have released that game.
1405945	1406766	It had to be done.
1406966	1408447	It had to be unleashed upon the world.
1408567	1410909	And if you want a copy, now you can get one brand new for $10.
1411169	1412831	They shouldn't have put their name on it then.
1412851	1414392	They should have just finished it.
1414452	1415553	They got money for it.
1416380	1416860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1438644	1441165	Alright, I think that's it for my gaming week.
1441185	1442885	Dan's going to be reading my stories tonight, by the way.
1443105	1443445	Is he?
1443885	1444406	Yeah, he is.
1444806	1445866	Are you guys fighting again?
1445906	1446686	It's always awkward.
1446786	1449007	Dan wouldn't give me the mic back until I snatched it from him.
1449047	1450547	He doesn't like sharing a mic with me.
1451147	1452488	I don't like sharing anything with you.
1453908	1456569	She was mad I bought a new video card.
1458996	1462638	I got a new video card and now she's mad because my computer's got better graphics than hers.
1462958	1464838	Oh, that is a reason to be upset, though.
1465279	1467480	I'm going to go ahead and put this out there.
1467780	1470241	It has way better graphics than hers.
1470641	1474102	I don't mean to get in the middle of arguments because that's not what I strive to do.
1474122	1475343	Mind-numbingly better graphics.
1475423	1479645	But if Alan did that to me, that would be grounds for sleeping on the couch.
1481479	1481819	and DarkSakura.com.
1507852	1530585	That would be Sunday the 30th, we'll be back, last day of the month, with episode 475 Alright, let's get into what's going on in video game news, and we'll go back to Tokyo Game Show, I guess Yes, we're going to talk about Sony and their little press conference that they had They announced a new redesigned PlayStation 3 It's flatter than ever before
1531158	1535384	It's like, yeah, it's got texture on top.
1536145	1536605	Cool.
1536846	1538047	So does it look as dusty?
1538508	1544396	No, actually, I like the little texture they have on it, but yeah, it's even thinner.
1544416	1547220	It's like someone ran over it with an SUV or something like that.
1547860	1549062	So, neat.
1549723	1562157	They're going to have a 250 gigabyte model, which is going to be coming out, I think, next week, actually, with the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3, and then also $30 towards Dust 5.14, in case you wanted to play that.
1562717	1587050	and then of course later on in the year at the end of October a 500 gigabyte model will launch for $299 and they'll include they're also going to have like an Assassin's Creed 3 bundle and stuff like that it's weird though in Europe and Hong Kong they also got a 12 gigabyte flash memory version and here's the strangest part about that is you can add a hard drive to that but when you add a hard drive to it the 12 gigabytes of flash memory stop working
1588548	1590129	It's probably just like a bypass or something.
1590149	1590969	It's a weird thing.
1591209	1592930	Yeah, it's really strange.
1592970	1594391	How do you load discs in the new one?
1595111	1595852	Same way as the old one.
1595972	1597272	Okay, so it's still like a tray?
1597493	1597753	Yeah.
1597793	1598433	Or like a slot?
1598773	1602795	Yeah, it makes sense because if they did a regular... I don't know.
1603376	1607878	Looking at the picture, it almost looked like one side slid over like it was a top loader.
1608918	1609759	And I was just like...
1611192	1612813	That's really bizarre.
1613053	1617036	But if it's a slot loader, I guess... Yeah, I don't even think they have any top-loading Blu-ray players.
1617077	1618377	I mean, that would have been strange.
1619138	1623561	Well, it would have been a way to price it down another... Because it's only, what, $30 less?
1624222	1629786	Well, yeah, it's $269, but I mean, still, that's pretty good for a 250 gigabyte system.
1629826	1631527	Isn't there a 600 gigabyte version?
1632328	1632648	Well, 500.
1633169	1633429	Okay, 500.
1633469	1635210	That's a lot of gigabytes.
1635671	1639954	I mean, I have a 500 gigabyte hard drive in mind, and I'll never fill that thing up.
1640174	1641555	That's like a week worth of saving stuff for Jamie.
1641575	1643757	Unless I have PlayStation Plus, in which case I could.
1644077	1646339	I have an 80 and I'm having a lot of issues.
1646439	1649281	I do have to cycle through stuff that I'm not really playing anymore.
1649301	1650182	I've got to delete it out.
1650602	1653585	DC Universe Online or whatever had to go.
1654145	1654826	I'm having problems.
1655326	1655726	And that's just 80.
1657187	1662291	So I could use a 500 gig or rig my PlayStation to use an external.
1662351	1662652	I don't know.
1662672	1663913	Because I have a terabyte hard drive.
1663953	1665494	I just use a supportable drive.
1665814	1669839	Also, another thing they announced is that they're going to be doing the PlayStation Plus service.
1669939	1671561	It's going to be coming to the Vita in November.
1671641	1672141	Yay!
1673463	1674364	Free stuff on the Vita.
1674604	1674984	Awesome.
1675285	1676466	Yes, that's pretty awesome.
1677547	1679589	Well, not really free if you pay for it.
1680310	1681712	Freer than Xbox Live.
1683141	1693484	I thought there already was PlayStation Mobile.
1693724	1694644	What's the difference?
1694664	1697885	I already thought there was because I know Flacco Jones has one of those phones, I think.
1697905	1698845	I've heard him talk about it before.
1698965	1704406	But I don't think that they've actually launched any of the store for it yet.
1704826	1706387	I think they have some games that you can buy.
1706407	1707787	There are at least three games on it.
1708086	1708446	Xperia Play
1723957	1724337	Really?
1725477	1725838	Really?
1726058	1728838	Well, the thing is, those phones didn't look that bad.
1728858	1729819	My wife is a snot.
1730159	1732399	Their tablets that they have, though, are really weird looking.
1732439	1739181	Like that one that looks like actually the new PlayStation 3 split in half and it's on a hinge or something like that.
1739201	1742902	Well, you don't want to make it look like a tablet or Apple will sue the shit out of you.
1742942	1747443	I was going to say, you know your stuff when it comes to phones because it's kind of like, you know, related to the job.
1747663	1748864	Yeah, that's what I got to do these days.
1748884	1750024	How do you feel about iPhone 5?
1750864	1752145	It's like a longer iPhone.
1755555	1756855	It's like somebody dipped it in water.
1757215	1760196	It's like a longer iPhone that's getting some Android features.
1760456	1761257	So there you go.
1761557	1762097	Good job.
1763597	1764417	I like the iPhone.
1764477	1765878	I'm actually a big fan of the iPhone.
1765898	1772159	I don't have one anymore but I miss it because I like the way that Apple makes all their stuff play together and I think it's a great product.
1772219	1773040	It's smooth and elegant.
1773140	1774020	How about the Windows 8 phones?
1774820	1776121	I haven't really got to play with them.
1776861	1781484	I mean, I played with one of, I guess it would be the Windows 7 phone, whatever the current generation of Windows phones are.
1781504	1782525	Yeah, they're cool.
1783185	1788608	I mean, there's nothing too bad to say about them, but you can't beat the support that Apple has gotten for the iPhone.
1788668	1789268	I was just curious.
1790489	1790809	No reason.
1791230	1792650	The iPhone long.
1792670	1793511	A little tweaking.
1794972	1798315	I want to replace my iPhone 4 and I'm no longer in contract.
1798375	1802419	So the logical choice is we have all the apps, get an iPhone 5, stupid.
1802799	1811107	But then I'm like, well, in my mind, I'm justified if I just don't get an iPhone 5 because I have the iPad.
1811667	1815611	Because clearly I've gone down on Apple several times in the past couple of years.
1816051	1833639	so I have an iPad the new iPad or whatever so technically my apps I have something to use them on so I could go Android or something else but I don't know I hear mixed things about it to give you a perspective on it I've had two Android phones now and the next time I come up for upgrade I'm probably getting another Apple
1834904	1837407	I'm thinking about Windows 8 phones though, holding out for those.
1838388	1840490	Although Windows 8 doesn't really excite me, I don't know.
1840650	1841892	That sounds like a bad idea.
1842873	1843073	What?
1843473	1845175	You want the mic?
1845235	1846397	Come over here and take it from me.
1848911	1849231	No.
1849651	1850532	She wants to comment.
1850552	1853593	Let the lady have the mic.
1853613	1853993	Give it!
1854093	1856755	See, I've got my wonderful... That's how mics get broken.
1857495	1860916	I have my wonderful Samsung Galaxy S2, and it works just fine.
1861437	1862397	Alan wants an S3.
1862997	1863938	So... Yes, ma'am.
1864478	1867900	First of all, from everyone I've heard who's tested Windows 8, it's shit.
1868980	1890875	and let me finish shut up after having used a Windows phone of my friends it's shit I can only think that if you put shit on shit it will get shittier I don't think that you can you have to put a seed of something in there to make the flowers grow and without that it's just shit
1893035	1900845	Windows 8 I'm a little less excited about but I thought maybe since it kind of makes your desktop look like a tablet I thought maybe the mobile version would kind of rock.
1900865	1903669	Tablet or ugly ass art display.
1904410	1908736	It's like I'm walking to a fucking hipster art gallery staring at the damn metro interface.
1909797	1910077	Alright.
1910357	1915619	Because they thought that neon, orange, pink, green, and blue was a fucking fantastic idea.
1915899	1918679	That'll be... That just won't burn my retinas.
1919499	1922060	Let's move on before we get too far off track.
1922080	1922880	Anything else for SOTY?
1923100	1924241	Yeah, other real quick stuff.
1925241	1927982	Of course, also, the Vita's getting some new colors.
1928642	1929462	Red and blue.
1929602	1933583	I'm not gonna say cosmic red and sapphire blue because it's just fucking... Just call it red.
1933883	1936144	Say PlayStation Vita Red.
1936924	1937744	PlayStation Vita Red.
1938124	1939465	Outro Music
1958391	1987960	it's Crimson's like especially an Alizarin Crimson that's on the cooler spectrum of red and mommy says I'm not supposed to eat red dye and some of the coolest news is made from bug butts some of the coolest news about the Vita Muramasa the Demon Blade is going to be coming on to the Vita at the end of March so that's pretty sweet it is true by the way yes red dye number 40 is made from beetles Muramasa the Demon Blade yeah beetles vanilla wears really sexy looking 2d action game
1989850	1991410	Alright, so that was it for Sony, yes?
1991571	1992271	That was it.
1992411	2000533	Let's talk about Microsoft for a minute over on this side of the pond because this did not come out of Tokyo Game Show because LOL Microsoft in Japan.
2000993	2005995	But this is pretty big news here for, you know, the US and Europe and places where people are actually buying Xbox 360s.
2006015	2010536	You know, they might do better in Japan if they had Sai, you know, pimping out the Xbox 360s.
2010576	2011596	Buy Xbox style!
2012556	2013097	Okay, forget it.
2014897	2021645	Apparently Microsoft has hired a CBS executive, as in the network that has my favorite TV show, Big Brother.
2023046	2023447	Oh, great.
2023567	2024808	That with the Kinect cameras.
2025048	2025709	I can't wait.
2027431	2028152	Thank you.
2029714	2034959	By a vote of three to one, Dan, you have been evicted from the Kinect house.
2035620	2035840	All right.
2038749	2042030	Anyhow, apparently a new exec has been hired from CBS.
2042130	2047312	It's Nancy Tellem, and she was with CBS as entertainment president before.
2047692	2049592	I don't know exactly what she did as CBS.
2049672	2051193	Oh, I mean, I know she was entertainment president.
2051253	2054054	I don't know what she did or did not bring to the network.
2054654	2056995	She brought wonderful puns with her last name.
2057195	2057815	You tell them!
2060031	2060952	That wasn't very funny
2082856	2085239	We're going to reach out to a very broad range of consumers.
2085279	2089604	When I first got to CBS, we looked at what the core audience was and built from there.
2089964	2092107	And that's just what I'm going to do again.
2093789	2103580	Interesting, because if I were to look at the core audience of the Xbox 360, I'd basically be looking at making Spike TV or G4 or something like that all over again.
2104497	2107279	Now CBS used to be the grandma network, right?
2107340	2112264	Murder She Wrote, Diagnosis Murder, Chicago Hope, all that stuff.
2112284	2114205	What is it about old people and murder shows?
2115747	2118629	Because old people are paranoid and they think everyone's out to murder them.
2118930	2120871	That's all old people can think about is death.
2120991	2127577	It's good that they have an old person advocate for them that's stopping the murderers so that the old people can feel safe.
2127777	2128938	Well, here's the thing.
2129358	2134300	Murder, she wrote, is exactly what the Xbox 360 needs to expand their audience.
2135720	2137001	That'd be a point-and-click game.
2138862	2140022	That actually would be a good game.
2140122	2140802	They already have that.
2140822	2141162	It's on PC.
2141182	2142783	Yeah, I was going to say, I think they have those games.
2142823	2143743	Nancy Drew games.
2144964	2147365	That shit sells like crazy.
2147525	2150166	It's kind of like the undiscussed thing in gaming.
2150266	2152527	No podcast I know of talks about it.
2152787	2153868	But those games sell.
2154128	2156769	There's nothing left for old people anymore since Andy Griffith died.
2158123	2161946	Well, there's other celebrities that, you know, old people love.
2161966	2162567	Wilford Brimley.
2162947	2166690	Okay, you explain to me how Dancing with the Stars is popular.
2166951	2168292	Who's watching Dancing with the Stars?
2168312	2170734	Stacey Keebler was on it, and they keep hoping she'll come back.
2171134	2172475	Who's watching Dancing with the Stars?
2172876	2173576	Somebody.
2173836	2174357	Old people.
2174757	2175598	I watch it on YouTube.
2175798	2178600	Old people and Jamie are watching Dancing with the Stars.
2179581	2183525	I watched three episodes of Dancing with the Stars when I was in the hospital.
2185790	2189893	I watched while Stacey Keebler was on because she has pretty epic legs.
2190653	2191554	I watched no episodes of that.
2191654	2192494	I was just wondering.
2193034	2196196	I just kept thinking that they were moving independently of her, that they were their own entity.
2196797	2198538	Because, I mean, seriously, no one has legs that long.
2199858	2201759	Anyhow, back to the article in question.
2202080	2203560	We don't know what's happening.
2203581	2206102	You know what the scam of that is?
2206162	2209544	Is that Stacey Keebler is like a professionally trained dancer.
2211604	2213525	So, why the fuck was she on Dancing with the Stars?
2213545	2217386	Well, it's just like that one guy from the Drew Carey show or whatever.
2217426	2217947	What's his name?
2218367	2220147	Drew Carey.
2221088	2227791	The year I watched, Christy Yamaguchi was on and it was clear that she was like a million light years... Wait a minute.
2228111	2230772	This show has just resorted to Dancing with the Stars talk.
2230892	2232553	I am drawing the fucking line here.
2237394	2238395	Back to the story.
2240117	2242458	We don't know exactly what type of content this is.
2242659	2245300	Is it short little pieces like Inside Xbox?
2245400	2245981	Rest in peace.
2246561	2249143	Is it longer pieces like TV shows?
2249323	2250984	Julie Chen hosted programming?
2251524	2251904	Who knows?
2251984	2257088	Is it a crappy reality show where you vie to become a product tester?
2257168	2260149	Let's hope because we haven't heard anything about a tester 4.
2260310	2263412	I didn't see online casting so I'm thinking the tester got cancelled.
2263492	2263932	I don't know.
2264505	2265646	And there was much rejoicing
2286724	2297532	You think one of them would have told us if they're doing a test or four or not, we haven't heard But anyway, as far as the Xbox programming goes, what do you think?
2297692	2301215	I mean, what do you think this means for the direction of Microsoft in the future and all that?
2301635	2309101	I mean, it's very clear Microsoft is trying to infiltrate the living room and maybe will broadcast programming all over your walls and who knows what
2309843	2317782	Right now, I can't get excited about anything because when they were talking about all their TV network partnerships and stuff like that, it just became like a bunch of apps.
2318003	2318945	I just, eh.
2320712	2321793	It's an interesting idea.
2321993	2324015	I just don't know if I trust that it'll work.
2324155	2326176	You know what was a great idea?
2326657	2327577	You know what was a great idea?
2327998	2328638	One versus 100.
2328718	2329519	One versus 100.
2329979	2331160	That was your TV network.
2331720	2332081	Wasn't it?
2332561	2333001	Oh, my God.
2333041	2334062	Dan and I agree on something.
2334102	2334362	Hold on.
2334382	2335083	I got to chat with Dan.
2335904	2337405	Wasn't one versus 100 awesome?
2337865	2338986	One versus 100 was great.
2339586	2340167	People were like...
2341721	2346603	Getting on Xbox Live and stuff just to play 1 vs. 100 Why did they get rid of 1 vs. 100?
2347464	2362811	Because Microsoft sucks Thank you, we agree on something Moving on More news, DarkSakura Well, I killed my husband five seconds ago No, not really I just punched him in the kidneys
2366573	2368574	So, there's been an announcement for PlayStation 3.
2368914	2371555	Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.
2371695	2372376	Oh my god!
2373136	2374276	Oh my god, Kingdom Hearts.
2375877	2378518	Famitsu reported that it will be out next year for PlayStation 3.
2379759	2384440	And I have no idea what's going to be special about it other than being HD.
2384660	2385701	Maybe I'll actually beat it.
2386901	2388502	It's Kingdom Hearts 1.
2389882	2390622	Was it 1?
2390682	2391743	The Chains of Memory.
2391763	2394763	Chains of Memory is in 358.
2396704	2397984	So I kind of want it.
2398044	2398885	Which is a terrible name.
2399225	2404026	Well, 358.2, I had heard they don't know if they're really going to port the game.
2404046	2404906	It has cutscenes.
2405106	2407427	It's just going to be the cutscenes in pretty HD.
2409395	2409996	I kind of want it.
2410036	2411799	Why don't they just put two in there, too?
2411819	2412040	Oh, yeah.
2423636	2426039	It's Sony and Disney.
2426700	2428361	How many things are they going to milk?
2428802	2429683	All the things.
2430003	2431385	One teat at a time.
2432366	2433187	All the things.
2434148	2434628	All of them.
2435029	2435569	The things?
2437111	2440074	It's Square Enix and, you know...
2441175	2443296	Well, we're going to get into some other stories.
2443316	2444876	They are milking their shit.
2445456	2450878	Yet we're saying all this, and I will sit right here and tell you, I am buying this shit the day it comes out.
2451118	2452119	Abso-fucking-lutely.
2452179	2453139	I just said I wanted it.
2453199	2454739	Sign me up for corporate whoredom.
2454980	2455240	Nope.
2456020	2456420	Not you?
2456620	2456940	Not me.
2457060	2457880	Sitting out?
2457900	2460961	Probably one of the people at the corporate teat of Squeenix.
2461222	2462122	I'll be, gimme.
2463122	2464002	No, you can't have it.
2464103	2465003	I also missed.
2465023	2465563	No, you can't have it.
2465803	2467784	I also missed Chains of Memories.
2467964	2472167	Before she can buy any more Kingdom Hearts games, she has to beat her copies of Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.
2472207	2475128	No, I have to, you have to fix my copy of 2.
2475349	2478190	I can, your copy of 2 is fine, you just need to restart.
2478490	2483113	I mean, it's not like you ignore what you left off anyway, you haven't played it in like, what, 10 years?
2483653	2486515	I have to go back and do the pirate thing again.
2486815	2487655	I was even further.
2487776	2492538	And then she made me stop playing because she was mad that I was going to beat the game first.
2492618	2493379	I said you could.
2493399	2493899	Get that out of my face.
2494380	2496081	The thing is, all I did was just customize.
2496221	2498002	The only guy that I upgraded was Sora, though.
2498982	2500223	I didn't upgrade Donald or Goofy.
2501303	2502024	Loki, how's your dinner?
2502804	2503724	Tasty.
2504024	2505485	Dan, go leave and get me something to eat.
2509427	2510527	I'll punch you in the kidney.
2512248	2513509	You'll pee blood for a year.
2516530	2517070	Next story.
2517731	2518031	Help.
2518891	2521652	If he's peeing blood for a year, that's seriously a clotting problem.
2524784	2525445	Give you a clot.
2525725	2526025	Anyways.
2528347	2528868	So Valve.
2529248	2530389	They've got some hardware coming.
2531130	2531390	Funny.
2531650	2532531	Valve hardware.
2533532	2534793	Valve is a piece of hardware.
2536795	2537395	Read the news.
2538756	2539137	So anyways.
2540458	2542099	Their hardware is going into the beta next year.
2542800	2543741	But what is their hardware?
2544061	2544982	Eh, who knows.
2545963	2546743	But it's going in.
2546983	2549726	They're having internal beta tests of their hardware.
2551314	2554996	I only hope that some sort of computer shaped like one of the portal turrets.
2555596	2556496	Because then I'd have to buy it.
2558817	2559318	I mean, come on.
2559938	2560458	That'd be awesome.
2560578	2561739	That would be kind of awesome, actually.
2561779	2563259	Did you see the video this week from Weta?
2563299	2563820	I want one.
2564240	2564740	Yeah, I did.
2565340	2565680	Yeah.
2565760	2565981	Yeah.
2567201	2569122	So... Just try to get near that baby.
2569342	2572584	Interesting that it's going to be next year for the Valve hardware, right?
2572824	2574564	And not before the holiday season?
2574584	2575345	It's going to be next year, yeah.
2575505	2577286	Is that because we're going to expect a big push...
2578326	2600378	although 2013 seems like a bad time to release a console if you're somebody new because you're going to have Sony and Microsoft enter the ring next year as far as we know they're both going to debut their consoles next year Sony could go another year I think Microsoft will launch next year Sony might go wait until 2014 it's hard to say if any of them are going to launch next year I mean
2602769	2606652	I think they could still be fine launching hardware because I don't think they're really going to be competing against consoles.
2606672	2610015	They're kind of like, hey, here's a cool way you can play some awesome PC games.
2610395	2612136	It's almost like an on-live type thing.
2614398	2620643	I just don't know how they're going to put out hardware because that's one thing with PC is that you have to constantly upgrade.
2620883	2627468	Even if they put out some nice hardware that runs stuff now, two years from now, it's not going to run stuff that well.
2628008	2630809	Which is too bad, because that's kind of the dilemma I'm in right now.
2630869	2632349	It's like, I use my laptop more.
2632849	2636830	Although my laptop has better specs than my PC.
2637110	2647632	My PC clocked faster and was my gaming machine for a while, but now it's old graphics cards and processor and stuff.
2647752	2650933	Can't keep up with it, and I've got to buy all new stuff to be able to do it.
2651213	2651833	That's the thing, though.
2651893	2652273	It's like...
2653473	2654614	Dead Rising Dead Rising
2678986	2681067	Oh yeah, so what's he working on now?
2681147	2705739	It's a game called Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z Yes, that Ninja Gaiden It's not part of the other Ninja Gaiden trilogy This is a new game The trailer was very weird It was talking about zombies and stuff And apparently, the new protagonist in this game The mission is to kill Ryu Hayabusa So that could be interesting So, yeah
2707302	2708423	The trailer looked pretty sweet.
2708523	2713065	It's got kind of like that cell shading graphics and, you know, pretty action-packed.
2713085	2715926	But it was very heavy on the cutscenes, so you couldn't really tell what the game looked like.
2715946	2717287	Every game's got to have zombies in it.
2717387	2717827	Of course.
2719208	2720569	Sell millions more copies.
2721609	2722910	Why can't they have sea creatures?
2723510	2728313	This is coming out from Tecmo, and they are partnering up with Spark, which is a Western developer.
2729133	2732295	So that will be coming, I'm assuming, next year at some point.
2733395	2733876	In the meantime...
2734901	2741643	Well, there's actually been a trademark renewal that Microsoft has done for Killer Instinct.
2743023	2748444	They've actually stated they've either renewed or refiled the trademark application.
2749484	2761007	But there was an interview not too long ago where one of their 3D modelers at Rare said that Microsoft wasn't interested in doing another fighting game, so they don't think it ever will be done.
2761047	2761487	But who knows?
2761547	2764228	Maybe we'll get... Let's just hope he was lying.
2764688	2765629	Maybe he just didn't know.
2766950	2769012	Maybe now the time is right.
2770213	2773255	I do think that a lot of it is wishful thinking.
2773295	2778099	It's probably just they have to renew the trademarks so somebody else doesn't come in and do a Killer Instinct game or whatever.
2778600	2780521	But it certainly does raise hope.
2781342	2783344	It would be a killer launch title for whatever the next Xbox is.
2783364	2787007	We were just watching playthroughs the other day and they have the worst necks.
2788536	2789938	And their skin looks like plastic.
2790058	2791661	But some of the best music.
2792282	2792963	I know, right?
2793784	2798391	Like, freaking, um... What's-Her-Face's music from KI2.
2798451	2800193	Orchid's music from KI2 was the best.
2800474	2802617	The only one I have here handy, real quick, is...
2806115	2815503	I remember when I lived in Alabama and Dan and I were just friends on the interwebs, how he recorded, waited until the game started up with Orchid's music to record it for me.
2816123	2818185	And didn't you say it took you like 30 minutes to do it?
2818846	2820527	Aww, that's kinda romantic.
2820547	2827933	I had a really hard time getting like the exact spot where it started because I don't know if there was a sound test or if I just wasn't smart enough to use it.
2828914	2830674	That's like really sweet in a way.
2831074	2831835	I'm a nice guy.
2831895	2832735	Look at you guys now.
2834195	2834375	Yep.
2834655	2835115	What happened?
2835175	2835715	Oh, you got married.
2835735	2836055	That's right.
2836075	2836555	You got married.
2837375	2837635	All right.
2840156	2841036	I love that bastard.
2841196	2844897	So I'm sure I speak for everybody when I say Killer Instinct 3, please.
2846657	2847137	I wish.
2847677	2848377	Release dates.
2848417	2852238	Let's travel around the world and talk about games that will actually be coming out sometime soon.
2852518	2852738	Yes.
2853138	2856859	This week we've got the Angry Birds Trilogy on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
2856899	2857099	Whoopee!
2861294	2861674	Wipeout 3 Wipeout 3
2882952	2886975	The Testament of Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2887915	2892738	Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2893578	2896660	Puzzler World 2012 3D on the 3DS.
2897861	2902063	Disney Princess My Fairytale Adventure on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.
2904305	2907086	Some game called World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria.
2907446	2909828	Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda, panda.
2909888	2910348	No one care.
2914571	2923076	Dead or Alive 5 on PS3 and 360, FIFA Soccer 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Vita, and 3DS.
2927938	2928218	That's it.
2928619	2933282	You forgot the most important title, although it's Download, so that's why you missed it.
2934003	2937245	Tokyo Jungle is out this next week on the PlayStation 3.
2937945	2938766	That's pretty awesome.
2939086	2950215	Honestly, I might have to not play World of Warcraft for a little bit to go play Tokyo Jungle because that game looks lulzy.
2950495	2951095	I can't wait.
2952937	2957660	If you don't know Tokyo Jungle, that's the game where basically you play like animals trying to survive.
2957680	2959361	It's like 28 days later with animals.
2960142	2962904	And they're killing other animals and you get to eat animals.
2963404	2965666	You get to be like a pug in good times.
2965986	2966446	A poodle.
2967827	2968868	But it's not Nintendogs.
2969248	2970789	It's Nintendogs if they killed each other.
2971330	2973071	It's like Nintendogs meets Hunger Games.
2973091	2974232	How about Nintendferrets?
2974532	2976293	That's the game that Nintendo should make.
2977814	2979115	Nintendogs to the death.
2982948	2984769	Oh, that's terrible, Dan.
2985309	2986409	Thank God he didn't have a mic.
2986429	2988330	He said Nintendog's Michael Vick edition.
2988370	2988690	That's terrible.
2988710	2991091	You say, thank God he didn't have a mic, and then you repeated it.
2991611	2992811	That means you're going to hell with him.
2992851	2994452	Yeah, now it's not funny anymore.
2995432	2996853	It's not funny when it's real.
2997993	2998953	All right, moving on to...
3001334	3022250	Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360 on September 27th Dead or Alive 5 Love Toray sweet version in regular and limited edition and Sleeping Dogs Hong Kong they're not dead they're just sleeping Sleeping Dogs Hong Kong Himitsu Keisatsu comes out on the Xbox 360 this week
3023391	3030096	on the PlayStation 3, also Dead or Alive 5, and Sleeping Dogs, that same game, as well as a new headset, if you're so inclined.
3030416	3035259	I think it's a third-party headset, but probably to support that official PlayStation 1 that just came out not that long ago.
3036020	3039142	On the Vita this week, DJ Max Technica Tune.
3039262	3041904	I think there might be a few people I know that are interested in that one.
3042284	3043064	That is coming out.
3044345	3045026	Dan Ball.
3045746	3046387	That's what it's called.
3046407	3048048	Dan Ball.
3048148	3048928	Dan's balls.
3054032	3057353	Nobunaga, Noyabo, Tendul with a power-up kit.
3058474	3060175	And it looks like these are Ys games.
3061156	3063917	Ys Selectica No Jukai.
3063957	3067519	It's a 25th anniversary limited edition of Ys, so that's pretty cool.
3068300	3073723	And some game I've never heard of called Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, also on the video this week.
3074844	3090284	Lastly, taking a look at the 3DS this week, Chibi Devil, Kokuga, 3DSLL, I'm thinking that's their version of the XL in pink and white, and Wagamama Fashion, Girls Mode, Yokobari Sengen.
3090985	3095107	The only thing that's not cool about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is it's $72.
3095828	3096068	Ouch.
3096308	3097309	I'm not importing that.
3097749	3097949	Ouch.
3098709	3102412	I'm trying to see what this fashion girls game is, but they don't actually show screenshots.
3102472	3107474	It's just the little cover art is this very badly drawn anime chick who has no neck.
3108615	3109456	She has a neck.
3110076	3111677	No, it's... She has a neck.
3111797	3112757	It's weird.
3113938	3118861	And she's carrying this little like coach purse and yeah, whatever.
3119528	3120409	I kind of want it.
3120569	3121069	No, you don't.
3121169	3121550	Yeah, I do.
3121730	3122010	All right.
3123551	3125593	Other release dates for other countries.
3125633	3126153	DarkSakura.
3126614	3128615	I'm going to start with the 20th because that's today.
3130737	3135161	We have Rayman Jungle Run on Android and iPad, but no one has an Android, so it's fine.
3136101	3137202	Torchlight 2 for PC.
3137443	3141226	On the 21st, F1 2012, One Piece Kaizoku Musou.
3142807	3144308	We have One Piece Pirate Warriors.
3144368	3145229	Is it the same game?
3147352	3147593	It is.
3148033	3149354	Yeah, then why did they list it twice?
3149374	3149894	They're stupid.
3149954	3151015	Oh, we did this last week.
3151575	3153276	Okay, Borderlands 2, blah.
3153776	3156118	On the 25th, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria.
3156178	3156758	Oh my god, pandas.
3157258	3159260	26th, Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.
3159840	3161401	27th, Bad Piggies.
3162401	3166124	And Half Minute Heroes Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for PC.
3167264	3169466	And 28th, Carrier Command Gaia Mission.
3169826	3171127	It doesn't say Gaia, it says Gaia.
3171147	3172928	FIFA 13 and Inazuma 11 Strikers.
3176641	3181282	DarkSakura is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey...
3202046	3202507	Asshole.
3203888	3204649	Play this game.
3205210	3209735	In this case it was, you didn't pick a classic game, pick one while I'm in the car.
3210195	3211176	That may have happened, yes.
3211977	3212938	So it's Vector Man.
3213919	3216843	Because Dan was watching a playthrough of this the other day.
3217684	3219325	And I was like, I remember that game.
3220046	3221308	It was full of green balls.
3224010	3226353	Dan says coolest title screen ever, which I agree.
3226633	3227253	Fairly cool.
3227714	3229175	Very early 90s.
3230736	3232678	So it's basically a run and gun kind of game.
3232718	3237002	It was done by Blue Sky Software and published for Sega for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.
3237622	3242407	Came out October 24th, 1995 in North America and on the 30th in Europe.
3243167	3244509	Sorry, November 30th in Europe.
3245289	3253913	It's been out on a bunch of other stuff, usually in various Genesis collections for other handheld systems and virtual console and whatnot.
3254594	3256815	But it was originally a Genesis game.
3257555	3259636	And it had a contest on the cover.
3260336	3261277	So, Vectorman.
3261737	3264198	Basically, it's got orbots in it, but they're not mighty.
3264838	3267300	And if anyone remembers that show, which I'm sure Dan does...
3269421	3277786	So you have to stop this particular Orbot who gets submerged with a nuclear missile and goes insane and becomes Warhead, which is the coolest name ever.
3279007	3285371	And then Vectorman has to go around and clean up some toxic crap and shoot some TVs and save the Earth.
3286532	3287833	Save the Earth, kill your TV.
3288593	3290455	Really, you do shoot TVs everywhere.
3290475	3290815	Yeah, you do.
3290875	3292196	I'm watching this playthrough right now.
3293297	3295479	I'll go ahead and talk about Vector Man 2, the sequel.
3296580	3302244	Basically, you have to clean up mutant insects and kill the Black Widow Queen.
3303445	3304126	Oh, shit!
3305527	3309030	Vector Man is another game that if you knew the storyline, it was actually a way better game.
3309710	3315375	It was sort of like Wall-E, where the Earth was rendered uninhabitable thousands of years in the future.
3315936	3321824	And there was this really awesome robot, not Vectorman, who was sent to clean it up.
3322165	3326591	But they accidentally attached a nuclear missile to his head and he became Warhead.
3327091	3329815	And then Vectorman, and he turned all the robots on Earth evil.
3330216	3332439	And when the humans came back, he was going to whoop that ass.
3333416	3341439	Now Vector Man was like driving his barge of garbage to the sun and he came back and decided, man, I gotta take these guys out.
3341559	3343920	And then you run around shooting shit in a fairly generic shooter.
3344121	3345281	It had really good graphics.
3346141	3348162	Vector Man was an awesome game for the Genesis.
3348602	3350423	Jamie doesn't know shit about it.
3350523	3351744	She picked it at random.
3351784	3353044	WALL-E was such a good movie though.
3354885	3355465	Don't do what?
3356826	3357546	This is what I do.
3357746	3359467	Moving on with the classic game of the week.
3362660	3371925	So, as I said, it had a play-to-win contest that went with it, where you could win $25,000 or $10,000 or a Sega Saturn.
3372825	3374786	So, yay.
3376087	3377928	It was pretty much a success.
3378488	3385612	It had great level design, great graphics, as my wonderful, tactful spouse has said.
3386592	3390214	And it won EGM's Best Sega Mega Drive Game of 1995.
3391855	3394618	There was a third game in the works and it was cancelled in 2003.
3395478	3396679	It was going to be on the PlayStation.
3397740	3400963	The character actually looked very similar to Master Chief.
3402725	3403826	He kind of does, actually.
3404466	3405987	Well, for Vector Man 3.
3406248	3406688	Oh, I see.
3407108	3409511	I can see, though, where it could come from this guy.
3410091	3410391	Outro Music
3427148	3427368	Cool.
3427588	3428188	Alright, there it is.
3428569	3433691	Your classic game of the week, Vectorman on the Sega Genesis, Mega Drive, whatever you want to call it.
3434211	3434951	There you go.
3435672	3436472	No break tonight.
3436512	3442354	We're going right through and we'll kick off with some rapid fire news up next.
3442815	3443075	Loki.
3443735	3448778	All right, so Humble Indie Bundle 6 is available now, and you can check it out.
3449159	3452221	This time around, they've got some pretty cool games.
3452241	3453201	I actually picked it up already.
3453962	3467191	And in it, let's see, Dust Force, which you can unlock if you pay more than the average, Rashard, Shatter, Spaz, Torchlight, Vessel, and at least that's it right now.
3467271	3467611	Who knows?
3467971	3472374	They probably will add more stuff, probably the previous pack at some point soon.
3475777	3476457	Still a great deal.
3476517	3479960	Torchlight's a great game if you somehow still have not played it.
3480340	3482842	I'm not as familiar with the other games in the bundle, I don't think.
3483262	3484283	Let me look again at the list.
3485284	3489347	But I think I've bought all but one of these, so I'll probably get this one too.
3490188	3491749	It's a great, great thing.
3491949	3494290	Right now the average is $5.79.
3495070	3504534	And let's be honest, if you don't want to pick up Dust Force and you want to kind of a dick about it, you can pay a penny and still get five games.
3505174	3506975	Give the money to charity if you must.
3508196	3509856	You should still pay at least five bucks.
3510296	3511337	These are all really good games.
3511897	3512617	So that's pretty cool.
3513358	3514238	And the soundtracks too.
3515438	3520340	That's part of the reason why I want to get it, even though I already own Torchlight, just to get the soundtracks.
3523682	3550855	so they've got that and then of course also there's there's a new game that's on IOS from Square Enix and Square Enix likes to charge a lot for their games now this one isn't that expensive it's $6.99 the game's called Demon's Score and it's a rhythm action game from Anise which you may remember Elite Beat Agents anyways so it's kind of a rhythm music game
3552416	3580411	but then you can also unlock like different characters in it and when you unlock those characters you have to pay $3 to actually play as those characters and apparently there's about oh I don't know $40 worth of DLC in this game so to actually play as those other characters it would cost you another $40 on an IS game I'm sorry $30 worth of extra content
3581211	3581812	Funk that.
3593861	3597162	We just had a Square Enix music game too, which is kind of weird, the theatrism.
3597282	3608584	I know this is different because it's not even the same design or anything, but it's just weird that we have these different music games with an abundance of DLC, kind of almost back to back.
3608644	3612244	And I guess each character has a different style of music.
3612364	3621546	So you might have one that has funk, one that's classical or looks like Latin and I don't know.
3624011	3631477	Well, speaking of milking it for all it's worth, I can't believe this collection's coming again, but I do love my classic game collections.
3631837	3634979	Might have to check out Midway Arcade Origins.
3635539	3638702	It is a collection coming out for the Xbox and the PlayStation 3.
3639122	3639502	More than 30...
3640983	3643624	Midway titles from the golden age of arcades.
3643664	3648847	You can expect things like Gauntlet, Joust, Defender, Rampage, Spy Hunter.
3648907	3652028	I think every single one of those games was on the previous collection.
3652048	3652928	Marble Madness.
3652968	3655189	Marble Madness is in this collection though.
3655769	3658130	I don't think that was in any of the previous ones.
3658190	3658851	I'm surprised.
3658871	3659151	Was it?
3659611	3659892	Yes.
3660532	3660913	Damn it.
3661434	3662916	It's all re-releases.
3662976	3665379	It's just a new factor for them.
3665399	3670626	I'm surprised that they haven't done an HD remake of some of these arcades.
3671027	3675313	Not necessarily an HD remake, but just redo the graphics in HD for Marvel Madness.
3675453	3683535	I mean, like, for a short time, there was, like, Joust and Robotron, and some of them were the early, early Xbox Arcade releases.
3683575	3686096	Remember when Xbox Arcade was mostly just re-releases of old shit?
3686576	3689137	And I think Gauntlet was one of them, too, really early on.
3689157	3690077	Yeah, I bought that.
3690157	3692298	Yeah, a lot of these, and they're not available anymore.
3693158	3704761	I want to say some of them had at least high-definition smoothing and some of the cheap and easy effects on it, but not really a true HD remake.
3705842	3714464	Well, there will be no online multiplayer for this, sadly, which what a great way to add value to a collection that a lot of people probably already have on their stinking iPhones.
3715625	3727393	There are achievements, trophies, leaderboards, whoopee If you're a true achievement or trophy whore, then there you go It is coming out from Backbone Didn't they do those early Xbox releases too?
3727413	3737801	I think they did $30 in November Was Backbone the one that did... Was it the other arcade thing that they had?
3740200	3744421	They did Street Fighter 2 puzzle turbo thing that was really good.
3744441	3748802	Who did the one that was like Wolf of the Battlefield?
3748882	3749822	No, no, not even that.
3749902	3757623	It was like... Remember the thing that they actually had on Xbox where you get to make your own arcade collections and stuff like that?
3757663	3758483	Oh, Game Room!
3758603	3759183	Yeah, Game Room.
3759203	3760304	No, Backbone did not do Game Room.
3760344	3761304	That developer closed.
3761364	3763504	It was somebody out of Australia, I think.
3763824	3766405	Remember, they shut down and then Game Room just suddenly stopped updating.
3767265	3768265	That was really unfortunate.
3768325	3768605	God...
3770064	3771605	Oh, it's been at least... Another misstep.
3771645	3776528	It's been a good six months since I've ranted about Game Room and how that should have been so much better than it was.
3777528	3777848	Anyway.
3778028	3778709	Who was that again?
3778749	3780270	Blah, blah, blah.
3780290	3786393	No, Backbone pretty much just does arcade translations, classic collections, and new versions of old games.
3786413	3787713	They did Wolf of the Battlefield.
3787773	3795678	They did whatever the 1940 whatever series game that they did straight for the Xbox and PS3, like the remake.
3797278	3798179	That's just kind of what they do.
3798459	3800160	Oh, I am being corrected by chat.
3800280	3803481	The perks of having a live chat room is that they correct you when you're wrong.
3804521	3808342	Dark Tetsuya says, actually, the Midway ones were Digital Eclipse.
3809302	3809863	So I was wrong.
3809903	3810703	It was not Backbone.
3810763	3811043	Sorry.
3812283	3816085	Alpha Cananogram does state, though, Backbone did do Yaris.
3818905	3823667	It's not exactly one to get really excited about, just saying.
3823927	3826848	It's the best free game based on a cheap Toyota ever made.
3827574	3827935	Thank you.
3828075	3829358	Bobby Blackwolf to the rescue.
3829418	3830640	Chrome Studios is the name.
3830700	3831602	I knew it was K something.
3832003	3833606	Chrome Studios did Game Room.
3833987	3835290	And Shadow Next Gen agrees.
3835350	3837775	Game Room, such a missed opportunity by Microsoft.
3839341	3843402	Because, man, I desperately wanted to play Intellivision games on my 360 and pay for it.
3843542	3847743	Now, I want to know, why is Dartetsuya talking about online Super Off-Road?
3848084	3850364	He says, I'm disappointed this collection doesn't have online.
3850404	3852305	I would have loved online Super Off-Road.
3852985	3856066	Super Off-Road wasn't in the list, but there is a trailer.
3856766	3861687	So now I feel the need to watch this trailer immediately just to see if it has Super Off-Road in it.
3861767	3864668	Because I don't remember Super Off-Road being in the...
3867025	3868566	I didn't realize that was a Midway game.
3868866	3869406	It's not.
3869587	3871348	I mean, a lot of these aren't Midway games.
3871768	3873529	Now it's time to talk some classic games.
3874390	3876111	A lot of these are like Atari games, right?
3876131	3881574	But Midway became the owner of Atari after Namco, actually, strangely enough.
3882314	3885877	And Leland actually was the company that released Super Off-Road.
3887037	3891220	And somehow they ended up with the rights to the Leland games as well.
3892608	3895711	I'm looking at this trailer and I'm definitely seeing some Spy Hunter and some Defender.
3895771	3897312	I'm not seeing Offroad, though.
3898113	3899354	Super Offroad would be a good one.
3899394	3900495	I don't even think it had a...
3902116	3903997	I don't think it's had an Xbox Live release.
3904618	3908480	And can you imagine, though, if that was on this collection and you can't play online?
3908560	3912343	Like, damn, talk about a game from my childhood I'd like to be able to play online.
3912363	3913984	Well, it's because they're not doing any new code.
3914044	3918767	It's just, you know, quick and dirty ROM ports.
3919128	3920589	Build an emulator, dump ROM.
3920609	3922550	Right, build an emulator, dump ROM, you know.
3924211	3929174	DarkTetsuya says it was in Midway Treasures 3 and that was the one with all the racing games.
3930094	3930594	Let me look.
3930674	3931355	I think I have it.
3931495	3932676	I don't know if Super Off-Road.
3932696	3933416	Yeah, I think it was.
3933476	3935197	I think it and the Track Pack both were.
3935817	3937098	I know it was Hydra Thunder.
3937258	3939840	I know it's the later Off-Road game like Off-Road Thunder.
3940540	3941441	Rush 2049 Arcade Rush 2
3959580	3960321	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3983985	3984585	Thank you for watching!
3999912	4000652	Just awesome.
4001173	4002813	I was disappointed to have Atari Party this year.
4002994	4004334	I totally forgot.
4004514	4008176	I totally forgot about Super Off-Road being in Midway Arcade Treasure 3.
4008216	4010257	I wonder if that's one of the backwards compatible games I can play on 360.
4011118	4012538	If so, no?
4013659	4014379	Curse you!
4019443	4024604	Except I don't have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3, so I just got... Yeah, exactly.
4024624	4024944	That sucks.
4024985	4026425	I guess I'll just have to play it on mine.
4026465	4028565	Now I see why they're re-releasing it all over again.
4028585	4030306	Rob, do you want to borrow our Xbox?
4030566	4030626	No.
4030886	4033907	I have an... Dan vetoed that real quick.
4034227	4035847	I have an old Xbox somewhere.
4035867	4038068	I just can't guarantee if it'll work or not.
4040074	4040634	LeSci.
4041795	4042055	All right.
4042095	4043855	Anyhow, that was supposed to be rapid fire news.
4043935	4044135	Oops.
4045856	4047416	Animal Crossing Jump Out.
4047476	4051577	Well, this ought to be quick because we're going to talk about what's new in Animal Crossing Jump Out.
4051637	4052698	Crickets, crickets, crickets.
4053458	4055519	No, there will be five new characters.
4056459	4058179	Frap or Frappé.
4058479	4062100	I like to use the E. Frappé, who will be a lively penguin.
4063041	4064181	A penguin rock penguin.
4064341	4064561	I know.
4064601	4065661	It's a brisk hamster.
4065681	4066962	I thought they already had Frappé.
4068363	4073267	Takoya, a carefree octopus, Brittany, who's a mature pig.
4073887	4075709	Wait, that would be Takoya.
4076970	4078091	Taco is octopus.
4078972	4081254	And Anthony, who is a smug horse.
4082755	4086419	Apparently smug is a new personality you will see throughout the game.
4086739	4089882	So does he go around going, no sir, I do not like it.
4092003	4092864	He goes around going, nay.
4092964	4096025	Yeah, I was just going to say, he goes around going, nay.
4098166	4101969	There is also, Loki, this could be, here is something new.
4102009	4103549	You've been asking, you've been dying.
4103890	4106091	What is going to be new in the new Animal Crossing game?
4106131	4106751	So here it is.
4106791	4107572	I'm waiting for it.
4107632	4108272	Something new.
4108292	4108652	You ready?
4109693	4117317	There is going to be a special tree that you plant when you become mayor, and it will grow as your city grows.
4120134	4120694	Bravo.
4122496	4123016	Bravo.
4123477	4124257	Pre-order it.
4125298	4129041	Oh, I'm going out tomorrow and buying a 3DS just for... No.
4129421	4129901	You know what?
4131142	4133704	I would do that just to start my toilet collection again.
4134365	4138388	Well, DarkSakura, you might appreciate this because it's kind of in your name.
4138708	4141670	There will be new flowers in the game and cherry blossoms are coming back.
4141710	4142351	Okay, we're getting it.
4143331	4143692	Hold on.
4145073	4146794	They got to put NES games back in it.
4147924	4152527	You can, I guess, apparently put the Reset Management Center anywhere you want.
4152567	4155229	I didn't realize Resetti got his own building now so he can yell at you.
4155289	4155789	Oh, okay.
4155869	4156930	I have to digress, Rob.
4157110	4157310	What?
4158291	4158851	Uncracked.
4159712	4167237	They did the what if minor characters in games got their own game and one of them was Mr. Resetti's game and the thing was like full of text.
4167998	4168698	It was great.
4168838	4172261	Mr. Resetti is one of the most underappreciated video game characters ever.
4172561	4173381	He's amazing.
4173661	4173922	Yeah.
4174942	4178744	There's also Brewster's Coffee Shop, so you can have a not-Starbucks in your town.
4178764	4179144	That was it.
4179164	4179864	It was Brewster.
4179904	4180805	That's who you're thinking of.
4180865	4183466	Two types of police stations that you can have.
4183686	4187948	Mr. Rossetti needs to be in the next Mario Kart game as one of the attacks.
4188048	4191149	Instead of the squid ink and stuff like that, it's just Mr. Rossetti.
4191950	4194811	He just blocks you with nothing but text for five seconds.
4195131	4196152	Is he in Smash Bros.?
4196992	4200554	Wasn't it a trophy or something, probably?
4200594	4201514	I think there was a trophy.
4201594	4203535	It was Animal Crossing level, I thought.
4205099	4206741	I can't remember if Resetti was in it or not.
4206761	4207341	I think he was.
4207961	4212545	Anyway, let's move on with more rapid fire news with DarkSakura.
4214732	4216073	Stuff happened and things happened.
4216213	4225698	No, Knights HD is going to have Christmas nights and it will be on PlayStation Network on October 2nd and on Xbox Live October 5th.
4225858	4226259	Guess what?
4226379	4230461	I already have it except the HD looks super fucking pretty and I want it.
4231001	4231282	It'll be $10.
4232022	4232983	It does have Christmas nights.
4233503	4235844	Yeah, but I've got it on the Saturn.
4237125	4237725	Shut up!
4237866	4238866	We have it on the Saturn.
4238906	4240007	You can sit there and shut up.
4241587	4243888	Yeah, I got the Japanese one after.
4244148	4244568	Whatever.
4244968	4253290	On this show before, you've talked about it's kind of a tradition for you to break out the Saturn every Christmas and play Christmas Nights.
4253750	4257131	Is there any chance you'd replace it with HD, or is that done?
4257171	4257751	Hell no!
4260132	4263713	It's a tradition for her to have me break out the Saturn and play Christmas Nights.
4266914	4269315	You know what would be great about having it in HD, though?
4270015	4270355	What's that?
4272259	4276160	The fact that every year I go through, I unlock maybe half the presents.
4276200	4277561	I know I had them all unlocked at once.
4278121	4285684	But since the Saturn's internal memory dies in like, oh, 12 seconds, even with a brand new battery, every year I have to unlock all the presents again.
4286424	4288285	So it'd be nice just to have them all unlocked.
4290345	4290726	All right.
4291126	4294567	But with no Saturn analog controller, it just ain't gonna play right.
4297259	4297619	Rob.
4298040	4299781	Alright, let's... Yeah, Rob.
4300342	4301102	Alright, Rob.
4301302	4301763	Rob!
4302964	4304125	Rob, more coffee.
4305426	4308949	No, neither one of you gets coffee.
4308989	4311611	BioWare has... Dan, shut up.
4312331	4313152	Just kidding, I don't have weed.
4313372	4313853	Don't do drugs.
4313913	4315134	We need to go get some food.
4315914	4317896	Let's do this show faster so we can go get dinner.
4318696	4319437	Free Fiona.
4319737	4322620	Okay, BioWare's a Dragon Age 3 Inquisition, the end.
4323803	4326546	Nobody expects the Dragon Age Inquisition.
4327147	4330771	You've been waiting like an hour and a half to make that joke.
4330852	4331713	Seriously, tell him.
4332353	4334436	You've been waiting an hour and a half to make that joke, haven't you?
4334536	4336118	Ever since I posted that story in the showroom.
4338373	4341256	Nobody expects this Spanish Inquisition Okay, close enough
4361089	4365332	There's other Bioware news too that's not a part of that story, and it was kind of something big that happened this week.
4365552	4368914	I don't know if you're aware, but the doctors that founded Bioware left.
4369134	4369775	Yeah, I know.
4370055	4370655	Hello, well, bye.
4370715	4373337	Dan told me, and I'm like, good for them.
4373798	4377640	Well, it's been kind of a crappy couple years for Bioware.
4377740	4380122	They're taking a lot of shit about Mass Effect 3 ending.
4380402	4383244	They're pissed off about all you people bitching about Mass Effect 3's ending.
4383284	4384184	Wait, don't point at us.
4384525	4385085	Get over it.
4385645	4386466	Oh, no, Jamie did.
4386806	4387387	Stop it.
4388107	4389508	I heard her bitching about it the other day.
4390749	4394711	Star Wars The Old Republic didn't quite meet expectations.
4395252	4398033	Dragon Age 2 was no Dragon Age 1.
4399014	4404037	So, I mean, that's like three punches in the gut in a quick span.
4404958	4407499	That's what happens when VA sticks their nose into a good thing.
4408180	4408680	That's very true.
4408740	4411742	One of them's leaving to make beer, so, I mean, that's good, right?
4412462	4413503	We can have Bioware beer.
4415751	4416872	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4440052	4444976	Also confirmed because people are paranoid because these guys are leaving.
4445277	4452703	They had to put it out on the table and they did confirm another Mass Effect game is in development.
4453484	4454905	Now they didn't say it's Mass Effect 4.
4455265	4455946	That's all they said.
4456386	4458548	It better be the Tale of Garrus.
4458768	4460790	Another full Mass Effect game is in development.
4460850	4463933	Could be a prequel, could be a new trilogy, could be anything.
4463993	4467556	It could be like the new iPad where it's just the new Mass Effect.
4468340	4470301	It'd be Silent Scope featuring Garrus.
4472162	4481648	Also, the same team led by Casey Hudson working on a new IP that's supposed to be pushing the envelopes with game design.
4481708	4484549	Strong hints that it's for an unannounced console.
4485610	4488712	It's gonna be a lot of hardcore gay sex in that one.
4490093	4491133	We'll get cocked this time.
4491153	4491774	One can hope!
4493955	4494775	That's right.
4495076	4496476	No, cocks and twats everywhere.
4497952	4499512	Pushing the pornography envelope.
4499753	4501433	That's how Bioware is going to sell some games.
4501793	4503133	Heck yeah.
4504354	4506434	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, you know what's funny?
4507495	4508195	Cox and Twats?
4508435	4509555	No, not Cox and Twats.
4510175	4517358	Is that if you look at the date of their retirement announcement, it's almost exactly five years after the EA purchase of Bioware.
4518418	4522339	One has to wonder if that was in the contract that their jobs would be protected for five years.
4524904	4528286	No one can hear you when you are not talking on the microphone, Dan.
4530388	4532790	It's probably just that they had to stay with the company for five years.
4533110	4534691	They couldn't be like, thanks for the money.
4535031	4535391	Bye.
4536232	4538534	I would leave WoW for Mass Effect MMO just saying.
4541075	4545038	Shadow Next Gen says, I heard the next Mass Effect game probably won't include Shepard.
4545058	4545759	Well, duh.
4546339	4549622	Well, let me just put it this way.
4549642	4550222	What?
4550839	4554401	When you're writing fiction, you can do anything you want.
4556022	4557463	Especially when it's sci-fi.
4558143	4560825	Look at the shit they got away with on Star Trek for years.
4561145	4563646	Look at the shit they get away with in comics.
4563746	4565227	How many times has Superman died?
4565587	4566948	How many times has Batman died?
4567549	4570090	Isn't Captain America president now?
4571831	4574673	How many more endings can they get Buzz Aldrin to narrate?
4576949	4577429	Yeah, I know.
4577829	4580830	BlackWolf in the chat says SWTOR equals Mass Effect MMO.
4580890	4581150	No.
4581450	4586492	Well, I think that's kind of why a Mass Effect MMO isn't exactly at the top of anybody's wish list right now.
4586552	4587532	Mass Effect would sell better.
4587552	4589293	But SWTOR wasn't bad.
4589473	4590033	That's the thing.
4590073	4594975	It just wasn't strong enough to take down a game that it was emulating.
4595355	4596935	The fandom wasn't enough.
4596975	4605258	It just needs to go the Macross 2, Macross 7 route where it's just all about music and their weapon is music and they can get Psy to be the leader of...
4606698	4610421	Side to be the leader of whatever rebellion or whatever.
4610722	4612143	Just have them dancing.
4612163	4621931	I think the Old Republic would have been a lot better if they hadn't just put it out of the tail end of just running Star Wars into the ground as hard as they could.
4622771	4623052	True.
4623452	4625413	Not BioWare's fault.
4625474	4626574	No, not BioWare's fault at all.
4627175	4634701	The game design is apparently really solid, but the Star Wars franchise has lost a lot of its shine.
4637108	4644295	The Star Wars franchise hasn't had shine since they changed the first one to Episode IV.
4646619	4647299	Moving on.
4647739	4649480	Now I was going to say at least the third movie.
4649580	4650280	Anyway, forget it.
4650740	4651440	Moving on.
4652640	4659442	Now that we're done with rapid fire news, 30 minutes later, no Fugle question of the week this week because I forgot to ask one.
4660542	4661662	We'll bring one back next week.
4662102	4666543	But you should join our Facebook and Google Plus communities in anticipation.
4667664	4669544	And so that you have something to do on Google Plus.
4671027	4672428	Actually, Hangouts are still cool.
4672588	4673169	I'm just saying.
4673869	4677833	Google Plus is kind of underappreciated, but I'll save that tangent for another week.
4678593	4680295	Let's get back into some long-form news.
4680375	4680915	Ha ha ha.
4680995	4681335	Loki.
4681796	4689282	So, Zynga has bought a bit lucky, and they're a developer of such wonderful games called Lucky Train and Lucky Space.
4689942	4690503	Lucky Charms?
4690983	4691824	No Lucky Charms.
4692344	4693425	Perhaps that could be a sequel.
4693906	4695827	And also a game called Solstice Arena.
4697709	4699350	This, of course, begs the question.
4699790	4700411	So, Zynga...
4701051	4702152	Are you feeling lucky?
4703592	4703913	Maybe.
4704133	4707655	And they paid $20 million for the company.
4708335	4718600	And apparently, also, in unrelated news, the executive at, was it, OMG Pop has left.
4720321	4723923	Was it Wilson Kriegel, the former chief revenue officer.
4724383	4728145	Eh, revenue officer, that's just like, you know, the guy that handles money.
4728675	4734596	Oh, you know, the guy that cut that deal where the company sold for, what, $100 million or however much it went for?
4734616	4735897	That crazy-ass amount?
4735917	4736197	He's retiring.
4737637	4738777	Fuck it, I would too.
4740038	4744899	If I could sell Orange Lounge Radio for $100 million, five bitches have fun.
4746479	4747759	You'd be splitting that three ways.
4747779	4748780	I'm going to Tahiti.
4749780	4750500	I'd buy you Pinkberry.
4756035	4758457	To quote my husband, it better be a Pinkberry franchise.
4758817	4759197	We'll see.
4759858	4760958	Depends what flavors you carry.
4761319	4763680	Alright, moving on.
4764440	4765721	For you, Rob, I'll peach.
4766642	4771765	You know the funny thing is that that story went quicker than anything in Rapid Fire News because it was a Zynga story.
4773053	4774434	and Nolan Kerr.
4775716	4777417	Lesson learned for producing future shows.
4777477	4777737	All right.
4778798	4780400	Dragon Quest X. Listen up.
4780440	4781841	I know some people are excited about this.
4782241	4786786	Dragon Quest X, even though it's an MMO, which might turn some people off, but I don't know.
4786826	4787786	I'm curious about it.
4788167	4791250	Well, Dragon Quest X, some more details of Tokyo Game Show.
4791630	4795714	You can play the entire game on the Wii U game pad if you want.
4797315	4809225	I don't think that's too surprising either because they've already talked about that there will be games that you can kind of play on the Wii U gamepad while people are watching whatever on TV.
4809605	4813969	Like you can kind of do that dual thing that was part of the point of having the gamepad.
4814490	4822176	But the fact that this is an MMO makes it very interesting because people tend to get drawn to MMOs a little more.
4822537	4823798	Imagine if it was Warcraft.
4824278	4828101	You can sit on the couch and watch American Idol and play World of Warcraft at the same time.
4828962	4830723	Of course, a lot of people kind of already do that with two monitors.
4830743	4832344	I don't see how this is even a big deal.
4833145	4835166	For some people, we know just put a TV on their wall.
4835407	4838909	Because it's basically just like playing it on a small monitor.
4839570	4842812	Well, they also talk about that you can switch between the two.
4842872	4848597	You can go between the TV screen and the gamepad in the menu under options smoothly.
4850305	4852468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4866243	4870226	Well, then I guess we're done with that story.
4870866	4881713	Basically, that just tells me that they really didn't need the whole Wii at all to do this Dragon Quest X because it doesn't utilize anything other than a standard control set.
4882534	4882874	Cool.
4884255	4885055	But it's Dragon Quest.
4886036	4886736	Yeah, cool.
4887857	4888818	Moving on to the mailbag!
4890453	4894098	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com What?
4894318	4896962	You still have Alan's name on it.
4897943	4900967	Oh my god, I made a mistake from copy pasting last week.
4901047	4901889	I am not that tall.
4902469	4904893	Maybe you have a scarlet letter A for another reason.
4906798	4912061	You're saying awesome, but okay, if you had to go there.
4912641	4918344	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send Dark Sakura letters.
4918944	4919904	Whatever letter you want.
4920104	4921065	Send me lots of Qs.
4921345	4924186	This one starts with an A. It's from AJ Twist.
4924527	4925047	Ba-bow!
4927333	4928933	Is that actually his name, AJ Twist?
4929073	4929594	Babow?
4929954	4930134	No.
4930634	4931874	I was emphasizing.
4931954	4932914	You added flair.
4933375	4934035	Yeah.
4934115	4935175	This is my flair.
4936855	4938516	Good day, good hosts of OLR.
4938576	4938996	Howdy.
4940716	4941817	Stop it.
4941897	4942137	What?
4942177	4944237	I'm not allowed to respond to the greeting?
4944597	4944797	What?
4944937	4948018	If you say hi to me, I just have to look at you?
4948298	4948939	Yeah, what?
4950499	4950679	Girl.
4952389	4952890	Game On!
4952910	4954471	The Unauthorized History of Video Games
4970749	4970789	Me.
4970809	4970849	Me.
4993001	4998931	First thing you should do about that documentary, which I've also watched, is just forget everything that you saw in it.
4999371	5001675	Because it's really, really, really bad.
5003368	5007191	I will tell you everything you need to know about the video game crash without having to watch a documentary.
5007211	5009613	Although I have not seen said documentary so I have no opinion on it.
5009673	5017599	However, imagine that you have a system like the Atari 2600 and imagine they've created Yaris for the Atari 2600.
5018260	5026106	Imagine that 30 companies created Yaris for the Atari 2600 and they're charging you $60 a copy for Yaris.
5026786	5031710	This marketplace was flooded with bullshit games like this and that's what caused the crash.
5032911	5047055	It'd be like if all of a sudden that the Apple store or whatever, the App Store was selling physical copies of those knockoff games for $60 at retail and they were all clogging the shelves at Walmart or something like that.
5047675	5049136	That would be the video game crash.
5049636	5053097	Don't forget that there were like seven or eight competing consoles.
5053817	5054578	That's true, too.
5054718	5055719	And PC computing.
5055739	5057842	I mean, you had Coleco.
5057862	5063668	That was actually kind of pre-PC being even a factor.
5063728	5067653	Okay, personal computer, Commodore, TI-99, Apple II.
5067753	5069655	Motherfucker, do you even know who you are stepping to?
5070376	5072799	I will whoop that ass if you want to talk about this.
5074000	5075561	That stuff all really rose up.
5076202	5077863	I mean, it did play a part.
5077943	5084709	You know, the fact that the market switched to, hey, why spend the money on a game console when you can spend the money on a computer?
5085149	5091715	But the gaming in computers really came after the crash because, you know, what were you going to get your games on?
5092356	5093837	You know, so to an extent.
5094097	5097860	But it was, yeah, market oversaturation, terrible quality control.
5098220	5100903	And at the time, video gaming really was kind of...
5101343	5101944	and Fatish.
5102665	5107154	You know, and there was a big lull and they didn't realize that there was a cycle that you should upgrade it.
5107254	5108215	There was no Angry Birds.
5108236	5109317	All right, let's finish the email.
5109338	5109558	Sorry.
5110059	5112203	By the way, that would be there were no Angry Birds.
5113624	5114204	Actually, you were right.
5114244	5116405	There was no, because the game is singular.
5116885	5117785	Is that in the email?
5120346	5126207	Speaking of documentaries, I think you guys should check out Focus, starring Mike Ross, or I Got Next, which is free on Hulu.
5126787	5129388	They're both about the fighting game community and tournaments.
5129908	5133949	Really recommend it if anyone is interested in seeing what the community is like.
5134409	5138312	I love the competitive gaming scene, but I don't have the time or motivation to get back into it.
5139033	5139793	Thanks for your time.
5139833	5141655	I've been a podcast listener since 05.
5141815	5142415	Love the show.
5142936	5147840	It's been a great inspiration for my own projects, and you guys keep me awake during long, boring nights at work.
5148220	5149101	Shh, don't tell my boss.
5149741	5152243	Keep up the greater than great work.
5152363	5153444	And that's from AJ Twist.
5153504	5159989	I'm just really sad that, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 never became part of the MLG scene, because I could have fucking earned some money there.
5160690	5162131	Unfortunately, it's all Call of Duty, and...
5162765	5166768	And I'm surprised this guy said we inspired him to do other projects, which is a great compliment.
5167188	5169950	And he refrained from plugging said projects.
5170010	5171410	That's a great amount of restraint.
5171931	5175273	But if you would like to, we're nice that way.
5175533	5176013	Yeah, you can.
5176053	5176634	Yeah, you can always.
5176774	5178175	We support people.
5180447	5181007	and that's it.
5181047	5181408	That's it?
5181588	5182088	One email?
5182228	5183789	I told you at the beginning of the show.
5183809	5184350	I wasn't listening.
5184490	5185431	One lousy email.
5185451	5186311	Jeez, Rob.
5186451	5189994	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Fill her up for next show.
5190795	5192256	That's what happens when you tape midweek.
5192276	5195678	See, we'll get a bunch of emails on Sunday and then it'll be like LOL didn't tape today.
5197259	5198740	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
5198820	5199421	This should be good.
5220292	5224814	You know, my FUs are really kind of personal this week.
5227235	5228816	No, I don't want to say it to you.
5228976	5229756	I'm over it.
5230537	5231277	Okay, fine.
5231377	5232938	Fuck you for not buying me an iPad.
5235479	5236640	Or the hard drive I needed.
5240882	5244346	I'd like to go ahead and accept the responsibility for this fuck you.
5244726	5252655	Not really so much because I upgraded my graphics card and didn't buy her anything because, you know, she's a little miss grabby, but I have been really fucking with her all night on the show tonight.
5252755	5253516	It's been awesome.
5255918	5257300	I think you should bite my ass.
5258061	5258461	Loki?
5260664	5260764	Uh...
5261852	5290184	I had some I was angry about earlier but you know just after eating delicious teriyaki it's just hard to be angry about anything so I guess I guess that'd be the fact that I'm tired just because I've been staying up till midnight playing Borderlands 2 every night well Minecraft actually but I'm tired and wish I could take a day off to like sleep and play more Minecraft let me do that and I may or may not be taking Tuesday off to play World of Warcraft all day
5290675	5299747	and FU2 to the fact that I probably am not going to be able to convince the wife to allow me to purchase a $1200 DDR machine that's in Modesto.
5302932	5303853	Because I really want it.
5304699	5308002	I've wanted one for years now.
5309983	5310984	Wife will be pissed.
5312645	5313306	Shut up!
5314267	5316368	Dan and Loki have very different outlooks on this.
5316388	5318610	You should buy it, and I'll tell you why.
5319031	5322353	Number one, man, you having a DDR machine would be awesome.
5323054	5324955	Number two, she'll get over it.
5325095	5325716	I mean, really.
5328007	5329788	And number three, Awesome.
5329948	5333650	I was going to talk to her last night, but she was really cranky yesterday.
5333670	5336171	This is coming from the guy who has five pinball machines.
5336811	5338332	I only have three pinball machines.
5338372	5339592	The other two are loaners.
5339672	5340113	My bad.
5341053	5344815	I thought we should have bought that Solo that was for sale for like $800, but Jamie said no Solo.
5344935	5346455	It's still for sale.
5346936	5348296	No, I didn't say no.
5348596	5352158	I thought we should have bought that Planet Harriers that was only $600, but Jamie said no.
5352338	5353999	No, you said no, you ass.
5354479	5356000	You said we don't have room for it.
5356020	5356300	Stop.
5357113	5359494	I thought we should have bought that Daytona USA duel that I saw for like $250.
5359714	5362716	But she said no.
5362856	5365237	Give me the damn mic.
5365797	5366597	You're breaking it.
5366618	5367258	Let go.
5367698	5370339	If you did the fact, I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack to buy a new mic.
5374191	5376613	The good news is I get an employee discount.
5377414	5378395	I want to say F you.
5379035	5380256	I want to say F you to Apple.
5380977	5381738	Get the fuck off me.
5382458	5385180	I want to say F you to Apple for launching the new iPhone this weekend.
5385541	5389164	It's not really anything against Apple launching the new iPhone because that's fine.
5389624	5392747	But I'd really, really rather be playing Borderlands all weekend.
5393107	5396330	And now I can't because I got to go and sell iPhones all weekend.
5396410	5397290	Get the fuck off me.
5398091	5399152	This is about to get violent.
5402033	5403133	I looked down her shirt.
5403474	5404494	Can I do my FUs, please?
5404514	5405094	Can you finish?
5405154	5405574	Can I finish?
5405814	5406194	Can I finish?
5406214	5406534	Can I finish?
5407315	5407515	Alright.
5407915	5408615	Dan isn't getting the mic again.
5408635	5412336	My FU of the week just goes to being, like, super busy and stressed.
5412376	5413977	Like, I was so busy this week.
5414377	5417898	I think one day I had, like, such low blood sugar I was about to pass out in faint.
5418078	5420418	Like, just between where... I mean, cry me a river.
5420478	5422499	It's not like I don't volunteer for this shit, but...
5422839	5423139	Outro Music
5449594	5471936	We actually, I do have money to get a new mic, I need to get one But the question is, do I want to get a mic But Rob, you're Dutch The question is, do I want to get a mic like this, or do I want to get like a super fancy condenser mic that's three digits in cost Kind of want the super fancy condenser mic for voiceovers I had one, I don't know what the fuck happened to that Yeah, didn't we have one?
5472136	5472677	Thanks for watching!
5489250	5492871	There was literally an episode of Orange Lounge Radio and it's like a double digit episode.
5492931	5495392	That was one that I was asleep in your bed.
5495432	5496973	Jamie passes out in my bed.
5497533	5499913	I am kicking... No, I ate waffles in your bed.
5500014	5502954	I am kicking the wall yelling, I'm in the Matrix.
5503074	5503895	I'm in the Matrix.
5505575	5506336	On the radio.
5508077	5509078	and DarkSakura.com.
5522620	5536172	If we get nominated for a podcast award this year, here's the concessional may If we can get nominated for a podcast award this year, I will get drunk and likely kick the wall again That's the little promise I make to you How's that sound?
5536592	5541656	Sounds fun And if we win, we'll get the cats drunk?
5541756	5546140	I don't know No I don't know what else to add to that, all right
5548267	5548608	Anyway.
5548628	5550650	Okay.
5550990	5555674	So let's talk about stuff that we probably didn't really want, but they're going to give us anyways.
5557736	5559818	Castlevania, the movie.
5560258	5560859	It's returning.
5562080	5564022	And how do we know it's returning?
5564542	5565904	Because Michael Dorn said so.
5566404	5568786	Michael Dorn, who played many things.
5569347	5570628	Mr. Worf as Dracula.
5570768	5571489	Yes, Mr. Worf.
5571849	5573290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5597234	5603299	Basically, I guess he got involved because of Marina Sirtis, who I don't know who she played.
5603500	5604100	Troy.
5604981	5610185	And they were both also in the Mass Effect series because he was one of the other Erdnott.
5610485	5611266	No, he wasn't the Erdnott.
5611526	5614389	He was the guy with the green forehead that was hanging out with Rex.
5615630	5615890	Reeve?
5616310	5617151	Yeah, not Reeve.
5617671	5620113	I kind of would want to see it because they're in it.
5620314	5620854	You know what I mean?
5621695	5624357	It's like even if it was terrible, it would be like, hey, that's kind of cool.
5626696	5627557	I trust the Klingon.
5629459	5637667	As much as I'm like, alright, Castlevania movie... Let's just cast the rest of Castlevania with old actors from Next Generation and stuff.
5637707	5638829	Hey, I'm all about that.
5638889	5639309	Why not?
5639529	5643914	We'll get, let's see, we'll get Michael... Let's get Bruce Campbell.
5644334	5645175	He was Uvink.
5646697	5647878	He wasn't Reeve, he was Uvink.
5650067	5677109	Patrick Stewart as Dracula Will Wheaton as badass vampire hunter To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase QUICKSAND
5679733	5680073	Alright.
5682114	5685835	Also, I need to say this comment from chat because it's very important before I get to the last story here.
5686276	5688677	Bobby Blackwolf has made an offer on the podcast awards.
5689697	5694119	If you win, Bobby Blackwolf says, I'll fly out and get drunk too.
5695703	5702646	Okay, remember, this is Bobby Blackwolf, host of the clean and family-friendly Bobby Blackwolf Show, offering to come out here and get drunk with us.
5702906	5703806	That's awesome.
5704526	5706707	All bets will be off if that happens.
5706807	5708048	We must win the award.
5708368	5709408	I'll bring my sleeping bag.
5709848	5710509	Seriously.
5711789	5713970	If we win, marathon show.
5714670	5714950	Okay.
5715090	5715871	All right, there you go.
5716211	5716851	Make it so.
5716991	5717631	Make it so.
5719552	5721413	Marathon show with drunk Bobby Blackwolf.
5721473	5721853	Make it so.
5723596	5724938	Dan has to come and drink too.
5725218	5727041	We'll engage the listeners.
5727561	5729444	We can set it up in the front room at our house.
5730285	5731787	We will fix the warp core.
5732628	5733049	The breach.
5735331	5737294	Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.
5737314	5738956	Do you even bother with Minecraft on Xbox?
5738996	5741459	I don't right now, but the story is interesting.
5743300	5746701	Alright, update 1.8.2 for Minecraft on Xbox.
5746761	5748442	We'll be adding the creative mode.
5748462	5753883	There's going to be new food, new monsters, and that means we're almost caught up to the PC version.
5754383	5755523	Eh, there's still ways off.
5755563	5762545	They're adding the random dungeon stuff, like the abandoned mine shafts, which I keep running into those in.
5762885	5765487	Yeah, you have a lot of those in the VOG world.
5765587	5766068	There's a lot.
5766568	5773114	And also the villages, the villagers and Enderman and all that stuff.
5773214	5774695	Do we have villagers in VOG world?
5774835	5775476	I've been looking.
5775856	5777358	There's just a lot of fucking ocean.
5777418	5781521	That's all I've found because, like I said, I went into creative.
5781541	5782042	It's Atlantis.
5782142	5782642	They're all underwater.
5782662	5789348	I went into creative and I flew around through the nether and I created a new portal because I couldn't remember where the hell the old portal was.
5789508	5792990	and I ended up in the middle of the ocean and I still don't know where the fuck I was.
5793050	5795311	That's what I want to build is like an underwater lair.
5795971	5797052	Well, there's plenty of water.
5798052	5799453	That will not be a problem.
5799533	5800393	I mean, you can do that.
5801014	5801274	All right.
5802934	5808317	Also, okay, so they are doing these updates to the Xbox version.
5808377	5814220	Now, they are talking about maybe doing some mods, maybe differentiating it a little bit from the PC version.
5814700	5830466	Now, the Xbox 360, according to 4J Studios, won't be able to have the mod system that gives such a variety of community additions to the game on PC, but we're looking at the elements of these that people seem to be enjoying the most, and deciding how we could tailor those elements into something for the Xbox.
5830826	5831266	That'd be cool.
5831646	5837408	Xbox 360 players, they say it's because you're in a living room, you use a controller, so this is different, the way you interact with the game.
5837669	5840690	I don't know that I play the controller on the PC version, and it's just fine.
5840730	5841310	You're a freak.
5842495	5844155	My coworker does too, and he likes it.
5844916	5848937	He has a little bit of getting used to it, but it's actually really easy to play with, and I love it.
5849277	5849697	It's great.
5851017	5855558	I'm looking forward to just whatever they're going to do with Minecraft on the Xbox in the future.
5855578	5862400	I think it's great that despite the fact that they've already sold millions and millions of copies of it, they're not going to stop updating it.
5862420	5866681	I think a lot of people would just take the money and run, but they're still supporting it to sell even more copies.
5866721	5867301	I think that's great.
5869182	5870042	Just throwing that out there.
5870834	5872601	Thank you Rob, now that song is stuck in my head.
5872922	5873143	What?
5873745	5874428	Take the money and run.
5875856	5876376	You're welcome.
5877457	5879477	All right, I'm going to open up the Skype line right now.
5879637	5881618	Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
5881698	5885219	The 877 number doesn't work tonight because somebody forgot to pay the bill.
5885940	5887180	But I don't want to pay the bill tonight.
5887220	5889881	Why would I pay the bill tonight when I'm not going to use it tonight?
5889961	5893182	So we'll have the 800 number back next week.
5893222	5896623	But for now, you can call us OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, all one word.
5897083	5902205	While we wait for any call... I mean, we have way less listeners than usual tonight, obviously, because you guys had no warning this was happening.
5902245	5903986	But while I wait to see if anybody is going to call...
5904326	5905067	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5924506	5927047	Talk about something that's bigger than the iPhone 5.
5927207	5929227	Man, that thing is fucking massive.
5929287	5931207	Is it like original Xbox controller big?
5932108	5932908	I think bigger.
5933168	5934908	It's seriously massive.
5935548	5937929	I just, it looks stupid.
5937949	5940929	I mean, it seriously looks dumb that they have that.
5940949	5941830	It's like, come on, man.
5942410	5952652	You had this 3DS system that you could, there's a spot that you could have put another circle pad there, but no, you just had to go and say, eh, we're going to add another attachment that no one fucking needs.
5953432	5954653	That's fantastic.
5956354	5959095	Let me go to some Twitter topics real quick while we wait and see if we get any calls.
5959215	5960936	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
5961836	5963717	I did not know about this.
5963877	5967899	This is something that Tigerclaw sent because Tigerclaw always sends the tweets, even if it's Thursday.
5968839	5970100	And this actually makes me really sad.
5970140	5970820	This is news to me.
5970860	5971820	I did not hear about this.
5972221	5980044	I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi and the games he's created, Rez and Meteos and Luminous.
5980524	5981685	He's made all these great games.
5982325	5984167	He's apparently moving away from game production.
5984407	5988009	He's going to be doing more of a delegatory role in Q Entertainment.
5988270	5988850	More playgrounds.
5989410	5989751	What's that?
5989971	5991032	He's making playgrounds too.
5991312	5991832	I guess.
5991912	5992313	I don't know.
5993233	5996676	Since finishing Child of Eden, apparently he's doing more academic work.
5998397	6000238	They're saying he's more of a spokesperson.
6000278	6002100	He's not developing stuff right now.
6002560	6003301	Well, why not?
6003341	6004101	That makes me sad.
6005903	6009005	There's been some other people that have left Q Entertainment.
6009325	6009405	Um...
6010906	6019372	James Milke, I guess, was somebody that produced Luminous Electronic Symphony and now he's with Q Games in Kyoto.
6019652	6020232	Very different.
6021453	6022074	So, huh.
6023875	6024515	Well, that's sad.
6025716	6035703	I hope Q Entertainment is able to make more of the music and puzzle and those kind of really innovative types of games like Rez and stuff and maybe less of the 99 Nights.
6035763	6037584	You know, I haven't played much of Luminous.
6038885	6039345	It's great.
6042412	6044734	One more Twitter topic I have, also from Tigerclaw.
6045174	6045675	You the man.
6046996	6050079	Apparently some layoffs at Sony Public Relations.
6050519	6052180	I'll get to that in a minute, though, because we have a call coming in.
6052201	6052781	I don't want to miss it.
6053161	6054182	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6054202	6054563	Who's this?
6055604	6056624	What's up, guys?
6056664	6057325	It's Codeman.
6057505	6058306	Codeman!
6058346	6059347	What's on your mind, buddy?
6060368	6061148	Oh, not much.
6061949	6066053	Just got back last Saturday from Gearbox Community Day.
6066073	6067274	I wanted to tell you guys about it.
6067935	6072957	Yes, and thank you in advance for that stuff you got at the event.
6073057	6073597	You rock.
6074437	6075417	Oh, no problem, guys.
6075457	6080339	I just wanted to get you guys something because you guys deserve everything in the world for putting on this show every Sunday.
6080399	6081640	Shucks.
6081940	6082980	Flattery will get you everywhere.
6084122	6085843	I know, that's why I do it.
6086424	6088646	So, no, it was actually an amazing event.
6088666	6095911	I mean, obviously, as everybody knows, Gearbox is a fantastic developer with their games and their fan service.
6095931	6097953	I mean, their fan service is just ridiculous.
6098053	6102276	I mean, I was talking to devs just all day.
6102356	6104198	I talked to Randy Pitchford.
6104338	6106220	I mean, it was just crazy.
6106280	6110403	I mean, just how much these guys just want to interact with their fans, and it was amazing.
6111591	6113112	How did this event work?
6113232	6113813	What was it?
6113873	6116455	Was it just like a big showroom for Borderlands 2?
6116955	6118736	Was it Q&A panels?
6118776	6119937	Was it more like a convention?
6120197	6121518	How was this all kind of set up?
6122559	6124800	I mean, pretty much everything you just said.
6124840	6128343	I mean, there were panels, Q&A panels.
6128403	6131325	They had a panel specifically for Borderlands 2.
6131545	6139190	And then they had a panel for Aliens Colonial Marines, which they really didn't say a whole lot about it because I guess it's supposed to be out in 2013 or something.
6140798	6145919	But they had a room for Colonial Marines, which they only had two game types.
6145939	6149480	They had a team deathmatch game type, which was actually quite fun.
6149780	6155021	You can actually play as humans against aliens, which was actually kind of neat.
6155321	6162682	And then they had an escape game type, which I guess it was just you were basically trying to escape this area where there was a whole bunch of aliens attacking you.
6163383	6167924	But yeah, it was just a big event that just had all kinds of different stuff.
6167984	6169484	You got to talk to everyone.
6169504	6170184	It was amazing.
6170638	6172120	No Duke Nukem Forever presence?
6173642	6175504	No, they had his chair there.
6176445	6180910	But no, no, there were no Duke Nukem anywhere.
6180970	6183313	I mean, I don't even think they even mentioned it, really.
6183513	6184714	What a shock, what a shock.
6185515	6186416	I know, right?
6187097	6188419	So how are you enjoying Borderlands 2?
6188959	6190861	I seem to recall you're a bit of a Borderlands fan.
6192123	6199508	Oh yeah, well, I actually picked it up on launch day, of course, I guess like every crazy person that loves Borderlands 2.
6199988	6202010	And I only have gotten to play it once.
6202390	6206353	I'm actually a dad, so I don't really get to play a whole lot of video games.
6206793	6211436	But when I do, I get to sit down for long periods of time and play them.
6211496	6212757	But no, I'm really enjoying it.
6212817	6220742	I have figured out, and Loki, you probably know this, because you've been playing it a lot too, and it actually has gotten a little harder.
6222363	6224744	The AI dodges your bullets now.
6224784	6228065	I mean, they're all over the place with the enemies.
6228125	6229545	So, I mean, it's pretty crazy.
6229725	6231386	This is why I need BFF mode.
6232486	6233286	I know, right?
6233426	6235507	I'm still working on the first one slowly.
6235547	6237647	I think I got to level 10 not that long ago.
6237707	6241188	So I'm still working on it amongst the Warcrafts of the World.
6241248	6247670	I do want to say they did kind of dance around the whole girlfriend mode thing in the panel.
6248950	6254273	One of the guys said something and then Randy was like, why don't you tell us about that?
6254373	6256133	He's like, why don't you go fuck yourself?
6256153	6259995	It was pretty funny.
6260775	6266118	I can plug Bobby Blackwell's show from this two weeks ago at this point now, not last week but the week before.
6266418	6269239	He had those guys on the show and they talked openly about it.
6269319	6271360	No go fucking yourself involved.
6272542	6277824	Oh no, it was actually pretty funny because it was just the panel that were talking back and forth.
6278525	6301894	He was talking to another dev that was talking to him and I guess they've been giving him a whole lot of crap about this whole thing that got released and how the media just took it and ran with it and so I guess around the office they've just been giving him all kinds of crap and they were just joking about it and Randy made a statement about it, how they're not discriminatory towards anybody in the whole entire world and he said people that
6302441	6303742	Discriminate Towards Other People
6327644	6331446	and them actually being an independent company and not answering to anybody else.
6331486	6334387	I mean, that's just fantastic to me.
6334527	6339909	Yeah, it's pretty cool that they do something like this because not every gaming company does something directly for the fans.
6340069	6341970	And I mean, where was this at?
6342030	6343591	It was in Texas somewhere.
6343631	6344011	Where was this?
6344815	6348477	It was in Dallas, Texas at the Palladium Theater
6364604	6368387	QuakeCon just happened before we got there community day.
6368648	6372311	I saw a whole bunch of people wearing QuakeCon shirts and all kinds of stuff.
6372451	6375033	It was a pretty big deal.
6375073	6380698	I think they estimated about probably around 700 people at this thing.
6380758	6383660	It was a pretty big deal.
6385322	6388344	We actually got to jump in line because we paid for tickets.
6388604	6391627	They had free general admission tickets.
6392108	6397870	But we paid for tickets, me and my friend, and so we got to jump in line a little bit and get in there quicker.
6397930	6410174	But yeah, I did play Borderlands on the PC, which really spoiled me because I played it on the Xbox when I got it on Tuesday, and I was just like, oh, these graphics are horrible.
6410754	6417496	Yeah, and getting used to the controls when you can have such precision with a keyboard and mouse, it's a little bit rough.
6417556	6417736	True.
6418896	6419417	True, true.
6419717	6421798	And then I also wanted to – and then I'll let you guys go.
6422098	6428502	But I also wanted to say I actually – it's funny you mentioned the tester earlier in the show.
6429223	6435747	I actually grew up – I don't know if you guys – one of the panel, Brent Gokey, I actually grew up with him.
6437328	6437428	Wow!
6437468	6437549	Wow!
6455822	6457503	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6478735	6479595	True, true.
6507465	6518496	I don't know about this guy that won the most recent season, but for what it is, they are working their way up in the company and apparently ending up pretty successful, so that's kind of neat.
6519277	6521859	I was disappointed that DarkSakura didn't get on there.
6522800	6523261	We all were.
6523321	6524963	I kind of just gave up on it.
6525043	6532872	We all were, but we had Asuka, who apparently was a friend of an OLR listener and ended up calling into OLR one night.
6533412	6540320	You have to go back in the archives to find it, but she called in and it ended up being the day before she got voted off the island or whatever it is.
6541137	6541738	I heard that.
6541818	6542479	I heard that show.
6542519	6543399	I remember that show.
6543499	6547643	And it was very – I was very distraught because I kind of liked her.
6548083	6549744	Yeah, I know.
6550065	6554949	And when she got kicked off, I was like, oh, man, she just had an amazing interview with Orange Lounge Radio.
6555009	6556410	And now she got kicked off.
6556550	6558652	I had no idea that that was going to happen.
6558772	6562475	And, yes, it was just kind of – I was like, of course, of course.
6562615	6565397	She was just on the show and that – yeah, kiss of death or whatever.
6565477	6565658	But –
6566298	6568520	That's, what a funny small world.
6568600	6574225	Yeah, he's, that guy's like the Simon Cowell of the show, and so that's kind of funny that you grew up with him.
6574646	6575486	What a small world.
6576027	6579210	I told you, we're like D-list video game celebs now.
6579310	6584614	Now we've got ties to two, now we have ties not only to tester contestants, but apparently the tester panel.
6584975	6586576	I'm this close to Adrian Curry.
6586976	6587677	This close.
6588658	6588958	Alright.
6589899	6592041	Anyhow, we should probably let you go, dude.
6592930	6597813	Okay, man, well, I appreciate you taking my call, and enjoy the poster, man.
6598434	6606098	I should have got them to write on their OLR, but I was like, it was just so fast and crazy that, you know.
6606479	6615104	But yeah, everybody's on there, from the dev team to Randy Pitchford to the guardian angel who plays the guardian angel in Borderlands.
6615144	6619247	She's on there, the girl who plays the siren in the second game.
6619987	6621648	He's on there like everybody's on there.
6621688	6622709	So enjoy it.
6623369	6625411	We have a saying, beggars can't be choosers.
6625491	6626631	So thank you very much.
6626831	6629573	And maybe we'll get him on the show next time.
6629593	6630213	That would be great.
6630614	6632675	Bobby got it this time, but maybe for Borderlands 3.
6632935	6633255	We'll see.
6633976	6634276	All right.
6634696	6635197	Take care, buddy.
6636137	6637958	Thank you very much, and keep doing what you're doing.
6638218	6638699	We will.
6639159	6640260	Not slowing down anytime soon.
6640800	6641060	Bye.
6641400	6641741	All right.
6641781	6642181	We'll see you.
6643510	6645291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6662700	6685011	Championship Sprint, Tournament, Cyberball 2072, Defender, Defender 2, Gauntlet 2, Joust, Joust 2, Marble Madness, Pit Fighter, Rampage, Rampart, Robotron 2084, Rootbeard Tapper, Satan's Hollow, Sinistar, Smash TV, Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter 2, Super Offroad, Super Sprint, Tubin, Total Carnage, Vindicators Part 2, Wizards of War, Xenophobe, and Zybots.
6685971	6689555	That's kind of a greatest hits of the three that were already out.
6689675	6690816	I don't think there's any of those.
6691317	6693819	I didn't think Marble Madness was in any of the other collections.
6693859	6694120	And $29.99.
6694560	6694820	Huh.
6695841	6698184	It's just... It's a bummer it's not...
6699178	6700079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6723652	6742993	all employees are now apparently in the Foster City headquarters but there's no impact on game development so like Sony Santa Monica and all that's fine apparently this is in an article I've been linked to on GameSpot there was a reorg and some PR people were in San Diego were let go
6743733	6752063	Which, funny enough, I think was the studio where all that tester stuff happened, which might explain a little bit about... Oh, that's really sad.
6752263	6753024	That's too bad.
6753805	6757109	But it's all in Foster City, so hopefully some people got relocated at least, maybe?
6757889	6758070	But...
6758490	6759010	Bummer, bummer.
6760251	6764373	This follows a closing of Zipper Interactive, which had happened back in March.
6765254	6771577	They made SOCOM and MAG, and in April they said they were going to cut 10,000 jobs, but that was Sony-wide.
6772257	6778820	Wipeout developer studio Liverpool also had been closed this year, so a bunch of bummer news from Sony.
6778860	6783103	We hope they're able to land on their feet soon, and maybe they'll sell some Vitas so they can hire them back.
6784463	6787625	Loki, any other last-minute stories you want to get into tonight, or DarkSakura, if you have any?
6790324	6792025	Castle Crashers is coming to Steam next week.
6792686	6793046	Nice.
6794447	6795428	Only took, what, four years?
6796989	6800052	There's a Half-Life 3 rumor that it's open world and coming in 2013.
6800612	6801193	Oh my!
6801293	6803615	And from an anonymous source, too!
6804496	6805376	I think that's true.
6805516	6806758	Extremely trustworthy.
6806778	6807498	Extremely.
6809240	6811762	And I guess there's also an article I just read about
6812402	6814926	Publishers apparently trying to exploit Kickstarter.
6814946	6819651	This is actually coming from the last one.
6819712	6821013	It was Obsidian.
6821053	6822195	They have their Kickstarter.
6822235	6828483	They revealed, they said, We were actually contacted by some publishers over the last few months that wanted us to do a Kickstarter.
6829604	6847226	I said to them so you want us to do a Kickstarter for using our name we then get Kickstarter money to make a game then you publish the game but we don't get to keep the brand we make we only get a portion of the profits and they said yes wow to which he said fuck off no surprise
6849338	6849798	Anything else?
6849858	6850199	That's it.
6851039	6852840	Well, that brings us to the end of the show.
6853141	6857824	I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but that's what happens when we tape on a non-Sunday that we're not used to.
6858924	6862267	But before we close out tonight, we got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
6862427	6866830	Before I get into that, I do want to thank everybody for listening and for being here this week.
6867450	6873754	We will be back in our normal time slot live on Sunday night on the 30th with episode number 475.
6874415	6878337	We are talking behind the scenes about some possible changes in the future Orange Launch Radio.
6878357	6878938	Nothing major.
6879318	6882445	I just wanted to leave you that little sampling to go with.
6882566	6885472	So that could be in the coming weeks, certainly before episode 500.
6888584	6889384	Thank you for watching!
6916989	6921170	Word of mouth is all we got right now and it's all we've had over the past 10 years.
6921850	6925111	Dan the Man, thank you very much for being on the show tonight and fighting with your wife.
6925391	6927311	Always a good time to have that going on on air.
6928411	6929071	I like turtles.
6930232	6931052	Is that your final thought tonight?
6931072	6932092	Do you have a final thought tonight, Dan?
6933512	6934092	He's shaking his head.
6934112	6934972	I guess it's I like turtles.
6935293	6937233	Alright, DarkSakra.
6938593	6939153	I want dinner.
6939633	6940213	You want dinner.
6940313	6941814	And I didn't make a fortune cookie.
6942154	6943014	What do you want from Disneyland?
6946190	6947111	Stuff, you got it.
6947151	6947571	Duffy.
6947811	6948112	All right.
6948352	6949353	Stuff, I guess.
6949433	6951314	Loki, your final thought tonight?
6952635	6954396	I guess I'll play some more Minecraft.
6955357	6958580	My final thought tonight is don't hate me because I went to Disneyland.
6958860	6963604	It's the last trip for at least a year, so womp, womp, sadness.
6963644	6964704	It's okay, I'm going in two weeks.
6967386	6968267	All right, that's it.
6968327	6969268	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
