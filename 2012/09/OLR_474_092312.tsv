7000	27000	Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie and Loki
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	41000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, kind of a special edition tonight.
41000	48000	Although they're all a little bit special, particularly tonight's episode if you're here on this special Thursday.
48000	49000	In the head.
49000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff over the next few hours with my co-host.
56000	58000	First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura.
58000	59000	Hi.
59000	60000	How are you DarkSakura?
60000	61000	Educated.
61000	63000	Educated, edumacated. What did you learn today?
63000	70000	I learned that certain parties at my school have no concept of art.
70000	76000	Oh, that's unfortunate. Are you talking about like political parties? Are you talking about like sock hop?
76000	78000	I refrain from comment.
78000	87000	That and I hate this time of year because of all of the, do you want to, we want to talk to you about how you don't want to vote for this guy.
87000	89000	Oh, especially at college campuses, my lord.
89000	91000	No, on my cell phone.
91000	94000	Oh, good times.
94000	95000	Yeah.
95000	97000	Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
97000	98000	Hi.
98000	101000	Loki, what should I vote for in November?
101000	103000	Your mom.
103000	104000	Pornography.
104000	106000	Vote for your mom. I'd vote for your mom.
106000	108000	My mom's pretty awesome.
108000	112000	Cause your mom would just go, I can't believe you're all doing that. That's awful.
112000	119000	Rob, why, Rob, as president, I'm gonna ban that show, Rob.
119000	121000	You need to save your money.
121000	127000	It's only taken ten years before I finally started getting the porn spam in the old mailbox.
127000	128000	Only.
128000	132000	Only ten years. That is slow for internet. I mean it should be like five seconds.
133000	140000	Alright, well also joining us somewhat in studio tonight, say hello to Dan the Man is back.
140000	142000	Yes, I am.
142000	144000	How are you doing? Dan the Man?
144000	146000	Not average.
146000	147000	Good to hear.
147000	148000	Yeah, he's just average.
148000	150000	He's just, you know, he's alright.
150000	152000	Dan's my means to an end tonight.
152000	161000	Alright, so if you missed the memo during last week's show, and how dare you not listen to last week's show, but hey, at least you're listening tonight, so I forgive you, here's what's going on.
161000	171000	We're taping a little bit earlier in the week. It's a Thursday night right now, and we are live at vognetwork.com, so if you're hearing like, usually I hear music on Thursday nights, why is there a show?
171000	180000	We're here, we're doing this special thing. It will rebroadcast on Sunday night in our normal time slot, and then the podcast folks will get it about the time they usually get a podcast.
180000	184000	So if you're a podcast listener, you're like, oh, nothing's different except this week's a little bit shorter.
184000	190000	Well, because we are taping on an off night for us, so we got a little bit of a later start, and we'll have to get a little bit of an earlier finish.
190000	199000	Anyhow, though, still lots of stuff going on in the gaming world, but just the disclaimer at the top, the news is delayed a couple days here.
199000	207000	So there may be some things that have changed between Thursday, the day we tape, and Sunday night, Monday morning, the day the podcast goes out.
207000	215000	So just putting that disclaimer out there. Unless you're live at VOG Network right now on Thursday, in that case, I guess it's all current, as current as can be.
215000	221000	So if you do happen to be here live, I urge you guys to come in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and join us there.
221000	229000	The Skype line will be open later, only the Skype line tonight, not the 800 number. That will be open a little bit later on.
229000	235000	First off, Tokyo Game Show, without getting into the news about it too much, Tokyo Game Show's going on.
235000	241000	Loki, you and I were talking a little bit before the show about some of the more surprising things that are not at Tokyo Game Show right now.
242000	245000	So the not news. What's not news this week?
245000	247000	Dead Rising 3.
247000	251000	Yeah, what's up with that? Because we had some pretty juicy rumors on that a couple months ago about the story.
251000	255000	I think it's going to be Dead Rising 3, to be honest. I think they just weren't ready yet.
255000	259000	It was probably one of those, oh hey, we're going to show this, but then they're like, well, you know what?
259000	268000	We still have a couple games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, like Devil May Cry and Resident Evil, so let's not put Dead Rising 3 out there yet.
268000	270000	Because they don't probably have anything to show for it yet.
270000	272000	But next E3, I bet they will.
272000	279000	An E3 seems like the smarter time to, you know, well, I shouldn't say that, because certainly a lot of big stuff can debut at Tokyo Game Show.
279000	281000	But maybe, isn't Dead Rising...
281000	283000	They also have Captivate, what they do.
283000	291000	Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Dead Rising a little bit more of a probably game that sells here in the States than it does over in Japan?
291000	292000	I think so.
292000	294000	Yeah, well that makes sense.
297000	301000	Let's see, what else is in it at Tokyo Game Show? There was something I was thinking of.
301000	308000	Oh, Square, I know they've got some things going on, but I haven't heard a lot coming out about the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.
308000	310000	I don't know if that's still coming, or what's going on.
310000	314000	They should shoot something. They had, I think, a new trailer or something.
314000	318000	Did they? I know there's big Square news we'll get to later, but still no versus either, right?
318000	320000	No, I'm not surprised.
320000	324000	No Last Guardian, other than, yep, we're still working on it.
324000	326000	It's happening. It hasn't disappeared yet.
326000	329000	Alright, well we will get into all the news that's going on.
329000	332000	The Last Guardian is versus 13. Rumor!
335000	338000	Do you guys have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point in your life?
338000	339000	I just want to go to Tokyo.
339000	340000	You just want to go to Tokyo?
340000	343000	Yeah, and if I happen to be at the game show, then nice.
343000	346000	You could always plan to be there about that time.
346000	348000	To be honest, I'd rather go to Kyoto.
348000	351000	I'd rather go to Rockstar New York.
352000	353000	You want to go to Rockstar?
353000	356000	Dan wants to go to Tokyo because he wants to go to Akihabara.
356000	357000	That would be fun.
357000	359000	So he can buy Turbo Graphics games.
359000	361000	Who wouldn't want to buy Turbo Graphics games? Sounds like fun.
361000	363000	People who don't have Turbo Graphics.
363000	365000	Some folks in the chat, we do have a live chat room.
365000	368000	It's a small turnout tonight because we didn't really announce this
368000	371000	because we didn't know exactly what time we'd be up and everything,
371000	375000	so we really have the VOG loyalists at the Voice of Geeks Network in chat tonight.
375000	377000	And ShadowNextGen says,
377000	380000	Sony's Tokyo Game Show press conference was horrible,
380000	383000	but follows up with, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show at least once.
383000	387000	I'd like to go at least once, but it's really crowded from what I hear.
387000	390000	That and Gamescom are both really crowded shows
390000	393000	because they are open to the public, and I bet it's just kind of a mess.
393000	396000	You probably have to wait in Disneyland-style rides
396000	398000	to play anything out there on the floor.
398000	400000	E3 was bad enough there for a while,
400000	404000	especially before the big slim down back in 2006.
405000	408000	Loki, do you have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point?
408000	409000	Nope.
409000	410000	Why not?
410000	412000	Don't speak the language.
412000	414000	That would be difficult with the whole language barrier,
414000	417000	but does that mean you don't want to go to Gamescom either
417000	419000	because that's in Germany?
419000	421000	It's still Europe.
421000	423000	Strudel.
423000	426000	It's still Europe, so they have some English speaking.
426000	430000	The only thing I'd really want to go see at Tokyo Game Show
430000	433000	is D3's awesome booth.
433000	436000	We did a whole recreation of Earth Defense Force and LEGO.
436000	438000	They've been teasing it on their Facebook.
438000	440000	Of course. That's what you want to see.
440000	442000	They've been teasing it on their Facebook.
442000	445000	I'm like, why the fuck are they making LEGO characters?
445000	448000	It's kind of cool that they're doing the tank and the bugs and stuff like that in LEGO,
448000	450000	but why are they doing that?
450000	452000	It all makes sense now. It's this giant recreation.
452000	455000	That won't be there next year, though, unless you get lucky
455000	457000	and there's an Earth Defense Force 5.
457000	460000	You know, technically,
460000	465000	I mean, if I wanted to import it, next week is Earth Defense Force 3 Portable.
465000	467000	You thought about it?
467000	468000	For the Vita.
468000	469000	You thought about it?
469000	470000	In Japan.
470000	472000	Is the Vita region free? I thought it wasn't.
472000	474000	Oh, I thought it wasn't for some reason.
474000	476000	The digital marketplaces are, but...
476000	477000	Ah.
477000	479000	No, the 3DS is not.
479000	481000	Right, right.
481000	482000	What?
482000	485000	Yeah, so I can't get that awesome game unless I have an import.
485000	488000	Wow, that is the stupidest thing Nintendo's ever done.
488000	489000	I need a Japanese DS.
489000	491000	You didn't know the 3DS was region-locked?
491000	493000	After all this, how long has 3DS been out?
493000	496000	How many 3DSs do you see me owning?
496000	499000	I looked at the hardware and was like,
499000	501000	oh, it's the DS again.
501000	503000	Oh, and it's got blurry 3D.
503000	506000	Oh, and they've got absolutely no games I'm interested in.
506000	508000	Okay, yeah, I'll live.
508000	512000	I want that project cross whatever it's called.
512000	514000	Here's the reason why you need a 3DS, okay?
514000	519000	You take 3D pictures of cats and send them to your friends via SwapNote.
519000	522000	Can the Vita do that? I don't think so.
522000	526000	Is the power of three-dimensional cats in the PlayStation 3?
526000	528000	Maybe, but they're not unleashing it.
528000	531000	The 3DS is where 3D cat pics are at, sir.
531000	535000	Technically, I think if you have a 3D TV, I think you can view 3D photos.
535000	536000	You shut up!
536000	538000	I could give half a fuck.
538000	539000	Because I know...
539000	541000	But I'm keeping my half a fuck for when I need it.
541000	545000	Because I think there are some Sony cameras that do shoot in 3D.
545000	547000	I guess that is true.
547000	549000	Stop making points, asshole!
551000	553000	How dare you prove me wrong?
553000	555000	I don't know if I'm just speculating.
555000	556000	Oh, okay.
556000	559000	But you see, I've got that aura about anything I say to people.
559000	562000	Yeah, that's plausible. I'm gonna go with that.
563000	568000	If I look at the comments for last week's show on vognetwork.com,
568000	570000	apparently you are now right.
570000	572000	I even had to butt in and say,
572000	574000	Hold on, guys. Hold on. Slow down.
574000	577000	Loki's not right all the time. Don't let his ego get too big.
579000	582000	But apparently, Loki is like Miss Cleo now.
582000	583000	He knows everything.
583000	587000	So, kind of on a tangent here, but it's sort of...
587000	591000	I just started, out of curiosity, because I saw someone retweet him.
591000	594000	I started following Michael Pachter on Twitter.
594000	595000	Oh, yeah.
595000	598000	And, you know, he makes comments about things.
598000	600000	Some of his comments I just have...
600000	603000	Famous games analyst, right? The one that all the news stations call.
603000	606000	He's a game analyst. I don't like him because he's a game analyst.
606000	609000	And he does the same thing I do, except he gets paid, like, six figures or something like that.
610000	611000	Games analyst.
611000	613000	But anyways, so he's like...
613000	615000	And it didn't make any sense to me.
615000	622000	He's basically talking about how he thinks the Wii U is gonna do roughly about 50% of the units that the Wii did at launch.
623000	628000	But it's gonna have a good launch because it's already established.
628000	631000	You've got the hardcore gamers that are gonna buy into it.
631000	634000	And also because of the lack of units out there.
634000	640000	I'm like, how the fuck does a shortage on the system mean it's gonna sell better?
640000	643000	Ask the Wii. It worked.
643000	647000	It'll sell out because we've only put ten units out there.
647000	650000	Because it's what's gonna make the headlines on the local news.
650000	652000	Local news is stupid, okay.
652000	660000	Crazy motherfuckers lining up to get a Wii U at Kmart, selling them on eBay for six figures, all that stuff.
660000	662000	Except, here's the problem.
662000	664000	Nintendo plays that game, too.
664000	668000	Nintendo always does the shit where it's like, oh, there's like ten of them out there.
668000	673000	The only system that I don't think they really did that with was the 3DS, and look how that turned out.
673000	674000	Yeah, but here's the thing.
674000	678000	So you know that those things are going to be fucking impossible to find.
678000	681000	Just because they're gonna be hoping that the hype machine takes over.
681000	688000	Yeah, but the problem is the hype machine also didn't have to compete against the whole presidential campaign that's going on around the same time.
688000	690000	That's gonna eat out of headlines.
690000	692000	I'm gonna say, I'm gonna put this out there.
692000	697000	I think that they're probably not looking for the same demographic as paying attention to the presidential campaign.
697000	699000	Sad but true point.
699000	701000	The Wii U is for, what's the word I'm looking for?
701000	703000	Oh yeah, grade schoolers.
703000	706000	The presidential campaign is being run by grade schoolers.
706000	712000	The Wii U is meant for people that already own the Wii, but yet want another system that plays the same shit.
712000	714000	But nobody wants another system that plays the Wii.
714000	716000	That would be people that own the DS that bought the 3DS.
716000	718000	It's very clear that 47-
718000	719000	He's not allowed to talk anymore.
719000	722000	It's very clear that 47% of Americans don't care about the Wii U.
722000	725000	More like 7 to 4.
752000	755000	Yes, that's gonna be every show until the Wii launches, and then some.
782000	786000	On Bobby's last show, and this is all I hear.
812000	815000	It means playing together with our friends and family.
815000	817000	We as in multiple people.
817000	819000	Sexy party as in sexy party.
819000	824000	It looks fucking awesome and you're gonna have a party because it's sexy graphics all up on your fucking walls.
827000	831000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.
831000	833000	Dark Sakura.
833000	835000	I played WoW.
835000	837000	I have a tune at 84.
837000	840000	And I've been playing Mass Effect 3, which I beat again.
841000	842000	Again.
842000	843000	Again.
843000	844000	Again.
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	846000	Good times.
846000	849000	I love the comment from Black Wolf in our chat room right now.
849000	852000	Hey, sexy party.
854000	856000	It's not too late to get-
856000	858000	We'll buy Xbox style.
858000	860000	You make him the fucking spokesman.
860000	862000	That shit will sell.
862000	864000	Whoever can get that guy to sell their-
864000	866000	That shit will sell.
866000	869000	Whoever can get that guy to do the dance for the console will sell.
869000	871000	Nintendo, you wanna turn this shit around?
871000	874000	You know like, hey, you know, Wii would like to play?
874000	878000	It's fucking inside, it comes up to your door and it just fucking breaks it.
878000	880000	Busts it out.
880000	883000	I don't even know what this commercial is for but I'm gonna buy it.
885000	887000	I think Nintendo had something to do with it but-
887000	890000	That is quite possibly the worst thing you've ever said.
890000	892000	Reggie's gonna hear this.
892000	893000	Right.
893000	896000	Reggie's gonna hear this and then he's gonna be like, we're gonna do that.
896000	898000	And now the Wii's gonna be a big hit.
898000	900000	Good job.
914000	919000	I'm telling you man, you put that song, you put that guy in there, anything will sell.
919000	921000	I got some Peekman up in here.
921000	923000	It's another Mario game.
923000	925000	Hey.
925000	927000	Get a touch pad.
927000	930000	Alright, stop it now before this comes up funny.
930000	932000	Too late.
932000	934000	You shut up.
934000	935000	Alright.
935000	937000	Oh yes, gaming weeks, where were we?
937000	940000	Jamie beat Mass Effect 3 again and somehow that led to Gangnam Style.
940000	942000	Low key.
942000	944000	I played three things this week.
944000	947000	I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.
947000	949000	A little bit of multiplayer there.
949000	958000	I played Borderlands 2 which is awesome because I only touched it for about like two hours on Sunday.
958000	964000	So finally got a little bit more game time in this week and I have to say it's a lot different.
964000	971000	Well, not a lot different from Borderlands but there's definitely more of a story in the game and the humor is hilarious.
972000	980000	Just listening to Handsome Jack go on about Butt Stallion, his diamond horse is hilarious.
980000	985000	Or writing in the Claptrap who gives you a quest to go find his secret loot stash.
985000	990000	He needs you to pick up a few rocks and then a little checkpoint thing comes up.
990000	995000	Find 133,000 rocks.
995000	1006000	Or you must bring me the staff of the Destroyer of Worlds and then you must do a dance for me.
1006000	1008000	It's hilarious.
1008000	1011000	I'm really digging that game.
1011000	1015000	Then also I played a bit of Minecraft.
1015000	1017000	Still playing on the VoG network server.
1017000	1020000	Probably going to flip it over to creative mode in October here.
1020000	1022000	Can't wait.
1022000	1025000	May do it sooner. Maybe next week even.
1025000	1031000	Just so people can actually build some stuff without getting raped by Endermen.
1031000	1036000	And then finally played Bungie Ferret Tossing.
1036000	1043000	When I first played it I was actually ranked 4th for normal mode but I'm sure since I've only played it once I'm probably off.
1043000	1044000	Is that on the website?
1044000	1048000	I forgot to... I didn't have my phone with me so I didn't get the copy.
1048000	1050000	I don't know if you can look up your old codes.
1050000	1052000	The one you see on the Xbox is local.
1052000	1054000	So if you're 4th you're only 4th on your local warts.
1054000	1055000	You gotta do the online one.
1055000	1057000	You sure? Because I thought it was with friends too.
1057000	1058000	Is it?
1058000	1059000	I think it's friends on there.
1059000	1060000	I don't know. I thought...
1060000	1061000	Maybe. I don't know.
1061000	1063000	I thought you can't do that on Xbox Live.
1063000	1068000	But then again I think one of the other indie games I seem to remember in the past did something like that.
1068000	1069000	So maybe. I don't know.
1069000	1070000	Maybe. I don't know.
1070000	1073000	But if there's a way to look up that code again or I'll just do it next time.
1073000	1075000	We'll play it one more time and see where we get.
1075000	1078000	Bobby says he's waiting for creative mode to come build something.
1078000	1079000	He's scared of the creepers.
1079000	1082000	I'll flip it over tomorrow.
1082000	1083000	Good times.
1083000	1086000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1086000	1088000	That's it.
1088000	1089000	My gaming week?
1089000	1090000	Sadly not a lot.
1090000	1094000	I also play Bungie Paratossing which we've talked about during the show.
1094000	1096000	And right now I'm number one on the Internet Leaderboard.
1096000	1098000	Or at least I was the other day.
1098000	1100000	I haven't checked in like 48 hours.
1100000	1101000	So maybe I've been dethroned.
1101000	1102000	I don't know.
1102000	1106000	But it's super adorable, cute.
1106000	1109000	I mean is it like gonna blow your mind?
1109000	1112000	Like is it the second coming of Mass Effect?
1112000	1114000	Or is it the next World of Warcraft?
1114000	1115000	No it's not.
1115000	1117000	There better be a second coming of Mass Effect.
1117000	1119000	Well actually we'll get into that later.
1119000	1121000	It's funny you bring that up.
1121000	1122000	But it's a dollar.
1122000	1123000	And for a dollar it's a great value.
1123000	1125000	Very 80's retro arcade vibe.
1125000	1128000	And kind of like it feels familiar yet it doesn't feel familiar.
1128000	1132000	With the whole like being able to move the helicopter and the bungee separately is pretty cool.
1132000	1136000	But you know disclaimer. Full disclosure.
1136000	1137000	It was kind of our idea.
1137000	1139000	So of course we're gonna like it.
1139000	1143000	And our voices and our logos and our cats are in it.
1143000	1147000	Otherwise not a lot of new stuff this week.
1147000	1150000	Still playing World of Warcraft because the big expansion is next week.
1150000	1151000	So I'm trying to gear up.
1151000	1154000	My characters get ready to go to level 90.
1154000	1159000	I do plan on getting Torchlight 2 which came out today for 20 bucks.
1159000	1164000	Which is kind of the in a way answer to Diablo 3.
1164000	1166000	Because a lot of the people who worked on Diablo 1 and 2.
1166000	1168000	It's the 47% Diablo 3.
1168000	1171000	It's the poor man's Diablo 3.
1171000	1173000	It's the welfare Diablo 3. Thank you.
1173000	1177000	Well considering my copy of Diablo 3 was free though.
1177000	1179000	Because I signed the blood contract.
1179000	1182000	I don't know what political system that would be.
1182000	1183000	But who cares?
1183000	1184000	Socialism.
1184000	1186000	Who cares? They're video games.
1187000	1189000	So yeah I definitely plan on getting Torchlight 2.
1189000	1191000	And I'll be able to play that for like a day or two.
1191000	1193000	And then Mr. Pandaria is out and we all know.
1193000	1195000	Let's not even try to kid ourselves.
1195000	1196000	It's gonna dominate my week.
1196000	1199000	But I hope to get LittleBigPlanet Vita somewhere in there too.
1199000	1201000	It's starting to be that season.
1201000	1203000	I'm gonna fall behind on all these games I gotta play.
1203000	1205000	And it's all gonna be Warcraft's fault.
1205000	1206000	There's only one thing I wanna get.
1206000	1209000	Never discussed how costly that is.
1209000	1210000	Oh.
1210000	1212000	You wanna talk about this on the air?
1212000	1213000	No.
1213000	1214000	Wait for future week.
1214000	1219000	There's a 99 point a billion chance that I'm not gonna.
1219000	1220000	Alright.
1220000	1222000	Well maybe we'll get it out of you on a future episode.
1222000	1224000	Uh, Dan.
1224000	1225000	What have you been playing this week?
1225000	1227000	You wanna tell us about anything?
1227000	1229000	Borderlands 2.
1229000	1231000	How do you like it?
1231000	1233000	It's awesome.
1233000	1235000	Why?
1235000	1237000	Well it's like Borderlands 1.
1237000	1238000	Which was awesome.
1238000	1240000	But there's more of it.
1242000	1243000	Sounds good to me.
1243000	1244000	Yes it does.
1245000	1246000	Dan the man everybody.
1246000	1248000	Well I think just like the characters are more developed in the game.
1248000	1249000	Like they actually.
1249000	1250000	I don't know.
1250000	1252000	It seems like they have a lot more to do.
1252000	1253000	You know.
1253000	1257000	I think that the new characters are like way more generic than the original characters.
1257000	1258000	Which I don't like.
1258000	1259000	Like I looked at all four characters.
1259000	1261000	Which are basically the same four characters.
1261000	1263000	I know they're supposed to be like extra ones downloadable.
1263000	1266000	But I'm looking at the soldier and I said and I'll be in a black guy.
1266000	1268000	It's like you're generic sort of white guy.
1268000	1269000	And I'm like okay.
1269000	1271000	It's entertaining cause you know you need more.
1271000	1272000	Well yeah exactly.
1272000	1276000	I'm like well I'm gonna go ahead and like look around and check out all the different like customizable options.
1276000	1280000	Which is just mostly different colors and like two or three different heads per character.
1280000	1282000	At the beginning you unlock more stuff.
1282000	1284000	And so then I checked out the hunter.
1284000	1287000	Who in the first game was kind of a cool character and I started with him.
1287000	1291000	And now he just looks like a generic like Raiden cyber ninja sort of guy.
1291000	1292000	And I was like okay.
1292000	1295000	And then the girl who's still just a hot girl.
1295000	1301000	And the berserker who's now the gunzerker and he's like a midget kind of berserker.
1301000	1303000	With like giant guns.
1303000	1306000	And I'm just like oh I'm kinda gonna do this.
1306000	1309000	But then I remembered how much I hated using the berserker and how much I liked using the soldier.
1309000	1311000	So I went with Channing Tatum.
1311000	1314000	Yeah I went with the assassin Zero.
1314000	1319000	So I've got him going there and I'm digging it.
1319000	1321000	I almost definitely do the assassin next.
1321000	1324000	Because I immediately started playing with sniper rifles and pistols.
1324000	1326000	And I was just like why did I choose the soldier?
1326000	1329000	And then I got my turret and I was like this is why I chose the soldier.
1329000	1331000	Because the turret is awesome.
1332000	1334000	Do you want to show back Rob?
1334000	1339000	Doesn't matter but I'll just say in Borderlands 1 the only character I've played.
1339000	1341000	Because I'm about five years behind the rest of you.
1341000	1343000	The only character I've played is the sexy lady.
1343000	1347000	And I love being able to press the button and run like hell.
1347000	1352000	So hopefully if the gal is kind of like a clone or whatever.
1352000	1354000	Then I hope I can run.
1354000	1358000	Well she's one of the sirens and apparently there's only like five sirens in the whole world or something like that.
1358000	1362000	And it's cool because you run into all the old characters again.
1362000	1365000	She shows up early on and beats that ass.
1365000	1368000	Yeah it's pretty sweet.
1368000	1375000	And then also they had an interview today or something that they said that they've built it where they can add more character classes later on DLC.
1375000	1378000	Because they already announced the fifth one that they're going to do.
1378000	1380000	Right it wasn't like the...
1380000	1381000	The mecromancer.
1381000	1382000	The mecromancer.
1382000	1384000	And then they've got more that they could possibly do later on.
1384000	1387000	Here's the thing that's weird about Gearbox.
1387000	1389000	Gearbox and Borderlands are fucking just awesome.
1389000	1391000	It's just like a great game.
1391000	1393000	And then they also did Duke Nukem Forever.
1393000	1395000	They didn't do Duke Nukem Forever.
1395000	1399000	All they did was take what was done, make it work, and put it out.
1399000	1401000	So you can't blame Gearbox for Duke Nukem Forever.
1401000	1403000	And it had to be released.
1403000	1405000	There's no way you couldn't have released that game.
1405000	1407000	It had to be done.
1407000	1409000	It had to be unleashed upon the world.
1409000	1411000	And if you want a copy now you can get one brand new for ten bucks.
1411000	1413000	Well they shouldn't have put their name on it then.
1413000	1415000	They should have just finished it.
1416000	1417000	Can't blame them for that.
1417000	1419000	You want to get paid right?
1419000	1421000	Shit! They could have put my name on it.
1429000	1431000	That's all the text would have said on the back of the box.
1431000	1433000	Wouldn't have said Duke is back. Wouldn't have said he's a badass.
1433000	1435000	It would have literally said fuck it.
1435000	1437000	It had to be released.
1437000	1439000	Alright.
1439000	1441000	I think that's it for my gaming week.
1441000	1443000	Dan's going to be reading my stories tonight by the way.
1443000	1444000	Is he?
1444000	1445000	Yeah he is.
1445000	1447000	Are you just fighting again? It's always awkward.
1447000	1449000	Dan wouldn't give me the mic back until I snatched it from him.
1449000	1451000	He doesn't like sharing a mic with me.
1451000	1453000	I don't like sharing anything with you.
1453000	1455000	Alright.
1455000	1457000	She was mad I bought a new video card.
1457000	1459000	Among other reasons.
1459000	1463000	I got a new video card and now she's mad because my computer's got better graphics than hers.
1463000	1465000	Oh. That is a reason to be upset though.
1465000	1467000	I'm going to go ahead and put this out there.
1467000	1470000	It has way better graphics than hers.
1470000	1474000	I don't mean to get in the middle of arguments because that's not what it's trying to do.
1474000	1476000	Like mind numbingly better graphics.
1476000	1480000	But if Alan did that to me, that would be grounds for sleeping on the couch.
1480000	1486000	His computer already runs a little better than mine and I am a little jealous because I'm like your computer's not as good.
1486000	1488000	Why does it run better? I don't understand.
1488000	1490000	This makes me upset.
1490000	1491000	Overclock?
1491000	1492000	I don't know.
1492000	1494000	Witchcraft.
1494000	1496000	That's what. Powered by witchcraft.
1496000	1498000	Alright. Housekeeping tonight.
1498000	1501000	Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook community.
1501000	1503000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
1503000	1507000	We will be back with episode number 475 next Sunday.
1507000	1510000	That would be Sunday the 30th.
1510000	1514000	We'll be back. Last day of the month with episode 475.
1514000	1518000	Alright. Let's get into what's going on in video game news.
1518000	1520000	And we'll go back to Tokyo Game Show I guess.
1520000	1523000	Yes. We're going to talk about Sony and their little press conference that they had.
1523000	1527000	They announced a new redesigned Playstation 3.
1527000	1530000	It's flatter than ever before.
1530000	1536000	It's like. Yeah. And it's got texture on top. Cool.
1536000	1538000	So it doesn't look as dusty?
1538000	1544000	No. Actually it looks. I like the little texture they have on it. But yeah. It's even thinner.
1544000	1549000	It's like someone ran over it with an SUV or something like that. So. Neat.
1549000	1554000	They're going to have a 250GB model which is going to be coming out I think next week actually.
1554000	1557000	With the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3.
1557000	1562000	And then also 30 bucks towards Dust 514 in case you wanted to play that.
1562000	1569000	And then of course later on in the year at the end of October a 500GB model will launch for $299.
1569000	1574000	And they'll include. They're also going to have like an Assassin's Creed 3 bundle and stuff like that.
1574000	1579000	It's weird though. In Europe and Hong Kong they also got a 12GB flash memory version.
1579000	1583000	And here's the strangest part about that is. You can add a hard drive to that.
1583000	1587000	But when you add the hard drive to it. The 12GB of flash memory stopped working.
1587000	1591000	It's probably like a bypass or something. It's a weird thing.
1591000	1594000	Yeah. It's just. It's really strange. How do you load disks in the new one?
1594000	1596000	Same way as the old one.
1596000	1598000	Okay. So it's still like a tray? Yeah. Or like a slot?
1598000	1603000	Yeah. It makes sense because if they did a regular. I don't know. I don't know why.
1603000	1608000	Looking at the picture it almost looked like one side slid over like it was a top loader.
1608000	1614000	And I was just like. That's really bizarre. But if it's a slot loader I guess.
1614000	1619000	Yeah. I don't even think they have any top loading Blu-ray players. I mean that would have been strange.
1619000	1624000	Well it would have been a way to price it down another. Because it's only what? $30 less?
1624000	1630000	Well yeah. It's $269. But I mean still that's pretty good for a 250GB system.
1630000	1632000	Isn't there a 600GB version?
1632000	1635000	Well $500. Okay $500. That's a lot of gigabytes.
1635000	1640000	That's. I mean I have a 500GB hard drive in mind and I'll never fill that thing up.
1640000	1642000	That's like a week worth of saving stuff for Jamie.
1642000	1644000	Let's say PlayStation Plus. In which case I could.
1644000	1649000	I have an $80 and I'm having a lot of issues. Like I do have to kind of cycle through stuff that I'm not really playing anymore.
1649000	1655000	I got to delete it out. DC Universe Online or whatever had to go and you know. I'm having problems.
1655000	1663000	And that's just $80. So I could use a 500GB or rig my PlayStation to use an external. I don't know.
1663000	1666000	Because I have a terabyte hard drive. I just use a supportable drive.
1666000	1670000	Also another thing they announced is that they're going to be doing the PlayStation Plus service.
1670000	1672000	It's going to be coming to the Vita in November.
1672000	1675000	Yay! Free stuff on the Vita. Awesome.
1675000	1677000	Yes. So that's pretty awesome.
1677000	1679000	Not really free.
1679000	1680000	Well name free if you pay for it.
1680000	1682000	Freer than Xbox Live.
1682000	1683000	True that.
1683000	1689000	It's true. Also PlayStation Mobile is going to be launching on October 3rd as well.
1689000	1691000	So they've got that.
1691000	1695000	I thought there already was PlayStation Mobile. What's the difference? I already thought there was.
1695000	1699000	Because I know Flaco Jones has one of those phones I think. I've heard them talk about it before.
1699000	1704000	But I don't think that they've actually launched like any of the store for it yet.
1704000	1706000	I think they have some games that you can buy.
1706000	1708000	There are at least like three games on it.
1708000	1710000	But I don't think that they have like the PlayStation store yet.
1710000	1719000	But they're redoing the whole thing because now that they've broken up from Ericsson, like the whole PlayStation phone project, you know, what was it called? The Xperia, right? The Play.
1719000	1720000	The Xperia Play, yeah.
1720000	1726000	And they sold like eight of them. Really? Really?
1726000	1729000	Well the thing is those phones didn't look that bad.
1729000	1730000	My wife is a snot.
1730000	1739000	Their tablets that they have though are really weird looking. Like that one that looks like actually the new PlayStation 3 split in half and it's on a hinge or something like that.
1739000	1743000	Well you don't want to make it look like a tablet or Apple will sue the shit out of you.
1743000	1747000	I was going to say, you know your stuff when it comes to phones because it's kind of like, you know, related to the job.
1747000	1749000	Yeah, that's what I got to do these days.
1749000	1750000	How do you feel about iPhone 5?
1750000	1755000	It's like a longer iPhone.
1755000	1757000	It's like somebody dipped it in water.
1757000	1762000	It's like a longer iPhone that's getting some Android features. So there you go. Good job.
1763000	1773000	I like the iPhone. I'm actually a big fan of the iPhone. I don't have one anymore but I miss it because I like the way that Apple makes all their stuff play together and I think it's a great product. It's smooth and elegant.
1773000	1774000	How about the Windows 8 phones?
1774000	1782000	I haven't really got to play with them. I mean I played with one of like, I guess it would be the Windows 7 phone, whatever the current generation of Windows phones are.
1782000	1788000	Yeah, they're cool. I mean there's nothing too bad to say about them but you can't beat the support that Apple has gotten for the iPhone.
1788000	1791000	I was just curious. No reason.
1791000	1792000	The iPhone long.
1792000	1794000	Some of their apps need a little tweaking.
1794000	1802000	Well, here's the thing. I want to replace my iPhone 4 and I'm no longer in contract. So the logical choice is we have all the apps, blah, blah, blah, get an iPhone 5, stupid.
1802000	1816000	But then I'm like, well, in my mind I'm justified if I just don't get an iPhone 5 because I have the iPad because clearly I've gone down on Apple several times in the past couple years.
1816000	1817000	Gone down.
1817000	1827000	I have an iPad, the new iPad or whatever. So technically my apps, I have something to use them on. So I could go Android or something else but I don't know, I hear mixed things about it.
1827000	1834000	To give you a perspective on it, I've had two Android phones now and the next time I come up for an upgrade, I'm probably getting another Apple.
1834000	1840000	I'm thinking about Windows 8 phones though, holding out for those. Although Windows 8 doesn't really excite me, I don't know.
1840000	1842000	That sounds like a bad idea.
1842000	1844000	What? You want the mic?
1844000	1845000	I have a Galaxy S2.
1845000	1847000	Come over here and take it from me.
1849000	1850000	No.
1850000	1852000	She wants to comment, let the lady have the mic.
1852000	1853000	Give it!
1853000	1855000	See, I've got my wonderful-
1855000	1857000	Don't break, that's how mics get broken.
1857000	1861000	I have my wonderful Samsung Galaxy S2 and it works just fine.
1861000	1863000	Alan wants an S3.
1863000	1868000	So, first of all, from everyone I've heard who's tested Window 8, it's shit.
1869000	1871000	Let me finish-
1871000	1873000	Shut up.
1873000	1879000	After having used a Windows phone of my friends, it's shit.
1879000	1884000	I can only think that if you put shit on shit, it will get shittier.
1884000	1891000	I don't think that you can- you have to put a seed of something in there to make the flowers grow and without that it's just shit.
1892000	1901000	Yeah, Windows 8 I'm a little less excited about, but I thought maybe- since it kind of makes your desktop look like a tablet, I thought maybe the mobile version would kind of rock.
1901000	1904000	Tablet or ugly ass art display.
1904000	1909000	It's like I'm walking into a fucking hipster art gallery staring at the damn Metro interface.
1909000	1910000	Alright.
1910000	1915000	Because they thought that neon orange, pink, green, and blue was a fucking fantastic idea.
1915000	1919000	That'll be- that just won't burn my retinas.
1919000	1923000	Let's move on before we get too far off track.
1923000	1925000	Yeah, other real quick stuff.
1925000	1928000	Of course, also, the Vita's getting some new colors.
1928000	1934000	Red and blue. I'm not gonna say cosmic red and sapphire blue because it's just fucking- just call it red.
1934000	1937000	Say PlayStation Vita red.
1937000	1939000	PlayStation Vita blue.
1939000	1941000	You don't have to get all sexy with the name.
1941000	1943000	Cosmic red!
1943000	1945000	Sapphire blue!
1945000	1947000	I'm just saying that's more of a cadmium color.
1947000	1949000	Saturday night vomit green!
1949000	1951000	Is that like a Crayola?
1951000	1952000	Something like that.
1952000	1953000	Or is that a Pantone code?
1953000	1958000	Cadmium is used as a red dye on the warm tone.
1958000	1963000	It's crimson's, like, especially an alizarin crimson that's on the cooler spectrum of red.
1963000	1965000	And mommy says I'm not supposed to eat red dye.
1965000	1966000	And some of the coolest news-
1966000	1967000	Excuse me, this is made from bug butts.
1967000	1969000	Some of the coolest news about the Vita-
1969000	1970000	Just true.
1970000	1975000	Muramasa the Demon Blade is gonna be coming onto the Vita at the end of March.
1975000	1976000	So that's pretty sweet.
1976000	1978000	It is true, by the way.
1978000	1979000	Yes, I understand.
1979000	1981000	Red dye number 40 is made from beetles.
1981000	1983000	Muramasa the Demon Blade? Made from beetles?
1983000	1989000	Yeah. Vanilla Wear's really sexy looking 2D action game.
1989000	1991000	Alright, so that was it for Sony, yes?
1991000	1992000	That was it.
1992000	1998000	Let's talk about Microsoft for a minute over on this side of the pond because this did not come out of Tokyo Game Show
1998000	2001000	because, lol, Microsoft in Japan.
2001000	2006000	But this is pretty big news here for, you know, the US and Europe and places where people are actually buying Xbox 360s.
2006000	2010000	You know, they might do better in Japan if they had Sai, you know, pimping out the Xbox 360.
2010000	2012000	Buy Xbox style!
2012000	2014000	Okay, forget it.
2014000	2018000	Apparently Microsoft has hired a CBS executive.
2018000	2022000	As in, you know, the network that has my favorite TV show, Big Brother.
2022000	2026000	Oh great, that with the Kinect cameras. I can't wait.
2026000	2029000	Thank you.
2029000	2035000	By a vote of 3 to 1, Dan, you have been evicted from the Kinect house.
2035000	2042000	Alright, uh, anyhow, apparently a new exec has been hired from CBS.
2042000	2047000	It's Nancy Tellum and she was with CBS as entertainment president before.
2047000	2051000	I don't know exactly what she did as CB- oh, I mean, I know she was entertainment president.
2051000	2054000	I don't know what she did or did not bring to the network.
2054000	2057000	She brought wonderful puns with her last name.
2057000	2059000	You tell him!
2059000	2061000	That wasn't very funny.
2061000	2063000	Get out.
2063000	2073000	But CBS has been doing pretty well the past couple years, so I imagine it's pretty in part to whatever she's doing.
2073000	2082000	Anyhow, she's going to be making content, or I guess leading this effort to make content on the Xbox 360 that will reach, quote, a very broad range of consumers.
2082000	2085000	We're going to reach out to a very broad range of consumers.
2085000	2089000	When I first got to CBS, we looked at what the core audience was and built from there.
2089000	2093000	And that's just what I'm going to do again.
2093000	2104000	Interesting, because if I were to look at the core audience of the Xbox 360, I'd basically be looking at, you know, making Spike TV or G4 or something like that all over again.
2104000	2107000	Now, CBS used to be the grandma network, right?
2107000	2112000	Murder She Wrote, Diagnosis Murder, Chicago Hope, all that stuff.
2112000	2115000	What is it about old people and murder shows?
2115000	2119000	Because old people are paranoid and they think everyone's out to murder them.
2119000	2121000	That's all old people can think about is death.
2121000	2128000	It's good that they have an old person advocate for them that's stopping the murderer so that the old people can feel safe.
2128000	2136000	Well, here's the thing. Murder She Wrote is exactly what the Xbox 360 needs to expand their audience.
2136000	2138000	It'd be a point and click game.
2138000	2140000	That actually would be a good game.
2140000	2141000	They already have that on PC.
2141000	2144000	Yeah, I was going to say, I think they have those games. Nancy Drew games.
2144000	2147000	That shit sells like crazy.
2147000	2152000	It's kind of like the Undiscussed thing in gaming, like no podcast I know of talks about it.
2152000	2154000	But those games sell.
2154000	2157000	There's nothing left for old people anymore since Andy Griffith died.
2157000	2162000	Well, there's other celebrities that, you know, old people love.
2162000	2163000	Wilford Brimley.
2163000	2166000	Okay, you explain to me how Dancing with the Stars is popular.
2166000	2168000	Who's watching Dancing with the Stars?
2168000	2171000	Stacy Keibler was on it and they keep hoping she'll come back.
2171000	2173000	Who's watching Dancing with the Stars? Who is watching it?
2173000	2174000	Somebody.
2174000	2175000	Old people.
2175000	2176000	I watch it on YouTube.
2176000	2179000	Old people and Jamie are watching Dancing with the Stars.
2179000	2184000	I watched three episodes of Dancing with the Stars when I was in the hospital.
2184000	2190000	I watched while Stacy Keibler was on because she has pretty epic legs.
2190000	2192000	I watched no episodes of that.
2192000	2196000	I was just wondering, I just kept thinking that they were moving independently of her, that they were their own entity.
2196000	2198000	Because, I mean, seriously, no one has legs that long.
2198000	2201000	Anyhow, back to the article in question.
2201000	2202000	We don't know what type-
2202000	2204000	No! No!
2204000	2209000	You know what the scam of that is, is that Stacy Keibler is like a professionally trained dancer.
2209000	2213000	So, why the fuck was she on Dancing with the Stars?
2213000	2214000	Well, it's just like that one guy from-
2214000	2215000	She didn't even win.
2215000	2216000	The Drew Carey show or whatever.
2216000	2217000	But, I will admit-
2217000	2218000	What's his name?
2218000	2219000	Drew Carey.
2219000	2220000	She is smokingly hot.
2221000	2227000	The year I watched, Christy Yamaguchi was on and it was clear that she was like a million li-
2227000	2228000	Wait a minute.
2228000	2230000	This show has just resorted to Dancing with the Stars talk.
2230000	2232000	I am drawing the fucking line here.
2232000	2234000	The line must be drawn here!
2237000	2238000	Back to the story.
2240000	2242000	We don't know exactly what type of content this is.
2242000	2245000	Is it short little pieces like inside Xbox?
2245000	2246000	Rest in peace.
2246000	2249000	Is it longer pieces like TV shows?
2249000	2251000	Julie Chen hosted programming?
2251000	2252000	Who knows?
2252000	2256000	Is it a crappy reality show where you vied to become a product tester?
2256000	2257000	Let's hope!
2257000	2260000	Let's hope because we haven't heard anything about a tester before.
2260000	2263000	I didn't see online casting, so I'm thinking the tester got cancelled.
2263000	2264000	I don't know.
2264000	2265000	And there was much rejoicing.
2265000	2266000	Do we know?
2266000	2267000	Yay.
2267000	2268000	We do.
2268000	2269000	We have some-
2269000	2270000	We're-
2270000	2274000	The nice thing is, having this podcast for ten years,
2274000	2278000	I think we've finally ascended to about that D-list video game celebrity list,
2278000	2281000	where we are on par with some of the tester contestants.
2281000	2282000	So we-
2282000	2285000	We should get Kathy Griffin to be our advocate.
2286000	2289000	You'd think one of them would have told us if they're doing a tester for or not.
2289000	2290000	We haven't heard.
2290000	2292000	But anyway, I don't-
2292000	2294000	As far as the Xbox programming goes,
2296000	2297000	what do you think?
2297000	2301000	I mean, what do you think this means for the direction of Microsoft in the future and all that?
2301000	2305000	I mean, it's very clear Microsoft is trying to infiltrate the living room
2305000	2309000	and maybe will broadcast programming all over your walls and who knows what.
2309000	2311000	I- Right now, you know, I can't get excited about anything
2311000	2316000	because when they were talking about all their, you know, TV network partnerships and stuff like that,
2316000	2317000	it just became like a bunch of apps.
2317000	2318000	I just-
2318000	2319000	Eh.
2320000	2321000	It's an interesting idea.
2321000	2324000	I just don't know if I trust that it'll work.
2324000	2326000	You know what- You know what was a great idea?
2326000	2327000	You know what was a great idea?
2327000	2328000	One versus one hundred.
2328000	2329000	One versus one hundred.
2329000	2331000	That was a TV- That was your TV network.
2331000	2332000	Wasn't it?
2332000	2334000	Oh my god, Dan and I agree on something.
2334000	2335000	Hold on, I gotta chat with Dan.
2335000	2337000	Wasn't one versus one hundred awesome?
2337000	2339000	One versus one hundred was great.
2339000	2344000	People were like getting on Xbox Live and stuff just to play one versus one hundred.
2344000	2347000	Why did they get rid of one versus one hundred?
2347000	2349000	Because Microsoft sucks.
2349000	2350000	Thank you.
2350000	2351000	We agree on something.
2352000	2353000	Moving on.
2354000	2355000	More news.
2355000	2356000	Dark Sakura.
2357000	2359000	Well, I killed my husband five seconds ago.
2359000	2361000	No, not really.
2361000	2363000	I just punched him in the kidneys.
2366000	2368000	So, there's been an announcement for PlayStation 3.
2368000	2371000	Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.
2371000	2372000	Ermahgerd!
2372000	2374000	Ermahgerd, Kerndomhertz.
2375000	2379000	Famitsu reported that it will be out next year for PlayStation 3,
2379000	2384000	and I have no idea what's gonna be special about it other than being HD.
2384000	2385000	Maybe I'll actually beat it.
2385000	2387000	It's the actual Kingdom Hearts game.
2387000	2388000	It's, er, Kingdom Hearts 1.
2388000	2390000	Erm, was it, er, one?
2390000	2391000	The Chains of Memories.
2391000	2393000	Chains of Memories and 358.
2393000	2396000	Yeah, and 358.2dia.
2396000	2398000	So, I kind of want it.
2398000	2399000	Which is a terrible name.
2399000	2404000	Well 358.2, I had heard they don't know if they're really gonna port the game.
2404000	2405000	Has cutscenes.
2405000	2406000	It's just gonna be the cutscenes.
2406000	2407000	In pretty HD.
2409000	2410000	That could be interesting.
2410000	2411000	I kind of want it.
2411000	2412000	Now, here's the big question.
2412000	2415000	Is this building the hype train for a Kingdom Hearts 3?
2415000	2417000	Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
2417000	2418000	Why don't they just put two in there too?
2418000	2419000	Yeah, and where's two?
2419000	2422000	Or is this, you know, let's milk this slowly?
2423000	2425000	It's, it's Sony.
2425000	2426000	And Disney.
2426000	2428000	How many things are they gonna milk?
2428000	2429000	All the things.
2429000	2431000	One teat at a time.
2431000	2433000	All the things.
2433000	2434000	All of them.
2434000	2435000	The things?
2436000	2437000	Shit.
2437000	2439000	It's, it's Square Enix.
2439000	2442000	And, you know, well, we're gonna get in this.
2442000	2443000	All the things.
2443000	2444000	They are milking their shit.
2444000	2451000	Yet, yet we're saying all this and I will sit right here and tell you, I am buying this shit the day it comes out.
2451000	2452000	Abso-fucking-lutely.
2452000	2453000	I just said I wanted it.
2453000	2455000	Sign me up for corporate whoredom.
2455000	2456000	Nope.
2456000	2457000	Not you.
2457000	2458000	Not me.
2458000	2459000	Sitting out.
2459000	2461000	Probably one of the people at the corporate teat of Squeenix.
2461000	2462000	I'll be, gimme.
2462000	2463000	I.
2463000	2464000	No you can't have it.
2464000	2465000	I also missed.
2465000	2466000	No you can't have it.
2466000	2468000	I also missed Chains of Memories.
2468000	2472000	Before she can buy any more Kingdom Hearts games, she has to beat her copies of Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.
2472000	2475000	No, I have to, you have to fix my copy of 2.
2475000	2477000	I can't, your copy of 2 is fine.
2477000	2478000	You just need to restart.
2478000	2480000	I mean, it's not like you would know where you left off anyway.
2480000	2481000	You haven't played it in like, what?
2481000	2482000	I don't know where I left off.
2482000	2483000	10 years?
2483000	2486000	I'm, uh, fucking, I have to go back and do the pirate thing again.
2486000	2487000	I was even further.
2487000	2492000	And then she made me stop playing, cause she was not, that I was gonna beat the game first.
2492000	2493000	Give it.
2493000	2494000	I said you could.
2494000	2496000	The thing is, all I did was just customize.
2496000	2498000	The only guy that upgraded was Sora though.
2498000	2499000	Give.
2499000	2500000	I didn't upgrade Donald or Goofy.
2500000	2501000	Give.
2501000	2502000	Loki, how's your dinner?
2502000	2503000	Tasty.
2503000	2504000	Give it.
2504000	2506000	Dan, go leave and get me something to eat.
2509000	2511000	I'll punch you in the kidney.
2512000	2514000	You'll pee blood for a year.
2516000	2517000	Next story.
2517000	2518000	Help.
2518000	2522000	If he's peeing blood for a year, that's seriously a clotting problem.
2522000	2523000	Um.
2524000	2525000	I'll give you a clot.
2525000	2526000	Anyways.
2528000	2529000	So Valve.
2529000	2531000	They've got some hardware coming.
2531000	2532000	Funny.
2532000	2533000	Valve hardware.
2533000	2535000	Valve is a piece of hardware.
2536000	2537000	Read the news.
2537000	2538000	Alright.
2538000	2539000	So anyways.
2540000	2542000	Their hardware is going into the beta next year.
2542000	2543000	But what is their hardware?
2543000	2545000	Eh, who knows.
2545000	2550000	But it's going, they're having internal beta tests of their hardware.
2551000	2555000	I only hope that some sort of computer is shaped like one of the portal turrets.
2555000	2557000	Because then I'd have to buy it.
2558000	2559000	I mean, come on.
2559000	2560000	That'd be awesome.
2560000	2561000	That would be kind of awesome, actually.
2561000	2563000	Did you see the video this week from Weta?
2563000	2564000	I want one.
2564000	2565000	Yeah, I did.
2565000	2566000	Yeah.
2566000	2567000	Yeah.
2567000	2568000	So.
2568000	2569000	Just try to get near that baby.
2569000	2572000	Interesting that it's going to be next year for the Valve hardware, right?
2572000	2574000	And not before the holiday season?
2574000	2575000	It's going to be next year, yeah.
2575000	2578000	Is that because we're going to expect a big push?
2578000	2582000	Although, 2013 seems like a bad time to release a console if you're somebody new.
2582000	2585000	Because you're going to have Sony and Microsoft enter the ring next year.
2585000	2588000	As far as we know, they're both going to debut their consoles next year.
2588000	2591000	Sony could go another year.
2591000	2593000	I think Microsoft will launch next year.
2593000	2596000	Sony might go wait until 2014.
2596000	2597000	It's going to be rough.
2597000	2600000	It's hard to say if any of them are going to launch next year.
2600000	2604000	I mean, I think they could still be fine launching hardware.
2604000	2606000	Because I don't think they're really going to be competing against consoles.
2606000	2610000	I mean, they're kind of like, hey, here's a cool way you can play some awesome PC games.
2610000	2612000	It's almost like an on-live type thing.
2612000	2616000	I just don't know how they're going to put out hardware.
2616000	2620000	Because that's one thing with PC is that you have to constantly upgrade.
2620000	2627000	So, even if they put out some nice hardware that runs stuff now, two years from now, it's not going to run stuff that well.
2627000	2628000	That's true.
2628000	2629000	Which is too bad.
2629000	2631000	Because that's kind of the dilemma I'm in right now.
2631000	2632000	I use my laptop more.
2632000	2637000	Although my laptop has better specs than my PC.
2637000	2642000	My PC is clocked faster and was my gaming machine for a while.
2642000	2647000	But now it's old graphics cards and processor and stuff.
2647000	2648000	Can't keep up with it.
2648000	2651000	And I've got to buy all new stuff to be able to do it.
2651000	2652000	That's the thing, though.
2652000	2659000	A console-like device for a PC is going to have to be constantly upgraded.
2660000	2661000	Good point.
2662000	2665000	Moving on to something else out of Tokyo Game Show.
2665000	2670000	And speaking of consoles, this will be a big console game whenever it's released, I'm sure.
2670000	2674000	It's a new game from Kiji Inafune, who was the guy that left Capcom.
2674000	2675000	Who used to do Mega Man, right?
2675000	2676000	So, what's he doing now?
2676000	2678000	Oh, and Dead Rising?
2678000	2679000	Oh, yeah.
2679000	2681000	So, what's he working on now?
2681000	2685000	It's a game called Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z.
2685000	2687000	Yes, that Ninja Gaiden.
2687000	2691000	It's not part of the other Ninja Gaiden trilogy.
2691000	2692000	This is a new game.
2692000	2694000	The trailer was very weird.
2694000	2696000	It was talking about zombies and stuff.
2696000	2702000	And apparently, the new protagonist in this game, the mission is to kill Ryu Hayabusa.
2702000	2704000	So, that could be interesting.
2707000	2708000	The trailer looked pretty sweet.
2708000	2713000	It's got kind of like that cel-shading graphics and pretty action-packed.
2713000	2716000	But it was very heavy on the cutscene, so you couldn't really tell what the game looked like.
2716000	2717000	It's gotta have zombies in it.
2717000	2718000	Of course.
2719000	2721000	Sell millions more copies.
2721000	2723000	Why can't they have sea creatures?
2723000	2728000	This is coming out from Tecmo, and they are partnering up with Spark, which is a western developer.
2728000	2732000	So, that will be coming, I'm assuming, next year at some point.
2732000	2734000	In the meantime...
2734000	2741000	Well, there's actually been a trademark renewal that Microsoft has done for Killer Instinct.
2742000	2748000	They've actually stated that they've either renewed or refiled the trademark applications.
2748000	2754000	But there was an interview not too long ago where one of their 3D modelers at Rare said that
2754000	2761000	Microsoft wasn't interested in doing another fighting game, so they don't think it ever will be done.
2761000	2763000	But who knows? Maybe we'll get...
2763000	2764000	Let's just hope he was lying.
2764000	2766000	Maybe he just didn't know.
2766000	2769000	Maybe now the time is right.
2770000	2773000	I do think that a lot of it is wishful thinking.
2773000	2778000	It's probably just that they have to renew the trademarks so somebody else doesn't come in and do a Killer Instinct game or whatever.
2778000	2781000	But it certainly does raise hope.
2781000	2784000	It would be a killer launch title for whatever the next Xbox is.
2784000	2788000	We were just watching playthroughs the other day, and they have the worst necks.
2788000	2790000	And their skin looks like plastic.
2790000	2792000	But some of the best music.
2792000	2793000	I know, right?
2793000	2796000	Like freakin'...
2796000	2798000	What's-her-face music from KI2?
2798000	2800000	Orchid's music from KI2 was the best.
2800000	2803000	The only one I have here handy real quick is...
2806000	2810000	I remember when I lived in Alabama and Dan and I were just friends on the interwebs.
2810000	2815000	How he recorded, waited until the game started up with Orchid's music to record it for me.
2815000	2818000	And didn't you say it took you like 30 minutes to do it?
2818000	2820000	Aww, that's kinda romantic.
2820000	2828000	I had a really hard time getting like the exact spot where it started because I don't know if there was a sound test or if I just wasn't smart enough to use it.
2828000	2831000	That's like really sweet in a way.
2831000	2832000	I'm a nice guy.
2832000	2833000	Look at you guys now.
2833000	2834000	Yep.
2834000	2836000	What happened? Oh, you got married. That's right. You got married.
2836000	2837000	Jimmy!
2837000	2838000	Alright.
2840000	2841000	I love that bastard.
2841000	2845000	So I'm sure I speak for everybody when I say Killer Instinct 3, please.
2846000	2847000	I wish.
2847000	2852000	Release dates! Let's travel around the world and talk about games that will actually be coming out sometime soon.
2852000	2857000	Yes, this week we've got the Angry Birds trilogy on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the 3DS.
2857000	2858000	Whoopee!
2861000	2865000	You know, millions of other people disagree with you, but yes. I agree with you.
2865000	2866000	I yawned.
2867000	2880000	Uh, Wipeout 3 on 3DS, Xbox 360, and Wii. No, it's not the cool racing game Wipeout, but more of the obstacle show game.
2880000	2881000	Oh god.
2881000	2882000	Yeah.
2882000	2887000	The Testament of Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2887000	2893000	Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2893000	2897000	Puzzler World 2012 3D on the 3DS.
2897000	2902000	Disney Princess My Fairy Tale Adventure on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.
2902000	2907000	Uh, some game called World of Warcraft Missa Pandaria.
2907000	2909000	Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda.
2909000	2910000	That's coming out.
2910000	2912000	And, uh, No Unker.
2913000	2917000	Yeah. Dead or Alive 5 on PS3 and 360.
2917000	2924000	FIFA Soccer 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Vita, and 3DS.
2925000	2928000	And... that's it.
2928000	2933000	You forgot the most important title, although it's download, so that's why you missed it.
2933000	2937000	Tokyo Jungle is out this next week on the PlayStation 3.
2937000	2938000	That's pretty awesome.
2938000	2939000	That's pretty awesome.
2939000	2947000	Honestly, like, I might have to not play World of Warcraft for a little bit to go play Tokyo Jungle,
2947000	2951000	because that game looks... lolsy. I can't wait.
2952000	2957000	And that's the, if you don't know Tokyo Jungle, that's the game where basically you play, like, animals trying to survive.
2957000	2959000	It's like 28 days later with animals.
2960000	2963000	And they're killing other animals, and you get to eat animals.
2963000	2967000	And you get to be, like, a pug in good times. A poodle, and...
2967000	2971000	But it's not Nintendogs. It's Nintendogs if they killed each other.
2971000	2973000	It's like Nintendogs meets Hunger Games.
2973000	2974000	How about Nintendferrets?
2974000	2976000	That's the game that Nintendo should make.
2977000	2979000	Nintendogs to the death.
2982000	2984000	Oh, that's terrible, Dan!
2984000	2988000	Thank God he didn't have a mic. He said Nintendogs, Michael Vick edition. That's terrible.
2988000	2991000	Oh, you said thank God he didn't have a mic, and then you repeated it.
2991000	2993000	That means you're going to hell with him.
2993000	2995000	Yeah, now it's not funny anymore.
2995000	2997000	It's not funny when it's real.
2998000	3002000	Alright, moving on to Japanese release dates.
3002000	3005000	On the Xbox 360 on September 27th.
3005000	3007000	Dead or Alive 5.
3007000	3011000	Love Tori, sweet version in regular and limited edition.
3011000	3014000	And Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong.
3014000	3016000	They're not dead, they're just sleeping.
3016000	3023000	Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong Himitsu Keisatsu comes out on the Xbox 360 this week.
3023000	3027000	On the Playstation 3, also Dead or Alive 5 and Sleeping Dogs, that same game.
3027000	3030000	As well as a new headset, if you're so inclined.
3030000	3035000	I think it's a third-party headset, but probably to support that official Playstation 1 that just came out not that long ago.
3035000	3039000	On the Vita this week, DJ Max Technica Tune.
3039000	3042000	I think there might be a few people I know that are interested in that one.
3042000	3043000	That is coming out.
3043000	3045000	Dan Ball.
3045000	3047000	That's what it's called. Dan Ball's second game.
3047000	3049000	Yay! Dan's Balls.
3053000	3057000	Nobunaga no Yabu, Tenduo with a power-up kit.
3057000	3060000	And it looks like these are Ys games.
3060000	3067000	Ys Selectica no Jukai, it's a 25th anniversary limited edition of Ys, so that's pretty cool.
3067000	3072000	And some game I've never heard of called Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, also on the Vita this week.
3074000	3077000	Lastly, taking a look at the 3DS this week.
3077000	3085000	Chibi Devil, Kokuga 3DS LL, I'm thinking that's their version of the XL in pink and white.
3085000	3090000	And Wagamama Fashion, Girls Mode, Yokubari Sengen.
3090000	3095000	The only thing that's not cool about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is it's $72.
3095000	3096000	Ouch.
3096000	3097000	I'm not importing that.
3097000	3098000	Ouch.
3098000	3102000	I'm trying to see what this Fashion Girls game is, but they don't actually show screenshots.
3102000	3108000	It's just the little cover art is this very badly drawn anime chick who has no neck.
3108000	3110000	She has a neck?
3110000	3111000	No, it's...
3111000	3112000	She has a neck?
3112000	3113000	It's weird.
3113000	3114000	She's got a neck.
3114000	3119000	And she's carrying this little, like, coach purse and... yeah, whatever.
3119000	3120000	I kind of want it.
3120000	3121000	No you don't.
3121000	3122000	Yeah, I do.
3122000	3123000	Alright.
3123000	3126000	Other release dates for other countries. Dark Sakura.
3126000	3129000	I'm gonna start with the 20th, because that's today.
3130000	3135000	We have Rayman Jungle Run on Android and iPad, but no one has an Android, so it's fine.
3135000	3137000	Torchlight 2 for PC.
3137000	3141000	On the 21st, F1 2012, One Piece Kaizoku Musou.
3141000	3145000	We have One Piece Pirate Warriors. Is it the same game?
3146000	3147000	Oh.
3147000	3148000	It is.
3148000	3150000	Yeah, then why did they list it twice? They're stupid.
3150000	3151000	Oh, we did this last week.
3151000	3153000	Okay, Borderlands 2. Blah.
3153000	3157000	On the 25th, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria. Oh my god, Pandas.
3157000	3159000	26th, Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.
3159000	3162000	27th, Bad Piggies.
3162000	3166000	And Half-Minute Heroes Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for PC.
3166000	3171000	And 28th, Carrier Command Gaia Mission. It doesn't say Gaia, it says Gaia.
3172000	3175000	FIFA 13 and Inazuma Eleven Strikers.
3176000	3177000	And I'm spent.
3177000	3178000	Alright.
3178000	3186000	Well, let's take a trip back to a time when gaming was a little bit simpler and, you know, we didn't have crazy games like Tokyo Jungle.
3186000	3189000	Well, the games were actually kind of crazy in their own special way.
3189000	3190000	I totally want to play Tokyo Jungle.
3190000	3195000	Uh, it is the classic game of the week. Where's my cue music? There it is.
3197000	3204000	Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, asshole, play this game.
3204000	3209000	In this case, it was, you didn't pick a classic game, pick one while I'm in the car. So...
3209000	3211000	That may have happened, yes.
3211000	3213000	So, uh, it's Vectorman.
3213000	3219000	Because Dan was watching a playthrough of this the other day and I was like, I remember that game.
3219000	3221000	It was full of green balls.
3223000	3227000	Dan says, coolest title screen ever, which I agree. Fairly cool.
3227000	3229000	Very, uh, early 90s.
3229000	3237000	Um, so it's basically a run and gun kind of game. It was done by Blue Sky Software and published for Sega for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.
3237000	3242000	Came out October 24th, 1995 in North America and on the 30th in Europe.
3242000	3244000	Sorry, November 30th in Europe.
3244000	3254000	It's been out on a bunch of other stuff, usually in various Genesis collections for other handheld systems and virtual console and whatnot.
3254000	3257000	But it was originally a Genesis game.
3257000	3259000	And it had a console on the cover.
3259000	3261000	So, Vectorman.
3261000	3264000	Basically, it's got orbots in it, but they're not mighty.
3264000	3267000	And if anyone remembers that show, which I'm sure Dan does.
3268000	3278000	Um, so, uh, you have to stop this particular orbot who gets merged with a nuclear missile and goes insane and becomes Warhead, which is the coolest name ever.
3278000	3285000	And then, um, Vectorman has to go around and clean up some toxic crap and shoot some TVs and save the earth.
3285000	3288000	Save the earth. Kill your TV.
3288000	3290000	Really, you do shoot, like, TVs everywhere.
3290000	3292000	Yeah, you do. I'm watching this playthrough right now.
3292000	3295000	Um, I'll go ahead and talk about Vectorman 2, the sequel.
3295000	3302000	Um, basically, it's, uh, you have to basically clean up mutant insects and kill the Black Widow Queen.
3302000	3304000	Oh, shit!
3304000	3309000	Vectorman's another game that if you knew the storyline, it was actually a way better game.
3309000	3315000	It was sort of like Wall-E, where the earth was rendered uninhabitable, like, thousands of years in the future.
3315000	3321000	And there was this, like, really awesome robot, not Vectorman, who was, like, sent to clean it up.
3322000	3327000	But they accidentally attached a nuclear missile to his head, and he became Warhead.
3327000	3330000	And then Vectorman, and he turned all the robots on Earth evil.
3330000	3333000	And when the humans came back, he was gonna whoop that ass.
3333000	3339000	Now, Vectorman was, like, driving his barge of garbage to the sun, and he came back and decided,
3339000	3341000	Man, I gotta take these guys out.
3341000	3344000	And then you run around shooting shit in a fairly generic shooter.
3344000	3346000	It had really good graphics.
3346000	3348000	Vectorman was an awesome game for the Genesis.
3348000	3350000	Jamie doesn't know shit about it.
3350000	3352000	She'd pick it at random.
3352000	3354000	Wall-E was such a good movie, though.
3354000	3356000	Don't do what?
3356000	3358000	This is what I do.
3358000	3360000	Moving on with Classic Game of the Week.
3362000	3372000	So, as I said, it had a play-to-win contest that went with it, where you could win $25,000 or $10,000 or a Sega Saturn.
3372000	3374000	So, yay.
3375000	3378000	It was pretty much a success.
3378000	3386000	It had great level design, great graphics, as my wonderful, tactful spouse has said.
3386000	3391000	And it won EGM's best Sega Mega Drive game of 1995.
3391000	3395000	There was a third game in the works, and it was cancelled in 2003.
3395000	3397000	It was gonna be on the PlayStation.
3397000	3401000	The character actually looked very similar to Master Chief.
3402000	3404000	He kinda does, actually.
3404000	3406000	Well, for Vectorman 3.
3406000	3410000	Oh, I see. I can see, though, where it could, you know, come from this guy.
3410000	3415000	I think I played this for, like, 15 seconds in one of the Sega collections I had, and I was like,
3415000	3417000	eh, I don't get it.
3417000	3418000	I went back to Sonic.
3418000	3423000	My ex-roommate, like, would just play these games for hours and just beat the hell out of him.
3423000	3425000	She was really good.
3425000	3426000	Yeah?
3426000	3427000	Yeah.
3427000	3428000	Cool. Alright, there it is.
3428000	3434000	Your classic game of the week, Vectorman on the Sega Genesis, Mega Drive, whatever you want to call it.
3434000	3435000	There you go.
3435000	3436000	No break tonight.
3436000	3442000	We're going right through, and we'll kick off with some rapid-fire news up next.
3442000	3443000	Loki.
3443000	3449000	Alright, so Humble Indie Bundle 6 is available now, and you can check it out.
3449000	3452000	This time around, they've got some pretty cool games.
3452000	3453000	I actually picked it up already.
3453000	3459000	And in it, let's see, Dust Force, which you can unlock if you pay more than the average.
3459000	3467000	Rashard, Shatter, Spaz, Torchlight, Vessel, and at least that's it right now.
3467000	3468000	Who knows?
3468000	3472000	They probably will add more stuff, probably the previous pack at some point soon.
3472000	3476000	Still a great deal.
3476000	3480000	Torchlight's a great game if you somehow still have not played it.
3480000	3483000	I'm not as familiar with the other games in the bundle, I don't think.
3483000	3485000	Let me look again at the list.
3485000	3489000	But I think I've bought all but one of these, so I'll probably get this one too.
3489000	3490000	Right, yeah.
3490000	3492000	It's a great, great thing.
3492000	3495000	Right now, the average is $5.79.
3495000	3500000	And let's be honest, if you don't want to pick up Dust Force, and you want to be kind of a dick about it,
3500000	3502000	you can pay a penny and still get, you know.
3502000	3503000	But you shouldn't do that.
3503000	3505000	Six, you know, five games.
3505000	3508000	Give the money to charity if you must, you know.
3508000	3510000	You should still pay at least five bucks.
3510000	3512000	These are all really good games.
3512000	3513000	So that's pretty cool.
3513000	3515000	And the soundtracks too.
3515000	3519000	That's part of the reason why I want to get it, even though I already own Torchlight.
3519000	3521000	Just to get the soundtracks.
3521000	3523000	Yeah.
3523000	3525000	So they've got that.
3525000	3532000	And then of course, also, there's a new game that's on iOS from Square Enix.
3532000	3536000	And Square Enix likes to charge a lot for their games.
3536000	3539000	Now this one isn't that expensive.
3539000	3541000	It's $6.99.
3541000	3543000	The game's called Demon's Score.
3543000	3546000	And it's a rhythm action game from Anise, which you may remember.
3546000	3548000	You know, Lead Beat Agents.
3548000	3552000	Anyways, so it's kind of a rhythm music game.
3552000	3559000	But then you can also unlock, like, different characters in it.
3559000	3565000	And when you unlock those characters, you have to pay $3 to actually play as those characters.
3566000	3573000	And apparently there's about, oh, I don't know, $40 worth of DLC in this game.
3573000	3578000	So to actually play as those other characters, it would cost you another $40 on an iOS game.
3578000	3581000	I'm sorry, $30 worth of extra content.
3581000	3583000	Funk that.
3583000	3584000	Yeah.
3584000	3588000	All the characters seem to be big-breasted women, so I'm not really sure what's going on.
3588000	3591000	Oh, well, now I'm kind of interested again all of a sudden.
3591000	3593000	No. Not really.
3593000	3597000	We just had a Square Enix music game, too, which is kind of weird, the theater rhythm.
3597000	3603000	But I know this is different, because it's not even the same design or anything.
3603000	3609000	But it's just weird that we have these different music games with an abundance of DLC, kind of almost back-to-back.
3609000	3612000	And I guess each character has a different style of music.
3612000	3614000	So you might have one that has, like, funk.
3614000	3622000	One that's, you know, classical, or looks like Latin, and I don't know.
3623000	3629000	Well, speaking of milking it for all it's worth, I can't believe this collection's coming again.
3629000	3632000	But I do love my classic game collections.
3632000	3635000	Might have to check out Midway Arcade Origins.
3635000	3639000	It is a collection coming out for the Xbox and the PlayStation 3.
3639000	3644000	More than 30 Midway titles from the golden age of arcades.
3644000	3649000	You can expect things like Gauntlet, Joust, Defender, Rampage, Spy Hunter.
3649000	3652000	I think every single one of those games was on the previous collection.
3652000	3653000	Marble Madness.
3653000	3655000	Marble Madness is in this collection, though.
3655000	3658000	I don't think that was in any of the previous ones.
3658000	3659000	I'm surprised it didn't.
3659000	3660000	Was it?
3660000	3661000	Yes.
3661000	3662000	Damn it.
3662000	3663000	It's all re-releases.
3663000	3665000	It's just a new factor for them.
3665000	3671000	I'm surprised they haven't done an HD remake of some of these arcades.
3671000	3674000	Not necessarily an HD remake, but just redo the graphics in HD.
3675000	3680000	For a short time, there was Joust and Robotron.
3680000	3683000	And some of them were the early early Xbox arcade releases.
3683000	3686000	Remember when Xbox arcade was mostly just re-releases of old shit?
3686000	3689000	I think Gauntlet was one of them, too, really early on.
3689000	3690000	Yeah, I bought that.
3690000	3692000	And they're not available anymore.
3692000	3698000	I want to say some of them had at least high definition smoothing.
3698000	3701000	And some of the cheap and easy effects on it.
3701000	3704000	But, yeah, not really a true HD remake.
3704000	3708000	Well, there will be no online multiplayer for this, sadly.
3708000	3714000	Which, you know, what a great way to add value to a collection that a lot of people probably already have on their stinkin' iPhones.
3714000	3719000	There are achievements, trophies, leaderboards, whoopee.
3719000	3722000	If you're a true achievement or trophy whore, then there you go.
3722000	3724000	It is coming out from Backbone.
3724000	3727000	Didn't they do those early Xbox releases, too?
3727000	3728000	I think they did.
3728000	3729000	That's pretty much what they did.
3729000	3731000	$30 in November.
3731000	3734000	Was Backbone the one that did, um...
3734000	3738000	Was it the other arcade thing that they had?
3738000	3743000	Um, they did Street Fighter II puzzle turbo thing.
3743000	3746000	Who was the one that did the one that was like, uh...
3746000	3748000	Like Wolf of the Battlefield.
3748000	3749000	No, no, not even that.
3749000	3751000	It was like, um...
3751000	3757000	Remember the thing that they actually had on Xbox where you get to make your own arcade collections and stuff like that?
3757000	3758000	Oh, Game Room!
3758000	3759000	Yeah, Game Room.
3759000	3761000	No, Backbone did not do Game Room. That developer closed.
3761000	3763000	It was somebody out of Australia, I think.
3763000	3766000	Remember, they shut down and then Game Room just suddenly stopped updating.
3766000	3768000	That was really important.
3768000	3769000	God.
3769000	3771000	Oh, it's been at least...
3771000	3772000	Another misstep.
3772000	3777000	It's been a good six months since I've ranted about Game Room and how that should have been so much better than it was.
3777000	3778000	Anyway.
3778000	3779000	Who was that again?
3779000	3780000	Blah, blah, blah.
3780000	3786000	No, Backbone pretty much just does arcade translations, classic collections, and like new versions of old games.
3786000	3789000	Like they did Wolf of the Battlefield. They did, uh...
3789000	3791000	Whatever the 1940...
3791000	3796000	The 1940-whatever series game that they did straight for the Xbox and PS3, like the remake.
3796000	3798000	That's just kind of what they do.
3798000	3800000	Oh, I am being corrected by chat.
3800000	3804000	The perks of having a live chat room is that they correct you when you're wrong.
3804000	3805000	Dark Tetsuya says,
3805000	3809000	Actually, the Midway ones were Digital Eclipse.
3809000	3811000	So I was wrong. It was not Backbone. Sorry.
3812000	3816000	AlphaCananagram does state, though, Backbone did do Yaris.
3819000	3824000	It's not exactly one to get really excited about, just saying.
3824000	3827000	It's the best free game based on a cheap Toyota ever made.
3827000	3829000	Thank you. BobbyBlackWolf to the rescue.
3829000	3832000	Chrome Studios is the name. I knew it was K-something.
3832000	3834000	Chrome Studios did Game Room.
3834000	3838000	And ShadowNextGen agrees Game Room is such a missed opportunity by Microsoft.
3839000	3843000	Because, man, I desperately wanted to play in television games on my 360 and pay for it.
3843000	3847000	Now I want to know why is Dark Tetsuya talking about online Super Off-Road?
3847000	3848000	He says,
3848000	3852000	I'm disappointed this collection doesn't have online. I would have loved online Super Off-Road.
3852000	3854000	Super Off-Road wasn't in the list.
3854000	3856000	But there is a trailer.
3856000	3861000	So now I feel the need to watch this trailer immediately just to see if it has Super Off-Road in it.
3861000	3865000	Because I don't remember Super Off-Road being in the, uh...
3866000	3868000	I didn't realize that was a Midway game.
3868000	3871000	It's not. I mean, a lot of these aren't Midway games.
3871000	3873000	Now it's time to talk some classic games.
3873000	3875000	A lot of these are like Atari games.
3875000	3881000	But Midway became the owner of Atari after Namco, actually, strangely enough.
3881000	3886000	And Leland actually was the company that released Super Off-Road.
3886000	3891000	And somehow they ended up with the rights to the Leland games as well.
3892000	3895000	I'm looking at this trailer and I'm definitely seeing some Spy Hunter and some Defender.
3895000	3897000	I'm not seeing Off-Road, though.
3897000	3899000	Super Off-Road would be a good one.
3899000	3901000	I don't even think it had a...
3901000	3904000	I don't think it's had an Xbox Live release.
3904000	3908000	And can you imagine, though, if that was on this collection and you can't play online?
3908000	3912000	Like, damn, talk about a game from my childhood I'd like to be able to play online.
3912000	3914000	Well, it's because they're not doing any new code.
3914000	3919000	It's just, you know, quick and dirty ROM, you know, ports.
3919000	3920000	Build an emulator, dump ROM.
3920000	3924000	Right, build an emulator, dump ROM, you know, question, question, question.
3924000	3929000	Dark Tetsuya says it was in Midway Treasures 3, and that was the one with all the racing games.
3929000	3931000	Yeah, let me look. I think I have it.
3931000	3935000	I don't know if Super Off-Road... Yeah, I think it was. I think it and the track pack both were.
3935000	3940000	I know it was Hydro Thunder. I know it's the later Off-Road game, like Off-Road Thunder.
3940000	3944000	And it was the Dreamcast port of Hydro Thunder, which pissed me off.
3944000	3946000	It was not Arctic Thunder because that would have been sweet.
3946000	3948000	Yep, Super Off-Road. I'm looking at it right here.
3948000	3950000	I actually have the Xbox version.
3950000	3955000	And it was the Dreamcast ports of Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049.
3955000	3959000	Oh, and a really nice arcade port of Rush 2.
3959000	3965000	I can say this now because this company doesn't really exist anymore, but I got this copy free for Midway
3965000	3972000	because the chick and I were at the Classic Game Expo and I were just kind of like talking and she gave me a free copy.
3972000	3975000	I'm disappointed that that's going to be in Vegas this next time.
3975000	3977000	Well, it hasn't been in the Bay Area like forever.
3977000	3978000	Really?
3978000	3983000	Yeah, we went like a couple years when it was like in Burlingame. It was awesome.
3983000	3988000	I had such a good time. One year, I mean, me and Jamie must not have taken more than like 150 bucks.
3988000	3996000	We got just a pristine, not a duo, but we got a Core Graphics, which is a PC Engine.
3996000	4001000	Just a stack of games. Just awesome.
4001000	4003000	I was disappointed they didn't have an Atari party this year.
4003000	4008000	I totally forgot. I totally forgot about Super Off-Road being in Midway Arcade Treasure 3.
4008000	4015000	I wonder if that's one of the backwards compatible games I can play on 360. If so, no? Curse you!
4015000	4019000	But you can play the PS2 version on your 60 gig PS3.
4019000	4022000	Except I don't have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.
4022000	4026000	Oh, that sucks. I guess I'll just have to play it on mine.
4026000	4028000	Now I see why they're re-releasing it all over again.
4028000	4030000	Rob, do you want to borrow our Xbox?
4030000	4034000	I have an Xbox. Dan vetoed that real quick.
4034000	4038000	I have an old Xbox somewhere. I just can't guarantee if it'll work or not.
4038000	4041000	Let's sigh.
4041000	4044000	Alright, anyhow, that was supposed to be rapid fire news. Oops.
4044000	4048000	Animal Crossing Jump Out. Well, this ought to be quick.
4048000	4051000	Because we're going to talk about what's new in Animal Crossing Jump Out.
4051000	4053000	Crickets, crickets, crickets.
4053000	4056000	No, there will be five new characters.
4056000	4060000	Frap, or Frappe, I like to use the E.
4060000	4064000	Frappe, who will be a lively penguin.
4064000	4066000	A brisk hamster.
4066000	4068000	Frappe.
4068000	4071000	Tocoya, a carefree octopus.
4071000	4073000	Brittany, who is a mature pig.
4073000	4076000	Wait, that would be Tocoya.
4076000	4078000	Taco is octopus.
4078000	4082000	And Anthony, who is a smug horse.
4082000	4086000	Apparently smug is a new personality you will see throughout the game.
4086000	4090000	So does he go around going, no sir, I do not like it.
4090000	4094000	He goes around going, nay.
4094000	4098000	Yeah, I was just going to say, he goes around going, nay.
4098000	4102000	There is also, Loki, this could be, here is something new.
4102000	4106000	You've been asking, you've been dying. What is going to be new in the new Animal Crossing game?
4106000	4108000	So here it is. I'm waiting for it.
4108000	4110000	You ready?
4110000	4114000	There is going to be a special tree that you plant when you become mayor,
4114000	4118000	and it will grow as your city grows.
4120000	4122000	Bravo.
4122000	4124000	Bravo.
4124000	4126000	Pre-order it right now.
4126000	4129000	I'm going out tomorrow buying 3DS just for, no.
4129000	4131000	You know what?
4131000	4134000	I would do that just to start my toilet collection again.
4134000	4138000	Well, Dar Sakura, you might appreciate this, because it's kind of in your name.
4138000	4142000	There will be new flowers in the game, and cherry blossoms are coming back.
4142000	4144000	Okay, we're getting it. Hold on.
4144000	4147000	They've got to put NES games back in it.
4147000	4152000	You can, I guess, apparently put the reset management center anywhere you want.
4152000	4155000	I didn't realize Resetti got his own building now, so he can yell at you.
4155000	4157000	Oh, okay. I have to digress, Rob.
4157000	4158000	What?
4158000	4160000	Uncracked.
4160000	4164000	They did the what if minor characters in games got their own game,
4164000	4167000	and one of them was Mr. Resetti's game, and the thing was full of text.
4167000	4169000	It was great.
4169000	4172000	Mr. Resetti is one of the most underappreciated video game characters ever.
4172000	4174000	He's amazing.
4174000	4179000	There's also Brewster's coffee shop, so you can have a not Starbucks in your town.
4179000	4181000	That was Brewster. That's who you're thinking of.
4181000	4184000	Two types of police stations that you can have.
4184000	4188000	Mr. Resetti needs to be in the next Mario Kart game as one of the attacks.
4188000	4192000	Instead of the squid ink and stuff like that, it's just Mr. Resetti.
4192000	4195000	He just blocks you with nothing but text for five seconds.
4195000	4197000	Is he in Smash Brothers?
4197000	4199000	They have a...
4199000	4202000	Wasn't he a trophy or something, probably? I think there was a trophy.
4202000	4205000	They have Animal Crossing level, I thought.
4205000	4208000	I can't remember if Resetti was in it or not. I think he was.
4208000	4213000	Anyway, let's move on with more rapid fire news with Dark Sakura.
4214000	4217000	Stuff happened, and things happened.
4217000	4223000	Nights HD is going to have Christmas nights, and it will be on PlayStation Network on October 2nd,
4223000	4226000	and on Xbox Live October 5th.
4226000	4231000	Guess what? I already have it, except the HD looks super fucking pretty, and I want it.
4231000	4233000	It'll be ten bucks.
4233000	4235000	It does have Christmas nights.
4235000	4237000	Yeah, but I've got it on the Saturn.
4237000	4241000	Shut up! We have it on the Saturn. You can sit there and shut up.
4242000	4245000	Yeah, and I've got the Japanese one after... whatever.
4245000	4253000	On this show before, you've talked about it's kind of a tradition for you to break out the Saturn every Christmas and play Christmas nights.
4253000	4257000	Is there any chance you'd replace it with HD, or is that done?
4257000	4259000	Hell no!
4260000	4264000	It's a tradition for her to have me break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.
4267000	4270000	You know what would be great about having it in HD, though?
4270000	4272000	What's that?
4272000	4278000	The fact that every year I go through, I unlock maybe half the presents. I know I had them all unlocked at once,
4278000	4283000	but since the Saturn's internal memory dies in like, oh, twelve seconds, even with a brand new battery,
4283000	4286000	every year I have to unlock all the presents again.
4286000	4289000	So, it'd be nice just to have them all unlocked.
4290000	4291000	Alright.
4291000	4295000	But, with no Saturn analog controller, it just ain't going to play right.
4296000	4297000	Rob.
4297000	4298000	Alright, let's...
4298000	4299000	Yeah, Rob.
4299000	4301000	Alright, Rob!
4301000	4302000	Rob!
4302000	4304000	Rob, more coffee.
4304000	4307000	No, neither one of you gets coffee.
4308000	4309000	Bioware has...
4309000	4310000	No, you can have, you can have weed.
4310000	4311000	Dan, shut up.
4311000	4313000	Just kidding, I don't have weed. Don't do drugs.
4313000	4315000	We need to go get some food.
4315000	4316000	Don't be like Fiona.
4316000	4318000	Let's do this show faster so we can go get dinner.
4318000	4319000	Free Fiona.
4319000	4322000	Okay, Bioware's at Dragon Age III Inquisition, the end.
4323000	4326000	Nobody expects the Dragon Age Inquisition.
4326000	4330000	You've been waiting like an hour and a half to make that joke.
4330000	4331000	Seriously, tell them.
4331000	4334000	You've been waiting an hour and a half to make that joke, haven't you?
4334000	4336000	Ever since I posted that story in the show, Rob.
4338000	4339000	But you have to do it in the right voice.
4339000	4341000	Nobody expects it.
4341000	4342000	One more time, one more time, please.
4342000	4345000	No, no, no, no, we're done. We already did the joke.
4345000	4347000	No, you don't want a clean cut for the Parsec Award.
4347000	4349000	He can't do squeaky voice.
4349000	4351000	I've never heard him do a proper squeaky voice.
4351000	4354000	Oh, a proper squeaky voice? I can do a proper squeaky voice.
4354000	4357000	Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.
4357000	4358000	Okay, close enough.
4361000	4363000	There's other Bioware news too that's not a part of that story,
4363000	4365000	and it was kind of something big that happened this week.
4365000	4369000	I don't know if you're aware, but the doctors that founded Bioware left.
4369000	4370000	Yeah, I know.
4370000	4371000	LOL bye.
4371000	4373000	Dan told me, and I'm like, good for them.
4373000	4377000	Well, it's been kind of a crappy couple years for Bioware.
4377000	4380000	They're taking a lot of shit about Mass Effect 3 ending.
4380000	4383000	They're pissed off about all you people bitching about Mass Effect 3's ending.
4383000	4384000	Wait, don't point at us. We didn't...
4384000	4387000	Get over it. Oh no, Jamie did.
4387000	4390000	I heard her bitching about it the other day.
4390000	4395000	Star Wars The Old Republic didn't quite meet expectations.
4395000	4398000	Dragon Age 2 was no Dragon Age 1.
4398000	4404000	So, I mean, that's like three punches in the gut in a quick span.
4404000	4408000	That's what happens when ZA sticks their nose into a good thing.
4408000	4409000	That's very true.
4409000	4412000	Everyone's leaving to make beer, so I mean, that's good, right?
4412000	4415000	We can have Bioware beer.
4415000	4420000	Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite beer on the Citadel.
4420000	4421000	Now, the other...
4421000	4422000	Captain Shepherds.
4422000	4426000	There were some very important things that were also confirmed.
4426000	4428000	Dark Sakura, pay attention.
4428000	4429000	Beer.
4429000	4431000	The next Mass Effect 3 DLC has been announced.
4431000	4436000	It will be the taking back of Omega this fall.
4436000	4440000	Play the news. Don't fuck with Aria.
4440000	4445000	Also confirmed, because people are paranoid because these guys are leaving.
4445000	4453000	They had to put it out on the table, and they did confirm another Mass Effect game is in development.
4453000	4456000	Now, they didn't say it's Mass Effect 4. That's all they said.
4456000	4457000	They just said another...
4457000	4459000	It better be the Tale of Geras.
4459000	4461000	Another full Mass Effect game is in development.
4461000	4463000	Could be a prequel, could be a new trilogy, could be anything.
4463000	4464000	Shut up.
4464000	4468000	It could be like the new iPad, where it's just the new Mass Effect.
4468000	4472000	It would be Silent Scope featuring Geras.
4472000	4478000	Also, the same team led by Casey Hudson working on a new IP.
4478000	4482000	That's supposed to be pushing the envelopes with game design.
4482000	4486000	Strong hints that it's for an unannounced console.
4486000	4490000	There's gonna be a lot of hardcore gay sex in that one.
4490000	4491000	We'll get cocked this time.
4491000	4493000	One can hope.
4494000	4495000	That's right.
4495000	4497000	No, cocks and twats everywhere.
4498000	4501000	Pushing the pornography envelope. That's how Bioware's gonna sell some games.
4501000	4503000	Heck yeah.
4504000	4507000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, you know what's funny?
4507000	4508000	Cocks and twats?
4508000	4510000	No, not cocks and twats.
4510000	4518000	Is that if you look at the date of their retirement announcement, it's almost exactly five years after the EA purchase of Bioware.
4518000	4522000	One has to wonder if that was in the contract that their jobs would be protected for five years.
4524000	4528000	No one can hear you when you are not talking on the microphone, Dan.
4530000	4532000	It's probably just that they had to stay with the company for five years.
4532000	4535000	They couldn't be like, thanks for the money. Bye.
4535000	4538000	I would leave wow for Mass Effect MMO just saying.
4540000	4545000	Shadow Next Gen says, I heard the next Mass Effect game probably won't include Shepard.
4545000	4546000	Well, duh.
4546000	4549000	Well, let me just put it this way.
4550000	4554000	When you're writing fiction, you can do anything you want.
4556000	4557000	Especially when it's sci-fi.
4558000	4560000	Look at the shit they got away with on Star Trek for years.
4561000	4563000	Look at the shit they get away with in comics.
4564000	4566000	How many times has Superman died? How many times has Batman died?
4567000	4569000	Isn't Captain America president now?
4571000	4575000	How many more endings can they get Buzz Aldrin to narrate? Hello.
4576000	4580000	Yeah, I know. Black Wolf in the chat says SWOTOR equals Mass Effect MMO.
4580000	4581000	No.
4581000	4586000	Well, I think that's kind of why a Mass Effect MMO isn't exactly at the top of anybody's wish list right now.
4586000	4587000	Mass Effect would sell better.
4587000	4590000	But SWOTOR wasn't bad. That's the thing.
4590000	4595000	It wasn't strong enough to take down a game that it was emulating.
4595000	4597000	The fandom wasn't enough.
4597000	4601000	It just needs to go the Macross 2, Macross 7 route where it's just all about music.
4601000	4610000	And their weapon is music and they can get Psy to be the leader of whatever rebellion or whatever.
4610000	4612000	Just have them dancing.
4612000	4622000	I think the Old Republic would have been a lot better if they hadn't just put it out of the tail end of just running Star Wars into the ground as hard as they could.
4622000	4623000	True.
4623000	4625000	I think back when they brought out the original...
4625000	4626000	Not Bioware's fault.
4626000	4627000	No, not Bioware's fault at all.
4627000	4635000	The game design is apparently really solid, but the Star Wars franchise has lost a lot of its shine.
4635000	4638000	That's kind of sadly true.
4638000	4645000	The Star Wars franchise hasn't had shine since they changed the first one to Episode 4.
4645000	4647000	Moving on.
4647000	4649000	Now I was going to say at least the third movie.
4649000	4650000	Anyway, forget it.
4650000	4652000	Moving on.
4652000	4655000	Now that we're done with rapid fire news, 30 minutes later.
4655000	4659000	No foogle question of the week this week because I forgot to ask one.
4659000	4661000	We'll bring one back next week.
4661000	4666000	But you should join our Facebook and Google Plus communities in anticipation.
4666000	4669000	And so that you have something to do on Google Plus.
4669000	4672000	Actually, hangouts are still cool.
4672000	4673000	I'm just saying.
4673000	4678000	Google Plus is kind of underappreciated, but I'll save that tangent for another week.
4678000	4680000	Let's get back into some long form news.
4680000	4681000	Hahaha, Loki.
4681000	4684000	So Zynga has bought a bit lucky.
4684000	4689000	And they're a developer of such wonderful games called Lucky Train and Lucky Space.
4689000	4690000	Lucky Charms?
4690000	4692000	No Lucky Charms.
4692000	4693000	Perhaps that could be a sequel.
4693000	4696000	And also a game called Solstice Arena.
4696000	4699000	This of course begs the question.
4699000	4702000	So Zynga, are you feeling lucky?
4702000	4704000	Maybe.
4704000	4707000	And they paid 20 million dollars for the company.
4707000	4718000	And apparently also in unrelated news, the executive at OMG Pop has left.
4718000	4723000	Wilson Kriegel, the former chief revenue officer.
4723000	4728000	Eh, revenue officer. That's just like the guy that handles money.
4728000	4732000	Oh, you know the guy that cut that deal where the company sold for what?
4732000	4734000	100 million dollars or however much it went for?
4734000	4735000	That crazy ass amount?
4735000	4736000	He's retiring.
4737000	4739000	Fuck it, I would too.
4739000	4743000	If I could sell Orange Lounge Radio for 100 million dollars.
4743000	4744000	I'd fuck you every time.
4744000	4746000	Five inches, have fun.
4746000	4748000	You'd be splitting that three ways.
4748000	4749000	I'm going to Tahiti.
4749000	4751000	I'd buy you Pinkberry.
4756000	4758000	To quote my husband, it better be a Pinkberry franchise.
4758000	4759000	We'll see.
4759000	4761000	Depends what flavors you carry.
4761000	4764000	Alright, moving on.
4764000	4766000	For you Rob All Peach.
4766000	4770000	You know the funny thing is that that story went quicker than anything in rapid fire news.
4770000	4772000	Because it was a Zynga story.
4772000	4774000	And no one curr.
4774000	4777000	Lesson learned for producing future shows.
4777000	4780000	Alright, Dragon Quest X, listen up.
4780000	4782000	I know some people are excited about this.
4782000	4786000	Dragon Quest X, even though it's an MMO, which might turn some people off.
4786000	4788000	But I don't know, I'm curious about it.
4788000	4791000	Well Dragon Quest X, some more details of Tokyo Game Show.
4791000	4795000	You can play the entire game on the Wii U gamepad if you want.
4795000	4797000	No one wants to.
4797000	4800000	Well I don't think that's too surprising either.
4800000	4809000	Because they've already talked about that there will be games that you can kind of play on the Wii U gamepad while people are watching whatever on TV.
4809000	4814000	Like you can kind of do that duel thing that was part of the point of having the gamepad.
4814000	4818000	But the fact that this is an MMO makes it very interesting.
4818000	4822000	Because people tend to get drawn to MMOs a little more.
4822000	4824000	Imagine if it was Warcraft.
4824000	4828000	You could sit on the couch and watch American Idol and play World of Warcraft at the same time.
4828000	4831000	Of course a lot of people kind of already do that with two monitors.
4831000	4833000	I don't see how this is even a big deal.
4833000	4835000	Some people we know just put a TV on their wall.
4835000	4839000	Because it's basically just like playing it on a small monitor.
4839000	4843000	Well they also talk about that you can switch between the two.
4843000	4849000	You can go between the TV screen and the gamepad in the menu under options smoothly.
4849000	4851000	Cool.
4851000	4857000	But once again I don't think it's news at all that any of these games can be played on the gamepad or on the TV.
4857000	4859000	Ooh it's a display. It displays the game.
4859000	4861000	Ooh my TV's a display. It displays the game.
4861000	4863000	That's not fucking news. That's a feature.
4863000	4866000	I thought that was sort of the whole idea, yes.
4866000	4868000	Well then I guess we're done with that story.
4868000	4877000	Because it's just like basically that just tells me that they really didn't need the whole Wii at all to do this Dragon Quest X.
4877000	4882000	Because it doesn't utilize anything other than a standard control set.
4882000	4884000	Cool.
4884000	4886000	But it's Dragon Quest.
4886000	4888000	Yeah, cool.
4888000	4890000	Moving on to the mailbag!
4890000	4893000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4893000	4895000	What?
4895000	4897000	You still have Alan's name on it.
4897000	4901000	Well, oh my god I made a mistake from copy pasting last twist.
4901000	4903000	I am not that tall.
4903000	4905000	Maybe you have a scarlet letter A for another reason.
4905000	4907000	Asshole.
4907000	4909000	Alright, mailbag.
4909000	4912000	You were saying awesome but okay if you had to go there.
4912000	4918000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send Dark Sakura letters.
4918000	4920000	Whatever letter you want.
4920000	4922000	Send me lots of Q's.
4922000	4924000	This one starts with an A.
4924000	4926000	It's from AJ Twist.
4927000	4930000	Is that actually his name? AJ Twist? Babow?
4930000	4932000	No. I was emphasizing.
4932000	4934000	You added flair.
4934000	4936000	This is my flair.
4936000	4938000	Good day good hosts of OLR.
4938000	4940000	Howdy.
4940000	4942000	Stop it.
4942000	4944000	What? I'm not allowed to respond to the greeting?
4944000	4948000	What? If you say hi to me I just have to look at you?
4948000	4950000	Yeah, what?
4950000	4952000	Girl.
4952000	4955000	I just finished watching a documentary on Netflix about video games.
4955000	4960000	You guys have mentioned the video game crash in the 1980's and I wanted to know what happened to cause this crash.
4960000	4967000	So I went looking for something on Netflix and I came across CNBC Originals Game On.
4967000	4970000	The unauthorized history of video games.
4970000	4974000	It was a great outline of the video game history up until the release of the Nintendo Wii.
4974000	4980000	What blew my mind about the documentary was a quote by the narrator, Bill Griffith, toward the end of the video.
4980000	4981000	He said,
4981000	4984000	The game machine is only as good as the games created for it.
4984000	4989000	Where have I heard that so many times before? But now I wonder, who coined the phrase first?
4989000	4991000	Me.
4993000	4999000	First thing you should do about that documentary, which I've also watched, is just forget everything that you saw on it.
4999000	5002000	Because it's really, really, really bad.
5003000	5007000	I will tell you everything you need to know about the video game crash without having to watch the documentary.
5007000	5010000	Although I have not seen said documentary so I have no opinion on it.
5010000	5018000	Imagine that you have a system like the Atari 2600 and imagine they've created Yaris for the Atari 2600.
5018000	5026000	Imagine that 30 companies created Yaris for the Atari 2600 and they're charging you $60 a copy for Yaris.
5026000	5032000	This marketplace was flooded with bullshit games like this and that's what caused the crash.
5033000	5047000	It'd be like if all of a sudden that the Apple store was selling physical copies of those knockoff games for $60 at retail and they were all clogging the shelves at Walmart or something like that.
5047000	5049000	That would be the video game crash.
5049000	5053000	Don't forget that there were like seven or eight competing consoles.
5053000	5056000	That's true too. And PC computing.
5056000	5062000	Well, that was actually kind of pre-PC being even a factor.
5062000	5068000	Okay, Commodore, TI-99, Apple II.
5068000	5070000	Motherfucker, do you even know who you are stepping to?
5070000	5073000	I will whoop that ass if you want to talk about this.
5073000	5078000	That stuff all really rose up. I mean, it did play a part.
5078000	5085000	The fact that the market switched to, hey, why spend the money on a game console when you can spend the money on a computer?
5085000	5092000	But the gaming in computers really came after the crash because, you know, what were you going to get your games on?
5092000	5098000	You know, so to an extent, but it was, yeah, market oversaturation, terrible quality control.
5098000	5104000	And at the time, video gaming really was kind of faddish, you know, and there was a big lull.
5104000	5107000	They didn't realize that there was a cycle that you should upgrade it.
5107000	5110000	There was no Angry Birds. All right, let's finish the email. Sorry.
5110000	5113000	By the way, that would be there were no Angry Birds.
5113000	5116000	Actually, you were right. There was no because the game is singular.
5116000	5118000	Is that in the email?
5118000	5126000	Speaking of documentaries, I think you guys should check out Focus starring Mike Ross or I Got Next, which is free on Hulu.
5126000	5129000	They're both about the fighting game community and tournaments.
5129000	5134000	Really recommend recommended if anyone is interested in seeing what the community is like.
5134000	5138000	I love the competitive gaming scene, but I don't have the time or motivation to get back into it.
5138000	5142000	Thanks for your time. I've been a podcast listener since 05. Love the show.
5142000	5145000	Wow. It's been a great inspiration for my own projects.
5145000	5148000	And you guys keep me awake during long, boring nights at work.
5148000	5152000	Shh, don't tell my boss. Keep up the greater than great work.
5152000	5153000	And that's from AJ Twist.
5153000	5160000	I'm just really sad that, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV never became part of the MLG scene because I could have fucking earned some money there.
5160000	5162000	Unfortunately, it's all call duty.
5162000	5167000	And I'm surprised this guy said we inspired him to do other projects, which is a great compliment.
5167000	5171000	And he refrained from plugging said projects. That's a great amount of restraint.
5171000	5175000	But, if you would like to, we're nice that way.
5175000	5177000	Yeah, you can always tack them on.
5177000	5179000	We support people.
5179000	5181000	And that's it.
5181000	5182000	That's it? One email?
5182000	5184000	I told you at the beginning of the show the only one.
5184000	5185000	I wasn't listening. One lousy email.
5185000	5186000	Jeez, Rob.
5186000	5190000	Mailbag at orangelandradi.com. Fill her up for next show.
5190000	5192000	This is what happens when you tape mid-week.
5192000	5196000	See, we'll get a bunch of emails on Sunday and then it'll be like, LOL didn't tape today.
5196000	5199000	Let's get to the FUs of the week. This should be good.
5201000	5213000	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
5213000	5215000	This is fucked up.
5217000	5218000	Uh...
5220000	5225000	You know, my FUs are really kind of, uh, personal this week.
5227000	5230000	No, I don't want to say it to you. I'm over it.
5230000	5233000	Okay, fine. Fuck you for not buying me an iPad.
5235000	5237000	Or the hard drive I needed.
5240000	5244000	I'd like to go ahead and accept the responsibility for this fuck you.
5244000	5247000	Not really so much because I upgraded my graphics card and didn't buy her anything.
5247000	5249000	Because, you know, she's a little miss grabby.
5249000	5252000	But I have been really fucking with her all night on the show tonight.
5252000	5254000	It's been awesome.
5255000	5257000	I think you should bite my ass.
5257000	5259000	Loki?
5260000	5263000	Uh, I had something I was angry about earlier.
5263000	5268000	But, you know, just after eating delicious teriyaki, it's just hard to be angry about anything.
5268000	5277000	So, I guess, uh, I guess that'd be the fact that I'm tired just because I've been seeing up until midnight playing Borderlands 2 every night.
5277000	5279000	Well, Minecraft, actually, with a knife.
5279000	5284000	But I'm tired and wish I could take a day off to, like, sleep and play more Minecraft.
5284000	5286000	May do that.
5286000	5287000	And...
5287000	5290000	I may or may not be taking Tuesday off to play World of Warcraft all day.
5290000	5292000	And, and FU too.
5292000	5300000	To the fact that I probably am not going to be able to convince the wife to allow me to purchase a $1200 DDR machine that's in Modesto.
5302000	5304000	Because I really want it.
5304000	5308000	I've wanted one for years now.
5309000	5311000	Wife will be pissed.
5311000	5313000	Shut up!
5314000	5316000	Dan and Loki have very different outlooks.
5316000	5319000	You should buy it. And I'll tell you why.
5319000	5323000	Number one, man, you having a DDR machine would be awesome.
5323000	5326000	Number two, she'll get over it. I mean, really.
5328000	5330000	And number three, awesome.
5330000	5331000	This is coming from the guy who has...
5331000	5334000	I was going to talk to her last night, but she was really cranky yesterday.
5334000	5337000	This is coming from the guy who has five pinball machines.
5337000	5340000	I only have three pinball machines. The other two are loners.
5340000	5341000	My bad.
5341000	5345000	I thought we should have bought that Solo that was for sale for like 800 bucks, but Jamie said no Solo.
5345000	5347000	It's still for sale.
5347000	5349000	No, I didn't say no.
5349000	5352000	I thought we should have bought that Planet Harriers that was only $600, but Jamie said no.
5352000	5354000	No, you said no, you ass.
5354000	5357000	You said we don't have room for it. Stop lying.
5357000	5361000	I thought we should have bought that Daytona USA dual that I saw for like 250 bucks.
5361000	5362000	Give me it.
5362000	5363000	But she said no.
5363000	5365000	Give me the damn mic.
5365000	5366000	You're going to break it.
5366000	5368000	You're breaking it. Let go.
5368000	5371000	I did the fact that I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack to buy a new mic.
5374000	5375000	Can I continue?
5375000	5377000	The good news is I get an employee discount.
5377000	5379000	I want to say F.U.
5379000	5381000	I want to say F.U. to Apple.
5381000	5383000	Get the fuck off me.
5383000	5386000	I want to say F.U. to Apple for launching the new iPhone this weekend.
5386000	5390000	It's not really anything against Apple launching the new iPhone because that's fine,
5390000	5393000	but I'd really, really rather be playing Borderlands all weekend,
5393000	5397000	and now I can't because I've got to go and sell iPhones all weekend.
5398000	5400000	This is about to get violent.
5402000	5403000	I looked on her shirt.
5403000	5405000	Can I do my F.U. please?
5405000	5406000	Can you finish? Can I finish?
5406000	5407000	Can I finish? Can I finish?
5408000	5409000	Dan is getting the mic again.
5409000	5412000	My F.U. of the week just goes to being super busy and stressed.
5412000	5414000	I was so busy this week.
5414000	5418000	I think one day I had such low blood sugar I was about to pass out and faint.
5418000	5420000	Just between where, I mean cry me a river.
5420000	5422000	It's not like I don't volunteer for this shit,
5422000	5426000	but I think I need to cool it in the future because I got too much going on.
5426000	5428000	So what do I do about it all?
5428000	5430000	Run out of town for four days.
5430000	5432000	Go to Disneyland.
5432000	5434000	That's the answer to everything.
5436000	5438000	That does it for my F.U.s of the week.
5439000	5441000	AlphaCanandagrams asked in chat,
5441000	5443000	Sky, do you still have that crappy mic that still cuts out?
5443000	5445000	If so, Kickstarter.
5445000	5447000	Yes, we have the crappy mic that cuts out.
5447000	5448000	And no Kickstarter.
5448000	5449000	No Kickstarter.
5449000	5453000	We actually, I do have money to get a new mic.
5453000	5454000	I need to get one.
5455000	5457000	But the question is, do I want to get a mic-
5457000	5458000	But Rob, you're Dutch.
5458000	5460000	The question is, do I want to get a mic like this,
5460000	5465000	or do I want to get like a super fancy condenser mic that's three digits in cost?
5465000	5468000	Kind of want the super fancy condenser mic for voiceovers.
5468000	5470000	I had one. I don't know what the fuck happened to that.
5470000	5472000	Yeah, didn't we have one?
5472000	5475000	I had a condenser mic that at one time it was the ambient room mic
5475000	5477000	because that shit picked up everything.
5477000	5478000	It broke.
5478000	5479000	Did it?
5479000	5480000	Yeah, I think it broke.
5480000	5481000	It broke.
5481000	5482000	Eh, whatever.
5483000	5485000	Some of the Orange Lounge radios in the past,
5485000	5488000	I don't know if you remember the nights when we used to get so drunk.
5488000	5491000	There was literally an episode of Orange Lounge Radio
5491000	5493000	and it's like a double digit episode.
5493000	5495000	That was one that I was asleep in your bed.
5495000	5497000	Jamie passes out in my bed.
5497000	5498000	I am kicking-
5498000	5500000	No, I ate waffles in your bed.
5500000	5503000	I am kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the matrix.
5503000	5504000	I'm in the matrix.
5505000	5506000	On the radio.
5508000	5509000	That was a great show.
5509000	5511000	People were listening to this.
5511000	5513000	That's how we win awards, man.
5513000	5514000	Huh?
5514000	5518000	By the way, podcast award nominations should be coming soon, so, uh,
5518000	5520000	you know, please consider us.
5520000	5521000	Here's- Okay.
5522000	5525000	If we get nominated for a podcast award this year,
5525000	5526000	here's the concessional, mate,
5526000	5529000	if we can get nominated for a podcast award this year,
5529000	5532000	I will get drunk and likely kick the wall again.
5532000	5535000	That's the- that's the little promise I make to you.
5535000	5536000	How's that sound?
5536000	5537000	Sounds fun.
5537000	5538000	And if we win,
5539000	5541000	we'll get the cats drunk?
5541000	5542000	I don't know.
5543000	5544000	No.
5544000	5546000	I don't know what else to add to that.
5546000	5547000	Alright.
5548000	5549000	Anyway.
5549000	5550000	Uh, okay.
5550000	5554000	So let's talk about stuff that we probably didn't really want,
5554000	5556000	but they're gonna give us anyways.
5557000	5558000	Castlevania.
5559000	5560000	The movie.
5560000	5561000	It's returning.
5561000	5564000	And, uh, how do we know it's returning?
5564000	5566000	Because Michael Dorn said so.
5566000	5569000	Michael Dorn, who played many things, including-
5569000	5570000	Mr. Worf is Dracula.
5570000	5571000	Yes, Mr. Worf.
5571000	5573000	He is not Dracula.
5573000	5574000	He is a werewolf.
5574000	5578000	And the joke I made earlier this week, were-warf.
5578000	5580000	But, cool.
5580000	5582000	And he says it's a fun little part.
5582000	5583000	It's four days.
5583000	5586000	I'm playing a werewolf that's been around for a gajillion years.
5586000	5587000	That's an actual term.
5587000	5590000	And, uh, who works for this vampire?
5590000	5593000	It's not too far from Worf because there's a lot of killing
5593000	5595000	and jumping and sword fights and everything.
5597000	5601000	Basically, I guess he got involved because of Marina Sirtis,
5601000	5603000	who, I don't know who she played.
5603000	5604000	Troy.
5604000	5605000	Troy, okay.
5605000	5607000	Well, and they were both also in the Mass Effect series,
5607000	5610000	because he was one of the, um, other-
5610000	5611000	No, he wasn't there.
5611000	5614000	He was the guy with the green forehead that was hanging out with Rex.
5614000	5615000	I'm-
5615000	5616000	Reeve.
5616000	5617000	Yeah, not Reeve.
5617000	5620000	I kinda would want to see it because they're in it.
5620000	5621000	You know what I mean?
5621000	5623000	Like, even if it was terrible, it would be like,
5623000	5624000	hey, that's kinda cool.
5624000	5626000	Never trust a Klingon.
5626000	5627000	I trust a Klingon.
5627000	5628000	Captain Kirk said.
5628000	5631000	As much as I'm like, alright, Castlevania movie, that's-
5631000	5634000	Let's just cast the rest of Castlevania with, like,
5634000	5637000	old actors from, like, Next Generation and stuff.
5637000	5639000	Hey, I'm all about that, why not?
5639000	5642000	We'll get, let's see, uh, we'll get Michael, uh, um-
5642000	5643000	He was-
5643000	5644000	Let's get Bruce Campbell.
5644000	5645000	He was Uvink.
5646000	5648000	He wasn't Reeve, he was Uvink.
5649000	5650000	Let's get, like, classic-
5650000	5653000	Get Patrick Stewart as, uh, he can be Dracula.
5653000	5654000	Mm-hmm.
5654000	5656000	I mean, it's a weird casting, but sure.
5656000	5659000	Uh, we'll get, uh, Wil Wheaton.
5659000	5662000	He can play, uh, you know, one of the-
5662000	5664000	He can just be himself.
5664000	5667000	Wil Wheaton as, you know, badass vampire hunter.
5667000	5668000	Yeah.
5670000	5672000	To register participation for this week's episode of
5672000	5675000	Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
5675000	5677000	use the passphrase, quicksand.
5678000	5680000	That's what I think of when I think of Wil Wheaton.
5680000	5684000	Alright, um, also, I need to say this comment from chat,
5684000	5686000	because it's very important before I get to the last story here.
5686000	5689000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf has made an offer on the podcast awards.
5689000	5692000	If you win, Bobby Blackwolf says,
5692000	5695000	I'll fly out and get drunk too.
5695000	5698000	Okay, remember, this is Bobby Blackwolf, host of the
5698000	5701000	clean and family-friendly Bobby Blackwolf show,
5701000	5703000	offering to come out here and get drunk with us.
5703000	5704000	That's awesome.
5704000	5706000	All bets will be off.
5706000	5708000	If that happens, we must win the award.
5708000	5709000	I'll bring my sleeping bag.
5709000	5710000	Seriously.
5711000	5714000	If we win, marathon show.
5714000	5715000	Okay.
5715000	5716000	Alright, there you go.
5716000	5717000	Make it so.
5717000	5718000	Make it so.
5719000	5721000	Marathon show with drunk Bobby Blackwolf.
5721000	5722000	Make it so.
5723000	5725000	Dan has to come and drink too.
5725000	5727000	We'll engage the listeners.
5727000	5729000	We can set it up in the front room at our house.
5730000	5732000	We will fix the warp core.
5732000	5733000	The breach.
5733000	5734000	Alright.
5734000	5737000	Um, Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.
5737000	5738000	Do you even bother with Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade?
5738000	5741000	I don't right now, but the story's interesting.
5741000	5746000	Alright, update 1.8.2 for Minecraft on Xbox.
5746000	5748000	We'll be adding the creative mode.
5748000	5750000	There's gonna be new food, new monsters,
5750000	5753000	and that means we're almost caught up to the PC version.
5753000	5755000	Eh, they're so ways off.
5755000	5759000	They're adding the, like, random dungeon stuff,
5759000	5761000	like the, you know, abandoned mine shafts,
5761000	5763000	which I keep running into those in our game.
5763000	5765000	Yeah, you have a lot of those in the vlog world.
5765000	5766000	Like, there's a lot.
5766000	5768000	And, um, also the villages.
5768000	5772000	Um, the, you know, villagers and endermen and all that stuff.
5772000	5774000	Now, do we have villagers in the vlog world?
5774000	5775000	I've been looking.
5775000	5777000	There's just a lot of fucking ocean.
5777000	5778000	That's all I've found.
5778000	5781000	Because, like I said, I went and I went into creative.
5781000	5782000	Atlantis. They're all underwater.
5782000	5785000	I went into creative and I flew around through the nether
5785000	5787000	and I created a new portal because I couldn't remember
5787000	5789000	where the hell the old portal was
5789000	5791000	and I ended up in the middle of the ocean
5791000	5793000	and I still don't know where the fuck I was.
5793000	5795000	That's what I want to build is, like, an underwater lair.
5795000	5797000	Well, there's plenty of water.
5797000	5799000	That will not be a problem.
5799000	5800000	I mean, you can do that.
5800000	5801000	All right.
5801000	5805000	Uh, also, okay, so they are, you know, doing, um,
5805000	5808000	these updates to the Xbox version.
5808000	5810000	Now, they are talking about maybe doing some mods.
5810000	5814000	Maybe differentiating it a little bit from the PC version.
5814000	5817000	Now, the Xbox 360, according to 4J Studios,
5817000	5819000	won't be able to have the mod system that gives
5819000	5822000	such a variety of community additions to the game on PC,
5822000	5824000	but we're looking at the elements of these
5824000	5826000	that people seem to be enjoying the most
5826000	5828000	and deciding how we could tailor those elements
5828000	5830000	into something for the Xbox.
5830000	5831000	That'd be cool.
5831000	5833000	Xbox 360 players, they say it's because
5833000	5835000	you're in a living room, you use a controller,
5835000	5837000	so this is different the way you interact with the game.
5837000	5839000	I don't know that I play the controller on the PC version
5839000	5840000	and it's just fine.
5840000	5841000	You're a freak.
5841000	5844000	My coworker does, too, and he likes it.
5844000	5846000	He has a little bit of getting used to it,
5846000	5848000	but it's actually really easy to play with it
5848000	5849000	and I love it.
5849000	5850000	It's great.
5850000	5853000	I'm looking forward to just whatever they're gonna do,
5853000	5855000	you know, with Minecraft on the Xbox in the future.
5855000	5857000	I think it's great that despite the fact that
5857000	5859000	they've already sold millions and millions of copies of it,
5859000	5861000	they're not gonna stop updating it.
5861000	5863000	Like, that's, you know, I think a lot of people
5863000	5864000	would just take the money and run,
5864000	5866000	but they're still supporting it to sell even more copies.
5866000	5867000	I think that's great.
5867000	5870000	So, just throwing that out there.
5870000	5871000	Thank you, Rob.
5871000	5872000	Now that song is stuck in my head.
5872000	5873000	What?
5873000	5875000	Take the money and run.
5875000	5877000	You're welcome.
5877000	5879000	All right, I'm gonna open up the Skype line right now.
5879000	5881000	Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
5881000	5883000	The 877 number doesn't work tonight
5883000	5885000	because somebody forgot to pay the bill,
5885000	5887000	but I don't want to pay the bill tonight.
5887000	5888000	Why would I pay the bill tonight
5888000	5890000	when I'm not gonna use it tonight?
5890000	5893000	So, we'll have the 800 number back next week,
5893000	5895000	but for now you can call us OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype,
5895000	5896000	all one word.
5896000	5898000	While we wait for any call,
5898000	5900000	I mean, we have way less listeners than usual tonight,
5900000	5902000	obviously, because you guys had no warning this was happening,
5902000	5904000	but while I wait to see if anybody is gonna call,
5904000	5905000	do we have last minute stories?
5905000	5907000	I do have Twitter topics, but...
5907000	5908000	Slender's getting a sequel,
5909000	5913000	so that creepy game on PC is getting a brand new sequel.
5913000	5915000	They have a teaser up for it,
5915000	5917000	and it's supposed to have better graphics.
5917000	5918000	Looks neat.
5918000	5922000	Also, there's a picture I saw of the new CirclePad Pro
5922000	5924000	for the 3DS XL.
5924000	5927000	Talking about something that's bigger than the iPhone 5.
5927000	5929000	Man, that thing is fucking massive.
5929000	5931000	Is it like original Xbox controller big?
5931000	5933000	I think bigger.
5933000	5935000	It's seriously massive.
5935000	5937000	I just...
5937000	5938000	It looks stupid.
5938000	5941000	I mean, it seriously looks dumb that they have that.
5941000	5942000	It's like, come on, man.
5942000	5944000	You had this 3DS system that you could...
5944000	5947000	There's a spot that you could have put another CirclePad there,
5947000	5949000	but no, you just had to go and say,
5949000	5953000	eh, we're gonna add another attachment that no one fucking needs.
5953000	5955000	That's fantastic.
5956000	5957000	Let me go to some Twitter topics real quick
5957000	5959000	while we wait and see if we get any calls.
5959000	5961000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
5961000	5964000	I did not know about this.
5964000	5965000	This is something that Tigerclaw sent,
5965000	5968000	because Tigerclaw always sends the tweets, even if it's Thursday.
5968000	5970000	And this actually makes me really sad.
5970000	5972000	This is news to me. I did not hear about this.
5972000	5976000	I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi and the games he's created.
5976000	5980000	Rez and Meteos and, you know, Luminous.
5980000	5982000	He's made all these great games.
5982000	5984000	He's apparently moving away from game production.
5984000	5988000	He's gonna be doing more of a delegatory role in Q Entertainment.
5988000	5989000	More playgrounds.
5989000	5990000	What's that?
5990000	5991000	He's making playgrounds, too.
5991000	5993000	I guess. I don't know.
5993000	5997000	Since finishing Child of Eden, apparently he's doing more academic work.
5997000	6000000	They're saying he's more of a spokesperson.
6000000	6002000	He's not developing stuff right now.
6002000	6005000	Well, why not? That makes me sad.
6005000	6010000	There's been some other people that have left Q Entertainment.
6010000	6016000	James Milke, I guess, was somebody that produced Luminous Electronic Symphony,
6016000	6019000	and now he's with Q Games in Kyoto.
6019000	6021000	Very different.
6021000	6023000	So, huh.
6023000	6025000	Well, that's sad.
6025000	6030000	I hope Q Entertainment is able to make more of the music and puzzle
6030000	6033000	and those kind of really innovative types of games like Rez and stuff,
6033000	6036000	and maybe less of the 99 Nights.
6036000	6038000	You know, I haven't played much of Luminous.
6038000	6041000	It's great!
6041000	6045000	Alright, one more Twitter topic I have also from Tigerclaw.
6045000	6046000	You the man.
6046000	6050000	Apparently some layoffs at Sony Public Relations.
6050000	6052000	I'll get to that in a minute, though, because we have a call coming in.
6052000	6053000	I don't want to miss it.
6053000	6055000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
6055000	6057000	What's up, guys? It's Codeman.
6057000	6059000	Codeman! What's on your mind, buddy?
6059000	6061000	Oh, not much.
6061000	6066000	Just got back on last Saturday from Gearbox Community Day.
6066000	6068000	I wanted to tell you guys about it.
6068000	6073000	Yes, and thank you in advance for that stuff you got at the event.
6073000	6074000	You rock.
6074000	6076000	Oh, no problem, guys.
6076000	6079000	I wanted to get you guys something because you guys deserve everything in the world
6079000	6081000	for putting on this show every Sunday.
6081000	6084000	Flattery will get you everywhere.
6084000	6086000	I know. That's why I do it.
6086000	6089000	So, no, it was actually an amazing event.
6089000	6093000	Obviously, as everybody knows, Gearbox is a fantastic developer
6093000	6096000	with their games and their fan service.
6096000	6098000	Their fan service is just ridiculous.
6098000	6102000	I was talking to devs just all day.
6102000	6104000	I talked to Randy Pitchford.
6104000	6108000	It was crazy how much these guys
6108000	6111000	just want to interact with their fans, and it was amazing.
6111000	6114000	How did this event work? What was it?
6114000	6117000	Was it just a big showroom for Borderlands 2?
6117000	6120000	Was it Q&A panels? Was it more like a convention?
6120000	6122000	How was this all set up?
6122000	6125000	Pretty much everything you just said.
6125000	6128000	There were Q&A panels.
6128000	6131000	They had a panel specifically for Borderlands 2,
6131000	6134000	and then they had a panel for Aliens Colonial Marines,
6134000	6137000	which they really didn't say a whole lot about it
6137000	6140000	because I guess it's supposed to be out in 2013.
6140000	6144000	But they had a room for Colonial Marines,
6144000	6146000	which they only had two game types.
6146000	6149000	They had a team deathmatch game type, which was actually quite fun.
6149000	6153000	You can actually play as humans against aliens,
6153000	6155000	which was actually kind of neat.
6155000	6157000	And then they had an escape game type,
6157000	6160000	which I guess it was just you were basically trying to escape this area
6160000	6163000	where there was a whole bunch of aliens attacking you.
6163000	6165000	But, yeah, it was just a big event
6165000	6168000	that just had all kinds of different stuff.
6168000	6170000	You get to talk to everyone. It was amazing.
6170000	6173000	No Duke Nukem Forever presence?
6173000	6176000	No, they had his chair there.
6176000	6181000	But, no, there were no Duke Nukem anywhere.
6181000	6183000	I don't even think they even mentioned it, really.
6183000	6185000	What a shock. What a shock.
6185000	6187000	I know, right?
6187000	6189000	So how are you enjoying Borderlands 2?
6189000	6192000	I seem to recall you're a bit of a Borderlands fan.
6192000	6196000	Oh, yeah. Well, I actually picked it up on launch day, of course.
6196000	6199000	I guess like every crazy person that loves Borderlands 2.
6199000	6202000	And I only have gotten to play it once.
6202000	6206000	I'm actually a dad, so I really get to play a whole lot of video games.
6206000	6211000	But when I do, I get to sit down for long periods of time and play them.
6211000	6213000	But, no, I'm really enjoying it.
6213000	6216000	I have figured out, and, look, you probably know this,
6216000	6218000	because you've been playing it a lot, too,
6218000	6221000	and it actually has gotten a little harder.
6221000	6225000	I mean, the AI dodges your bullets now.
6225000	6228000	I mean, they're all over the place with the enemies.
6228000	6230000	So, I mean, it's pretty crazy.
6230000	6232000	This is why I need BFF mode.
6232000	6234000	I know, right?
6234000	6236000	I'm still working on the first one, slowly.
6236000	6238000	I think I got to level 10, not that long ago.
6238000	6240000	So I'm still working on it.
6240000	6248000	I do want to say they did kind of dance around the whole girlfriend mode thing in the panel.
6248000	6253000	One of the guys said something, and then Randy was like,
6253000	6254000	why don't you tell us about that?
6254000	6256000	And he's like, why don't you go fuck yourself?
6256000	6260000	That was pretty funny.
6260000	6265000	I can plug Bobby Blackwell's show from this two weeks ago at this point now,
6265000	6266000	and not last week but the week before.
6266000	6269000	He had those guys on the show, and they talked openly about it.
6269000	6272000	No go-fucking-yourself involved.
6272000	6275000	Oh, no, it was actually pretty funny,
6275000	6277000	because it was just the panel that were talking back and forth.
6277000	6281000	I mean, he was talking to another dev that was talking to him,
6281000	6287000	and I guess they've been giving him a whole lot of crap about this whole thing that got released
6287000	6290000	and how the media just took it and ran with it.
6290000	6293000	And so I guess around the office they've just been giving him all kinds of crap,
6293000	6295000	and they were just joking about it.
6295000	6301000	And Randy made a statement about it, how they're not discriminatory towards anybody in the whole entire world.
6301000	6306000	And he said people that discriminate towards other people just need to basically go die in a fire
6306000	6307000	and all this stuff.
6307000	6315000	It was crazy, because he really wanted to get out there that their company is just...
6315000	6320000	I mean, he was basically whoring their company out, just because it's a good company.
6320000	6325000	And I wouldn't say another company is bad, but this company is just so amazing.
6325000	6327000	I can't say...
6327000	6331000	And them actually being an independent company and not answering to anybody else,
6331000	6333000	I mean, that's just fantastic.
6334000	6337000	It's pretty cool that they do something like this,
6337000	6340000	because not every gaming company does something directly for the fans.
6340000	6342000	And, I mean, where was this at?
6342000	6344000	It was in Texas somewhere? Where was this?
6344000	6348000	It was in Dallas, Texas, at the Palladium Theater.
6348000	6351000	Well, I guess Dallas is still a pretty big city, all things considered.
6351000	6355000	But usually these types of things only happen in the Bay Area or LA or New York,
6355000	6357000	one of the big, big cities.
6357000	6360000	You don't often hear about these events in the Midwest, so that's really cool.
6360000	6363000	That and QuakeCon are the ones I can think of that are out there, so that's great.
6363000	6368000	QuakeCon just happened before we got there, Community Day.
6368000	6372000	So, I mean, I saw a whole bunch of people wearing QuakeCon shirts and all kinds of stuff.
6372000	6375000	So, I mean, it was a pretty big deal.
6375000	6380000	I mean, I think they estimated about probably around 700 people at this thing.
6380000	6383000	So, I mean, it was a pretty big, big deal.
6383000	6388000	But, I mean, we actually got to jump in line because we paid for tickets.
6388000	6394000	They had free general admission, but we paid for tickets, me and my friend,
6394000	6398000	and so we got to jump in line a little bit and get in there quicker.
6398000	6403000	But, yeah, I did play Borderlands on the PC, which really spoiled me
6403000	6408000	because I was on the Xbox when I got it on Tuesday, and I was just like,
6408000	6411000	oh, these graphics are horrible.
6411000	6416000	Yeah, and the getting used to the controls when you can have such precision with a keyboard and mouse,
6416000	6419000	that's a little bit rough.
6419000	6422000	True, true. And then I also wanted to, and then I'll let you guys go,
6422000	6429000	but I also wanted to say I actually, it's funny you mentioned the tester earlier in the show.
6429000	6434000	I actually grew up, I don't know if you guys, one of the panel, Brent Gokey,
6434000	6437000	I actually grew up with him.
6437000	6440000	He lived down the street from me when I was a little kid.
6441000	6448000	He actually mentioned that it is not on the table right now for tester for,
6448000	6452000	but he said it could pop up in the future.
6452000	6459000	They got tons of money and just stuff to support this show,
6459000	6463000	and the turnout for people that watched it was amazing.
6463000	6466000	He just said they got so many other things on the drawing board right now
6466000	6468000	that they just can't worry about that.
6468000	6471000	I'm hoping that means maybe some more original programming.
6471000	6475000	I've said this before on the show, as much as we love to make fun of the tester,
6475000	6478000	it actually wasn't terrible for what it was.
6478000	6480000	True, true.
6480000	6483000	I mean, yes, the setup might have been a little bit hokey like,
6483000	6486000	oh, you get to be a game tester, but by season three,
6486000	6489000	they made it a little better where you were at least a little more involved,
6489000	6492000	like what was it, you were an associate producer or something.
6492000	6494000	And most of the people who won the show,
6494000	6496000	the gay guy that won the show in season two,
6496000	6499000	he only did that for like six months,
6499000	6501000	and now he works for Sony Pictures Entertainment.
6501000	6503000	And I think the guy who won the first season
6503000	6507000	ended up in some type of promotional position too.
6507000	6510000	I don't know about this guy that won the most recent season,
6510000	6515000	but for what it is, they are working their way up in the company
6515000	6519000	and apparently ending up pretty successful, so that's kind of neat.
6519000	6522000	I was disappointed that Dark Soccer didn't get on there.
6522000	6523000	We all were.
6523000	6525000	I kind of just gave up on it.
6525000	6528000	We all were, but we had Asuka,
6528000	6531000	who apparently was a friend of an OLR listener,
6531000	6533000	ended up calling into OLR one night.
6533000	6535000	You have to go back in the archives to find her,
6535000	6538000	but she called in and it ended up being like the day before she got,
6538000	6540000	you know, voted off the island or whatever it is.
6540000	6543000	I heard that, I heard that show, I remember that show,
6543000	6548000	and it was very, I was very distraught because I kind of liked her.
6548000	6549000	Yeah, I know.
6549000	6551000	And when she got kicked off, I was like,
6551000	6555000	aw man, she just had an amazing interview with Orange Lounge Radio
6555000	6556000	and now she got kicked off.
6556000	6558000	I had no idea that that was going to happen,
6558000	6561000	and yes, it was just kind of, I was like,
6561000	6563000	of course, of course, she was just on the show,
6563000	6565000	and yeah, Kiss of Death or whatever,
6565000	6568000	but that's, what a funny small world.
6568000	6571000	Yeah, that guy's like the Simon Cowell of the show,
6571000	6574000	and so that's kind of funny that you grew up with him.
6574000	6575000	That's pretty crazy.
6575000	6576000	What a small world.
6576000	6579000	I told you, we're like D-list video game celebs now.
6579000	6581000	Now we've got ties to two,
6581000	6583000	now we have ties not only to tester contestants,
6583000	6585000	but apparently the tester panel.
6585000	6588000	I'm this close to Adrian Curry, this close.
6588000	6589000	All right.
6589000	6592000	Anyhow, we should probably let you go, dude.
6592000	6595000	Okay, man, well, I appreciate you taking my call,
6595000	6598000	and enjoy the poster, man.
6598000	6602000	I actually, I should have got them to write on their OLR,
6602000	6605000	but I was like, it was just so fast and crazy
6605000	6608000	that, you know, but yeah, everybody's on there,
6608000	6610000	from the dev team to Randy Pitchford
6610000	6613000	to the guardian angel who plays
6613000	6615000	the guardian angel in Borderlands,
6615000	6617000	she's on there, the girl who plays the siren
6617000	6620000	in the second game is on there,
6620000	6622000	like everybody's on there, so enjoy it.
6622000	6625000	Hey, we have a saying, beggars can't be choosers,
6625000	6626000	so thank you very much,
6626000	6629000	and maybe we'll get them on the show next time.
6629000	6630000	That would be great.
6630000	6631000	Bobby got it this time,
6631000	6633000	but maybe for Borderlands 3, we'll see.
6633000	6635000	All right, take care, buddy.
6635000	6637000	Thank you very much, and keep doing what you're doing.
6637000	6638000	We will.
6638000	6640000	Not slowing down anytime soon.
6640000	6641000	Bye.
6641000	6642000	All right, we'll see you.
6642000	6644000	All right.
6644000	6646000	I like talking to him.
6646000	6647000	He's fun.
6647000	6648000	He's full of energy, too.
6648000	6650000	He's really happy, genuinely.
6650000	6651000	Quite so.
6651000	6652000	What's up?
6652000	6654000	The Midway Arcade Origins Collection
6654000	6655000	does have super off-road.
6655000	6657000	Ooh, and where'd you hear that?
6657000	6658000	They have the full list, actually.
6658000	6659000	Nice.
6659000	6662000	It's 720 APB arch rivals, bubbles,
6662000	6665000	Championship Sprint, Tournament Cyberball 2072,
6665000	6667000	Defender, Defender 2, Gauntlet, Gauntlet 2,
6667000	6669000	Joust, Joust 2, Marble Madness, Pit Fighter,
6669000	6672000	Rampage, Rampart, Robotron 2084,
6672000	6674000	Rootbeard, Tapper, Satan's Hollow,
6674000	6677000	Cinestar, Smash TV, Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter 2,
6677000	6679000	Super Off-Road, Super Sprint,
6679000	6682000	Toobin, Total Carnage, Vindicators Part 2,
6682000	6685000	Wizards of War, Xenophobe, and Zybots.
6685000	6688000	That's kind of the greatest hits of the three
6688000	6689000	that were already out.
6689000	6691000	I don't think there's any of those.
6691000	6693000	I didn't think Marble Madness was in one of the other collections.
6693000	6694000	And $29.99.
6694000	6695000	Huh.
6695000	6699000	It's just, it's a bummer it's not online.
6699000	6702000	Or that they couldn't add something else to Sweet in the Pot.
6702000	6704000	Shitty.
6704000	6708000	Alright, back to the tweet I was on before the phone call came in.
6708000	6712000	Unfortunately, talking Sony and talking people moving up in Sony,
6712000	6714000	unfortunately, some people moving out.
6714000	6718000	There was reorganization that affected some PR people.
6719000	6721000	Hopefully not people I was just talking about.
6721000	6723000	That's kind of too bad.
6723000	6727000	All employees are now apparently in the Foster City headquarters,
6727000	6729000	but there's no impact on game development.
6729000	6732000	So like Sony, Santa Monica, and all that's fine.
6732000	6736000	Apparently this is in an article I've been linked to on GameSpot.
6736000	6743000	There was a re-org and some PR people were in San Diego were let go.
6743000	6748000	Which, funny enough, I think was the studio where all that tester stuff happened.
6748000	6752000	Which might explain a little bit about, oh that's really sad.
6752000	6753000	That's too bad.
6753000	6755000	But it's all in Foster City.
6755000	6757000	So hopefully some people got relocated at least maybe.
6757000	6759000	But, bummer bummer.
6759000	6764000	This follows a closing of Zipper Interactive, which had happened back in March.
6764000	6766000	They made SoCom and MAG.
6766000	6771000	And in April they said they were going to cut 10,000 jobs, but that was Sony-wide.
6771000	6775000	Wipeout developer studio Liverpool also had been closed this year.
6775000	6778000	So a bunch of bummer news from Sony.
6778000	6780000	We hope they're able to land on their feet soon.
6780000	6783000	And maybe they'll sell some VITAs so they can hire them back.
6783000	6786000	Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get into tonight?
6786000	6788000	Or Dark Soccer if you have any.
6788000	6790000	No.
6790000	6792000	Castle of Crashers is coming to the Steam next week.
6792000	6793000	Nice.
6793000	6794000	26.
6794000	6795000	Only took what, four years?
6795000	6796000	Nice.
6796000	6800000	There's a Half-Life 3 rumor that it's open world and coming in 2013.
6800000	6801000	Oh my.
6801000	6803000	It's from an anonymous source too.
6803000	6805000	I think that's true.
6805000	6807000	Extremely trustworthy.
6807000	6809000	Extremely.
6809000	6815000	And I guess there's also an article I just read about publishers apparently trying to exploit Kickstarter.
6815000	6819000	Basically getting, this is actually coming from the last one.
6819000	6821000	It was Obsidian.
6821000	6823000	Now they have their Kickstarter.
6823000	6829000	They said, we were actually contacted by some publishers over the last few months that wanted us to do a Kickstarter.
6829000	6834000	I said to them, so you want us to do a Kickstarter for using our name.
6834000	6836000	We then get Kickstarter money to make a game.
6836000	6840000	Then you publish the game, but we don't get to keep the brand we make.
6840000	6842000	We only get a portion of the profits.
6842000	6844000	And they said yes.
6844000	6845000	Wow.
6845000	6847000	To which he said, fuck off.
6847000	6849000	No surprise.
6849000	6851000	Anything else? That's it.
6851000	6853000	Well that brings us to the end of the show.
6853000	6858000	I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but that's what happens when we tape on a Sunday that we're not used to.
6858000	6862000	But before we close out tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
6862000	6867000	Before I get into that, I do want to thank everybody for listening and for being here this week.
6867000	6874000	We will be back in our normal time slot live on Sunday night on the 30th with episode number 475.
6874000	6878000	We are talking behind the scenes about some possible changes in the future Orange Launch Radio.
6878000	6880000	Nothing major.
6880000	6882000	I just wanted to leave you that little sampling to go with.
6882000	6884000	So that could be in the coming weeks.
6884000	6886000	Certainly before episode 500.
6887000	6891000	If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.
6891000	6893000	Spread the word.
6893000	6895000	Leave us a nice review on iTunes.
6895000	6899000	Especially now that podcasting is in a separate application in the iOS 6.
6899000	6901000	We can use all the word of mouth we can get.
6901000	6905000	Also there's some great third party apps like Stitcher that you can listen to Orange Launch Radio in.
6905000	6909000	And it looks like, looking at the stats on Stitcher, more and more of you are.
6909000	6911000	So we really appreciate that.
6911000	6914000	And if you've enjoyed our show on Stitcher, please consider sharing it with your friends.
6914000	6916000	And leaving some good comments on there too.
6916000	6919000	You know, word of mouth is all we got right now.
6919000	6921000	And it's all we've had over the past 10 years.
6921000	6925000	Dan the man, thank you very much for being on the show tonight and fighting with your wife.
6925000	6927000	Always a good time to have that going on on air.
6927000	6929000	I like turtles.
6929000	6932000	Is that your final thought tonight? Do you have a final thought tonight, Dan?
6932000	6935000	He's shaking his head. I guess it's I like turtles.
6935000	6937000	Alright, Dark Sakura.
6937000	6939000	I want dinner.
6939000	6940000	You want dinner.
6940000	6942000	And I didn't make a fortune cookie.
6942000	6944000	What do you want from Disneyland?
6946000	6947000	Stuff. You got it.
6947000	6949000	Duffy. Stuff. I guess.
6949000	6951000	Loki. Your final thought tonight?
6951000	6954000	I guess I'll play some more Minecraft.
6954000	6958000	My final thought tonight is, don't hate me because I went to Disneyland.
6958000	6961000	It's the last trip for at least a year.
6961000	6963000	So, womp womp. Sadness.
6963000	6965000	It's okay, I'm going in two weeks.
6967000	6969000	Alright, that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody.
6969000	6971000	We'll see you next time at Orange Launch Radio.
6971000	6973000	Thanks for listening to this slightly shorter edition.
6973000	6975000	We'll see you next week for a full show. Good night.
7001000	7003000	Orange Launch Radio or FOG Network.
7003000	7006000	But you know they were all still true.
7006000	7008000	See you next week.
7031000	7034000	Thanks for watching!
