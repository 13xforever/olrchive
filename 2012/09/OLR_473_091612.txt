Tonight, September 16, 2012, the Wii U launch details are official, Zynga files a counterclaim against EA, and is Microsoft planning an immersive display experience for their next console?
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 473 for Sunday, September 16th, 2012.
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and gaming lols with my co-hosts,
Not with us tonight, sadly, the one, the only, DarkSakura.
She has the night off.
It is a holiday in her religion.
So a happy Rosh Hashanah to those of you that celebrate it.
We do have here tonight, though, in studio, Tech Master Loki joining us.
Hello.
How are you, Loki?
I'm doing all right.
Awesome.
And joining us in Jamie's absence, always a wonderful standby guest host we're happy to have here, as if he had a choice.
Say hello to Alan.
Hello.
How are you doing, Alan?
Good.
What's new with you lately?
Not much.
Working a lot.
Yeah?
Have you had time for any hobbies outside of video gaming and work?
No.
No?
No.
What else do you do on the interwebs?
Tumblrs.
Tumblrs?
You're a big Tumblr fan?
Yes.
Why do you like Tumblr?
I have a hard time getting into Tumblr.
Because for like funny reaction gifs and fandom stuff and screenshots, that's where everyone gets into that.
There was an amazing gif I saw on Tumblr last night that said starships are meant to fly.
And it was an old lady going up one of those moving chairs.
I guess you had to see it.
All right.
Anyhow.
All right.
We'll talk to Alan more as the show goes on.
We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOG Network.
VOGnetwork.com is the place to be.
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
Another quality show from Bobby tonight.
And we even got into a little bit of a debate at the end there on a topic we'll be talking about here shortly.
You can check that out at VOGnetwork.com when Bobby posts his show very soon.
But you should be participating live.
You can also participate with us and chat in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com where we have some good well wishes tonight.
Ranma saying L'chaim, SSJ100Mad, Happy New Year.
So some other well wishes there for those celebrating the holiday today.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want to start with this clip.
It's a two-minute clip.
This is a clip from our show, episode 463, from July 1st.
Let's go to the clip.
The Wii U, I think, is a reasonable price.
It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.
There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with.
What's in those SKUs?
No idea.
What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.
So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99.
So, there's that.
The next price up, $299.99, and then $349.99 are the three different price points.
Here's my thoughts on what they are, because this is completely speculative.
I don't know for a fact this is what it is.
Um...
249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.
So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now, you have all those Wii remotes and... Go on the online shop and enjoy.
Yeah, nunchucks...
Done.
There you go.
You've got a system.
You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.
$299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii Remote Plus and an Unchuck, kind of like the Wii had.
And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the GamePad controller, the Wii Remote Plus, the Nunchuck, and another pack-in game.
Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land.
It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.
Honestly, I do not think they're launching the system with two gamepads.
Because there's no games that support it.
And people will be like, it won't sell.
That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads.
But right now, it's absolutely useless to do that.
Which is why they're not going to do that.
Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September.
But there are the price points.
Release date is probably going to be the 18th of November.
So that's that.
I think it's somewhat reasonable.
That again, a clip.
It's done.
The clip was from episode 463 on July 1st, 2012.
Let me start by applauding you.
Honestly, clap, clap, clap.
Show me anyone else that was that close.
Was it perfect?
No.
You did make one major flaw.
Let's talk about the flaw.
Where was the difference?
Obviously, $299, $349 ended up being legit.
You called multiple SKUs.
The we did not, well, multiple bundles.
People don't like it when you say SKU.
Multiple bundles, you called that.
We didn't have that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's just too confusing for the populace.
That's why they only launched with two SKUs for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
No one does more than two SKUs because it's too confusing.
I also think they can't get the cost that low.
They couldn't get the cost of the system to be $249.
So they just dropped that bottom SKU.
I think that's why they haven't announced the price yet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's a lot higher than I would have thought.
Because to me, that thing isn't much more than the bottom half of a DS, except a little bigger.
Let's say a DS XL.
I guess maybe it's a little bigger than that, too.
I was kind of surprised it's got to go that high.
And that certainly would set off a chain of events that would cause the 249 bundle to get eliminated.
Well, even their reasoning behind not having remotes and nunchucks in there, they're like, well, there's 10...
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
WeMotionPlus enabled remote pluses.
But, I think, like I said, that they cut the bottom skew just because they couldn't get the price cheap enough.
Well, still, I mean, despite the fact that, you know, that part didn't end up being true, and you even said in that clip, you were kind of pulling what was in those bundles out of your ass, and you still kind of got the 349 one right.
You were pretty, I mean, there's a part in that clip I cut out where I went on this, I'm like, I think the 349 bundle will have two Wii tablets and da-da-da.
What was I wrong?
That's another reason why you're not, well,
We're not seeing two tablets because, one, no game support.
You're not seeing them sell the tablets separately because, once again, well, not here, because people will be confused and they'll think, oh, this is just an add-on for the Wii.
I'm going to buy the tablet.
And they go home and it doesn't fucking work in my Wii.
Why does this work?
This tablet's the Wii U, right?
No, it's not.
So you just have to think about the consumer and whether they're going to be confused by what you're trying to sell to them.
Giovedea agrees with you in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and puts it into slightly different words.
The second-hand market comes from people upgrading as well.
You need those parts even if you upgrade, so there isn't going to be a huge market.
I suppose that's true.
People are going to need those Wiimotes and things for the new system if they want to play all the games.
Nintendo Land, the pack-in game, that's the weird thing to me, that it isn't coming with another Wiimote, because doesn't Nintendo Land's minigames kind of require those Wiimotes?
I think they're all multiple.
We play Wii Sports, whatever.
It's basically tech demos to get you familiar with how you use the controllers and stuff like that.
But it's also a multiplayer game.
So if you buy it for your kid or something like that and you don't have a Wii...
Well, sucks to be you.
You're not going to be playing very much of it because you've got to go get those extra controllers and stuff.
And it gets confusing, I think, because you've got all these different control methods with this thing.
You've got the remotes, the nunchucks, the classic controllers, the pro controllers, this tablet thing.
You've got the balance board and...
Just figuring out what you need for each game.
It's ridiculous.
Oh, nunchucks with everything, too.
It's just going to get confusing.
It's interesting.
There is a lot.
There's a lot of peripherals over in Nintendo land.
That's for sure.
Chris109 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, My sister was thinking that the Wii U pad was just an add-on and that you write a U next to the... And it got cut off, but I'm assuming next to the word Wii.
so maybe not everybody is Jimmy Fallon I was going to reference that clip too there was that big clip a couple months ago where even Jimmy Fallon didn't get it and Reggie had to kind of hold on it's a whole new system but you can sit there and be a skeptic I can sit there and be a skeptic I'm not sure where Alan's at but we'll ask him in a little bit the fact of the matter is pre-orders are going fast as we have a story coming up later as we have to take the word from Nintendo that they're going fast well if you try to go to GameStop yourself they're not going to give you one right now
Well, that's because Nintendo tells GameStop how many they can sell.
But we don't know what that number is.
Of course not.
Because they want to make it sound like it's in high demand.
Like they do with the Wii.
Remember all those artificial... I'm sorry, real-life shortages.
Totally not artificial shortages whatsoever.
Well, to be fair, Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox 360 launch.
I distinctly remember how long it took to find a stinking 360...
trying to go on and check Best Buy's inventory every day.
That crap was madness.
Okay, yeah, that may have lasted for a few months.
Nintendo's Wii launch lasted for a few years that they did that, okay?
It wasn't even, you know, a few months.
It was, okay, we got our supply line taken care of in a couple months, but the Wii, it was just like, oh, it's so hard to get, so hard to get.
It's the must-have toy for, you know, your kids.
I don't know, whatever, you know, I'm skeptical.
There's some talk about the things that the Wii U could be leaving out.
TigerClaw in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, The only thing you have to take into account is the Wii U is not GameCube compatible.
So if you still play your GameCube games, you'll need to keep that Wii.
Or find a GameCube, to be fair.
You could find a GameCube really cheap.
Nowadays, Wiis aren't compatible with GameCube either.
And that's right, SSJ100Matt followed up saying they dropped GameCube controller compatibility in new Wii models, so I wouldn't expect it on the Wii U. He left out the part about the games don't play in the new Wii models either, but certainly the controllers aren't there either.
I'm surprised that the system doesn't do... I guess I understand why they don't do it, so they can do their own HD remakes and stuff, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
to a little bit you know smaller extent they kind of smooth them out a little bit and even like uh you know the Xbox 360 did that with the Xbox games it kind of smoothed it out a little bit to make it look a little bit nicer but I'm surprised they don't do that with the Wii stuff it's just you would think that'd be kind of a cool selling point hey all your games look better now I mean because that might even be a way to get people to purchase one if they're not going to so
well we'll talk a little bit more when we get into the news segment of our show the official news segment of our show on some more of the details with the Wii there's some pretty big ones we're leaving out right now but we'll come back to it in the official news segment talk a little more about it see where everybody here in studio is on if they're going to get one or not and then later when we get into the Fugle question of the week and throughout the show with our chatters we'll see where the listeners are at with do they want a Wii U or not because obviously this is kind of a very polarizing thing in the game in the gaming world right now
very back and forth on Twitter.
Lots of fanboys, lots of anti-fanboys, a few people in the middle, but not a lot.
I did, though, want to take a second to say, though, you know, again, congrats, because you nailed the date back in July before any other rumor was out there.
A lot of people jumped on the November train the closer we got here to the September conference, but you nailed it, so props to you.
Yes, thank you, EpicMickey2.
Because
Because that was the giveaway.
Considering that they're launching Epic Mickey 2 on all SKUs on the 18th, Disney never launches a game on Sunday.
They never do that.
So it was pretty obvious.
That was your hint right there.
Well, whatever it was, props to you because I didn't hear anybody else get as close as you did, even some top industry analysts.
But that's right, because no one noticed.
All right.
Let's move on into our gaming weeks.
Obviously, there's no chance to play a Wii U just yet, so we've been playing some other stuff to pass the time.
Alan, I haven't heard from you a lot yet, so let's start with you tonight.
How was your gaming week?
What have you been up to?
Amazing.
Yeah?
Black Mesa Source.
It's so good, I lost my mind.
It is so good.
Alright, back up a little bit.
For those that may not know, what is Black Mesa Source?
It is an 8 years in the making fan project to completely remake Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 Source Engine with completely new HD assets, new voice acting, new face models.
It is indistinguishable from something that Valve could have made themselves.
It is that good.
That's a pretty good endorsement right there.
Yes.
Can I read an email you sent me earlier in the week, if I can dig it up?
Yeah.
Dear Rob, I love you.
XOXO.
No, I'm just kidding.
That's not true.
Hey, let's see.
Where is it?
Where is that one you sent me?
Oh, this is great radio, isn't it?
I think you just sent it to me.
I think this mod may be the greatest accomplishment a fandom has ever produced for a franchise.
I'm serious.
There are tons of little added ambient dialogue bits and everything is professional.
It is literally indistinguishable italicized
from something Valve could have made themselves.
This is not a mod.
This is a wholesale creation that had the added benefit of model to reference.
These developers deserve college scholarships or offer letters from Valve and I'll be angry if Gabe Newell doesn't make some kind of statement by the end of the month acknowledging how fucking good this is.
They perfectly mimic the lobby of Black Mesa that is referenced from the more recent Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that of course looks nothing like the same room in the 98 original.
Anyone who still complains this took eight years to make is a fool.
I'm allowed to have some hyperbole in my emails to my boyfriend, thank you.
I was very heated.
Well, it certainly got the point across.
But, I mean, for something you didn't pay any money for, you felt... Well, I mean, it's a positive review, to be fair.
When the game loads up and you're on that monorail going through all of the extra rooms and shit they added, I had to pause it in, like, two places and be like, what the fuck am I looking at?
This is, like... This is incredible.
It's just like what the trailer was that came out in 2009, but...
Half-Life in itself is a fucking awesome game and this just complete for a fan project has blown my mind.
And despite what you said in your email about college scholarships and Gabe Newell should essentially give them big hugs and what have you, you have to admit it is pretty impressive.
Valve themselves said, cool, just don't call it Half-Life and we're good.
Don't infringe on the trademark and we're good.
In fact, we'll help you distribute it on Steam for free.
It's on Greenlight, yeah.
It is free.
That's huge.
You just have to own any Source game.
If you own a fucking Portal game, you can get this.
Which they've given away for free.
Yes.
So, Portal, I think, is the most accessible title that you would have, that you could play this with, or Left 4 Dead, because Left 4 Dead is also crazy popular.
What about, can't you download the client for Team Fortress 2 since that's Source 2, isn't it?
Yeah, that could also be it too.
And that is free.
Yeah.
Aha.
Loki, work in the system, like usual.
So yeah, you asked me, am I ever going to play Half-Life, either Half-Life the original or Half-Life Source?
No, there's no reason to.
Because Black Mesa Source is there.
That's a big endorsement from a Half-Life fan like you.
Yes.
So now the next question, where the fuck is Half-Life 3?
Another eight years.
Yeah, I know.
And there are people on the forums kind of being smartasses, but they're right saying, when I legitimately thought that this fan project was vaporware, I had a little voice in the back of my head that said, even if this is vaporware, we're still going to see this before Half-Life 3.
And those people are all right.
Amazing.
Going to our chat, Tigerclaw saying, I was hoping somebody would talk about Black Mesa.
I heard Black Mesa doesn't have Zen.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Gravity is weird.
It's got all these weird platforming bullshit puzzles in it for a first-person shooter.
You don't really want to do that.
It's probably the biggest misstep in the original game.
The Black Mesa Source developer said, we are putting out 90% of the game.
Once you enter the portal to go into Xen,
I haven't gotten there yet, but I imagine there's a screen that's like, we're saving your game, this is going to be patched in.
Of course, these people are terrified of giving deadlines.
But they're like, it is coming, we're working on Xen, it's mostly done.
Xen is coming later, and that's the end of the game.
Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says, it's not finished yet, everything's remade up to Lambda Core, but they figured they'd release what they have now and the rest later.
Breakman asks, Jesus, did he play the game or marry it?
Yeah.
No shame.
I don't care.
Think about that.
What has your fandom accomplished?
Well, they added women to... In the original game, all the security guards and scientists are just men just because it's only two or three different models, right?
They added women.
There's the guards and the scientists.
There's like 16 unique face models so that when you come across these NPCs, like, oh, this is like a new person.
It's...
All of the added voice acting of just the guards being killed by monsters running around that you encounter, it sounds like they found the original people from the first game.
And they just added all these lines of dialogue.
It's crazy what they did with this.
So props to the folks who put this together, certainly.
It's hard to make an argument not to go download this right now.
Yeah, it's a classic game, free.
They made some little changes to the maps, because obviously someone like me, I've beaten the original Half-Life maybe eight times from start to finish, so I could zerk my way through it.
But I'm like, oh, they added this area, or oh, they closed this door that I used to go into, and now I have to go over here, and this is all new.
They added their own little spice to it.
DungeonBuster at live.vognetwork.com says, Black Mesa's really great work.
Glad they kept the faith to continue with it for so long.
Very good point as well.
After what happened to them in 2009, where they came out, they said Q3 or Q4 of 2009, it's going to happen.
They realized the parts that they had left to program were the hardest parts.
They had at least a year's worth of work left to do.
and they made a design decision to basically cut out huge chunks of the game that they didn't know how to code and once 2010 hit they're like okay now that we've cut all of this shit out because it was too hard for us to do we're now embarrassed by this and we don't want to put it out like this so they're like fuck it media blackout they took down their twitter or they just they stopped updating their twitter and their youtube and they're like we're gonna put all this shit back in however long it takes us to do it and it took until September of this year
Wow.
That's amazing dedication because that sort of demotivation would have killed a lot of people.
It's very impressive what fan communities do.
You know, we've seen a lot of these stories throughout the years.
I can remember way back when there was the fan translation of Final Fantasy V for emulators.
Remember that back in the day before there was a PlayStation release?
And 3, I think, was the first one, right?
The NES one?
Because that's the first game we didn't get.
No, I think 5 got the translation first.
3 came soon afterwards.
Okay.
Because I think the NES was harder to patch or something.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I also remember Second Densetsu 3 was the other huge, huge one that they did the fan translation for.
And then, of course, I remember the, don't call it King's Quest, but the Silver Lining game that was heavily inspired by King's Quest and at one time was called King's Quest 9, but like Black Mesa, they had to take the King's Quest out of their name to avoid the legal situation they had found themselves in.
so it's really impressive what a lot of like fan communities have accomplished and I'm like would I be that motivated to do anything like that oh yeah I have had a podcast for 10 years I guess that's kind of cool but this shit's easy Black Mesa I don't think that was nearly as easy so that's that's you know major props so well what else in your gaming week anything else
I'm tinkered around with a little WoW, checking out the balance changes and the class changes to my druid, who's my main, and I haven't really played as much WoW as I should.
And then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a little bit.
They had a multiplayer weekend.
A little bit?
A little bit?
The last weekend when they had their, every other week they do log in and do this squad challenge and you get like a free rare elite weapon on Wednesday or whatever.
I completely spaced it.
What level are you in Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer?
My N7 score?
Yeah.
It's like about 680.
And then I'll still log in in a match with someone with an N7 score of like 8,000.
I'm like, you know what?
I'm not that bad.
I'm not that bad.
I'm not that bad.
They're sharing their account.
That's what's going on there.
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
No, that's it.
Let's go to Loki.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I played lots of Minecraft.
I've been just building this massive castle on the VOG Network server, which you should join, by the way, if you haven't already.
It's pretty fun.
Get a few people on there.
I see a few people on there.
That fucking castle you're building is astounding.
I could see that all the way from my little house that's like a ways away.
I can't believe we're talking about a fake world.
But my house is like all the way away.
The one that some smartass nutman put foreclosure signs all over.
Did I show you that, Alan?
Yeah, you did.
I don't know who did it.
Well, like, there's some people I can't... Like, there's some people I can't...
There's some people that are on there right now.
I don't see them on the map.
Nutman I haven't seen actually play, but there's a few spots because I need everybody to start posting.
If you haven't already, put a sign out front of your house so I know whose it is because there's a bunch of spots.
My coworker is the worst.
He keeps starting new places.
He's like, I'm going to build on this island.
I'm like, you already have four fucking houses.
I'm breaking all of them if you don't fucking pick a spot.
Pick a spot and stick to it.
and like the other day he's like I think I'm gonna build over here I'm like no you're not you're building where you fucking said before and I actually had to go in there and like I switched up the creative to go and destroy his like other houses that he built because they were I don't want all these like half built things well I will let Nutman know the banker
that I have started digging up clay from all the lakes I can find and started baking some bricks so I can make a house out of brick so go pick on the guys up on top of the hill who also have a stone house or go try to foreclose Loki's castle I know it's all in good fun I'm not really mad I laughed I really did laugh
Get on the VOG server right now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's why I haven't, that's why I run a vanilla server because I'm like, I don't know how to fucking set this up with bucket and stuff.
I'm like, mods?
The mods that I use are mostly just quality of life stuff.
They're not like spawn diamonds everywhere.
No, no, no, no, no.
Loki would frown on that, even though he's probably doing it himself.
I know.
I do find myself in creative mode a little bit more than I probably should be, just to fly around.
You know what?
When I saw those Endermen outside my house, I was like, no thank you, I'm going to log out for about 30 minutes and come back when those guys are gone.
They honestly, because like I said, the other day we were fucking around with it and my friend took on like...
20 of them at once.
I mean, they're really not that... If you just don't look at their face, you can walk right past them.
But they're scary.
Minecraft's scary.
They are kind of creepy.
They are creepy.
Survival horror.
They're way scarier.
It is hilarious, though, watching them in the rain because I was building in the rain.
All of a sudden, I see this red flash go past my screen.
I'm like, what the fuck was that?
It's like a bug or something.
It's because they're flipping out because they keep teleporting and they hit the rain and then they take damage so they teleport again.
So they're teleporting all over the place.
It was kind of funny.
But anyways, so I played lots of Minecraft.
And then I played, well, a little bit of Call of Duty.
I've been playing some of that because we have some more people we're playing with now at work and stuff.
But we haven't played Minecraft during our breaks, so that's kind of fun.
I repurposed our arcade cabinet that we had running MAME and stuff to play Minecraft.
and then yesterday I started playing Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360.
Ooh, little early or broken release street dates and all that kind of, okay.
Whatever.
I like it.
It's, you know, right now I was kind of, I didn't know who I should play as so I played as Zero because it was kind of a little similar to Mordecai which is how I played the first game.
You know, sniper, pistol.
I don't know if he's proficient in the pistol but I know he's proficient in sniper rifle.
Sniper Pistol
There's that in there, but then they take it a little bit further, and it's kind of funny.
So they've got that, and then there's a clear-cut villain in it, which is a little bit unique versus the last game.
In the last game, there wasn't really a villain until kind of towards the end, and even then it was like, okay, well, the villain kept changing.
It was a little weird, but now there's a clear-cut villain in there, and he's awesome.
You know, handsome Jack, so...
It's pretty sweet.
And the game seems a little bit harder.
For me, at least.
The enemies are a lot more mobile and they're less dumb.
They will actually take cover a lot better than they did before.
But this one has an easier... Because they have the BFF mode, right?
It hasn't come out yet.
BFF mode's in the MechRomancer, which is not until October.
It doesn't matter.
You don't need that.
I do.
You don't need that.
It's just a skill tree.
You can get skills, I think, until way later in the game.
I haven't gotten the skill trees yet.
I thought you started getting those at level 5.
Then again, remember, I'm playing... Well, level 5, yeah, but I'm only level 4 right now.
I haven't even gotten there yet.
Wow, okay.
I mean, it takes a little bit.
But it's nice.
I like the game.
It's fun.
So I will definitely be playing that.
I have to balance my time between that and Minecraft.
You're only level 4.
It sounds like you're not playing it enough.
I only played it for a couple hours last week.
I was like, I want to go back in Minecraft.
No, I should play this.
It's like me in Warcraft.
Same thing.
All right, is that it for your gaming week?
That's it.
My gaming week.
I didn't talk about Rock Band Blitz last week, so I just want to quickly kind of give it a shout out.
And I really, I've been wanting, meaning to write a review for vognetwork.com, but I've just been very busy between my day job and the show I'm directing for early October.
I haven't had a lot of time to just, when I do have free time, it's like, I don't want to do more work.
So I apologize.
But Rock Band Blitz, I'll tell you some of my early thoughts on it now.
Obviously, how great is it to have an enhanced version
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The fact that those songs will import into Rock Band 3 is great.
And just if you have whored and downloaded as many songs for Rock Band the series as I have onto your 360, what an amazing value to have this new game that uses them in this whole new way.
Some of the things I didn't like, I don't think the game is as strong as frequency and amplitude.
I think it's, you know, the whole fact that it's like two buttons and has this kind of interesting mechanic where the way you increase your score is to try and get up all the multipliers by a certain point in the song.
But you might have to know the song a little bit to know that, oh, your only chance to up the vocal multipliers is in this one part.
That was a little weird to get used to, but I'm okay with it.
But the part that starts to bug me is then when you, if you really want to do well on a song, you got to use power-ups.
and some of the power-ups are pretty cool like I love the pinball and I love all that stuff but then we get all Facebook up in here the only way to get these power-ups is with coins and you get coins through either playing songs or completing challenges how do you sign up for challenges?
you gotta link the game to your Facebook now I gotta say Harmonix does get props for thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different and integrating a game so well
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's just that, you know, I think it's just a little bit flawed.
I think you kind of took something that was meant to be for a free-to-play game and tried to put it in this game, and it's not working out so well, as you can tell, because you're already changing the weights of things in the first couple weeks.
But, again, $15, good songs, new game that uses your old DLC, not a bad deal.
If you like music games, you probably already have it.
um some other games I played this week Borderlands 1 because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now free with the quotes because PlayStation Plus isn't free but you know what I mean um ironic because I already own it on the PC but I don't know sometimes I just want to sit on the couch and play it that way with the controller even though I'm not as accurate with the controller I've already got farther on PlayStation 3 than I did on PC go figure but I'm having a good time uh the other new game I want to talk about
Double Dragon Neon Speaking of free things on PlayStation Plus Did you know Double Dragon Neon came out this last week?
Now, Alan, I distinctly remember this There was a previous show you were on You were filling in for Jamie And you and I had played through Double Dragon on Xbox Because I just randomly had the version that was on Xbox like five years ago Yeah, and then Dan came in and yelled at us That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah And we played through it and we were like God
What... This game is shitty.
Like, what were people... Why did we love this game growing up?
It did not age well.
The clipping and the falling off platforms and just the difficulty and it was kind of janky and slow and yeah.
Yeah, and so Dan came in and yelled at us going, shut up, Double Dragon's a great game.
But like, you know, we were like, ugh.
So now there's this remake, Double Dragon Neon, that came out.
And I gotta admit, I approached this remake going, Double Dragon's stupid, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it, so whatever, I'll get on there and check it out.
I gotta say, well done way forward.
They made Double Dragon kind of fun again.
It's not a straight up remake.
It's not a shot for shot remake type of thing.
They added some new things into it.
Like Billy and Jimmy can now throw fireballs.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, release the Kraken!
He'll start saying things like that.
It's really stupid.
And then there's this whole stupid thing you can do.
What the hell was it called?
It was, instead of co-op, it's called bro-op.
And you can use the right stick or something to just give a high five to your bro.
Yeah, high five, bro.
It's ridiculous.
It's so stupid, but I'm just eating it up.
I feel like the guys that way forward who developed it, and to give this company props, they've done a lot of the other good remakes too, of which I'm drawing a blank right now, but I know there were some other really good ones they did.
Son of a bitch.
Why can't I remember?
Somebody in chat will help me out.
But it's like they kind of knew that it was a bad game they were adapting, but made it fun.
So I love that.
TigerClaw says, I heard they changed how a Bobo looks in the new Double Dragon.
Yeah, they made him like twice the size.
There's definitely some Ninja Turtle arcade game elements too, like the bad guys flash when they're getting weaker in health and stuff.
I love that the game is self-aware.
It's great.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Is it gonna last past the first few LOLs and all that stuff?
I don't know.
It just depends how into these types of side-scrolling fighting games you are.
If you liked games like Final Fight and all that back in the day, and of course the original Double Dragon, there's something here for you.
You'll enjoy it.
Ninja Turtles arcade game, I'd say it's on par with that.
If you didn't enjoy those games, then it's probably a pass.
Probably won't be as funny to you, but I think it's worth checking out.
Thank you, Game Guru in the chat room.
Contra 4 was a great, great game that they did.
That was one of those, a lot of people missed that.
It was on the DS, but yeah.
Thank you, Game Guru.
I knew our chatters would help us out.
ah Degenerate Johnny in the chat says Double Dragon Neon the ultimate bromance in a way it is the way Double Dragon should be it's great all right uh I guess that's it for my gaming week so now let's get into some housekeeping actually there is a bit of housekeeping tonight um first off the show uh we will not be here live next week
Apologies guys, live listeners.
I'm going out of town so Studio OLR will be closed next Sunday.
There will be a new episode of OLR up so you can do that still next week.
So that will be up.
We're going to tape it earlier in the week and it will replay on Sunday night so you can hear that.
So that's just a special note for our live listeners.
I don't want to discourage you from tuning in, though, because Bobby has a really good interview next week.
And I want to get into that because this is a great media partnership for the network that we're on, the Voice of Geeks Network.
You know, we haven't been around that long, all things considered.
We just launched, what?
The official launch was June.
We did a soft launch in May.
Well, get this.
The VOG Network is an official media partner of the Siege Network.
GameDevelopersConference.com
You're in Florida.
I know we got some listeners in Florida.
If you're in that area and you're interested in developing games, this is a great opportunity for you.
October 5th through 7th in Atlanta.
Bobby Blackwolf will be there representing the Voice of Geeks Network and he's going to be there.
He'll be covering the show on our website, of course, as well as his own show.
He'll be helping out the Georgia Game Developers Association with doing audio and video from the panels and keynote speeches through the weekend.
So that's really cool.
This is the sixth year of the Expo.
Some people that are going to be there.
Dustin Klingman, who's the executive director of the International Game Developers Association, Rob Carroll, who's the director of publishing for Tapjoy, and so on.
Panels on programming, 3D modeling, game audio.
This is not E3.
No new game announcements here.
It's not going to be that type of expo.
But if you're curious about the industry, you want to know more about how to break into it, how are the games really made, what's going on in game development right now, and you're in that neck of the woods, I highly encourage you to go
October 5th through 7th, Atlanta Marriott, Northwest, in Atlanta, Georgia.
Passes are anywhere from $39.95 to $104.95 depending on your current membership with Georgia Game Developers Association or if you're a student or what have you.
You can check out more info at their website.
It is siegecon.net.
Excuse me, S-I-E-G-E-C-O-N.net.
And props to Bobby was obviously, because that's his backyard, a huge part of establishing that partnership.
props to you my friend pushing our network forward one other big announcement I got a lot of stuff tonight for housekeeping and not just plugging the Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio or twitter at twitter.com slash olr though I just did
Last week, we had Aaron on the show, or YYR, and he was pimping his game, Bungie Ferret Tossing, and you might be asking yourself, where the hell is it?
Well, Aaron tweeted earlier, and he says, Monday.
The game will be out tomorrow, so by the time most of you hear the podcast version of this, Bungie Ferret Tossing will be out on Xbox Live Indie Games.
Guys,
let's make this a success this is OLR inspired this is one of our dream games becoming a reality and it's one stinking dollar you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your wallet already so go get this game on Monday Bungie Ferret Tossing we will have links on the Twitters and on the Facebooks and all that good stuff as soon as the game is out and we can link you to it check that out
Alright, now I'm done with housekeeping Yay, we got it, right?
No live next week, but pre-recorded We have Siege and we have BFT on Monday Facebook, Twitter, busy busy Back to the Wii U then, Loki?
Let's talk about some of the stuff we missed
Alright, so a few things about the Wii U. Well, there's a lot of things about the Wii U. But first off, Bayonetta.
Bayonetta 2 is actually going to be an exclusive title for the Wii U that's coming through with a partnership between Platinum and Nintendo.
So they've got that.
One of the things that they're talking about also, game pricing.
Everyone was kind of wondering when the pricing was.
I think I've mentioned this in the past.
It's going to be like the current gen consoles.
$59.99 is going to be the kind of going price for Wii U games, which is kind of a duh.
I mean, it makes sense that it would be that price.
Those pro controllers are going to be going for $49.99.
Also, the different launches.
Of course, we know we're getting it over here in North America on November 18th.
Europe's getting it on November 30th, followed by Japan getting it on December 8th.
This is kind of interesting, too.
Not only does Japan get it on the 8th, but they're also getting their systems without sensor bars.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, it's an interesting choice.
Of course, there is some other stuff.
One of the features that they were kind of pimping out was the Nintendo TV service, TVII.
Gotta stick with the whole naming scheme.
Hate on it all you want.
It's cute and it fits.
The name's fine.
Alright, I'm just saying, it's a little interesting, it's kind of like the same stuff that we're doing on the other consoles, where they've got a bunch of different streaming services bundled together, plus also you can watch live TV, because you can apparently hook it up to...
Well, they haven't shown it yet because no one's allowed to take pictures of the back panel, but the thought is that you're going to be able to hook it up to your cable line.
But it does tie in with TiVo, Netflix, and I believe Amazon streaming services.
and of course you can also set stuff to TiVo if you have your TiVo and apparently they're working with all the different subscribers, Comcast, all the cable and satellite providers
Does this mean that it has the technology where like in your house let's say Loki you want to watch American Idol because I know you're such a Nicki Minaj fan you'll be watching this year.
You're going to watch American Idol on the big TV and then if Nelly doesn't want to watch that she can watch the Oprah Network on the Wii U device.
I don't think it works like that.
Not quite like that?
I don't think it works like that.
Maybe one's got to be Netflix.
Yeah, but see, at this point, everything streams Netflix.
True.
You know, the 3DS streams Netflix.
And because if you're a Nintendo fan, you probably have a 3DS as well.
You know, hell, your Wii streams Netflix.
Your phone streams Netflix.
Your iPod streams Netflix.
Your PC streams... Everything fucking streams Netflix.
We don't need another device to stream Netflix.
Wait, wait, my pants do not yet stream Netflix.
You need better pants.
But it's just, I mean, cool, okay, whatever.
So that's a selling point, whatever, they want to make that.
Of course they announced also that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, also 3DS.
That's coming out next year though, March 31st is the tentative date right now, obviously it's placeholder, but...
Probably March next year.
We know that the Wii U controllers are pretty expensive because they're selling them separately in Japan for some reason.
Even though there's no games that support it, but cool.
If you want to spend extra money, why not?
And...
And yeah, that's nothing about online other than that there's supposed to be some sort of premium service that they're going to give you 10% back on any downloads that you pay for.
I'm really bothered by the lack of online information.
You know what else is weird?
Have they shown, like, this is what the Wii U looks like when you turn it on.
This is the interface.
No, they talked about it.
Did they?
Because I missed that.
It's going to just boot right into that Nintendo, the Mi Plaza Home thing or whatever the hell they're calling it.
Was that the thing with little messages that were showing up?
Yeah.
That looks like it could be interesting.
Interesting.
I don't know, but here's the other thing too that's kind of bothersome is the amount of storage that's on this thing I mean, 8 gigs for the cheap one and 32 for the more expensive one Well, they made the right decision though because Reggie confirmed in an interview that you can just plug in any old drive and it'll work
I understand that, but fuck that.
I get a 250 gigabyte drive or something.
But the thing is, if they're going to be offering games digitally, and they've already said that these games, the disks are going to be up to 25 gigabytes, I'm going to get a third of a download for...
Well, let's be real.
How many games are going to really take up all that space?
If it's like Blu-ray, then if it's a PlayStation 3 type game, a lot of them actually will take up over 20 gigs or at least up to 20 gigs.
If you have a Wii set up to load games to a hard drive that you can plug in the Wii, which is something we've talked about on the show before, so that you can load discs that you own onto the Wii for quick access, whatever, you'd be surprised how small some of those games are.
Well, that's the Wii, though.
Remember, the Wii is last-generation graphics.
Therefore, anything is probably going to fit onto a single-layer DVD.
I mean, they only had a couple dual-layer DVD games, whereas everything is a dual-layer DVD on the Xbox 360 and on the PlayStation 3.
It's, you know, Blu-ray, and obviously those are going to be a lot bigger.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and so on.
Think of how exciting it'll be to spend all that money to buy those controllers.
Whether you did it when you had the Wii or you did it now because you don't own a Wii.
So you have to spend all that money.
Then on top of that, if you want to digitally download stuff, like actually first party games or full console games, you're going to have to spend money to buy a hard drive.
Which hard drives have come down in price, but still it's an added expense.
You still have to do that.
And...
I don't know, it's kind of annoying that they have all these things that they cut out to make the console cheaper.
Stuff that we gave other console manufacturers crap for, like cutting out USB ports.
That's another thing, too.
If I'm going to plug in some sort of USB drive into this thing, or like a...
Hard drive or something.
How many fucking USB ports on this thing?
Like two?
So what happens when, you know, say I got to play another game that requires some other USB peripheral.
Would a hub work?
Well, yeah.
At an expense.
I got to buy a fucking hub now.
They're not that bad.
It doesn't matter, though.
I don't have to buy a fucking hub.
If you bought three USB devices, you can spare the money for a hub or whatever.
I'm just saying, you know, it's an extra expense that they're not talking to, you know, the consumers about or they're not even, they don't even know what their fucking online plan is yet.
Can we, yeah, that concerns me too.
I really, I need to hear from Nintendo that they understand online now.
Like they haven't even said, here is, you know, our online.
Here's what it looks like, you know, requesting, you know, friend requests.
Here's this and that.
All we've seen is just, you know,
Hey, look, you can post stupid messages on a message board about this game.
Ha ha, this level is hard!
Whoa, smiley face!
You know, I mean, that's all I really... Just so you know, Loki, the chatters are correcting you on something, starting with Blackwolf and JVMon following four USB ports, they said.
Two in front, two in back.
Well, cool.
That should do it, then.
but uh still though I don't want to have to buy all these extra things let's take a step back for a minute Alan I'm going to ask your opinion on all this too because you're being too quiet over there but hold on before I get to you uh I want to take a step back Bayonetta 2 because obviously that was the big thing that people walked away from this whole uh you know expo going
Whoa, Bayonetta 2, it's real.
Oh my gosh.
And okay, it's on the Wii U. All right.
In my opinion, that's exactly the type of bullet Nintendo needed in their gun.
You know, pun intended.
That was... But for me, though, it wasn't quite enough.
I'm...
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Nintendo saved it from not existing at all, and I'm glad that's a step in the right direction.
It's just not enough in the right direction to really convince me, like, holy shit, I need one of these day one.
I needed to see F-Zero, Metroid, Zelda, one of those Nintendo properties that's not just another Mario game in the same vein as the three that have already come out recently.
well here's the thing too about Bayonetta too I mean Bayonetta didn't sell very well I mean it's a niche game I mean it didn't sell that great but now you're narrowing it down even more all those fans but it's fucking great I understand it but your devil may cry it's the same game and that game does well
Go ahead.
So for the Bayonetta thing, for the last two years I've been asking, even if it's just in Japan and we don't get it, where's Bayonetta 2?
Because, I mean, Japanese games, they love their sequels, right?
So I'm like, where is it?
Where's Bayonetta 2?
What's Platinum Games working on?
So when I finally said Bayonetta 2 is real, but it's Wii U exclusive...
I'm still kind of disappointed and mad about that, but I'm going to think realistically, will it be ported to at least a 360 or PS3 within two years?
No.
No, it's not?
It's published by Nintendo.
Yeah.
Oh.
Nintendo has it by the balls.
Okay.
Alright, well there's that, but one, I guess I just won't play it then, and two, like what Bobby Blackwolf was saying, if it means Nintendo dropping a big sack of money in Platinum Games Labs, saying give us Bayonetta 2, if that had to happen or else Bayonetta 2 wasn't going to happen at all, then fine, yes, I would rather there be a Bayonetta 2...
Don't swell his ego anymore after tonight's show.
You need to understand something about all these people going, oh my god, Bayonetta 2, the Wii U has it and all that stuff.
Did they announce a fucking release date for it?
Oh, wait, that wasn't there?
Gee, I wonder why.
Because maybe that Platinum Games right now is working on Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
That doesn't come out until February.
So that means they're still going to be fucking working on that game until at least January.
That trailer was literally nothing.
Was it in that 50 game launch window thing?
No.
it's not a launch title it's probably next year sometime you'd be lucky if it's next year holiday I bet you 2014 just like hey Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and everyone's like oh my god Smash Brothers I need to buy a Wii U it's not fucking coming out for years it's it's
It's a lot of the 3DS syndrome, I hate to say.
Pilotwings Resort, not the killer game to launch your system with.
They're teasing shit that's not going to be coming out forever because people are dumb enough to go, I'm buying the system for Bayonetta 2.
Cool, you're buying that system, it's going to be fucking collecting dust until the two years from now that Bayonetta is going to be coming out.
To be fair, Nintendo Land, for what it is, a weeaboo collection of minigames and so forth,
Looks pretty neat.
I'm kind of sold on Nintendo Land, I gotta say.
Cool.
I'll probably enjoy that more than I actually played Wii Sports.
Wii Sports is one of those things that's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, oh, I get it.
I mean, I wish they would have something that would be, you know, oh my god, I have to have this system for it, but they just don't.
And that's my thing.
That's why I'm not getting one.
I'm not saying that, oh, you're wrong for, you know, someone else is wrong for getting it because they have something that they're like, oh, my God, I want to play that.
You know, oh, God, I got to play, you know, Mario Brothers in HD.
Pikmin has a cult following.
That's not my game that I ever really got into, but I could understand where somebody's like, fuck, yeah, Pikmin, I got to get this.
Those games sell like crazy.
It's going to be a success.
Yeah, because people buy anything that says Mario on it, okay?
It could be Mario's Douche Factory and people eat that shit up, okay?
I...
It doesn't matter.
It's just, I'm sure it's going to be a fun game.
But the thing is, for me, it's not that, like, wow.
It's not that, it's the same experience I can get right now, you know, on 3DS or on Wii or something like that.
That's my problem.
You know, and the gimmicky thing of, hey, look, I can use this tablet and I can tap the screen and it makes platforms.
Fuck, you could probably do that if you made some sort of connectivity between the DS version and the Wii version.
You could do the same shit with your stylus on the touchscreen, but no, we're just not gonna do that.
Alan, you never got to finish your thought because Loki, you know, got on his tangent, but...
Yeah, so I'd rather there be a Bayonetta 2 that I'll never play than no Bayonetta 2 at all.
And when Bobby was reading those tweets about, this is the worst thing since the Mass Effect 3 ending, I was like, oh Jesus Christ, go pee your bed.
What?
Really?
This is a thing that people are talking about?
Yeah, whatever.
I really have no fucks to give for the Wii U. I don't care.
We don't play it here.
It's the one system that I don't bought that I didn't have my own copy of when I moved in with you.
I played Wii Fit for like a week.
Once in a while I get into Wii mode.
You have to admit.
Yeah.
Once in a while.
So you're going to pick up We Fit You because We Fit You's got the crappy pedometer with your little me on it.
Oh my God.
And guess what?
If someone's watching TV, you can look like a goddamn fool staring into a little tablet and exercising.
Well, okay, let's... Alan, let's say you had the money, money's not a concern, and so forth.
You still would not buy a Wii U on this principle of there's not really something you want to play on it right now, right?
Correct.
And also, I agree with what Loki was saying.
That 20, 25-second Bayonetta 2 reveal...
Reveal trailer is literally nothing.
So, like, there's... They have not probably even started to work on this game even a little tiny bit yet.
So it's two years off.
If you're interested in a Wii, and you haven't pre-ordered it yet, you're probably not going to fucking get it at launch anyways.
Just chill the fuck out.
Let the whole, like, you know, oh my god, I'm a crack addict.
I need my Nintendo crack, you know, right now.
Just let that, like, kind of calm down.
Get out of your system.
And just give it, like, a year.
And then...
you know a Zelda game will be fucking coming out the system will probably drop in price and there'll be stuff that you'll actually want to play I think the 3DS is going to be an awesome system that is going to have dozens of must-have games for it in another two years the Vita is going to be an awesome system with dozens of must-have games for it in another two years so Wii U is probably going to be the same way
GameGuru brings this comment to chat that has the facts I was looking for in arguing with Loki earlier.
Thank you, GameGuru.
New Super Mario Bros.
U sold 25... I think he meant to say New Super Mario Bros.
New Super Mario Bros.
sold 25 million copies.
It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.
25 million copies as a franchise or as a title?
Because I don't think that's as a title.
And it was a packing game.
Semantics.
It doesn't matter.
It's a huge game.
The point still stands.
It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.
or they could have made a new Mario game.
Why settle for just the same franchise that you've already been pimping for a while?
Yeah, those numbers look nice if you're talking franchise because you've only... How many new Super Mario Bros.
games have you released?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I can't wait to buy Legend of Zelda.
The new one?
No, all of them.
Again and again.
But now let's go back to the real world for a minute here, Alan, because you're not living by yourself anymore.
You're in a committed relationship with an individual who tends to be a bit of a consumer whore.
So there probably will be a Wii U in the house within the next year.
How does that make you feel?
I don't care about the Wii U. You won't even touch it?
You won't look at it?
Well, it's hooked up.
I'll play it, but I mean... Well, it's there.
I'll have my hour where I go, oh, okay, it's the controller.
All right, then boom, never again.
Alright, fair enough.
Technis in chat wondering, so I wonder what will come out first, Bayonetta 2 or The Wonderful 101?
Live.VogNetwork.com.
Clearly The Wonderful 101.
Yeah, Wonderful 101 because that's the launch window title and Bayonetta is not even fucking being worked on yet.
You know what though?
Again, I want to say props to Nintendo for the Bayonetta 2 thing.
Now give me like three more of those on that level and we're sitting really, really, really good.
Platinum tends to release about one game a year, I think.
They don't have to be Platinum games.
I'm talking about other exclusive things would be great.
No, I'm talking about Platinum games as the company being released.
One title they work on about once a year, I think.
I think Platinum games did Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns in the US.
Even though that's not out yet.
Then, of course, they've got, you know, next year, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
So, probably 2014.
Alright, let's move on with some more Nintendo news.
This is a story on the Nintendo Network.
We've kind of touched on this, so I'll make this quick.
If you shell out the money for the higher-end Wii U, you're going to get not just some more gigabytes, you will get access to Nintendo Network Premium.
Nintendo Network is the online service.
It's going to be free, but apparently Nintendo said at one point, well, maybe it won't always be free, we just don't know yet.
There's a lot we're still figuring out.
We haven't figured out the whole network thing.
So it looks like what we have now...
Nintendo Network Premium
Super Mario Bros.
2 Gold Mania 3DS
is this like a yearly subscription thing or is this just I buy the fancy system you buy the fancy system and you get it now the other thing from the Japanese conference only offered till December 2014
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Will I be able to get it in this, like, two-year window?
Yeah, I don't know.
Again, there's a lot of question mark here that I'm not, you know, and that's the problem is that after that press conference, there should not have been this many question marks.
That's life expectancy of the console.
It's a two-year console cycle.
Stop.
And they'll have the Wii U U.
Well, I get if it's only free until December 2014, but then what?
What do the non-deluxe people get?
Is that all it is?
Is it a discount program?
Are we still on friend codes?
Do we have Nintendo gamer tags now?
What's going on?
Hello?
Hello?
I guess I'm not supposed to ask those questions.
I'm supposed to say, ooh, Bayonetta, pretty.
Moving on.
Let's do more Nintendo news.
Yes.
So websites that are offering pre-orders for the Wii U system, either of the bundles, are marking themselves as being sold out.
So the assumption that could be made is that this thing is selling like crazy, at least in the pre-order cycle.
It looks like Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Target are sold out online of both versions.
Sears and Kmart are only listing the Deluxe as sold out with the cheaper SKU not there at all.
Again, GameStop online can't pre-order it.
Doesn't really mention Amazon in this article that I'm referencing.
Well, there's another issue going on there, but I'll come back to that.
So we already kind of talked about this a little bit where Matt was saying, well, we don't know how much...
Like Nintendo dictates to them what numbers there are before they have to consider themselves sold out.
But it looks like Walmart, grown, who's also making things more difficult because Walmart does their own bundle within the bundle.
Walmart Online is offering their Walmart Solution Bundle, which are even more expensive.
The basic one with the shit that they are bundling in is $400, and then $450 for the deluxe.
We use SKU plus whatever bullshit they're...
and so if you want to get in on the Wii U pre-order, Walmart, I guess, is a good place to start.
So I guess Nintendo's not looking to have these long lines and stuff this time because if Target and Walmart both did pre-orders and that's where all the lines were showing up before.
I'm telling you, if they sold out in one day, it's...
There's no way.
There's no stories about people lining up at the fucking store to make pre-orders.
There's no way that there's a large amount of systems being pre-ordered.
Even if everybody fucking rushed down and bum-rushed GameStop, there's no way that they have a lot.
But they're doing it, though, so that it makes a good headline.
The system's selling out.
Look how fast it sold out.
Yeah, if I offered one for sale, it would sell out instantly.
On a website where you can't see how many they have.
I mean, fuck, look at the iPhone 5.
Is that shit selling out?
And I'm sure they're going to sell millions of those.
I just have a hard time believing that there's going to be a lot being sold.
They used to carry the 3DS
Yeah, but exactly.
I bought a 3DS game from them not that long ago.
They used to carry the 3DS.
The 3DS, they had a problem with people reporting broken hinges.
And so they got returned to them.
And the thought is that they tried returning those to Nintendo.
Nintendo said, fuck you, you're stuck with them.
And so they're like, fuck you, we're not carrying your hardware.
Which is fine.
You know, to be honest, they don't need that shit.
Because you know why?
The hardware, there's no markup on the hardware.
They're making nothing off that.
So there's no reason for them to carry it.
But Amazon, that's not the type of company Amazon is.
Amazon will slit throats to get you to go to their site and buy this shit on their site.
I understand that, but if it's come down to where, you know, hey, we're losing hundreds of dollars on this thing.
Amazon lost their biggest competitive advantage yesterday.
Amazon is now in a whole new world as of yesterday.
Guess what changed at Amazon.com yesterday?
Started charging tax.
That's right.
Sales tax.
Sales tax in the state of California.
and I think a few others too.
I don't think it's just California.
Because when you file for your state taxes every April in California, it says, did you order something online from out of state?
Because please enter the amount here so that we can factor in sales tax.
Everyone goes next.
Fuck no.
I'm sure everybody has always been 100% honest and saved their receipts.
They've got a shoebox of receipts and Amazon invoices.
Yeah, but now it doesn't matter if you're in California.
I don't know.
You tell me if I've ordered something.
Oh, you don't know?
Well, then I didn't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Outro Music
What's this that Bobby's linking me to?
He's linking to an actual, it looks like a 3DS Cosmo Black.
Ah, here's the trick though.
It says 17 left in stock sold by Emacs and fulfilled by Amazon.
So technically that's not Amazon.
That's one of their little mini sub stores that's doing it.
So yes, you can get, okay, if you want to get me on a technicality, you can get the 3DS on Amazon, but it's not going to come from Amazon.
No, it's going to come from a third party.
Yeah.
So, very interesting.
I still am surprised that Amazon, you know, despite all that madness, would, you know, it's nothing that the other companies aren't having to put up with.
Don't take the returns then.
Well, I think it became a problem where, you know, customers were complaining that, you know, it's a defective system and they were just returning them in mass or something.
I don't know.
But I would assume that would be the only reason why they wouldn't carry it.
Hmm.
So let's talk a little bit something different than Nintendo for a while.
is huge gaming news, like it or not.
They come out and say it's a huge gaming handheld.
I think even more so than the iPhone 5.
I think we all need to not forget, because if you don't even want it for the phone or whatever, there is still the iPod Touch.
is that what they call the the ones that are the phones without the phone they announced that too that is basically an iPhone 5 and all those games and all that stuff so despite however you feel about Apple that is a huge you know the Angry Birds of the world is all going to be over there and stuff so that's pretty big gaming news I just wanted to get that out there because those were two big big big gaming stories this week
Cool, real racing's on it.
Fantastic.
Well, the fact that it's a new resolution is a little bit strange, too.
Why are they still talking iPad Mini?
There's no reason for an iPad Mini.
An iPad Mini is an iPod Touch.
Why do we still have all these crazy rumors about the iPad Mini?
I don't get it.
because 7-inch tablets are popular.
Just get the iPad.
You won't be disappointed.
It's pretty.
And it has Netflix.
Everything fucking has Netflix, okay?
Everything.
Seriously.
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, guitar.
and of course, you know, they're saying, you know, today we respond to EA's claims which we believe have no merit.
We also filed a counterclaim which addresses actions by EA believed to be anti-competitive and unlawful business practices including legal threats, demands for no higher agreements.
We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts on delighting our players and then to which I add with our clone games.
Um, but seriously, that's the whole thing.
There's like basically saying, oh yeah, no, we're not copying the SimSocial, no.
I'm sorry, they are.
It's, I mean, come on.
Anybody that probably listens to this show that's seen the evidence of them copying many other games, we know better.
I mean, who are they trying to fool?
Obviously the court, but...
I mean, this is also one of those things where it's like a duh.
Zynga's not going to take this long.
Well, you caught us there.
Yeah, we did.
You're IDA.
Yeah, we were ripping off all your games.
Here you go.
Here's the billion dollars you were asking for.
So this is not a surprise, right?
Yeah.
Not at all.
Come on.
And so...
I don't know, I mean, of course, you know, they're... Breakman in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Zynga considers copying other people's games to be a completely legal process.
I didn't mean to cut you off, but you sounded like you were trailing off with that thought there.
No, no, no, they're basically saying, here's their whole reason.
It's okay to do what we're doing, basically.
Certain modes of expression are customary and necessary to express a genre, such as sitting on a couch, watching TV, taking a shower, and going to sleep in a bed.
Such modes of expression are known as scenes affair, are not protectable.
Allowing one company to own them would thwart competition, innovation, and creativity Employing scenes off air, functional elements is not a copyright infringement It is how a genre is expressed So what they're saying is, our game looks slightly different But just because a Sim or a Ville person sits down to take a crap Doesn't mean that it's the same thing
Except, once again, they're not just copying the fact that this person can take a nap or this person cooks on a stove or something like that.
They're copying the character editor or the art style or the menus or the palette for your skin tones.
You know, that kind of stuff.
Okay.
Alright, let's move on to other legal news.
This one's a tricky issue.
Oh boy, this is, wow.
Okay, so who owns the word gamer?
G-A-Y-M-E-R, a word that describes a gay gamer.
It's kind of a name that the community's taken up a little bit here.
You might have heard of GamerCon was a big thing that we were talking about before on the show because I talked about that that's the only Kickstarter I've ever backed.
Well, you may or may not have heard of a site, Gamer.org, G-A-Y-M-E-R.org.
And back in 2007, the owner, Chris Vizzini, I hope I'm saying that right, announced that he was going to trademark the term gamer.
I seem to remember reporting on this back then, because this show's been around a while.
And I seem to remember reporting on this back then, saying, I'm not a big fan of this.
You know, the fact that he's trying to trademark this word, and I don't think anybody did.
Well, I think the part we missed...
He got the trademark.
The United States gave him the trademark on the word gamer for his website, gamer.org.
So the trademark applies to online communities hosting and maintaining an online website for others to discuss, receive, and disseminate information concerning video games.
So he owns the trademark on that when it comes to online communities.
Well, this past week, a cease and desist letter from Chris Vizzini was sent to Reddit.
Reddit.
Talk about a David vs. Goliath scenario.
The gamers community on Reddit is something like 17,000 some odd people.
Gamer.org
Not really a big website.
It was a good concept, but GayGamer.net kind of came around and did it better.
I don't mean any disrespect to Gamer.org because, you know, look at Orange Lounge Radio.
Shit, we've been around 10 years and we still haven't made it big, quote unquote.
So, you know, I can kind of sympathize in that sort of regard.
But I'm not so sure I would have picked my battle with Reddit either.
You know, like... Redditors are crazy!
We mean that in the nicest possible way.
But like, to quote a famous gif of Whoopi Goldberg, you in danger, girl.
So and Gamer.org ended up being shut down just like not even a day later with after this whole stuff.
So here's the situation.
He responded and so forth.
Here's his response.
I informed the mod team of our gamers that we'd received a cease and desist for the infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed – I'm sorry.
Is this – I'm sorry.
I am reading –
Scratch that.
My bad.
I am reading what the admin on Reddit said.
As I'm reading it here, it doesn't make sense.
Okay.
Sorry.
How embarrassing.
I informed the mod team of our gamers that we received a cease and desist letter for infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed us that the letter presents a real threat that they would sue Reddit.
I let them know so that they could start planning how to respond, including seeing if there's any way for them to work things out with the owner of the trademark.
Now the response from gamer.org.
He sent the cease and desist because as a trademark holder, you have to defend your trademark or you will risk losing it.
He's emailed Reddit twice before and no response.
I started Gamer.org in 2003 and began to build Gamer as a brand That's why I trademarked and wordmarked the name At that time there was only one other site around dedicated to gay gamers I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars on Gamer.org I have done so gladly as it's brought happiness to many people He is not pursuing GamerCon because his trademark is only about online communities
I would think though, GamerCon, if they're going to be as big as Fanime or PAX or any other big convention, will probably have an online forum at some point.
So I would still be a little worried if I was on the planning board at GamerCon about the impact this could have.
Now,
you might be curious about my thoughts as a gay gamer and my thoughts is I don't necessarily fault Chris in this circumstance because he does have to defend his trademark he should have never been given that trademark in the first place that's the problem why did they give him that?
he should have every right to gamer.org but the word gamer that's a really broad thing to have
and especially this far, I mean, there was a dude on the tester whose name was Gamer, his little online thing.
That didn't ruffle any feathers, I guess, because again, Gamer doesn't have his own online community.
But as many of the folks on Reddit and all around the internet were quick to point out, that word Gamer has existed dating back to Yahoo groups and all this stuff before that.
I mean, it's just kind of a little...
Play on word that makes a lot of sense.
Why was he given the trademark in the first place?
Because the patent offices don't know better.
Because he filed first.
Probably no one thought about trademarking it, so he did.
What he could have done if he's just defending it because, oh, I need to and otherwise I will lose my trademark, whatever it is, he could license it to him for free.
Okay, yes, you may use this as your forum thing or whatever, but I have the rights to, it is a trademark of blah, blah, blah.
That'd be the nice thing to do, I guess.
Ranma in chat says, Sky, a treaty alliance between both organizations.
I wish.
That would be the nice thing to see here.
You know, in a minority of a minority community, is this what we really need to have happening right now?
This sucks.
Like, especially when things are kind of gaining steam with the convention and all this right now, this is a real shot in the foot.
This is a terrible time for something like this to happen.
I get that Gamer.org feels the need to defend their trademark, and the thousands of dollars they've invested.
Shit, we've invested thousands of dollars in this program and the community we've built and all that stuff, but I just kind of think at a certain point, you have to let it go.
And you kind of have to just admit...
DarkSakura.com
or the Reddit.
He looks like he was updating it back in August and July and then kind of took off because to get his site back, he had to do a rollback of a month.
So a lot of the stuff that was up there was disappeared because there was something up there on the OUYA.
I managed to see it before it went down and there was something on there about the OUYA and some of the other stuff.
That makes sense.
But there's the forums.
Again, I mean no disrespect to that community because we have a small community and
shit Loki named the Wii U release date in July and I bet you nobody knows that but I don't know but then of course you come around and say well if somebody tried to start a community called Orange Lounge Video would you have a problem with that and there's a part of me that's kind of like yes and no if you're just trying to piggyback on our success yes I'd have a problem with that but at the same time Orange Lounge Radio wasn't exactly our name 100% either and we've always admitted that
We were inspired to name ourselves after something we were all fans of, the way a Beatles tribute band might call them Yellow Submarine or something like that.
It's very kind of akin to that.
But if Orange Lounge had this common meeting, like if Orange Lounge was suddenly the term that everybody called their video game room or something, I think there'd have to be a point where you just kind of let it go.
I don't know.
I...
Loki, you're on the outside looking in.
You probably have no reason to go to a gamer Reddit or gamer.org.
What do you think of all this kind of back and forth debacle?
That's typical trademark copyright garbage.
Someone trademarks.
If we're going to totally make it non-sexually oriented at all, look at the guy that tried to trademark Mame a while back.
A great comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room about this is the USPTO, the same place that gave Langdell his trademark over Edge.
Remember that?
And then there's not just Edge, but then there is the... What is the other one?
The one that hit against Elder Scrolls.
Was it Scrolls?
Yeah, it's the Mojang game.
It's called Scrolls, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, so there's that whole debacle too.
Like, holy hell do we need this stuff re-examined.
I mean, we're in this technological age where the laws from the 1700s and 1800s don't work anymore.
Again, I really feel like he should have never been given the trademark in the first place.
Stop.
I mean, I can feel for the guy because it's like, oh, you were given this great thing and now the internet's trying to take it away.
But it's like, you shouldn't have had that.
You should have gotten gamer.org.
That's all yours, buddy.
You get that.
Let me put it this way.
Gamer probably to someone that's not familiar with anything on the internet, people that work at the patent office.
and probably, you know, hey, that's a unique thing.
You know, we'll go ahead and give it to that guy.
I mean, they don't do any research, but that's the problem, though, is they'll just give it to whomever.
And, you know, yeah, it kind of sucks for everybody else, but I don't really know where, you know, something becomes so commonly used that they can't trademark it anymore or something.
I don't know.
I don't really know how that works.
Well, as somebody who's supporting GamerCon and would think that logically that's going to have a community at some point, and just like a gamer myself, I kind of think this guy needs to let it go.
I understand he wants to defend what he's invested his hard earned money in, but there's a way for everybody to win in this scenario.
If he wanted more visibility for his site, why not work with Reddit?
it's a pretty powerful if you want to get yourself promoted you want to get the word around the internet reddit's a pretty fucking great place to go for that type of stuff you know there it seems like they could he could have got more for his site working with reddit than he's getting working against them and that goes for any large large large online community
And I hate seeing these factions fight.
It sucks.
Alright, moving on.
I need some happier news or something.
Can you deliver, Alan?
Not really happy news, but some sassy news.
Okay, I'll take sassy.
So this is probably one of the most ludicrous stories that I've reported on whenever I've guest-hosted on this show.
Electronic arts usually, I won't say butted heads, but they've had snippy things to say about Valve and Steam in the past, where I guess that one EA guy was saying that...
when Steam discounts games as much as it does and has those crazy 99 cent sales and stuff that it sort of devalues PC games and this that and the other even though indie developers have come out and said that putting their game on Steam versus Xbox Live was one of the best things they ever did blah blah blah the Origin client for which became a mandatory thing for Mass Effect 3 is fucking terrible and EA and Origin doesn't have the sales that Steam does and blah blah blah so EA is always trying to be up Valve's ass and
I guess EA on two different occasions have tried to enter talks with Valve to purchase the company.
Going upwards of some of the preliminary talks they did offered up to a billion dollars if Valve was going to take the offer seriously.
That's how much they were willing to front to start the conversation.
And Gabe Newell is like, no, that's not going to happen.
Quote,
Co-owner and company founder Gabe Newell, however, said that the likelihood of his fiercely independent company selling to an electronic arts or one of the other major multinational publishers like Activision or Ubisoft is about as likely as Nintendo selling off the Mario brand.
Newell said that Valve would sooner disintegrate than sell out to a major publisher.
It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say, let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to have our employment agreements terminate.
So, yeah, EA, I guess, has tried to buy Valve.
And it sounds ridiculous.
One of the dumbest things I've ever heard.
And we don't even know what Valve is doing with the fact that they're... The story that we covered last week where Valve's looking for industrial engineers for this maybe...
PC box that's going to run Steam maybe on television sets.
That's what people are speculating on.
So we don't know what Valve is up to, but obviously they're not in a position to be bought by anyone.
And they have more money than God because Steam is like... Steam has how many?
Steam already commands a membership of 54 billion active users and growing.
So they're not in want for money.
For EA to buy them.
I would say it's surprising that EA's tried to buy Valve.
I don't think that's surprising.
It gives me warm fuzzies to know that Gabe Newell basically laughed in their face.
That gives me warm fuzzies.
Especially after that PopCap story from last week.
Yeah, from a business standpoint, if you're a company as big as EA, hey, they make good shit.
Let's say, hey, hey, you guys for sale?
That's legit.
EA can ask that of whoever they want.
But Gabe Newell is like, no.
That's what's funny.
I love this comment from MM2K in our chat room.
Thank God the people at Valve own Valve.
EA buying it would be the coming of Satan.
That's not a dramatic statement.
Would EA bring Half-Life 3 out faster?
Because I don't know.
No, you didn't.
Oh, no, you didn't.
And Zynga buying it would be ultra Satan.
I want somebody to buy Valve and legitimize them.
Is that possible?
EA should buy Zynga.
What better way to settle this whole thing?
That would be funny.
It would be hilarious.
Anyhow, that would happen.
Activision buys Zynga and then rolls it in with Blizzard and the sky turns black.
Oh, can you imagine how terrible World of Warcraft would be?
Possibly.
It already got worse when Activision bought them.
But anyway, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, VOG, however, would not say F you to EA.
EA, bring your money trucks to my house, please.
Wait a minute, Bobby.
It's not a gaming station.
EA doesn't have interest in the... Gaming is one part of nerddom.
That's fine.
They can roll those money trucks up.
I'll be able to sell my gaming part of it.
That's true.
I think all of us are sitting here going, yeah, we'd sell out.
Money?
Sure.
All right.
Let's move on.
Travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you in a country near you.
Loki, start us off.
There's some decent stuff coming out this week.
Of course, we've got Borderlands 2 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.
The Kirby's Dream Collector's Special Edition, that's way too many adjectives for that, that's coming out on the Wii this week.
NCIS 3D on the 3DS.
Hotel Transylvania on the DS and 3DS Collectors Editions for Borderlands 2 Deluxe Vault Hunter Collectors Edition and the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition that's coming out as well
Ultimate Loot Chest Edition.
I almost got that.
The chest on that thing is huge.
Although the collector's edition for Black Ops 2 looks pretty sweet.
And it has a bigger chest.
It's all about the bigger chest.
Formula One 2012 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
The Street Fighter 25th Anniversary Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3.
and Kinect Sports Ultimate Collection.
It's a re-release of Kinect Sports 1 and 2 on one disc.
It's coming out on 360.
Harley Pasternak's Hollywood Workout on Xbox 360 and the Wii.
And this week we get our Kinect TV games, Kinect Sesame Street TV and Kinect National Geo or Nat Geo TV on 360 as well.
When's Surface coming?
Do we know yet?
I'm sorry.
What the hell was that thing called they showed at E3?
The Surface?
No, the name of the... Is it called Surface?
The thing that'll let my iPad be a touch controller for me.
Oh, Smart Glass.
Thank you, Smart Glass.
That's in the fall update, I think.
Surface is the Microsoft touch.
We still don't know when that's coming either.
Surface is the tablet.
I thought it's in Vegas for slot machines or in Digital Blackjack and that's it.
That's all it is.
We had a great... I will say, when we went to PAX 08 or whatever, we had a great bonding time with Bobby sitting around one of those... Was somebody else with us too?
Maybe for a little bit.
I want to say one of the gals from the Bay Area that's also podcasting was there with us.
But we were having some bonding time around Microsoft Surface.
It was good times.
Good times.
All right, let's move on.
Let's take a look at release dates in Japan, starting with the Xbox 360.
Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, hey!
It's new for Japan coming out of there.
I'm assuming this is some type of localized version.
There is also Majiten, Majiditenshei Suksei Mita in limited and regular edition is coming out this week.
I'm not sure exactly what this is, but based on some of the screenshots...
Yeah!
It's naked anime chicks!
Look at that boobie!
Oh, excuse me, not boobie.
Look at that booty!
Yeah, naked anime girls, but their faces look like they're 12.
That is how the Xbox... Ew!
That's how the Xbox 360's gonna sell in Japan.
That's how you sell a Wii U. That's...
That's how you steal a Wii U right there.
The little LCD controller is x-ray, so the TV, she's got her top on it, but then you lift the controller and it's... That's how you do it.
Nelly's watching American Idol on the TV.
You're watching porn on the Wii U tablet.
They had, and I don't remember what the hell the game was called.
They had a game that came out in the UK.
It was on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
and it was like one of those not like a Leisure Suit Larry or like a Playboy the Mansion game but there was something like that where you're picking up women and you have to do weird things you know to get in their favor but one of the mini games had to do with manipulating their nipples and what were the nipples but the two analog sticks wow it was great awesome
All right, PlayStation 3, big releases this week.
We have Daikokai Jidai Online Second Age.
I don't know what game this translates to, but there's a regular and limited edition.
It looks like some type of online game.
I'm getting a vibe similar to like a Final Fantasy XI-esque or a White Knight Chronicles almost even, this kind of looks like to me.
Akatsuki no Gai Trinity Eureka 7 AO Jungfrau no Hanabana Tachi Video Game and Hybrid Anime Disc
F1 2011, Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning, Shin Sangoku Musou 6 Empires, that's Dynasty Warrior if I'm not mistaking, and a new wireless headset from Sony is all coming out this week.
Big week in Japan there on the PlayStation 3.
Yeah, they do have a new wireless headset.
I'm not really sure what it is though.
I just saw it the other day in their system.
Why not?
Quickly looking at the handhelds, checking out the Vita.
Oh, Little Big Planet.
That's kind of a big release.
That's out in Japan this week.
Little Big Planet.
And did you say that's coming out here too?
we'll be playing it in a couple weeks damn, I really want to play that lastly on the 3DS, nothing this week, strangely, everything's next week for the 3DS, nothing this week let's travel to the UK Alan, are you able to fill in for Jamie tonight?
Yes, over in the UK, starting on September 18th, Connect Nat Geo TV and Connect Sesame Street TV.
On the 19th of September, LittleBigPlanet on the Vita.
20th of September, Rayman Jungle Run on the Android and iPad.
Torchlight 2 for PC September 21st F1 2012 for PS3 PC and 360 I think this title is being listed twice one in English one in Japanese but One Piece Kaizoku Musou and also One Piece Pirate Warriors that has the same box art I'm assuming it's the same game Borderlands 2 on September 21st and then that's it for that week
Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom this is why I love having chatters live.vognetwork.com they set us straight when we're wrong Alpha Kanatagram says LittleBigPlanet Vita came out two days ago Sony said fuck it and released it early I'm playing it now the box version is not although now I have to charge my Vita
I know, I'm all about LittleBigPlanet on the Vita, I'm excited about that I was just a target today, if I'd seen that I would have snatched it up It's not been released box, maybe digitally I think somebody broke street date, I think GameStop broke street date I seem to remember now, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine that said GameStop broke street date Oh, I'm not surprised, they do that shit all the time Oh, but if anyone else breaks street date, all hell's gonna break loose Ooh, somebody's bitter over there
Well, no, seriously, they're the big proponents of not having street dates in the first place because they have a competitive advantage over everybody else.
Alpha Cananogram says, I have the box version.
It's out.
Black Wolf says, it's only on sale at the Evil G. Black Wolf said, Sony told Evil G to break street dates.
Weird.
Fuckers!
It's not supposed to be out for a couple weeks, but okay.
Cool.
That'll make for an interesting conversation.
I'm waiting two weeks.
I'm not going to you-know-where just to get LittleBigPlanet.
I'm excited about LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not that excited.
Too bad, Sony, because a great way to get my attention would have been to do that before Mr. Pandaria's out.
Because if you're going to try and get my attention after Mr. Pandaria's out, yeah, good luck.
Who am I kidding?
I'll still get LittleBigPlanet.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
of military installations on the island of Lemnos, Greece.
And of course they were caught and they had the footage and stuff and apparently it's illegal, I'm surprised, legal to take video and photographs of military installations.
So...
Yeah, that's not good.
And, of course, you know, Bohemia Interactive, you know, they've confirmed it, yes.
You know, they were arrested during their holiday trip, and it says they visited the island with the sole purpose of experiencing the island's beautiful surroundings.
And...
Yeah, I don't know.
That kind of sucks.
But, I mean, it's against the law to take pictures of that stuff, so maybe you shouldn't.
That's crazy.
Maybe, you know, the Greek military would not like you putting their military installation in your game.
I'm just saying.
Might not be a good thing.
Might not be a good thing.
Might not be good.
Wow, that's crazy.
All right.
Can I tell a true story that's completely random once?
I went to Canada in 2006 with my good friend John at the time.
He was my roommate when we had the studio in the garage, so I can't remember if he ever popped on OLR or not.
He played Final Fantasy, and that's about it.
We went to Canada together and he's a big picture taker.
Takes pictures of everything.
He'll take pictures of food at the dinner table, take pictures of signs, whatever.
He'll take pictures of everything.
So we're in the little line waiting at the airport because the plane lands, you have to go through customs first before you get to technically enter the country, right?
He's taking pictures in customs.
Which, okay, he's being a dumb tourist, whatever.
So we get up to the front and the lady behind the thing is all, it's this one.
And the security guard comes up and is like, what kind of pictures are you taking?
And he's like scared shitless.
And so he's like showing the guy on the camera the pictures he's taken.
And like the lady behind the counter is like, why are you shaking?
Why are you nervous?
And we're like, fucking Canada's hardcore.
Yeah.
But keep in mind, this was only five years after a major event that changed the way we travel in many ways.
So he was just like, honestly, he didn't know better.
But yeah, they don't fuck around with picture taking and stuff like that.
Even though he was just taking pictures of the Canadian and the US flags together and the signs.
Nothing you or I would think is bad, but they don't know that.
And apparently there's some top secret shit in there.
They don't want people knowing how the system works or whatever.
The true origin of maple syrup.
It's people!
It's people!
Alright, let's go to a much simpler time.
When all you needed to get to Canada was a birth certificate, not a passport.
It's a segment we call the classic game of the week.
Every week, DarkSakura likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey, you kids ought to be playing this game this week.
But she's not here.
Oh!
So we get to tap into my brain instead tonight.
Sometimes Alan will do this, sometimes Loki will do this.
Tonight I'm doing it.
So, tonight's classic game of the week is a real old, old game.
Tonight's classic game of the week is Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.
That's right.
Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns was on a lot of systems back in the 80s.
It dates all the way back to the Atari 2600, actually.
It was the original releases on the Atari 2600 from 1984.
I remember this game fondly from the Commodore 64 games.
It was on a lot of different systems.
The 5200, the ColecoVision, the MSX, the ZX Spectrum, the PC Booter.
Apple II.
It was on a lot of different systems.
The reason why I picked Pitfall 2 over Pitfall 1 is that personally I have a lot more fond memories playing this one.
And I think this really lends itself to a lot of the games that we have today.
Pitfall 2 was about exploring the cavern, whereas Pitfall 1 was really just kind of like a very linear... Remember Pitfall 1 was just kind of like you didn't...
You could go down in the cave and skip screens, but it was very linear.
Pitfall 2 really fleshed out that feeling of like, I can go down here and then I can backtrack and go back here and get the item I got here to go get the rat over here.
And it was one of the first games on the Atari 2600 to have background music, a similar piece to the one you're hearing right now from the Commodore 64 version.
Pitfall 2 was similar to Pitfall 1, but obviously Lost Caverns had a lot of different features.
Pitfall Harry had unlimited time and lives.
The original game was limited to, I think, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
So you could never lose the game.
You never could actually die.
Whenever you would get hit, you will just flash back and the sad little music plays.
Pitfall 2 has 27 Horizontal Levels
They're all about the same height, but sometimes there's balloons that will let you go up to new areas.
There are no snakes or crocodiles like there were in Pitfall 1, but there are scorpions, there are bats, there's condors, electric eels in the water and frogs.
There was also not just Pitfall Harry, but there was his little friends, the Mountain Lion, which was Quick Claw, and there was Ronda.
And that was the object of the game.
You were trying to save Ronda, Quick Claw, and I believe find a diamond ring was like all that stuff.
All those characters ended up appearing on the Saturday Supercade children's cartoon that's based on Pitfall.
Ronda and Quick Claw were actually created for that before this game was released about a year sooner.
The maximum possible score in the game, 199,000 points.
That is different from the Atari 8-bit and 52 version that I'll get into in a minute.
You can actually see Quick Claw, one of the goals of the game, you see him right under you when you start the game.
So that's kind of cool that like, that's probably the last thing you'll collect as you're doing the game, is that you kind of end up where you started.
It's kind of a neat little, you know, especially for game design back in the day, it was kind of neat that you ended up where you started there.
of course the soundtrack as well that would change keys and stuff depending on how well you're doing what you're hearing in the background right now is kind of like the heroic theme whenever you collect a treasure you'll hear a ding and it starts over if you die there's a slower theme that plays
So this was a huge game on the Atari 2600.
It was really pushing the envelope.
The hardware was six years old when this game came out, but Pitfall 2 brought scrolling, detailed animation, and of course the musical score.
David Crane actually designed and patented a display processor chip which would enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and could process the music in three channels plus drums.
They were hoping that this would push the limits of the Atari 2600, but considering this came out in 84, what else happened around that same time?
The video game crash.
So this kind of came out when the party was already over.
Now there's another version of the game that's really cool.
It's the Adventurers Edition.
This is only available on the 5200 and the Atari 8-bit versions.
Huh.
Well, they came out and said, they being the marketing, they said, no, the two versions are not allowed to be different.
Because you may think things are bad now where you have the same game on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.
But back in the day, dude, it was Apple, Commodore, Coleco, Atari, Intellivision.
Like, you can go find ads from old gaming magazines that would show you screenshots from ten different versions of the game.
Yeah, there were...
Usually anywhere between six to eight valid platforms.
Really small niche ones during that time.
Early 80s.
Absolutely.
So marketing said, no, you can't have different sections of the game.
So what happened?
Well, Brad Freger, who is the producer...
They left it in and made it an Easter egg.
So they just kind of hid it away in the game, but you can get it.
So the new level will have way more challenging stuff.
There's new creatures, rabbit bats that fly more erratically.
They also will reverse direction.
There's also frogs that go all the way across the screen.
Fire ants and piranha fish.
We're fast creatures as well.
Yeah, all this stuff was new.
And then you have to collect different items as well.
You would get a rope, a pot, a trumpet, and a snake charmer.
And what happens is that you get all the way to the last guy and it would scroll across the bottom of the screen.
Charming the golden rope is Pitfall Harry's only hope.
So it brings the game full circle because if you have the rope, the pot, the trumpet, the snake charmer...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There is also, and I'll leave it at this, there was an arcade version.
Sega made an arcade version in 1985.
It was very different.
It looked very cartoonish.
It looked very Alex Kidd to me.
But it had definitely some elements.
It had some of the similar music.
In fact, do we have... I think I should have here ready... Yes.
Here's the Sega version.
And you can hear it's a little bit similar here.
If we actually fast forward...
So it's kind of like similar, but the game design is very different.
It's split up into four stages.
There is a timer because it was an arcade game.
And, you know, there is kind of a definitive beginning and end that doesn't have to do with collecting the same things you did.
So it was kind of like they took the name and the idea and made this completely different type of game out of it.
But it's worth checking out.
That's, of course, the Sega version of Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns that was out in the arcade.
One other port...
Super Pitfall on the NES
The week it was released because I was such a fan of Pitfall 2 Super Pitfall is absolute fucking garbage It is one of the worst games they ever released on the NES It is buggy as shit There's flickering Go look at some of the long plays that are on YouTube People walking through walls and shit Like Waters...
water caverns that just suddenly end and you can fall down a waterfall to like a whole new level things like that like it just doesn't fucking make sense like it's one of the seriously it is like somebody pooed in a cartridge and put it out it is one of the worst NES games they ever made and when you're that young or at least in my experience it takes because we're not obviously we weren't as discriminating back then to realize oh no I was I played it and I was like this is fucking garbage
Even as a 10-year-old, I was like, what the shit?
It took like a day or two, though, right?
Or no?
No!
Like, even the first time I played it, I was like, that doesn't even look like Pitfall Harry.
Who's this blue munchkin with the mustache?
Fuck this guy in the hard hat.
It was terrible.
Ugh.
Breakman in chat backing me up.
Sky is a million percent correct.
Super Pitfall is one of the worst games ever made.
It is such garbage.
I would love for some month on the show to have Jamie change this segment and do the unclassic game of the week.
And I'll tell you, Super Pitfall is one of the worst games that ought to be featured.
Anyhow, let's not focus on the bad.
Let's go back to the good.
If you're going to play an Atari 2600 game at some point in your life, because maybe you weren't born yet when the Atari 2600 was kind of a big deal, go play Pitfall 2.
It was a great game that really pushed the envelope for the technology of the Atari 2600.
All right.
Let's move on and take a break.
We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more show to come, which is great because Part A was two hours.
So we're going to come back with some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, as well as more news stories, including a really interesting Microsoft patent we've got to talk about when we come back.
Your emails, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics, and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 473rd episode for this September the 16th of 2012.
Kind of a long show so far, but lots of talk this week about the news on Wii U and all that good stuff in Part A, and then there was other stuff, too.
I don't even think Loki has gotten to officially talk about Earth Defense Sports, the new one, yet.
Is that even on the show roll?
Nah, probably not.
How did that happen?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Podcast listeners, you won't notice a thing different except the fact that the show was taped a little bit early, so the news might be just a couple days behind.
But you should still have the same great show, and DarkSakura will be back for that taping on Thursday.
Let's see.
Did I cover everything?
I think so.
I think we're getting ready to get back to it with some rapid-fire news.
So, Loki.
All right, so we talk about Kickstarter pretty regularly, and there's a new Kickstarter from a developer that you might recognize, Obsidian, famous for Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout New Vegas, the new South Park game that's going to be coming out.
Well, they're kickstarting a new project called Project Eternity for PC.
It's a new MMO, kind of like a fantasy world game, and their goal was to raise $1.1 million, and they pretty much have already hit their goal.
Actually, they already have hit their goal, and they're going beyond that now to the stretch goals, but...
So if you want to back them up, check out what they have to offer as far as what the game's going to be about.
Cool.
And I know I remember reading a tweet that Notch had kicked them, I think, 10 grand or something.
So that's kind of cool.
Yeah.
And then, of course, if you're into some time waster stuff, there's a cool Flash game that was created by...
IndieGames.com 2012-09 Freeware Game Pick Pac-Man Portal
I'm sure you can just search for Pac-Man Portal in Google and find it just as well.
It's kind of neat.
You can teleport around the map.
And then last but not least, a brand new update is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 very soon.
4.25, and that's going to be the update, of course, that's going to give the increased storage space for PlayStation Plus.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
If all you want is kind of the bare bones little portable Neo Geo X thing that I believe, if I remember right, you can hook it up to a television through the system as well.
Probably.
Kind of like some of those bootleg Nintendos that are coming more and more prevalent you see now.
What was that one you got me called?
I can't remember the name of that thing now.
The...
FC Mobile, is that it?
Something like that?
Anyhow, if you just want the little handheld device itself, it will be $130.
This is a Neo Geo that comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo games.
So you could spend that money on a Neo Geo X, so 20 games, or almost have enough money for a Wii U tablet in Japan.
Or you can buy a Dingu and it plays the same stuff.
Yeah.
The Dingu Ate My Baby Double Dragon Neon If you are listening live to Orange Lounge Radio you heard a song or two from the soundtrack during the break If you are on the podcast sadly I can't replay the songs due to rights issues during the break but good news you can get the soundtrack for free
Check that out.
It is available for free on the site Bandcamp.
vert.bandcamp.com slash album slash double dash dragon dash neon.
That link is floating around the internet.
Here's the thing, though.
You can contribute however much you want.
You can put a big fat zero in that box if you want, but if you have the money to chip in or you find you do enjoy the soundtrack, maybe go back and give a
Who's basically making the soundtrack free.
It's not just remakes of the old songs.
There's also inspired music from the 80s.
There was definitely a song in that first stage that sounded like it was Heart or some shit playing in the background.
It was great.
It's great.
So good job.
That is Jake Kaufman who goes by Vert, which is why it's on vert.bandcamp.com.
And I definitely wanted to tip the hat to this at some point tonight.
I think this is a great cause.
And I know we have a variety of different people that listen to OLR.
And I know for a fact that there's some people out there who are facing some disability in their gaming.
Perhaps it's that they are blind, can't see at all.
Or I've heard of some folks that are unable to use all of their limbs or some of the other things that people take for granted sometimes.
Well, the Able Gamers Foundation created a 48-page document that they want to have be a how-to guide for developers and publishers on how to create more accessible games.
In a quote from founder Mark Barlett, quote, And I love this.
They actually put like a little screenshot of Bejeweled 3 and they say, this is what Bejeweled 3 looks like to, you know, the most gamers, gamers that don't face a visual disability.
But then they show, this is what it looks like to somebody who can only see in black and white.
This is what it looks like to somebody who has red colorblind or blue colorblind or whatever it is, green colorblind.
It shows kind of the different ways the screens look and I think that's a great way to get somebody to, you know, think about their game.
and I love this in the PDF document they actually show like a list they actually show like a checklist of you know keep this checklist handy this is what your game should have and it's things like remappable buttons
I don't even really face a disability.
I'm very thankful and fortunate and lucky that I don't have these same challenges that other people do in their lives.
But even I can appreciate a game with remappable buttons.
Because, damn, sometimes you look at the default controls and you're like, why is the game this way?
Or sometimes you have a joystick that, you know, a controller or whatever that...
A button wears out on it.
For some reason, these Microsoft controllers, the wired ones, the L3 button breaks a lot.
So it'd be cool to remap that.
And AbleGamers believes every game should have remappable buttons, which just makes sense.
And then it's other things.
Sometimes, think about the Vita.
When the Vita first came out, if you're blind, you can't use a touchscreen the same way somebody that can see can.
so why on earth would you not make it so that or why on earth would you make it so you can't use the controller to choose well thankfully the Vita patched that in in their last patch but it was because of response like this undoubtedly so anyway I know I spent a little time on that but I thought that was a great great document that they put out that I do think every game developer company out there ought to have a little printed copy of it somewhere for reference I think it would be a good thing Alan are you gonna go with your rapid-fire stories
Yes, just get the thing when it beeps.
Terraria, a game that sold 1.6 million on PC, most of that probably through Steam, is coming to XBLA and PlayStation Network in early 2013.
and I have Terraria I've only really tinkered with it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes but I know that it's I don't want to say that it's a 2D Minecraft but it's it's an adventure game with a lot of building and exploration you dig into tunnels and you find monsters and it's just a really huge indie hit from the last I think two years you have Terraria right didn't you didn't you have a bunch of people trying I do I bought it for like three other people too yeah I doubt and I bet none of them are playing it
Yeah, so Terraria, if you're a Terraria fan, the graphics are very cutesy, Super NES, 16-bit, pixely, cute look.
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says the Terraria hardcore are pissed about this news.
Oh.
This is right up there with the Bayonetta 2 being on the Wii U.
Someone's Cool Kids Club is having its pretension barriers lifted.
We have a saying, and it's deal with it, and then shades will fall from the sky and fall right on your nose.
Yeah, sorry that I'm not a part of the cult of Traria, but it's, you know.
What was it you said earlier?
Go pee your bed.
Yeah, go pee your bed.
What else do I have?
Shifty Look, I'm not sure who that is.
There's a Katamari webcomic coming out by them.
And the art direction looks great.
It looks very weird and silly like Katamari does.
And September... Oh, this is already out.
No, tomorrow, actually.
The new Katamari webcomic will debut on ShiftyLook.com on September 17, 2012.
So that's tomorrow.
It's a free-to-read series based on the popular junk-rolling package flashing...
and Namco Bandai Gaming Franchise.
It will be updated twice a week.
So, yeah, if you're into Katamari, there's going to be an official... Looks like this is a... Namco doesn't have a problem with it.
Webcomic for you to read and enjoy.
And there's a... I can paste the link in the chat and you can see what the art is going to look like.
My last quickfire news story is people are wondering, especially with Capcom, I guess the story we covered last week about...
Watch.
Watch.
watch so yeah the 25th anniversary is looming and people are like saying Capcom's gonna do something but Capcom used to be that cool they're not that cool anymore if they were gonna release it they were gonna they would have announced it by now
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The devs stopped supporting the PC version, said they weren't making any more updates.
Then they announced a console version with new features.
That stank.
Okay, that is a little stank.
So that's them pooping the bed, not you peeing it.
Who pooped the bed?
Who pooped the bed?
Terraria developers did.
All right.
Let's move on with the foogle question of the week.
Every week we ask you guys a question on our fan communities on Facebook as well as Google+.
If you want to find us on Google+, well, there's no short links on Google+, so just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll come right up.
If you want to find us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
This week's Google Question of the Week, it's all about the Wii U, because we haven't talked enough about it during the show.
Did the Nintendo Wii U conference this week change your mind on if you wanted a Wii U or not?
At this point, are you planning on buying a Wii U between November 18th and the end of the year?
Red Entertainment says on Google+, I want to buy a Wii U, but it probably won't happen until after the end of the year.
He has other priorities.
Actdeft says, Well, I'm still not sold completely on the system, so I'll wait at least a year to get one and see what games will be released and see if the system is definitely worth a purchase or not.
That's what I'm currently doing with the 3DS.
Flacco Jones replied on Google+, and says, It convinced me that they're going to have more games on the system than just the Nintendo staples.
I could see myself buying one a year from now if they start getting the multi-platform games at the same time and if the price goes down or built-in memory goes way up they also need to bundle in a remote plus there are just too many hidden costs for me to afford when it launched that was an interesting response because he said it convinced me that they're gonna have this new stuff but I'll consider it a year from now which to be fair there's a lot of people that are in that boat I don't exactly blame him with that one
Let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.
There were a lot of answers on Facebook.
I'm not going to be able to get through all these.
So I apologize in advance.
If you want to see all the answers, go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And I'm going to have to shorten a lot of these too to even get through some of them.
Don't hear me wrong, though.
We love the fact that so many people are responding.
Lama Juice says, I went to a Nintendo event about a week ago where they let a small group of people in and played the Wii U stuff.
Oh, yeah, we had somebody call in on that a little while ago.
After an hour and a half with the system, I came to the conclusion it's not a system I want, but a system I'd want to play at a friend's house.
Critical Myth from our Monday, Wednesday, Friday show at Voicy Geeks Network replied and said, The Wii was fun for a couple weeks until it became apparent that the controls were too much trouble compared to the PS3 or 360.
The Wii U takes that to the next level and doesn't have compelling excuses.
We're gonna pass.
DarkCharger says as an owner of all current consoles and handhelds I will eventually pick up a Wii U but I see no reason to pick one up at launch.
Few games in the launch window interest me and history tells us that some of those will invariably get delayed.
I have no doubt there will be an exclusive that will compel a purchase sometime next year.
Probably Bayonetta 2.
Kevin S replied and said, I'd rather purchase an Ouya.
Nintendo ruined it for me.
$100 is feasible.
I kind of wish the answer was longer there.
I want to know more about the reasoning behind that answer because $100 is feasible for a new system?
I'm not dismissing the answer.
I'm just saying I wish he'd written more because I want to know more about why does the Ouya stand out?
Is it just the price?
Anyhow, Stan replied and said, I'm sold.
First Pikmin 3 was announced and I'm sure a new Mario Kart Smash Brothers will come out.
Bayonetta 2 on top of that.
As Fry would say, shut up and take my money.
Tiara said, I'm still not interested, especially for the price point.
If there's a drastic price cut like there was with the 3DS, I may invest at a later point, but right now it's not worth the money.
Giovadea says, with what I spent on the Wii and all the games that I own and don't play on that system, my answer is no.
While I loved Bayonetta, I can't see the second one doing so well on Wii U that it stays an exclusive past the launch date.
I do want to clarify, though, even though a lot of people are theorizing that, Nintendo is publishing it.
It will not be on any other system.
Not going to happen.
So far, that's the only game mentioned that I care about.
Kareem J replied and said, Short answer, no.
Storage is so cheap now, I don't know why Nintendo didn't opt for a 16 gig version instead of a 32 gig version.
No one starts at 8 anymore.
Even Apple moved away from that storage capacity.
250 pounds for an 8 gig device.
Excuse me, 250 euros for an 8 gig device.
Give me a break.
Acidic Vampire says, no, not enough Imagine Babies games.
Just wait.
Imagine babies will happen.
You gotta give it time, man.
Give it time.
Give it time.
Gamer Girl says, I'm not sure if I want one just yet.
Might wait a while before deciding.
Besides, if I get one now, I'll just regret it later.
I kinda wanna wait for the price to drop and more games added to the library.
Kinda learned my lesson to the Wii.
Don't get me wrong, but it's lacking in titles.
James S. replied and said, Hi guys, I'm new to OLR.
Thanks to Stitcher.
Well, thank you.
And thank you, Stitcher, where you can hear us, by the way, on Stitcher Radio, which is, in some ways, kind of like where podcasting's going right now is apps like Stitcher and TuneIn and all that, especially with podcasting becoming its own app.
But that's a discussion for another day.
Welcome to the show, and here's the answer.
Thank you for watching!
uh he wants to throw in a plug why not plug plug search James Anthony on Amazon Kindle for my 99 cent highly rated horror comedy books fine I will give a listener a shout out um back to the answer though it's it's actually a real similar answer to where I'm at to be honest that's almost exactly what I said earlier right Bayonetta 2 fucking great not enough
So there you go.
Those are the answers on Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them all.
There was just like 20 of them and that's a lot.
So go read them.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and then answer next week's when it comes up.
TigerClaw says he made a quick link for the Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus page.
I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.
Gplus.to slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Well, thank you.
It's much easier for me to give out than say
Go to Google and search for it.
Fantastic.
All right, that's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
And just to clarify, if there was any question here in studio, are you buying a Wii U?
Did the conference change your mind?
Loki?
Not buying a Wii U. Did not change anything.
Alan, sorry, I know you're mid-bite there on that delicious quesadilla, but your thoughts?
Like I said earlier, I don't care enough.
me I am still on the fence I really am it is going to come down to how much extra money do I have burning a hole in my pocket around that time I'm thinking probably not right away I just think I'm trying to save for other life priorities right now I just don't know but I could still be convinced Nintendo tell me that an F-Zero game's coming in 2013 and I'll be like
Beatmania 2DX Volumes 1-15 Yeah, right.
Don't get my hopes up.
Alright, Beatmania 2DX was a great game.
It's too bad that it's kind of a shadow of what it used to be.
But anyway, that's for another day.
Hey, Loki!
Why don't we get back into some news?
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about some wonderful new, hopefully soon, tech from Microsoft.
They patented a new immersive display experience.
Basically, the way it works is in conjunction with Kinect,
It would project a display on your walls, kind of like a projector would.
I actually saw some... They have a video that they showed off, I think it was a couple of years ago or whatever.
It was a similar type of thing.
It was during one of their campus tours, kind of talking a little bit about home automation and stuff.
And the way it works is, in conjunction with the camera, it will detect different movements you're doing, but it'll also kind of...
Adjust for your room.
For example, they were talking about game applications that it would correct the perspective of the scene based on the objects you have in your room.
So if there's a chair or something like that, it'll know that the chair is there and it'll adjust the perspective of whatever object is being mapped onto it so that it looks like one seamless thing, which is pretty awesome.
and some other applications they showed in the campus tour that they did in May 2011.
It was more Windows-based, more computing.
One example was a kid's room or something.
They had a completely interactive display on their walls.
It was all projector-based.
and it had like you know tweets and social networking stuff was popping up on the wall and you know they could you know make a gesture or whatever and pull up music and you know just the interface was really huge and kind of cool very immersive I guess
You know, there's a part of me that wants to say this is full of shit.
This is the same thing we heard about the revolution in 2006.
Remember when the Wii was going to be called the revolution?
LOL.
And we talked about it was going to be fucking holograms in your room.
Go back and listen to the shows from 2006.
That was one of the rumors about the Nintendo Wii was that it was going to do holograms and all this shit.
So here we kind of go again, I feel like, in a way.
But the way you describe it,
It doesn't sound far off from where Microsoft's going.
There's a lot with it that I can dig.
And if you think about it, we've kind of had that technology before where you can have like a thing that projects images on kids' walls and stuff.
Like that's how you have like the dancing circus animals and stuff.
Like it's a very, very basic light with the cutouts, right?
Well, even if you're talking a little bit more politically.
It's seriously cool looking.
They had it on MS... Was it...
I think it was MSN or something.
But it's like a seven minute long video.
If you skip like five minutes into it and it shows... Now, I hadn't seen this before.
Oh, damn it.
It wants me to put on Silverlight.
Can I do this other one?
This is only like a minute.
That will still work.
It's showing some of the other stuff.
But it's not the interactive one I was telling you about.
But see, it gives you the idea.
See how the room is whole.
Oh, yeah.
Integrated into it.
That looks like the Interventions building at Disneyland.
The type of stuff that's in there.
That makes sense.
I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, okay, it's not going to be like the holodeck from Star Trek.
It doesn't look that good.
It looks like projections on a wall, but it's kind of rad in a real sci-fi kind of way, you know?
Yeah, I mean, imagine if you will, like your apartment here, you just have this thing that's in the middle of the room and you're interacting with the entire room as like...
Xbox, fill my walls with boobies!
Yes, I can't... That is one of the things that I am... Loki could walk into his spare bedroom that could be his wall of boobies, his boobie palace, and just projections of boobies all over the wall, bouncing in slow motion.
Or...
MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K
I think it'd be cool.
I mean, because you can use it with pretty much anything.
It's just a display.
To be fair, the Kinect looked really cool at first, but there's like two types of games for it.
Well, yes, the tech right now for the Kinect is terrible.
I'm going to say right now it's terrible, but even the PC version is slightly better, but right now it's terrible, but next iteration of it may be better.
It's just like, you know, the iToy camera.
The iToy was crap.
And the PlayStation Eye is less crappy, but it's still not quite there.
But the technology is growing so fast that this is going to be possible.
Well, hell, it's possible now because they're showing it.
What I want to know is how the fuck is everything projecting on things because projectors aren't cheap.
So I want to know what kind of hardware I got to have.
I got to mount a fucking thing to my roof or something?
I mean, how's this going to work?
Don't get me wrong, I'm going to mount a fucking thing on my roof if I can do that shit.
You know, the technology will always be glitchy.
Like, if you tried to do that thing where you're like, Xbox, guns, it'll probably think you said Xbox, nuns, and there'll be people praying all over your walls for your soul.
Well, it wasn't even that.
It was still motion censored and stuff, but I don't think the voice commands are going to be necessary.
You know, if they've got a, you better connect, because I think a lot of the voice commands now are because connect doesn't really read you very well.
It doesn't really listen to you very well either, but, you know, I don't know.
It'll work.
All right.
Well, meanwhile, while Microsoft is working on, you know, projecting boobies on your wall, we have the 3DS that is working on getting Game Boy Advance games, possibly in the eShop.
This is all a rumor right now.
However...
I mean, Game Boy Advance games on the 3DS are nothing new.
There was the Ambassador program, and we did have some games that came out on that.
If you were a 3DS early adopter, you got some pretty fucking good Game Boy Advance games, all things considered.
Like, there was the Metroid, not Zero Mission, but the other one, Metroid Fusion.
There was the Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Adventure remake, which I think was Advance 4?
I can't...
I've lost count.
But yeah, you had a lot of those games.
Fire Emblem, there was a lot of good stuff that was a part of the ambassador program.
Well, apparently, Nintendo Australia's eShop software page was recently updated, and it added a Game Boy Advance category to the virtual console spread.
The only title that was listed there was Dr. Mario, as in the classic NES version.
That's kind of weird, though, because why would they put that there instead of just a regular NES game?
Could it have been the Game Boy Advance version of the Nintendo game, which seems really redundant?
I don't know, but there it is.
It's possible that Nintendo Australia may have spilled the beans on that.
I mean, it makes sense.
Although, didn't they say at one point, these games will never come out for sale?
And I think we all sat here going, yeah, sure, yeah, right, they will come out for sale at some point.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's that.
Just a few more news stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag and soon the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype if you want to add us, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
But first, Alan.
You've just given me all the Valve stories today.
I know you're a fan.
Yes.
Black Mesa, McPixel, and others are the first to pass through their Greenlight, Steam's Greenlight program.
It's basically indie developers pay a one-time fee to kind of keep the amount of crap submissions down.
That was the story we covered last week.
To have their game be say, hey, we want to distribute this on Steam.
Please, because it's pretty much the best digital platform for buying games in existence right now.
So vote for our game.
And the 10 titles that have passed the gauntlet and gotten the amount of votes that they needed was Black Mesa Source, Cry of Fear, Dream, Heroes and Generals, Kenshi, McPixel, No More Room in Hell, Project Zomboid, Routine, and finally a game called Towns.
These games will be released independently in the months ahead.
as they are in varying stages of completion, Valve spokesman has said.
I actually checked for Osfer in chat.
Black Mesa source is not yet on Steam Greenlight because a big reason for that could be because the last stage of it, like the last 10% of the game, Xen,
isn't in it yet, and this is pure speculation on my part, but it could be that.
Because obviously the game is being downloaded everywhere on their actual website.
It could be that Valve could be like, you've already said that this game isn't completely done, so however long that takes.
But yeah, some of these games should start appearing and be searchable through the Steam store.
These are the first 10 to make it.
Fantastic.
Well, congrats to those games.
Now we need to convince Aaron to put Bungee Ferret Tossing as part of this Project Greenlight thing so we can get Bungee Ferret Tossing on Steam.
It's too bad that the Xbox indie games don't support Kinect.
It is too bad, isn't it?
Because we could actually toss...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I can't believe that some silly idea here on Orange Lounge Radio is now turning into a media empire.
But there is an official soundtrack for six bucks.
It looks like Dan Period is the guy that wrote... Do we want to play a little snippet of some of the music from Bungie Ferret Tossing here?
Here's a song called Jungle War.
That sounds like a good title.
I'll present it.
That sounds like a bungee tail, or excuse me, a ferret tail whipping really quick.
I was going to say, whose dog's barking in the background there?
That's good, though.
That's very professional.
Love it.
It's like that 80s power guitar in there.
So you can check that out on Amazon.com right now.
Thank you for giving me an excuse to somehow inadvertently plug Bungie Ferret Tossing again.
But yes, Project Greenlight.
Congrats to those developers.
Yes.
Oh, weird... Excuse me.
Steams, what's it called?
Big Picture?
Big Picture, yeah.
I clicked on that, and it made my monitor not spaz out or anything, but it made my system run really slow, and then it's like, oh, you're supposed to hook this up to your TV.
Yeah, that's for people that, like Dan and Jamie, have their computer on their TV so they can watch YouTubes and stuff.
Yeah, but my TV already has an HDMI on it, so why wouldn't I just run an HDMI from my PC to the TV?
that's what they want you to do that's what they want you to do but it's it makes it so that you're not like windows because it looks different on a tv it's like all full screen basically like it looks more like a console i guess is the trick got it whatever it's optional right yeah so steam's just releasing either they're just going crazy because they've got the workshop for mods that was the first thing that was a
Still need to play Skyrim on PC.
Yes, you do.
And Portal 2 on PC that I still need to play with.
Yes, you do.
I got Dawnguard like two weeks ago, or basically, yeah, about two weeks ago, and I haven't really played any of the new content yet.
It just got me to load up Skyrim after taking a couple months off.
I loaned my Xbox 360 copy to my sister because she wanted to play it, and she's a fan of glitchy games.
I mean, she played Driver 3 forever, so, you know, Skyrim's really glitchy.
All the good domain names are taken at this point.
I'm going to give you, this is free right here, free for whoever, you know, hears it first and decides to name their company this.
You want to get in the people's faces?
You name your company, Ermagerd.
That's name recognition.
Ermagerd Streaming.
Exactly.
Ermagerd Germs.
So, Agawi, apparently they've announced a partnership with Microsoft and they're going to bring cloud streaming games to Windows 8.
And of course it's going to tie in with Microsoft's Windows Azure Cloud Platform.
They promise popular AAA games will be playable within the coming months.
And they didn't really say how it's going to work with a tablet, but I guess virtual D-pads are some garbage.
Yay.
Ermagerd Verg.
Verg Network.
Alright, it doesn't have the same ring to it.
Let's do one more story here before we get to the mailbag and see what people are emailing us and ermagirding about tonight.
Ikaruga's creator is making a new game.
Yay!
Because who doesn't love Ikaruga?
Unless you, like, hate shooters.
I don't know what to tell you in that case.
Hiroshi Yuichi is going to release a new shooter called Kokuga.
It's for the 3DS.
And the trailer is now out, so if you are an Ikaruga fan...
Might be time to get a 3DS because this is what awaits you there.
It looks a lot more of the polygon-esque kind of 3D graphics going into this game.
Trying to get in some Raiden vibes.
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit there.
Bullet hell!
Bullet hell!
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
I bet that will make you barf in 3D.
Should be fun.
Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Sorry, I have to say this.
MM2K says in chat, Ermagerd is patent too, just like gamer.
Oh my God, somebody needs to trademark Ermagerd and then sue the entirety of the internet for infringing on that trademark.
Amazing idea, MM2K.
You should do that right now.
All right, moving on.
Mailbag, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag every week and find some emails to read for you all.
But since she's not here...
Alan has stolen her hazmat suit so that he can walk in the mailbag and find some email for you.
I'm reading this first email and it sounds like it's talking about a cheat in Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
Should I read this if it tells you how to cheat?
You can leave that part out if you want.
Okay, this email is from MM2K.
First off, I want to apologize if this is the second email you got for me.
I originally went to the old R site to send, but the character limitations made it seem like a bunch of babble.
Here's my question for Rob and DarkSakura.
Multiplayer is rather tough on the game, and I had problems surviving past bronze difficulty.
And this is me now inserting this.
This is talking about Mass Effect multiplayer.
Then some cool people showed me the Striker Assault Rifle Cheat.
This allows you to convert this weapon's ammo to cobra missiles, resulting in one-hit kills with each shot.
But that's cheating.
I see their shrieks as mindless chest pounding over game ranking, which again means jack shit if you're all at the level cap.
If we win, we all get the same amount of cash.
To me, we should be happy.
I'm assisting them to win.
To me, they should be happy.
I'm assisting them to win.
I also play the harder levels as a Turian soldier without the cheat and I tell you 80-85% of the people who play these levels have no idea what WTF they're doing anyway.
Winning isn't everything but if it's the difference between us wasting power-ups to die at wave 3 and only get 20,000 credits or completing the playthrough and getting 75-240,000 credits God, that must be how much you get for platinum, that's crazy.
I would be glad that someone was aboard that could help when we were all about to die as I was when I met the person who showed me the glitch.
Thoughts?
Am I thinking like the gaming jackass that many are claiming or do I have a fair point?
P.S.
You and Bobby's show is the freaking best.
I think you should take over G4, turn it into a 24-hour radio show network and make Blair Herder, a.k.a.
Ross from Friends.
That's David Schwimmer.
I don't get that reference.
I think that was a character.
Oh, I don't know.
Bring you smoothies and Cheez-Its all day.
That reference is lost on me, but thank you nonetheless.
Let's get back to the question at hand about the whole Mass Effect 3 cheat.
Here's the problem.
You may think you're trying to do a good thing by helping these people out of trouble, but the problem with what you're doing, and in your mind you're thinking you're doing a good thing, and it's like, oh, hey, I'm saving you from death and losing all these credits.
You have to remember you're making a big assumption here, that all these people that you're playing with are only in it for the credits.
Some people are in it for the challenge.
Some people are very anti-cheating.
And I tend to notice that type of mentality usually comes when you're very passionate about a series like Mass Effect fans tend to be.
Some people feel like, I don't want you to cheat because I don't want to be associated with you so that if Bioware catches you and you get banned, I get banned too.
I don't want to be around that shit.
So that's the problem with what you're doing is that you're bringing other people into it who didn't consent to do that.
Yeah, and that and also there is a money element to this because I have my two or three favorite classes that I try to keep at level 20 when I want to try and do silvers and golds.
The reason why I play silvers and golds at level 20 is because I want credits so I can buy the upgrade packs to unlock the new characters and the weapon upgrades and blah, blah, blah.
I could also spend five bucks on Bioware's website and get a pack of like 300 Bioware points and then...
Manually buy those with cash.
Don't know why you do that, but I'm sure there are tons of people that have spent hundreds of dollars.
When you're helping people farm credits in that way, like if you were to do that in Firebase White with the geth, and I'm getting way too technical in the game, you're kind of screwing over the people that are paying money.
Does that make sense for those packs?
Yeah.
So you may be well-intentioned, but not everybody really understands that.
So here's my advice to you.
If that's the way you want to play, and keep in mind, you're taking a risk.
If BioWare catches you exploiting too many credits that way, you don't know what's going to happen.
So use caution.
That's all I'm going to say.
Do it with a consenting audience.
Only do that stuff with your friends, with the people that you know online.
You mentioned in your email that somebody showed you how to do that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But Loki's on the right track when he talks about his Grand Theft Auto 4 matches, that they cheat like hell in those matches.
But it's all internal.
It's all people that know each other.
It's all, you know, when, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, when you go on Xbox Live and play against strangers, you don't cheat.
You play it straight up.
No, we don't play those mods anymore anyways.
But yeah, when we were playing those mods, we only played against each other because we all had the same mods and it was all modding new weapons that were all balanced.
It wasn't so that we could cheat other people.
It was just, look at all these crazy fucking weapons that we have.
We're going to shoot each other with them.
All right.
So I guess the moral of the story, and I'll end with this.
Long story short, too late.
Make it like Monopoly.
Set the house rules in advance.
Is there going to be a jackpot when you land on free parking?
You know, set all those house rules.
Do people really go to jail if they roll three doubles in a row?
Set the house rules in advance.
And if you're going to play with strangers, then the house rules have already been set.
There are no house rules.
You have to play by Bioware's rules.
You can just say, hey, can I rocket glitch this, bros?
Hey, can I rocket glitch?
And if they're like, no, fuck off, then maybe that's not the round for you.
Yeah.
MM2K is actually in our chat tonight and wanted to give a follow-up to the email.
By the way, the person that showed me got banned, so I stopped the day after I sent that email.
Sorry for the babble.
Before I knew that, we kind of warned you.
If you get caught, you'll be the one that gets banned and the people that want to be associated with you.
You know what?
Despite the fact that that's already a resolved situation, I thought it was a good thing to talk about, so no worries.
I'm sure there's plenty of other games and communities where something like this goes on.
All right.
All right.
And next email is from Catastrophic Moggy.
Not sure I've heard this reader before.
I have.
Our listener.
OLR, no doubt you've already got the classic game of the week covered, but if you don't mind, I'd like to add my own, given that this game will likely be unheard of.
And then he's got a, they've got a gameplay link.
I will bring that up here while you start to read it on YouTube school days for the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum if you're in the UK you play as a schoolboy named Eric though you could change the name if you wanted to and your goal is to get the combination to the safe that holds your permanent record
to get the combination you have to grab or shoot these little shields scattered around the school with your catapult.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
Some you can't reach without knocking over your classmates to get a boost so you can jump higher or deflect shots off of a teacher's head.
I'm wondering if catapult is British for a slingshot.
Thank you for watching!
Get too many and you may be excluded.
I imagine that's expelled.
You've also got the other kids to deal with, particularly the bully who is trying to get you into trouble and the SWOT, S-W-O-T, who runs to the teachers whenever he sees you do anything wrong.
Like a narc or a snitch, I guess.
For anyone interested in the game, there was a fan-made remake release called Class of 99, with improved graphics and sound.
I have no idea if it works on Vista or Win 7, though.
And then I'll link to that.
P.S.
I'm pissed at the moment because, predictably, Persona 4 Arena has been delayed in Europe to God knows when.
So much for it coming out in all territories in quick succession, my F.U.,
of the week is region locking.
Hold on.
I think that was it.
Did you get it?
No, there's one more email.
Last week's episode was weird because a lot of the content that was discussed.
I don't want to get into it.
This email kind of addresses that.
Let me look at it real quick.
I mean, I think we need to read...
What's wrong with this?
This is funny.
Okay.
Are we looking at the same one?
The one from Osfer?
Yeah.
Okay, this is fine.
Dear DarkSakura, I think it's in your best interest to not take Rob's advice.
Diving headfirst into the mailbag is a horrible idea as you never know how deep or shallow in emails it will be.
I would recommend stepping in slowly to test the depth.
Bring Garrus along with you for sure as he can calibrate the mailbag afterwards.
You read way too much.
What was the controversy you saw in that email?
I didn't see your name.
I saw Dan's.
Oh!
You shouldn't take Dan's advice.
That's a cute little pun on the, when I always say DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst.
Way to make a funny joke awkward.
I know.
Womp womp.
This is why you don't get invited to parties, Alan.
Yeah.
And he, Oscar was like, ooh, who's gonna read my email?
And I'm like, it's gonna be me.
And then I just pissed all over it.
So, Austin, I'm very sorry.
This is for Alan reading emails.
It's fine.
Why would I read Your Name is Dance?
Yeah, that's what I want to know.
Rob and Dan don't even have same letters in common.
You know what you saw?
You saw Garrus as Dan, because Jamie always talks about how Garrus kind of reminds her of Dan, which is kind of cute in a really weird way.
We need to get her that Moe cuddle pillow for her of Garrus, and then Dan will be like, I don't want that in my house.
That's it for Mailbag.
Good job reading the mailbag tonight.
Well, if you do a really bad job at something, then people will ask you to not do it anymore.
Is that a hint?
Is that a hint?
That's it for the mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR We'll get some Twitter topics in there as well.
But first, a couple quick stories.
Loki.
I thought first we had the FUs of the week.
Oh shit, you're right.
FU to me for getting the FUs of the week.
Well, you know what?
Alan threw off my wrist.
So I guess F you to FedEx for not just losing one pallet of games, but two different pallets of the same game.
I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointed Borderlands 2 fans.
And also old people driving on the freeway there, driving like 30 miles an hour.
What the fuck?
I mean, seriously?
30 miles an hour on the freeway?
Two missing pallets of a top-tier game?
That shuts on eBay.
Someone lifted that off a truck.
No, it was just misrided.
Oh, okay.
How convenient.
Oh, so they're somewhere, they're just not where they need to be sold to people.
They apparently flunked geography and thought that Oklahoma City was Memphis.
Oh, I make that mistake all the time.
Yeah, so they shifted to Memphis and, oh, hey, shit, this isn't Oklahoma City.
Elvis' mansion's in Oklahoma City, right?
or Indianapolis instead of, you know, Perrysburg, Ohio.
Alan, do you have any interviews of the week you want to share?
Very minor in first world, but we bought juice at Target, and orange juice is, like, really good, and we got two cartons of it, and apparently we just left it on the counter in the bag and fucking walked away and left and got into the car and drove away.
Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.
Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.
But now, because it happened, I'm, but yeah, now it happened, I'm like, I really, for no reason, I want orange juice at, you know, 9 o'clock at night, because we forgot it.
Do you need me to go to Save Mart and get you some orange juice?
So F you to just, I guess, walking away from a counter and leaving behind things that you paid for.
Even if it's just $1.50 orange juice.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's not like I'm having a gun held to my head.
I don't have to be doing the things I'm doing.
But still, it's keeping me very busy.
But I'm able to work in some good stuff, and I know there'll be a good payoff.
All right.
Before we get into the next story, I want to say F you to one other thing as well.
And that is the fact that we got so tied up in that Wii U conversation earlier in the show...
I didn't get to embarrass Loki with the fact that his birthday was this past week.
Oh yeah.
On September 11th.
It's not a hard day to, or it's an easy day to remember, I guess I'll put it that way.
What'd you end up doing for your birthday?
I went to work, and then I went and saw The Expendables 2 afterwards.
Well, what a manly way to spend a birthday.
And to be honest, The Expendables 2 was better than the first movie.
It was actually entertaining.
Yeah, but Chuck Norris is in it.
Chuck Norris is awesome.
My brother saw it and said it was awesome, but my brother's also like 18.
Chuck Norris was awesome, though, because his character is like this lone wolf or whatever.
He just comes in, and it's like...
Yeah, I just murdered everybody, because I'm Chuck Norris, and that's what the fuck I do.
Now, F you to the fact that I'm having to have listeners remind me about my life.
TigerClaw says, don't you mean F you to that table that hit you in the face?
Yes, F you to the table that hit me in the face.
But anyhow, let's go back to Loki.
So it was your birthday this past week, so Alan and I wanted to say happy birthday.
Aw, thank you.
Give you something to open on air there.
So a little bit of, oops.
Hold on, let me put this down here.
It's just a card.
That's probably one of the worst wrapping jobs I've ever done.
We're boys.
We don't wrap gifts.
And we recycled... Look on the other side.
It is a Skylanders portal keeper where he can keep all his little Skylanders dolls.
And all your Skylanders toys.
You can open it and you might find something a little more useful inside.
Skylanders.
I hope it's more Skylanders.
Oh sweet, 1600 point guard.
There you go.
And a little more useful.
I figured that, you know, it's cute that Josh can put stuff in it when he's old enough to.
Well, he does need a toolbox because he's got like some frou-frou, like flowery boxes he's keeping his tools in right now.
There you go.
So we figured, even though you might not actually put portals in there, it's actually the perfect size for a little lunch or something.
Exactly.
Here's another lunchbox.
Now you have to carry around a Skylanders purse.
I originally joked that we should just get you one of the figures, but I'm like... I had some of the figures, actually, for a while, because I was selling them.
Put it this way.
There used to be a gray market for Skylanders, and they just... Really fast.
All right, I'll get it.
The chatters are demanding a picture, so I'll get one of those really quick and get it up on orangelaundry.com.
I'll grab the iPad.
Misty also says, quit being sexist in our chat room.
I can't wrap presents for shit either.
Thank fuck for gift bags.
I normally don't wrap presents.
I apologize.
You're absolutely right.
But thank fuck for gift bags is absolutely right as well.
Did not mean to stereotype.
I apologize.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
The card's funny too.
You're welcome.
Yeah, the card's funny too.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
We're going to have to wait for him to do the card because he has the next story.
Birthday bad.
Cake good.
And it has a fat cat on it.
Yeah, my fat cat.
Well, she's not fat, but she threw up last night again.
Oh.
Hairballs.
Oh, my God.
That was the first card I was looking at was a cat on it saying, I'm getting all choked up because it's your birthday.
And then he opened it up and it says, oh, just kidding.
It's a hairball.
Oh, if I'd known your story.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Alright, so you know of course Australia's got the brand new R18 Plus rating for their game ratings.
Of course, they have guidelines for the classification and it should be no surprise, like anything that's rated out there, they're being stricter on games than any other form of media.
And of course, you know, it says, Given the opposition to the introduction of the R18 Plus category from a vocal yet unrepresentative section of the community, along with a largely conservative group of attorneys-generals, it is no surprise that the new guidelines hold video games to a higher standard across a number of categories compared to film and what originally existed for video games.
As we have previously stated, we are concerned with the acknowledgment
are in the guidelines that the interactivity has a greater impact on the players despite the Federal Attorney General's Office Publishing and Literature Review in September 2010 that found no evidence to support these claims.
There will be continued debate about whether the interactivity of video games has a greater impact than other forms of media and we will continue to refer to the lack of evidence to support these claims.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think it'd make me less violent because if there's an annoying character in a movie and I want to punch him in the face, that makes me want to punch somebody in the face, whereas if I have the ability to punch him in the face in the game, then I may not have that urge to punch somebody in the face because, well, I've taken out my aggression.
Well, at least they can have the games out there on Australia that were banned previously.
I mean, at least there's that, so...
Whatever.
Alright.
I'm trying to remember.
We have a secret email you use to upload these pictures to and I can't remember what it is because remember our site got hella spammed once so we changed it and I don't remember the address.
Jamie has it saved on her phone.
Crap.
We have a sent items folder.
Can it be piped to the OLR Tumblr?
Because I think Ramna's on.
He does that, right?
How would I search for emails that I sent to an OrangeLaunchRadio.com address?
You just go to your sent items.
Yeah, go into your sent folder and then do the search from.
I know it's live radio, but I need tips on how to use my mailbag.
Oh, no, it's not OrangeLaunchRadio because they go to Flickr.
That's the problem.
Is that it?
I bet it's this.
Don't say that on air, but I think this is it.
Yes.
Yes, that's it.
Okay, I found it.
Yay.
Just host fail because I forgot the correct that they went to Flickr, not to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Ahem.
Ahem.
Great live radio, huh?
Indie Game Stand will be a place that will sell a new indie game every four days for a pay-what-you-want fee.
That's a pretty bold way to do it.
It's going to launch September 26th.
A lot of Steam and Desura keys will be available on the game.
10% of whatever you do will benefit a charity of the developer's choice.
More than 50 indie developers are signed on to this right now.
Spiderweb Software, Cypher Prime, Digital Eel, Magical Time Beam, and so on and so on.
If you create an account before September 26th, you will get the platformer Chester for free.
IndieGameStand.com That's pretty cool.
I like the whole charity aspect to that as well.
It's pretty bold to do pay what you want.
I'm surprised there's no minimum whatsoever.
That's... Wow.
OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is open right now for you to send in your phone calls.
Meanwhile, it's going to take me a minute to get that picture up because I need to bring up Twitters on my iPad here so we can talk about tweets to twitter.com slash OLR.
While I bring that up... Oh, never mind.
We're getting a call.
I will do last-minute stories in a minute, though.
But first, we have a call on the line.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
Who else but Ranma?
Hey, Ranma.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
Wii U. All right.
Yeah, let's do it.
Wii U. What's up?
The money for that Wii U is staying in my bank account because I'm not buying into that bullshit.
It's a pretty strong word, bullshit.
Because first things first, the price that they're asking for, I think, is a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it.
Another thing is, they haven't even said the specs behind the Wii U. I haven't been able to find anything in regards to it.
There's only three games that they announced that I want, and truth be told, the console can stay on the shelf until those three games come out.
But they're not staying on the shelves.
They're selling out the pre-orders.
I can wait.
I'm a very patient person.
What do you think it would take?
What's missing here?
What would it take for you to say, you know what?
I'm plunking the money down.
Let's do this.
Pack a Mario game.
No, forget that whole Nintendo Land stuff.
Take it back to the old school when the NES came with Super Mario Brothers.
When Super Nintendo came with the Super Mario Brothers game.
Then they changed things around.
Take it back to the old school.
Put in an awesome Mario title.
That's what I'm looking at.
Well, there is a Mario title.
Nintendo Land doesn't count in my book.
What about New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever it's called?
That's an extra $60.
And I don't know if you've noticed, the price that they're asking for the Wii U games brings me back to the days of Super Nintendo when games were $69.99 to $79.99 a pop.
BlackWolf in our chatroom, you know he's one ready to challenge you on things once in a while.
BlackWolf says, you're right, it's a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it, hence why it's currently sold out of the pre-orders.
The price of the Wii U games brings me back to the days of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
You have to admit that's funny.
The way I look at it, the price kind of reminds me of the PS3 when it was so expensive because they're trying to put the Blu-ray players in everybody's living room.
There's a big difference between $2.99 and $5.99 as in half.
I know, but I'm just saying that they're trying to get everyone on the whole tablet thing, which is why the console is so expensive.
And truth be told, as much as I enjoy the features that the tablet's going to offer, I don't need it.
Just give me a Wii U, a Pro Controller, and that's it.
That's all I really want.
Well, I guess you can't get that.
Yeah, I know, and I see that.
And the sad yet interesting yet funny part is, even though Nintendo's playing catch-up with all of this, even if the Wii U falls flat on their face, they will still come out on top because remember, except for the 3DS when they did a price cut on, except until recently, every console Nintendo put out has made a profit off of.
Except for that whole 3DS price cut.
That's a very true point.
I believe Microsoft and PlayStation took losses on theirs, so it is interesting.
Yeah.
Alright, well, what will you be playing this holiday season with no Wii U in your house?
I will be probably playing more games on my PS3, my 360, and a tablet that I just bought.
And if you're also wondering, my younger brother begged me, so I will be going with him to Nintendo World dressed as Luigi during that weekend release of the Wii U because evidently I have nothing else better to do that weekend.
So even though you're not going to buy the Wii U, you're going to pull out Black Luigi just because?
Yeah, I have to shamelessly plug out a couple of awesome sites that I help work for.
There you go.
Take some VOG flyers.
My business cards have VOG on them.
Good, good, good.
All right, well, the chatters are complaining because somehow you broke the stream, but here's my question.
If the internet just went down, why are we still connected on Skype?
Because you're supported by my awesome files connection.
66 megabits down and 33 megabits going up.
Can't beat that.
Whatever.
It's not the size.
It's how you use it.
Alright, bye Ranma, take care buddy.
Peace, stay fabulous.
Yeah, always.
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lawn Tradio if you want to give us a call.
I did get that picture up.
Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to do?
Yeah, I was going to mention there was a few things.
There was an article I saw about the whole multiplayer, or the Just Cause 2 multiplayer project.
They've got up to 1,800 people playing on one server.
And this is all fan done, you know, kind of talking a little bit about Black Mesa stuff.
I mean, multiplayer in a game that doesn't have multiplayer.
They have 1,800 people on that goddamn server.
That's pretty impressive.
And then also Black Ops 2 is supposed to have a zombie campaign, like as in a single player campaign.
That's kind of neat.
And what else?
Oh, I want to mention I had actually, because I'm on Kickstarter a lot, I tweeted about this.
There's a game called Rhythm Destruction.
It is a game that's a cross between a shmup and a rhythm game and features music by Kyle Ward.
So if you want to check that out, check out Rhythm Destruction on Kickstarter.
They've got 18 days left, five bucks net to the game.
So that's not bad.
and that's including, I think, a Steam key and they're supposed to be bringing that out, I think, on Xbox Indie games as well.
It does support an Xbox 360 controller.
It's also on Steam Greenlight.
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open.
That's all.
Otherwise, I was responding to folks in the chat room, apparently about the breaking of our stream or what have you.
Also, the Indie Games, or Indie Royale, they have a back-to-school bundle that's out with seven games.
Pay what you want.
Includes Lunar Flight, Bunny Must Die, Chelsea, and The Seven Devils.
Clion, FlyingRedBarrel, Sequence, CuteThingsDyingViolently, and an 18-track chiptune album, Bias.
Alright, going to some tweet topics real quick.
First, I want to say Bobby Blackwolf, who sent us a tweet to a story about how LittleBigPlanet Vita's street date was lifted.
You're a jerk.
But yes, we already addressed this.
The street date was lifted.
Sony says retailers can begin selling the game once they receive copies.
Well, apparently my local Target didn't receive copies.
So this news is still false, as far as I'm concerned.
TigerClaw sends us some tweets.
Oh, this was really sad, and it does have a tie-in to the gaming world.
I don't know if, well, hopefully you heard about this.
Hopefully you're not that shut off to the world around you, but there was a U.S.
Embassy attack that happened in Libya, and it took the lives of a few people, and one of them was this huge EVE Online player.
Like apparently he was really big in the EVE Online community.
His nickname in the community was Vile Rat, but he was known to his friends and family also as Sean Smith.
And unfortunately he died in that senseless attack this week that was...
Very unfortunate.
The EVE community is grieving his loss.
They're saying that over the years, Vile Rat rose to become one of the most well-known and respected diplomats for one of the most powerful alliances in EVE.
He was instrumental in shaping the universe we all play in today.
That was Chairman Mark Hurd on the CSM behalf.
That would be the Council of Stellar Management for EVE Online.
there you go uh very sad very sad um moving on another link from Tiger Claw uh consoles lacking in an important functionality for MMOs I want to see what this is about because I don't know this one so he sent us a story from GameSpot that talks about I don't want to see this give me this one here
Sorry, my iPad's acting up and not showing me the right story there.
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to call in.
The VP of Publishing at Wargaming.net says, Long approval times on consoles are restricting development of MMOs.
Otherwise, they would be there if manufacturers made it easier for developers.
This is according to Andre Yaren...
and Yaran Sao, who is at the World of Tanks World Championship Final.
Oh, have you heard about that MMO, World of Tanks?
I've heard of that.
I've heard of that before, too.
It's supposed to be, like, massive.
They were pimping it out over at the air show I went to, World of Tanks, and there's also some other one, World of War, or World of Planes or something.
Well, here's a quote.
Again, I'm reading this article.
I'm sight-reading this article for the first time because of the tweet we got from Tigerclaw.
Consoles are a nice, attractive part of the market because there are no really well-known MMOs there, and the install base is huge.
But as you know, the consoles are still lacking in important functionality.
In MMOs, it is very important for developers to have a fast reaction time for the service.
If you're a big company like Sony or Microsoft, then the approval time for release candidates is so, so long, you can't change the game immediately."
So interesting, kind of blaming the console development cycle for the reason that MMOs aren't coming out.
Well, Square Enix might have something to say about that when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn, or whatever they're calling it, which is still coming out later this year, as far as I know, or at least it's going into testing.
And Zaku in our chatroom reminds us about Final Fantasy XI.
SSJ100Matt, lastly on Twitter, wanted to remind us about the Bungie Ferret Tossing soundtrack, but I already plugged that earlier.
So that's it for tweets.
Any other last-minute stories, Logie?
I think that was it.
Alright.
Well, Skyflying's not looking too popular tonight, so unfortunately I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.
If you think of something later on, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be a great place to send an email to.
Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But the show's running a little long anyway because we had a very long first half.
So I think it's about time to wrap things up anyway.
Alan, thank you for being here tonight as always.
I appreciate you filling in even though you feel like you have to do it apparently.
I won't ask you next time then and see how you feel.
Enjoy Black Mesa and all that.
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
Chicken.
I would like to remind everybody that this show is free and we don't ask for much, but please tell a friend or two about the show.
Help spread the word, word of mouth.
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show and support independent podcasting, especially those shows at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
We love being a part of this indie network that helps to bring...
The voices of gamers everywhere to you even when they're being shy like they are tonight Ranma's not shy though at least, we know that Loki, thank you as always for being here and enjoy the Skylanders purse and the points more importantly that maybe can buy you something you'll actually be using but any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
play on our Minecraft server if you haven't done that yet because it's awesome and you should check it out and then of course on Tuesday play Borderlands 2 with me because I need someone to play with
And my final thought tonight is, yes, play those games.
Play World of Warcraft and listen to Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
Or if you're extifer, play Guild Wars 2 and still be on a Warcraft podcast.
Listen to that and also play Bungie Ferret Tossing tomorrow on Xbox Live Indie Games.
Very exciting.
That's it, guys.
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you, as always, for tuning in.
Remember, we will not be live Sunday next week.
However, a new episode will still be playing on the feed.
Podcast listeners, nothing will change for you.
You'll still have a new show next week because I'm out of town.
So I just want to remind everybody of that.
We'll be back live in two weeks with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And that would be in two weeks, episode number 475.
We're climbing on up.
Moving on up.
500's almost here.
Have a wonderful night, everybody.
Take care.
