Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie and Loki

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, kind of a special edition tonight.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Although they're all a little bit special, particularly tonight's episode if you're here on this special Thursday.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the head.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff over the next few hours with my co-host.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hi.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How are you DarkSakura?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Educated.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Educated, edumacated. What did you learn today?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I learned that certain parties at my school have no concept of art.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, that's unfortunate. Are you talking about like political parties? Are you talking about like sock hop?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I refrain from comment.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That and I hate this time of year because of all of the, do you want to, we want to talk to you about how you don't want to vote for this guy.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, especially at college campuses, my lord.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, on my cell phone.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, good times.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hi.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Loki, what should I vote for in November?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Your mom.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Pornography.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Vote for your mom. I'd vote for your mom.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My mom's pretty awesome.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Cause your mom would just go, I can't believe you're all doing that. That's awful.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Rob, why, Rob, as president, I'm gonna ban that show, Rob.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You need to save your money.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's only taken ten years before I finally started getting the porn spam in the old mailbox.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Only.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Only ten years. That is slow for internet. I mean it should be like five seconds.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, well also joining us somewhat in studio tonight, say hello to Dan the Man is back.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, I am.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How are you doing? Dan the Man?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not average.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good to hear.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, he's just average.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's just, you know, he's alright.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dan's my means to an end tonight.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright, so if you missed the memo during last week's show, and how dare you not listen to last week's show, but hey, at least you're listening tonight, so I forgive you, here's what's going on.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're taping a little bit earlier in the week. It's a Thursday night right now, and we are live at vognetwork.com, so if you're hearing like, usually I hear music on Thursday nights, why is there a show?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We're here, we're doing this special thing. It will rebroadcast on Sunday night in our normal time slot, and then the podcast folks will get it about the time they usually get a podcast.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So if you're a podcast listener, you're like, oh, nothing's different except this week's a little bit shorter.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, because we are taping on an off night for us, so we got a little bit of a later start, and we'll have to get a little bit of an earlier finish.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Anyhow, though, still lots of stuff going on in the gaming world, but just the disclaimer at the top, the news is delayed a couple days here.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So there may be some things that have changed between Thursday, the day we tape, and Sunday night, Monday morning, the day the podcast goes out.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So just putting that disclaimer out there. Unless you're live at VOG Network right now on Thursday, in that case, I guess it's all current, as current as can be.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you do happen to be here live, I urge you guys to come in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and join us there.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The Skype line will be open later, only the Skype line tonight, not the 800 number. That will be open a little bit later on.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
First off, Tokyo Game Show, without getting into the news about it too much, Tokyo Game Show's going on.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Loki, you and I were talking a little bit before the show about some of the more surprising things that are not at Tokyo Game Show right now.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So the not news. What's not news this week?

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Dead Rising 3.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, what's up with that? Because we had some pretty juicy rumors on that a couple months ago about the story.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think it's going to be Dead Rising 3, to be honest. I think they just weren't ready yet.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was probably one of those, oh hey, we're going to show this, but then they're like, well, you know what?

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We still have a couple games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, like Devil May Cry and Resident Evil, so let's not put Dead Rising 3 out there yet.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because they don't probably have anything to show for it yet.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But next E3, I bet they will.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
An E3 seems like the smarter time to, you know, well, I shouldn't say that, because certainly a lot of big stuff can debut at Tokyo Game Show.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But maybe, isn't Dead Rising...

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They also have Captivate, what they do.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Dead Rising a little bit more of a probably game that sells here in the States than it does over in Japan?

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think so.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, well that makes sense.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's see, what else is in it at Tokyo Game Show? There was something I was thinking of.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, Square, I know they've got some things going on, but I haven't heard a lot coming out about the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know if that's still coming, or what's going on.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They should shoot something. They had, I think, a new trailer or something.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Did they? I know there's big Square news we'll get to later, but still no versus either, right?

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, I'm not surprised.

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No Last Guardian, other than, yep, we're still working on it.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's happening. It hasn't disappeared yet.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alright, well we will get into all the news that's going on.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Last Guardian is versus 13. Rumor!

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you guys have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point in your life?

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I just want to go to Tokyo.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You just want to go to Tokyo?

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, and if I happen to be at the game show, then nice.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You could always plan to be there about that time.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
To be honest, I'd rather go to Kyoto.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'd rather go to Rockstar New York.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You want to go to Rockstar?

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Dan wants to go to Tokyo because he wants to go to Akihabara.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That would be fun.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So he can buy Turbo Graphics games.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Who wouldn't want to buy Turbo Graphics games? Sounds like fun.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
People who don't have Turbo Graphics.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Some folks in the chat, we do have a live chat room.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a small turnout tonight because we didn't really announce this

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
because we didn't know exactly what time we'd be up and everything,

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so we really have the VOG loyalists at the Voice of Geeks Network in chat tonight.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And ShadowNextGen says,

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sony's Tokyo Game Show press conference was horrible,

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
but follows up with, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show at least once.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'd like to go at least once, but it's really crowded from what I hear.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That and Gamescom are both really crowded shows

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
because they are open to the public, and I bet it's just kind of a mess.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You probably have to wait in Disneyland-style rides

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to play anything out there on the floor.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
E3 was bad enough there for a while,

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
especially before the big slim down back in 2006.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Loki, do you have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point?

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Nope.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why not?

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't speak the language.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That would be difficult with the whole language barrier,

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but does that mean you don't want to go to Gamescom either

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
because that's in Germany?

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's still Europe.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Strudel.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's still Europe, so they have some English speaking.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The only thing I'd really want to go see at Tokyo Game Show

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is D3's awesome booth.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We did a whole recreation of Earth Defense Force and LEGO.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They've been teasing it on their Facebook.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course. That's what you want to see.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They've been teasing it on their Facebook.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm like, why the fuck are they making LEGO characters?

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's kind of cool that they're doing the tank and the bugs and stuff like that in LEGO,

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
but why are they doing that?

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It all makes sense now. It's this giant recreation.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That won't be there next year, though, unless you get lucky

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and there's an Earth Defense Force 5.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You know, technically,

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I mean, if I wanted to import it, next week is Earth Defense Force 3 Portable.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You thought about it?

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
For the Vita.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You thought about it?

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In Japan.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is the Vita region free? I thought it wasn't.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, I thought it wasn't for some reason.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The digital marketplaces are, but...

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ah.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, the 3DS is not.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right, right.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What?

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, so I can't get that awesome game unless I have an import.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wow, that is the stupidest thing Nintendo's ever done.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I need a Japanese DS.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You didn't know the 3DS was region-locked?

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
After all this, how long has 3DS been out?

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How many 3DSs do you see me owning?

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I looked at the hardware and was like,

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
oh, it's the DS again.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, and it's got blurry 3D.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, and they've got absolutely no games I'm interested in.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, yeah, I'll live.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want that project cross whatever it's called.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here's the reason why you need a 3DS, okay?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You take 3D pictures of cats and send them to your friends via SwapNote.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Can the Vita do that? I don't think so.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is the power of three-dimensional cats in the PlayStation 3?

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe, but they're not unleashing it.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The 3DS is where 3D cat pics are at, sir.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Technically, I think if you have a 3D TV, I think you can view 3D photos.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You shut up!

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I could give half a fuck.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because I know...

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I'm keeping my half a fuck for when I need it.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because I think there are some Sony cameras that do shoot in 3D.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I guess that is true.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Stop making points, asshole!

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How dare you prove me wrong?

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know if I'm just speculating.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, okay.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But you see, I've got that aura about anything I say to people.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, that's plausible. I'm gonna go with that.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If I look at the comments for last week's show on vognetwork.com,

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
apparently you are now right.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I even had to butt in and say,

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hold on, guys. Hold on. Slow down.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Loki's not right all the time. Don't let his ego get too big.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But apparently, Loki is like Miss Cleo now.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He knows everything.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, kind of on a tangent here, but it's sort of...

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I just started, out of curiosity, because I saw someone retweet him.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I started following Michael Pachter on Twitter.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, yeah.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And, you know, he makes comments about things.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Some of his comments I just have...

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Famous games analyst, right? The one that all the news stations call.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He's a game analyst. I don't like him because he's a game analyst.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And he does the same thing I do, except he gets paid, like, six figures or something like that.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Games analyst.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But anyways, so he's like...

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And it didn't make any sense to me.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's basically talking about how he thinks the Wii U is gonna do roughly about 50% of the units that the Wii did at launch.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But it's gonna have a good launch because it's already established.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You've got the hardcore gamers that are gonna buy into it.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And also because of the lack of units out there.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm like, how the fuck does a shortage on the system mean it's gonna sell better?

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Ask the Wii. It worked.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It'll sell out because we've only put ten units out there.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because it's what's gonna make the headlines on the local news.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Local news is stupid, okay.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Crazy motherfuckers lining up to get a Wii U at Kmart, selling them on eBay for six figures, all that stuff.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Except, here's the problem.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Nintendo plays that game, too.

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Nintendo always does the shit where it's like, oh, there's like ten of them out there.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The only system that I don't think they really did that with was the 3DS, and look how that turned out.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, but here's the thing.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So you know that those things are going to be fucking impossible to find.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just because they're gonna be hoping that the hype machine takes over.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, but the problem is the hype machine also didn't have to compete against the whole presidential campaign that's going on around the same time.

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's gonna eat out of headlines.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna put this out there.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think that they're probably not looking for the same demographic as paying attention to the presidential campaign.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sad but true point.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The Wii U is for, what's the word I'm looking for?

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh yeah, grade schoolers.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The presidential campaign is being run by grade schoolers.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The Wii U is meant for people that already own the Wii, but yet want another system that plays the same shit.

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But nobody wants another system that plays the Wii.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That would be people that own the DS that bought the 3DS.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's very clear that 47-

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He's not allowed to talk anymore.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's very clear that 47% of Americans don't care about the Wii U.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
More like 7 to 4.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, that's gonna be every show until the Wii launches, and then some.

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
On Bobby's last show, and this is all I hear.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It means playing together with our friends and family.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We as in multiple people.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sexy party as in sexy party.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It looks fucking awesome and you're gonna have a party because it's sexy graphics all up on your fucking walls.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Dark Sakura.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I played WoW.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I have a tune at 84.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I've been playing Mass Effect 3, which I beat again.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Again.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Again.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Again.

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

238
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Good times.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I love the comment from Black Wolf in our chat room right now.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, sexy party.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's not too late to get-

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We'll buy Xbox style.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You make him the fucking spokesman.

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That shit will sell.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Whoever can get that guy to sell their-

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That shit will sell.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Whoever can get that guy to do the dance for the console will sell.

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Nintendo, you wanna turn this shit around?

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You know like, hey, you know, Wii would like to play?

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's fucking inside, it comes up to your door and it just fucking breaks it.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Busts it out.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't even know what this commercial is for but I'm gonna buy it.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think Nintendo had something to do with it but-

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That is quite possibly the worst thing you've ever said.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Reggie's gonna hear this.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Right.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Reggie's gonna hear this and then he's gonna be like, we're gonna do that.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And now the Wii's gonna be a big hit.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Good job.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm telling you man, you put that song, you put that guy in there, anything will sell.

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I got some Peekman up in here.

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's another Mario game.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey.

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Get a touch pad.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Alright, stop it now before this comes up funny.

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Too late.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You shut up.

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Alright.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh yes, gaming weeks, where were we?

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Jamie beat Mass Effect 3 again and somehow that led to Gangnam Style.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Low key.

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I played three things this week.

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.

274
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A little bit of multiplayer there.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I played Borderlands 2 which is awesome because I only touched it for about like two hours on Sunday.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So finally got a little bit more game time in this week and I have to say it's a lot different.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, not a lot different from Borderlands but there's definitely more of a story in the game and the humor is hilarious.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Just listening to Handsome Jack go on about Butt Stallion, his diamond horse is hilarious.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Or writing in the Claptrap who gives you a quest to go find his secret loot stash.

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He needs you to pick up a few rocks and then a little checkpoint thing comes up.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Find 133,000 rocks.

282
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Or you must bring me the staff of the Destroyer of Worlds and then you must do a dance for me.

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's hilarious.

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm really digging that game.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then also I played a bit of Minecraft.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Still playing on the VoG network server.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Probably going to flip it over to creative mode in October here.

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Can't wait.

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
May do it sooner. Maybe next week even.

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just so people can actually build some stuff without getting raped by Endermen.

291
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then finally played Bungie Ferret Tossing.

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
When I first played it I was actually ranked 4th for normal mode but I'm sure since I've only played it once I'm probably off.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is that on the website?

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I forgot to... I didn't have my phone with me so I didn't get the copy.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know if you can look up your old codes.

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The one you see on the Xbox is local.

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So if you're 4th you're only 4th on your local warts.

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You gotta do the online one.

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You sure? Because I thought it was with friends too.

300
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Is it?

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think it's friends on there.

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know. I thought...

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe. I don't know.

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I thought you can't do that on Xbox Live.

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But then again I think one of the other indie games I seem to remember in the past did something like that.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So maybe. I don't know.

307
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Maybe. I don't know.

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But if there's a way to look up that code again or I'll just do it next time.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We'll play it one more time and see where we get.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Bobby says he's waiting for creative mode to come build something.

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He's scared of the creepers.

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll flip it over tomorrow.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Good times.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's it.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
My gaming week?

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Sadly not a lot.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I also play Bungie Paratossing which we've talked about during the show.

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And right now I'm number one on the Internet Leaderboard.

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Or at least I was the other day.

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I haven't checked in like 48 hours.

322
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So maybe I've been dethroned.

323
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But it's super adorable, cute.

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean is it like gonna blow your mind?

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Like is it the second coming of Mass Effect?

327
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Or is it the next World of Warcraft?

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No it's not.

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
There better be a second coming of Mass Effect.

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well actually we'll get into that later.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's funny you bring that up.

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But it's a dollar.

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And for a dollar it's a great value.

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Very 80's retro arcade vibe.

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And kind of like it feels familiar yet it doesn't feel familiar.

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
With the whole like being able to move the helicopter and the bungee separately is pretty cool.

337
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But you know disclaimer. Full disclosure.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It was kind of our idea.

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So of course we're gonna like it.

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And our voices and our logos and our cats are in it.

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Otherwise not a lot of new stuff this week.

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Still playing World of Warcraft because the big expansion is next week.

343
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I'm trying to gear up.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
My characters get ready to go to level 90.

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I do plan on getting Torchlight 2 which came out today for 20 bucks.

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Which is kind of the in a way answer to Diablo 3.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because a lot of the people who worked on Diablo 1 and 2.

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's the 47% Diablo 3.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's the poor man's Diablo 3.

350
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's the welfare Diablo 3. Thank you.

351
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well considering my copy of Diablo 3 was free though.

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Because I signed the blood contract.

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't know what political system that would be.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But who cares?

355
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Socialism.

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Who cares? They're video games.

357
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So yeah I definitely plan on getting Torchlight 2.

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I'll be able to play that for like a day or two.

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And then Mr. Pandaria is out and we all know.

360
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's not even try to kid ourselves.

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's gonna dominate my week.

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But I hope to get LittleBigPlanet Vita somewhere in there too.

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's starting to be that season.

364
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm gonna fall behind on all these games I gotta play.

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And it's all gonna be Warcraft's fault.

366
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's only one thing I wanna get.

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Never discussed how costly that is.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh.

369
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You wanna talk about this on the air?

370
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No.

371
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wait for future week.

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There's a 99 point a billion chance that I'm not gonna.

373
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Alright.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well maybe we'll get it out of you on a future episode.

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Uh, Dan.

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What have you been playing this week?

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You wanna tell us about anything?

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Borderlands 2.

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How do you like it?

380
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's awesome.

381
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Why?

382
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well it's like Borderlands 1.

383
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Which was awesome.

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But there's more of it.

385
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Sounds good to me.

386
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes it does.

387
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Dan the man everybody.

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Well I think just like the characters are more developed in the game.

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Like they actually.

390
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know.

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It seems like they have a lot more to do.

392
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You know.

393
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think that the new characters are like way more generic than the original characters.

394
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Which I don't like.

395
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Like I looked at all four characters.

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Which are basically the same four characters.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I know they're supposed to be like extra ones downloadable.

398
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But I'm looking at the soldier and I said and I'll be in a black guy.

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's like you're generic sort of white guy.

400
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And I'm like okay.

401
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's entertaining cause you know you need more.

402
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well yeah exactly.

403
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm like well I'm gonna go ahead and like look around and check out all the different like customizable options.

404
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Which is just mostly different colors and like two or three different heads per character.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
At the beginning you unlock more stuff.

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And so then I checked out the hunter.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Who in the first game was kind of a cool character and I started with him.

408
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And now he just looks like a generic like Raiden cyber ninja sort of guy.

409
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I was like okay.

410
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And then the girl who's still just a hot girl.

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And the berserker who's now the gunzerker and he's like a midget kind of berserker.

412
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
With like giant guns.

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And I'm just like oh I'm kinda gonna do this.

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But then I remembered how much I hated using the berserker and how much I liked using the soldier.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I went with Channing Tatum.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah I went with the assassin Zero.

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So I've got him going there and I'm digging it.

418
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I almost definitely do the assassin next.

419
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Because I immediately started playing with sniper rifles and pistols.

420
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I was just like why did I choose the soldier?

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And then I got my turret and I was like this is why I chose the soldier.

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because the turret is awesome.

423
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you want to show back Rob?

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Doesn't matter but I'll just say in Borderlands 1 the only character I've played.

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Because I'm about five years behind the rest of you.

426
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The only character I've played is the sexy lady.

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I love being able to press the button and run like hell.

428
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So hopefully if the gal is kind of like a clone or whatever.

429
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then I hope I can run.

430
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well she's one of the sirens and apparently there's only like five sirens in the whole world or something like that.

431
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And it's cool because you run into all the old characters again.

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
She shows up early on and beats that ass.

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah it's pretty sweet.

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And then also they had an interview today or something that they said that they've built it where they can add more character classes later on DLC.

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Because they already announced the fifth one that they're going to do.

436
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Right it wasn't like the...

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The mecromancer.

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The mecromancer.

439
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And then they've got more that they could possibly do later on.

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Here's the thing that's weird about Gearbox.

441
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Gearbox and Borderlands are fucking just awesome.

442
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's just like a great game.

443
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then they also did Duke Nukem Forever.

444
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
They didn't do Duke Nukem Forever.

445
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
All they did was take what was done, make it work, and put it out.

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So you can't blame Gearbox for Duke Nukem Forever.

447
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And it had to be released.

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There's no way you couldn't have released that game.

449
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It had to be done.

450
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It had to be unleashed upon the world.

451
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And if you want a copy now you can get one brand new for ten bucks.

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well they shouldn't have put their name on it then.

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
They should have just finished it.

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Can't blame them for that.

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You want to get paid right?

456
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Shit! They could have put my name on it.

457
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's all the text would have said on the back of the box.

458
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Wouldn't have said Duke is back. Wouldn't have said he's a badass.

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It would have literally said fuck it.

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It had to be released.

461
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Alright.

462
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I think that's it for my gaming week.

463
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Dan's going to be reading my stories tonight by the way.

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Is he?

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah he is.

466
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Are you just fighting again? It's always awkward.

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Dan wouldn't give me the mic back until I snatched it from him.

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
He doesn't like sharing a mic with me.

469
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't like sharing anything with you.

470
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Alright.

471
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
She was mad I bought a new video card.

472
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Among other reasons.

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I got a new video card and now she's mad because my computer's got better graphics than hers.

474
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Oh. That is a reason to be upset though.

475
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm going to go ahead and put this out there.

476
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It has way better graphics than hers.

477
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't mean to get in the middle of arguments because that's not what it's trying to do.

478
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Like mind numbingly better graphics.

479
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But if Alan did that to me, that would be grounds for sleeping on the couch.

480
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
His computer already runs a little better than mine and I am a little jealous because I'm like your computer's not as good.

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Why does it run better? I don't understand.

482
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This makes me upset.

483
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Overclock?

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't know.

485
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Witchcraft.

486
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's what. Powered by witchcraft.

487
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Alright. Housekeeping tonight.

488
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook community.

489
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

490
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We will be back with episode number 475 next Sunday.

491
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That would be Sunday the 30th.

492
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We'll be back. Last day of the month with episode 475.

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Alright. Let's get into what's going on in video game news.

494
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And we'll go back to Tokyo Game Show I guess.

495
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes. We're going to talk about Sony and their little press conference that they had.

496
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They announced a new redesigned Playstation 3.

497
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's flatter than ever before.

498
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's like. Yeah. And it's got texture on top. Cool.

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So it doesn't look as dusty?

500
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
No. Actually it looks. I like the little texture they have on it. But yeah. It's even thinner.

501
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It's like someone ran over it with an SUV or something like that. So. Neat.

502
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They're going to have a 250GB model which is going to be coming out I think next week actually.

503
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
With the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3.

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And then also 30 bucks towards Dust 514 in case you wanted to play that.

505
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And then of course later on in the year at the end of October a 500GB model will launch for $299.

506
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And they'll include. They're also going to have like an Assassin's Creed 3 bundle and stuff like that.

507
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's weird though. In Europe and Hong Kong they also got a 12GB flash memory version.

508
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And here's the strangest part about that is. You can add a hard drive to that.

509
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But when you add the hard drive to it. The 12GB of flash memory stopped working.

510
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's probably like a bypass or something. It's a weird thing.

511
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah. It's just. It's really strange. How do you load disks in the new one?

512
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Same way as the old one.

513
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay. So it's still like a tray? Yeah. Or like a slot?

514
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah. It makes sense because if they did a regular. I don't know. I don't know why.

515
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Looking at the picture it almost looked like one side slid over like it was a top loader.

516
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I was just like. That's really bizarre. But if it's a slot loader I guess.

517
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah. I don't even think they have any top loading Blu-ray players. I mean that would have been strange.

518
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Well it would have been a way to price it down another. Because it's only what? $30 less?

519
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well yeah. It's $269. But I mean still that's pretty good for a 250GB system.

520
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Isn't there a 600GB version?

521
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well $500. Okay $500. That's a lot of gigabytes.

522
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's. I mean I have a 500GB hard drive in mind and I'll never fill that thing up.

523
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's like a week worth of saving stuff for Jamie.

524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's say PlayStation Plus. In which case I could.

525
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I have an $80 and I'm having a lot of issues. Like I do have to kind of cycle through stuff that I'm not really playing anymore.

526
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I got to delete it out. DC Universe Online or whatever had to go and you know. I'm having problems.

527
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And that's just $80. So I could use a 500GB or rig my PlayStation to use an external. I don't know.

528
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because I have a terabyte hard drive. I just use a supportable drive.

529
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Also another thing they announced is that they're going to be doing the PlayStation Plus service.

530
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's going to be coming to the Vita in November.

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yay! Free stuff on the Vita. Awesome.

532
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yes. So that's pretty awesome.

533
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Not really free.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Well name free if you pay for it.

535
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Freer than Xbox Live.

536
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
True that.

537
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's true. Also PlayStation Mobile is going to be launching on October 3rd as well.

538
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So they've got that.

539
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I thought there already was PlayStation Mobile. What's the difference? I already thought there was.

540
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because I know Flaco Jones has one of those phones I think. I've heard them talk about it before.

541
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But I don't think that they've actually launched like any of the store for it yet.

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think they have some games that you can buy.

543
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
There are at least like three games on it.

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But I don't think that they have like the PlayStation store yet.

545
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But they're redoing the whole thing because now that they've broken up from Ericsson, like the whole PlayStation phone project, you know, what was it called? The Xperia, right? The Play.

546
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The Xperia Play, yeah.

547
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And they sold like eight of them. Really? Really?

548
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Well the thing is those phones didn't look that bad.

549
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
My wife is a snot.

550
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Their tablets that they have though are really weird looking. Like that one that looks like actually the new PlayStation 3 split in half and it's on a hinge or something like that.

551
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Well you don't want to make it look like a tablet or Apple will sue the shit out of you.

552
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I was going to say, you know your stuff when it comes to phones because it's kind of like, you know, related to the job.

553
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, that's what I got to do these days.

554
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
How do you feel about iPhone 5?

555
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's like a longer iPhone.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's like somebody dipped it in water.

557
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's like a longer iPhone that's getting some Android features. So there you go. Good job.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I like the iPhone. I'm actually a big fan of the iPhone. I don't have one anymore but I miss it because I like the way that Apple makes all their stuff play together and I think it's a great product. It's smooth and elegant.

559
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
How about the Windows 8 phones?

560
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I haven't really got to play with them. I mean I played with one of like, I guess it would be the Windows 7 phone, whatever the current generation of Windows phones are.

561
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, they're cool. I mean there's nothing too bad to say about them but you can't beat the support that Apple has gotten for the iPhone.

562
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I was just curious. No reason.

563
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The iPhone long.

564
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Some of their apps need a little tweaking.

565
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Well, here's the thing. I want to replace my iPhone 4 and I'm no longer in contract. So the logical choice is we have all the apps, blah, blah, blah, get an iPhone 5, stupid.

566
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But then I'm like, well, in my mind I'm justified if I just don't get an iPhone 5 because I have the iPad because clearly I've gone down on Apple several times in the past couple years.

567
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Gone down.

568
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I have an iPad, the new iPad or whatever. So technically my apps, I have something to use them on. So I could go Android or something else but I don't know, I hear mixed things about it.

569
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
To give you a perspective on it, I've had two Android phones now and the next time I come up for an upgrade, I'm probably getting another Apple.

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm thinking about Windows 8 phones though, holding out for those. Although Windows 8 doesn't really excite me, I don't know.

571
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That sounds like a bad idea.

572
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What? You want the mic?

573
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I have a Galaxy S2.

574
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Come over here and take it from me.

575
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
No.

576
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
She wants to comment, let the lady have the mic.

577
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Give it!

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
See, I've got my wonderful-

579
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't break, that's how mics get broken.

580
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I have my wonderful Samsung Galaxy S2 and it works just fine.

581
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Alan wants an S3.

582
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So, first of all, from everyone I've heard who's tested Window 8, it's shit.

583
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let me finish-

584
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Shut up.

585
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
After having used a Windows phone of my friends, it's shit.

586
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I can only think that if you put shit on shit, it will get shittier.

587
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't think that you can- you have to put a seed of something in there to make the flowers grow and without that it's just shit.

588
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, Windows 8 I'm a little less excited about, but I thought maybe- since it kind of makes your desktop look like a tablet, I thought maybe the mobile version would kind of rock.

589
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Tablet or ugly ass art display.

590
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's like I'm walking into a fucking hipster art gallery staring at the damn Metro interface.

591
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Alright.

592
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because they thought that neon orange, pink, green, and blue was a fucking fantastic idea.

593
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That'll be- that just won't burn my retinas.

594
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's move on before we get too far off track.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah, other real quick stuff.

596
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Of course, also, the Vita's getting some new colors.

597
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Red and blue. I'm not gonna say cosmic red and sapphire blue because it's just fucking- just call it red.

598
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Say PlayStation Vita red.

599
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
PlayStation Vita blue.

600
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You don't have to get all sexy with the name.

601
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Cosmic red!

602
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Sapphire blue!

603
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm just saying that's more of a cadmium color.

604
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Saturday night vomit green!

605
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Is that like a Crayola?

606
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Something like that.

607
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Or is that a Pantone code?

608
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Cadmium is used as a red dye on the warm tone.

609
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's crimson's, like, especially an alizarin crimson that's on the cooler spectrum of red.

610
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And mommy says I'm not supposed to eat red dye.

611
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And some of the coolest news-

612
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Excuse me, this is made from bug butts.

613
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Some of the coolest news about the Vita-

614
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Just true.

615
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Muramasa the Demon Blade is gonna be coming onto the Vita at the end of March.

616
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So that's pretty sweet.

617
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It is true, by the way.

618
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yes, I understand.

619
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Red dye number 40 is made from beetles.

620
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Muramasa the Demon Blade? Made from beetles?

621
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Yeah. Vanilla Wear's really sexy looking 2D action game.

622
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Alright, so that was it for Sony, yes?

623
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That was it.

624
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Let's talk about Microsoft for a minute over on this side of the pond because this did not come out of Tokyo Game Show

625
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
because, lol, Microsoft in Japan.

626
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But this is pretty big news here for, you know, the US and Europe and places where people are actually buying Xbox 360s.

627
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You know, they might do better in Japan if they had Sai, you know, pimping out the Xbox 360.

628
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Buy Xbox style!

629
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay, forget it.

630
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Apparently Microsoft has hired a CBS executive.

631
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
As in, you know, the network that has my favorite TV show, Big Brother.

632
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh great, that with the Kinect cameras. I can't wait.

633
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Thank you.

634
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
By a vote of 3 to 1, Dan, you have been evicted from the Kinect house.

635
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Alright, uh, anyhow, apparently a new exec has been hired from CBS.

636
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's Nancy Tellum and she was with CBS as entertainment president before.

637
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't know exactly what she did as CB- oh, I mean, I know she was entertainment president.

638
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't know what she did or did not bring to the network.

639
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She brought wonderful puns with her last name.

640
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You tell him!

641
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That wasn't very funny.

642
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Get out.

643
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But CBS has been doing pretty well the past couple years, so I imagine it's pretty in part to whatever she's doing.

644
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Anyhow, she's going to be making content, or I guess leading this effort to make content on the Xbox 360 that will reach, quote, a very broad range of consumers.

645
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We're going to reach out to a very broad range of consumers.

646
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
When I first got to CBS, we looked at what the core audience was and built from there.

647
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And that's just what I'm going to do again.

648
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Interesting, because if I were to look at the core audience of the Xbox 360, I'd basically be looking at, you know, making Spike TV or G4 or something like that all over again.

649
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Now, CBS used to be the grandma network, right?

650
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Murder She Wrote, Diagnosis Murder, Chicago Hope, all that stuff.

651
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
What is it about old people and murder shows?

652
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Because old people are paranoid and they think everyone's out to murder them.

653
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's all old people can think about is death.

654
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's good that they have an old person advocate for them that's stopping the murderer so that the old people can feel safe.

655
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, here's the thing. Murder She Wrote is exactly what the Xbox 360 needs to expand their audience.

656
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It'd be a point and click game.

657
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That actually would be a good game.

658
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
They already have that on PC.

659
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I think they have those games. Nancy Drew games.

660
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That shit sells like crazy.

661
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's kind of like the Undiscussed thing in gaming, like no podcast I know of talks about it.

662
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But those games sell.

663
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
There's nothing left for old people anymore since Andy Griffith died.

664
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, there's other celebrities that, you know, old people love.

665
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Wilford Brimley.

666
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay, you explain to me how Dancing with the Stars is popular.

667
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Who's watching Dancing with the Stars?

668
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Stacy Keibler was on it and they keep hoping she'll come back.

669
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Who's watching Dancing with the Stars? Who is watching it?

670
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Somebody.

671
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Old people.

672
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I watch it on YouTube.

673
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Old people and Jamie are watching Dancing with the Stars.

674
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I watched three episodes of Dancing with the Stars when I was in the hospital.

675
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I watched while Stacy Keibler was on because she has pretty epic legs.

676
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I watched no episodes of that.

677
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I was just wondering, I just kept thinking that they were moving independently of her, that they were their own entity.

678
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Because, I mean, seriously, no one has legs that long.

679
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Anyhow, back to the article in question.

680
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We don't know what type-

681
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
No! No!

682
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know what the scam of that is, is that Stacy Keibler is like a professionally trained dancer.

683
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So, why the fuck was she on Dancing with the Stars?

684
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, it's just like that one guy from-

685
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
She didn't even win.

686
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The Drew Carey show or whatever.

687
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But, I will admit-

688
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What's his name?

689
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Drew Carey.

690
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
She is smokingly hot.

691
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The year I watched, Christy Yamaguchi was on and it was clear that she was like a million li-

692
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Wait a minute.

693
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This show has just resorted to Dancing with the Stars talk.

694
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I am drawing the fucking line here.

695
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The line must be drawn here!

696
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Back to the story.

697
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We don't know exactly what type of content this is.

698
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Is it short little pieces like inside Xbox?

699
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Rest in peace.

700
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Is it longer pieces like TV shows?

701
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Julie Chen hosted programming?

702
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Who knows?

703
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is it a crappy reality show where you vied to become a product tester?

704
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Let's hope!

705
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Let's hope because we haven't heard anything about a tester before.

706
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I didn't see online casting, so I'm thinking the tester got cancelled.

707
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know.

708
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And there was much rejoicing.

709
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Do we know?

710
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yay.

711
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
We do.

712
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We have some-

713
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We're-

714
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The nice thing is, having this podcast for ten years,

715
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I think we've finally ascended to about that D-list video game celebrity list,

716
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
where we are on par with some of the tester contestants.

717
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So we-

718
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We should get Kathy Griffin to be our advocate.

719
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You'd think one of them would have told us if they're doing a tester for or not.

720
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We haven't heard.

721
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But anyway, I don't-

722
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
As far as the Xbox programming goes,

723
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
what do you think?

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I mean, what do you think this means for the direction of Microsoft in the future and all that?

725
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I mean, it's very clear Microsoft is trying to infiltrate the living room

726
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and maybe will broadcast programming all over your walls and who knows what.

727
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I- Right now, you know, I can't get excited about anything

728
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
because when they were talking about all their, you know, TV network partnerships and stuff like that,

729
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
it just became like a bunch of apps.

730
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I just-

731
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Eh.

732
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's an interesting idea.

733
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I just don't know if I trust that it'll work.

734
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You know what- You know what was a great idea?

735
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You know what was a great idea?

736
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
One versus one hundred.

737
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
One versus one hundred.

738
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That was a TV- That was your TV network.

739
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Wasn't it?

740
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh my god, Dan and I agree on something.

741
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Hold on, I gotta chat with Dan.

742
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Wasn't one versus one hundred awesome?

743
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
One versus one hundred was great.

744
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
People were like getting on Xbox Live and stuff just to play one versus one hundred.

745
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Why did they get rid of one versus one hundred?

746
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because Microsoft sucks.

747
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Thank you.

748
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We agree on something.

749
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Moving on.

750
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
More news.

751
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Dark Sakura.

752
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Well, I killed my husband five seconds ago.

753
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
No, not really.

754
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I just punched him in the kidneys.

755
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, there's been an announcement for PlayStation 3.

756
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.

757
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Ermahgerd!

758
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Ermahgerd, Kerndomhertz.

759
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Famitsu reported that it will be out next year for PlayStation 3,

760
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and I have no idea what's gonna be special about it other than being HD.

761
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Maybe I'll actually beat it.

762
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's the actual Kingdom Hearts game.

763
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's, er, Kingdom Hearts 1.

764
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Erm, was it, er, one?

765
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The Chains of Memories.

766
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Chains of Memories and 358.

767
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, and 358.2dia.

768
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So, I kind of want it.

769
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Which is a terrible name.

770
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well 358.2, I had heard they don't know if they're really gonna port the game.

771
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Has cutscenes.

772
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's just gonna be the cutscenes.

773
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
In pretty HD.

774
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That could be interesting.

775
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I kind of want it.

776
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Now, here's the big question.

777
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Is this building the hype train for a Kingdom Hearts 3?

778
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

779
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Why don't they just put two in there too?

780
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, and where's two?

781
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Or is this, you know, let's milk this slowly?

782
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's, it's Sony.

783
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And Disney.

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
How many things are they gonna milk?

785
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All the things.

786
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
One teat at a time.

787
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
All the things.

788
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All of them.

789
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The things?

790
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Shit.

791
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's, it's Square Enix.

792
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And, you know, well, we're gonna get in this.

793
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
All the things.

794
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
They are milking their shit.

795
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yet, yet we're saying all this and I will sit right here and tell you, I am buying this shit the day it comes out.

796
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Abso-fucking-lutely.

797
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I just said I wanted it.

798
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Sign me up for corporate whoredom.

799
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Nope.

800
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Not you.

801
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Not me.

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Sitting out.

803
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Probably one of the people at the corporate teat of Squeenix.

804
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll be, gimme.

805
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I.

806
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
No you can't have it.

807
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I also missed.

808
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No you can't have it.

809
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I also missed Chains of Memories.

810
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Before she can buy any more Kingdom Hearts games, she has to beat her copies of Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

811
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
No, I have to, you have to fix my copy of 2.

812
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I can't, your copy of 2 is fine.

813
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You just need to restart.

814
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I mean, it's not like you would know where you left off anyway.

815
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You haven't played it in like, what?

816
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't know where I left off.

817
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
10 years?

818
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm, uh, fucking, I have to go back and do the pirate thing again.

819
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I was even further.

820
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And then she made me stop playing, cause she was not, that I was gonna beat the game first.

821
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Give it.

822
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I said you could.

823
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The thing is, all I did was just customize.

824
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The only guy that upgraded was Sora though.

825
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Give.

826
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I didn't upgrade Donald or Goofy.

827
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Give.

828
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Loki, how's your dinner?

829
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Tasty.

830
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Give it.

831
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Dan, go leave and get me something to eat.

832
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'll punch you in the kidney.

833
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You'll pee blood for a year.

834
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Next story.

835
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Help.

836
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If he's peeing blood for a year, that's seriously a clotting problem.

837
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Um.

838
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll give you a clot.

839
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Anyways.

840
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So Valve.

841
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
They've got some hardware coming.

842
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Funny.

843
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Valve hardware.

844
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Valve is a piece of hardware.

845
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Read the news.

846
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Alright.

847
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So anyways.

848
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Their hardware is going into the beta next year.

849
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But what is their hardware?

850
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Eh, who knows.

851
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But it's going, they're having internal beta tests of their hardware.

852
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I only hope that some sort of computer is shaped like one of the portal turrets.

853
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Because then I'd have to buy it.

854
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, come on.

855
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That'd be awesome.

856
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
That would be kind of awesome, actually.

857
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Did you see the video this week from Weta?

858
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I want one.

859
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, I did.

860
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah.

861
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yeah.

862
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So.

863
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Just try to get near that baby.

864
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Interesting that it's going to be next year for the Valve hardware, right?

865
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And not before the holiday season?

866
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's going to be next year, yeah.

867
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Is that because we're going to expect a big push?

868
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Although, 2013 seems like a bad time to release a console if you're somebody new.

869
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because you're going to have Sony and Microsoft enter the ring next year.

870
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
As far as we know, they're both going to debut their consoles next year.

871
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Sony could go another year.

872
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I think Microsoft will launch next year.

873
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Sony might go wait until 2014.

874
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's going to be rough.

875
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's hard to say if any of them are going to launch next year.

876
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean, I think they could still be fine launching hardware.

877
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because I don't think they're really going to be competing against consoles.

878
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I mean, they're kind of like, hey, here's a cool way you can play some awesome PC games.

879
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's almost like an on-live type thing.

880
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I just don't know how they're going to put out hardware.

881
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because that's one thing with PC is that you have to constantly upgrade.

882
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So, even if they put out some nice hardware that runs stuff now, two years from now, it's not going to run stuff that well.

883
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That's true.

884
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Which is too bad.

885
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Because that's kind of the dilemma I'm in right now.

886
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I use my laptop more.

887
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Although my laptop has better specs than my PC.

888
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
My PC is clocked faster and was my gaming machine for a while.

889
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But now it's old graphics cards and processor and stuff.

890
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Can't keep up with it.

891
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I've got to buy all new stuff to be able to do it.

892
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's the thing, though.

893
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
A console-like device for a PC is going to have to be constantly upgraded.

894
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Good point.

895
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Moving on to something else out of Tokyo Game Show.

896
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And speaking of consoles, this will be a big console game whenever it's released, I'm sure.

897
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's a new game from Kiji Inafune, who was the guy that left Capcom.

898
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Who used to do Mega Man, right?

899
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So, what's he doing now?

900
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh, and Dead Rising?

901
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh, yeah.

902
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So, what's he working on now?

903
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's a game called Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z.

904
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yes, that Ninja Gaiden.

905
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's not part of the other Ninja Gaiden trilogy.

906
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
This is a new game.

907
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The trailer was very weird.

908
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It was talking about zombies and stuff.

909
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And apparently, the new protagonist in this game, the mission is to kill Ryu Hayabusa.

910
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So, that could be interesting.

911
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The trailer looked pretty sweet.

912
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's got kind of like that cel-shading graphics and pretty action-packed.

913
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But it was very heavy on the cutscene, so you couldn't really tell what the game looked like.

914
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's gotta have zombies in it.

915
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Of course.

916
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Sell millions more copies.

917
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Why can't they have sea creatures?

918
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
This is coming out from Tecmo, and they are partnering up with Spark, which is a western developer.

919
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So, that will be coming, I'm assuming, next year at some point.

920
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
In the meantime...

921
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Well, there's actually been a trademark renewal that Microsoft has done for Killer Instinct.

922
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
They've actually stated that they've either renewed or refiled the trademark applications.

923
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But there was an interview not too long ago where one of their 3D modelers at Rare said that

924
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Microsoft wasn't interested in doing another fighting game, so they don't think it ever will be done.

925
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But who knows? Maybe we'll get...

926
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Let's just hope he was lying.

927
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Maybe he just didn't know.

928
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Maybe now the time is right.

929
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I do think that a lot of it is wishful thinking.

930
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's probably just that they have to renew the trademarks so somebody else doesn't come in and do a Killer Instinct game or whatever.

931
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But it certainly does raise hope.

932
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It would be a killer launch title for whatever the next Xbox is.

933
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We were just watching playthroughs the other day, and they have the worst necks.

934
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And their skin looks like plastic.

935
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But some of the best music.

936
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I know, right?

937
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Like freakin'...

938
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
What's-her-face music from KI2?

939
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Orchid's music from KI2 was the best.

940
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The only one I have here handy real quick is...

941
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I remember when I lived in Alabama and Dan and I were just friends on the interwebs.

942
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
How he recorded, waited until the game started up with Orchid's music to record it for me.

943
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And didn't you say it took you like 30 minutes to do it?

944
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Aww, that's kinda romantic.

945
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I had a really hard time getting like the exact spot where it started because I don't know if there was a sound test or if I just wasn't smart enough to use it.

946
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's like really sweet in a way.

947
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm a nice guy.

948
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Look at you guys now.

949
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yep.

950
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
What happened? Oh, you got married. That's right. You got married.

951
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Jimmy!

952
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Alright.

953
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I love that bastard.

954
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So I'm sure I speak for everybody when I say Killer Instinct 3, please.

955
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I wish.

956
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Release dates! Let's travel around the world and talk about games that will actually be coming out sometime soon.

957
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, this week we've got the Angry Birds trilogy on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the 3DS.

958
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Whoopee!

959
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You know, millions of other people disagree with you, but yes. I agree with you.

960
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I yawned.

961
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Uh, Wipeout 3 on 3DS, Xbox 360, and Wii. No, it's not the cool racing game Wipeout, but more of the obstacle show game.

962
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh god.

963
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

964
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The Testament of Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

965
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

966
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Puzzler World 2012 3D on the 3DS.

967
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Disney Princess My Fairy Tale Adventure on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.

968
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Uh, some game called World of Warcraft Missa Pandaria.

969
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda.

970
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That's coming out.

971
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And, uh, No Unker.

972
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah. Dead or Alive 5 on PS3 and 360.

973
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
FIFA Soccer 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Vita, and 3DS.

974
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And... that's it.

975
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You forgot the most important title, although it's download, so that's why you missed it.

976
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Tokyo Jungle is out this next week on the PlayStation 3.

977
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's pretty awesome.

978
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That's pretty awesome.

979
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Honestly, like, I might have to not play World of Warcraft for a little bit to go play Tokyo Jungle,

980
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
because that game looks... lolsy. I can't wait.

981
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And that's the, if you don't know Tokyo Jungle, that's the game where basically you play, like, animals trying to survive.

982
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's like 28 days later with animals.

983
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And they're killing other animals, and you get to eat animals.

984
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And you get to be, like, a pug in good times. A poodle, and...

985
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But it's not Nintendogs. It's Nintendogs if they killed each other.

986
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's like Nintendogs meets Hunger Games.

987
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
How about Nintendferrets?

988
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That's the game that Nintendo should make.

989
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Nintendogs to the death.

990
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh, that's terrible, Dan!

991
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Thank God he didn't have a mic. He said Nintendogs, Michael Vick edition. That's terrible.

992
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, you said thank God he didn't have a mic, and then you repeated it.

993
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That means you're going to hell with him.

994
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah, now it's not funny anymore.

995
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's not funny when it's real.

996
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Alright, moving on to Japanese release dates.

997
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
On the Xbox 360 on September 27th.

998
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Dead or Alive 5.

999
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Love Tori, sweet version in regular and limited edition.

1000
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong.

1001
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
They're not dead, they're just sleeping.

1002
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong Himitsu Keisatsu comes out on the Xbox 360 this week.

1003
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
On the Playstation 3, also Dead or Alive 5 and Sleeping Dogs, that same game.

1004
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
As well as a new headset, if you're so inclined.

1005
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I think it's a third-party headset, but probably to support that official Playstation 1 that just came out not that long ago.

1006
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
On the Vita this week, DJ Max Technica Tune.

1007
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I think there might be a few people I know that are interested in that one.

1008
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That is coming out.

1009
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Dan Ball.

1010
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That's what it's called. Dan Ball's second game.

1011
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yay! Dan's Balls.

1012
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Nobunaga no Yabu, Tenduo with a power-up kit.

1013
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And it looks like these are Ys games.

1014
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Ys Selectica no Jukai, it's a 25th anniversary limited edition of Ys, so that's pretty cool.

1015
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And some game I've never heard of called Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, also on the Vita this week.

1016
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Lastly, taking a look at the 3DS this week.

1017
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Chibi Devil, Kokuga 3DS LL, I'm thinking that's their version of the XL in pink and white.

1018
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And Wagamama Fashion, Girls Mode, Yokubari Sengen.

1019
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The only thing that's not cool about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is it's $72.

1020
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Ouch.

1021
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm not importing that.

1022
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Ouch.

1023
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm trying to see what this Fashion Girls game is, but they don't actually show screenshots.

1024
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's just the little cover art is this very badly drawn anime chick who has no neck.

1025
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
She has a neck?

1026
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No, it's...

1027
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
She has a neck?

1028
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's weird.

1029
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
She's got a neck.

1030
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And she's carrying this little, like, coach purse and... yeah, whatever.

1031
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I kind of want it.

1032
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
No you don't.

1033
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Yeah, I do.

1034
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Alright.

1035
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Other release dates for other countries. Dark Sakura.

1036
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm gonna start with the 20th, because that's today.

1037
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We have Rayman Jungle Run on Android and iPad, but no one has an Android, so it's fine.

1038
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Torchlight 2 for PC.

1039
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
On the 21st, F1 2012, One Piece Kaizoku Musou.

1040
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
We have One Piece Pirate Warriors. Is it the same game?

1041
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh.

1042
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It is.

1043
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah, then why did they list it twice? They're stupid.

1044
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, we did this last week.

1045
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Okay, Borderlands 2. Blah.

1046
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
On the 25th, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria. Oh my god, Pandas.

1047
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
26th, Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.

1048
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
27th, Bad Piggies.

1049
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And Half-Minute Heroes Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for PC.

1050
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And 28th, Carrier Command Gaia Mission. It doesn't say Gaia, it says Gaia.

1051
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
FIFA 13 and Inazuma Eleven Strikers.

1052
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And I'm spent.

1053
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Alright.

1054
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Well, let's take a trip back to a time when gaming was a little bit simpler and, you know, we didn't have crazy games like Tokyo Jungle.

1055
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, the games were actually kind of crazy in their own special way.

1056
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I totally want to play Tokyo Jungle.

1057
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Uh, it is the classic game of the week. Where's my cue music? There it is.

1058
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, asshole, play this game.

1059
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
In this case, it was, you didn't pick a classic game, pick one while I'm in the car. So...

1060
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That may have happened, yes.

1061
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So, uh, it's Vectorman.

1062
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because Dan was watching a playthrough of this the other day and I was like, I remember that game.

1063
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It was full of green balls.

1064
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Dan says, coolest title screen ever, which I agree. Fairly cool.

1065
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Very, uh, early 90s.

1066
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Um, so it's basically a run and gun kind of game. It was done by Blue Sky Software and published for Sega for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.

1067
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Came out October 24th, 1995 in North America and on the 30th in Europe.

1068
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Sorry, November 30th in Europe.

1069
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's been out on a bunch of other stuff, usually in various Genesis collections for other handheld systems and virtual console and whatnot.

1070
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But it was originally a Genesis game.

1071
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And it had a console on the cover.

1072
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So, Vectorman.

1073
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Basically, it's got orbots in it, but they're not mighty.

1074
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And if anyone remembers that show, which I'm sure Dan does.

1075
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Um, so, uh, you have to stop this particular orbot who gets merged with a nuclear missile and goes insane and becomes Warhead, which is the coolest name ever.

1076
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And then, um, Vectorman has to go around and clean up some toxic crap and shoot some TVs and save the earth.

1077
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Save the earth. Kill your TV.

1078
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Really, you do shoot, like, TVs everywhere.

1079
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah, you do. I'm watching this playthrough right now.

1080
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Um, I'll go ahead and talk about Vectorman 2, the sequel.

1081
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Um, basically, it's, uh, you have to basically clean up mutant insects and kill the Black Widow Queen.

1082
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, shit!

1083
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Vectorman's another game that if you knew the storyline, it was actually a way better game.

1084
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It was sort of like Wall-E, where the earth was rendered uninhabitable, like, thousands of years in the future.

1085
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And there was this, like, really awesome robot, not Vectorman, who was, like, sent to clean it up.

1086
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But they accidentally attached a nuclear missile to his head, and he became Warhead.

1087
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And then Vectorman, and he turned all the robots on Earth evil.

1088
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And when the humans came back, he was gonna whoop that ass.

1089
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Now, Vectorman was, like, driving his barge of garbage to the sun, and he came back and decided,

1090
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Man, I gotta take these guys out.

1091
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And then you run around shooting shit in a fairly generic shooter.

1092
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It had really good graphics.

1093
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Vectorman was an awesome game for the Genesis.

1094
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Jamie doesn't know shit about it.

1095
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
She'd pick it at random.

1096
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Wall-E was such a good movie, though.

1097
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Don't do what?

1098
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
This is what I do.

1099
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Moving on with Classic Game of the Week.

1100
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So, as I said, it had a play-to-win contest that went with it, where you could win $25,000 or $10,000 or a Sega Saturn.

1101
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So, yay.

1102
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It was pretty much a success.

1103
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It had great level design, great graphics, as my wonderful, tactful spouse has said.

1104
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And it won EGM's best Sega Mega Drive game of 1995.

1105
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
There was a third game in the works, and it was cancelled in 2003.

1106
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It was gonna be on the PlayStation.

1107
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The character actually looked very similar to Master Chief.

1108
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
He kinda does, actually.

1109
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, for Vectorman 3.

1110
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh, I see. I can see, though, where it could, you know, come from this guy.

1111
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I think I played this for, like, 15 seconds in one of the Sega collections I had, and I was like,

1112
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
eh, I don't get it.

1113
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I went back to Sonic.

1114
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
My ex-roommate, like, would just play these games for hours and just beat the hell out of him.

1115
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
She was really good.

1116
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah?

1117
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah.

1118
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Cool. Alright, there it is.

1119
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Your classic game of the week, Vectorman on the Sega Genesis, Mega Drive, whatever you want to call it.

1120
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
There you go.

1121
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
No break tonight.

1122
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
We're going right through, and we'll kick off with some rapid-fire news up next.

1123
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Loki.

1124
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Alright, so Humble Indie Bundle 6 is available now, and you can check it out.

1125
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
This time around, they've got some pretty cool games.

1126
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I actually picked it up already.

1127
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And in it, let's see, Dust Force, which you can unlock if you pay more than the average.

1128
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Rashard, Shatter, Spaz, Torchlight, Vessel, and at least that's it right now.

1129
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Who knows?

1130
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
They probably will add more stuff, probably the previous pack at some point soon.

1131
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Still a great deal.

1132
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Torchlight's a great game if you somehow still have not played it.

1133
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm not as familiar with the other games in the bundle, I don't think.

1134
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Let me look again at the list.

1135
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But I think I've bought all but one of these, so I'll probably get this one too.

1136
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Right, yeah.

1137
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's a great, great thing.

1138
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Right now, the average is $5.79.

1139
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And let's be honest, if you don't want to pick up Dust Force, and you want to be kind of a dick about it,

1140
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
you can pay a penny and still get, you know.

1141
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But you shouldn't do that.

1142
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Six, you know, five games.

1143
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Give the money to charity if you must, you know.

1144
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You should still pay at least five bucks.

1145
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
These are all really good games.

1146
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So that's pretty cool.

1147
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And the soundtracks too.

1148
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
That's part of the reason why I want to get it, even though I already own Torchlight.

1149
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Just to get the soundtracks.

1150
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah.

1151
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So they've got that.

1152
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And then of course, also, there's a new game that's on iOS from Square Enix.

1153
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And Square Enix likes to charge a lot for their games.

1154
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Now this one isn't that expensive.

1155
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's $6.99.

1156
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The game's called Demon's Score.

1157
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And it's a rhythm action game from Anise, which you may remember.

1158
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You know, Lead Beat Agents.

1159
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Anyways, so it's kind of a rhythm music game.

1160
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But then you can also unlock, like, different characters in it.

1161
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And when you unlock those characters, you have to pay $3 to actually play as those characters.

1162
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And apparently there's about, oh, I don't know, $40 worth of DLC in this game.

1163
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So to actually play as those other characters, it would cost you another $40 on an iOS game.

1164
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm sorry, $30 worth of extra content.

1165
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Funk that.

1166
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah.

1167
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
All the characters seem to be big-breasted women, so I'm not really sure what's going on.

1168
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Oh, well, now I'm kind of interested again all of a sudden.

1169
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
No. Not really.

1170
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
We just had a Square Enix music game, too, which is kind of weird, the theater rhythm.

1171
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But I know this is different, because it's not even the same design or anything.

1172
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,000
But it's just weird that we have these different music games with an abundance of DLC, kind of almost back-to-back.

1173
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And I guess each character has a different style of music.

1174
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So you might have one that has, like, funk.

1175
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:22,000
One that's, you know, classical, or looks like Latin, and I don't know.

1176
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, speaking of milking it for all it's worth, I can't believe this collection's coming again.

1177
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
But I do love my classic game collections.

1178
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Might have to check out Midway Arcade Origins.

1179
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It is a collection coming out for the Xbox and the PlayStation 3.

1180
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
More than 30 Midway titles from the golden age of arcades.

1181
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You can expect things like Gauntlet, Joust, Defender, Rampage, Spy Hunter.

1182
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think every single one of those games was on the previous collection.

1183
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Marble Madness.

1184
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Marble Madness is in this collection, though.

1185
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I don't think that was in any of the previous ones.

1186
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I'm surprised it didn't.

1187
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Was it?

1188
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yes.

1189
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Damn it.

1190
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's all re-releases.

1191
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It's just a new factor for them.

1192
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm surprised they haven't done an HD remake of some of these arcades.

1193
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Not necessarily an HD remake, but just redo the graphics in HD.

1194
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
For a short time, there was Joust and Robotron.

1195
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And some of them were the early early Xbox arcade releases.

1196
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Remember when Xbox arcade was mostly just re-releases of old shit?

1197
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I think Gauntlet was one of them, too, really early on.

1198
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, I bought that.

1199
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And they're not available anymore.

1200
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I want to say some of them had at least high definition smoothing.

1201
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And some of the cheap and easy effects on it.

1202
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But, yeah, not really a true HD remake.

1203
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Well, there will be no online multiplayer for this, sadly.

1204
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Which, you know, what a great way to add value to a collection that a lot of people probably already have on their stinkin' iPhones.

1205
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
There are achievements, trophies, leaderboards, whoopee.

1206
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you're a true achievement or trophy whore, then there you go.

1207
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It is coming out from Backbone.

1208
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Didn't they do those early Xbox releases, too?

1209
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I think they did.

1210
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
That's pretty much what they did.

1211
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
$30 in November.

1212
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Was Backbone the one that did, um...

1213
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Was it the other arcade thing that they had?

1214
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Um, they did Street Fighter II puzzle turbo thing.

1215
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Who was the one that did the one that was like, uh...

1216
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Like Wolf of the Battlefield.

1217
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
No, no, not even that.

1218
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It was like, um...

1219
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Remember the thing that they actually had on Xbox where you get to make your own arcade collections and stuff like that?

1220
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Oh, Game Room!

1221
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah, Game Room.

1222
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No, Backbone did not do Game Room. That developer closed.

1223
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It was somebody out of Australia, I think.

1224
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Remember, they shut down and then Game Room just suddenly stopped updating.

1225
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
That was really important.

1226
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
God.

1227
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh, it's been at least...

1228
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Another misstep.

1229
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's been a good six months since I've ranted about Game Room and how that should have been so much better than it was.

1230
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Anyway.

1231
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Who was that again?

1232
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Blah, blah, blah.

1233
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
No, Backbone pretty much just does arcade translations, classic collections, and like new versions of old games.

1234
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Like they did Wolf of the Battlefield. They did, uh...

1235
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Whatever the 1940...

1236
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The 1940-whatever series game that they did straight for the Xbox and PS3, like the remake.

1237
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
That's just kind of what they do.

1238
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Oh, I am being corrected by chat.

1239
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The perks of having a live chat room is that they correct you when you're wrong.

1240
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

1241
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Actually, the Midway ones were Digital Eclipse.

1242
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So I was wrong. It was not Backbone. Sorry.

1243
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
AlphaCananagram does state, though, Backbone did do Yaris.

1244
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
It's not exactly one to get really excited about, just saying.

1245
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's the best free game based on a cheap Toyota ever made.

1246
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Thank you. BobbyBlackWolf to the rescue.

1247
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Chrome Studios is the name. I knew it was K-something.

1248
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Chrome Studios did Game Room.

1249
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And ShadowNextGen agrees Game Room is such a missed opportunity by Microsoft.

1250
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Because, man, I desperately wanted to play in television games on my 360 and pay for it.

1251
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Now I want to know why is Dark Tetsuya talking about online Super Off-Road?

1252
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He says,

1253
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm disappointed this collection doesn't have online. I would have loved online Super Off-Road.

1254
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Super Off-Road wasn't in the list.

1255
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But there is a trailer.

1256
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So now I feel the need to watch this trailer immediately just to see if it has Super Off-Road in it.

1257
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Because I don't remember Super Off-Road being in the, uh...

1258
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I didn't realize that was a Midway game.

1259
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's not. I mean, a lot of these aren't Midway games.

1260
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Now it's time to talk some classic games.

1261
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
A lot of these are like Atari games.

1262
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But Midway became the owner of Atari after Namco, actually, strangely enough.

1263
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And Leland actually was the company that released Super Off-Road.

1264
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And somehow they ended up with the rights to the Leland games as well.

1265
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm looking at this trailer and I'm definitely seeing some Spy Hunter and some Defender.

1266
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I'm not seeing Off-Road, though.

1267
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Super Off-Road would be a good one.

1268
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I don't even think it had a...

1269
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I don't think it's had an Xbox Live release.

1270
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And can you imagine, though, if that was on this collection and you can't play online?

1271
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Like, damn, talk about a game from my childhood I'd like to be able to play online.

1272
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Well, it's because they're not doing any new code.

1273
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's just, you know, quick and dirty ROM, you know, ports.

1274
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Build an emulator, dump ROM.

1275
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Right, build an emulator, dump ROM, you know, question, question, question.

1276
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Dark Tetsuya says it was in Midway Treasures 3, and that was the one with all the racing games.

1277
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah, let me look. I think I have it.

1278
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know if Super Off-Road... Yeah, I think it was. I think it and the track pack both were.

1279
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I know it was Hydro Thunder. I know it's the later Off-Road game, like Off-Road Thunder.

1280
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And it was the Dreamcast port of Hydro Thunder, which pissed me off.

1281
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It was not Arctic Thunder because that would have been sweet.

1282
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yep, Super Off-Road. I'm looking at it right here.

1283
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I actually have the Xbox version.

1284
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And it was the Dreamcast ports of Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049.

1285
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh, and a really nice arcade port of Rush 2.

1286
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I can say this now because this company doesn't really exist anymore, but I got this copy free for Midway

1287
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
because the chick and I were at the Classic Game Expo and I were just kind of like talking and she gave me a free copy.

1288
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'm disappointed that that's going to be in Vegas this next time.

1289
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Well, it hasn't been in the Bay Area like forever.

1290
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Really?

1291
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, we went like a couple years when it was like in Burlingame. It was awesome.

1292
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I had such a good time. One year, I mean, me and Jamie must not have taken more than like 150 bucks.

1293
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:36,000
We got just a pristine, not a duo, but we got a Core Graphics, which is a PC Engine.

1294
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Just a stack of games. Just awesome.

1295
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I was disappointed they didn't have an Atari party this year.

1296
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I totally forgot. I totally forgot about Super Off-Road being in Midway Arcade Treasure 3.

1297
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I wonder if that's one of the backwards compatible games I can play on 360. If so, no? Curse you!

1298
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But you can play the PS2 version on your 60 gig PS3.

1299
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Except I don't have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.

1300
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Oh, that sucks. I guess I'll just have to play it on mine.

1301
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Now I see why they're re-releasing it all over again.

1302
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Rob, do you want to borrow our Xbox?

1303
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I have an Xbox. Dan vetoed that real quick.

1304
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I have an old Xbox somewhere. I just can't guarantee if it'll work or not.

1305
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Let's sigh.

1306
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Alright, anyhow, that was supposed to be rapid fire news. Oops.

1307
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Animal Crossing Jump Out. Well, this ought to be quick.

1308
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Because we're going to talk about what's new in Animal Crossing Jump Out.

1309
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Crickets, crickets, crickets.

1310
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
No, there will be five new characters.

1311
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Frap, or Frappe, I like to use the E.

1312
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Frappe, who will be a lively penguin.

1313
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
A brisk hamster.

1314
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Frappe.

1315
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Tocoya, a carefree octopus.

1316
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Brittany, who is a mature pig.

1317
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Wait, that would be Tocoya.

1318
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Taco is octopus.

1319
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And Anthony, who is a smug horse.

1320
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Apparently smug is a new personality you will see throughout the game.

1321
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So does he go around going, no sir, I do not like it.

1322
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
He goes around going, nay.

1323
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah, I was just going to say, he goes around going, nay.

1324
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
There is also, Loki, this could be, here is something new.

1325
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You've been asking, you've been dying. What is going to be new in the new Animal Crossing game?

1326
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So here it is. I'm waiting for it.

1327
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You ready?

1328
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
There is going to be a special tree that you plant when you become mayor,

1329
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and it will grow as your city grows.

1330
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Bravo.

1331
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Bravo.

1332
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Pre-order it right now.

1333
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm going out tomorrow buying 3DS just for, no.

1334
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
You know what?

1335
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I would do that just to start my toilet collection again.

1336
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Well, Dar Sakura, you might appreciate this, because it's kind of in your name.

1337
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
There will be new flowers in the game, and cherry blossoms are coming back.

1338
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Okay, we're getting it. Hold on.

1339
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
They've got to put NES games back in it.

1340
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You can, I guess, apparently put the reset management center anywhere you want.

1341
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I didn't realize Resetti got his own building now, so he can yell at you.

1342
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Oh, okay. I have to digress, Rob.

1343
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What?

1344
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Uncracked.

1345
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
They did the what if minor characters in games got their own game,

1346
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
and one of them was Mr. Resetti's game, and the thing was full of text.

1347
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It was great.

1348
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Mr. Resetti is one of the most underappreciated video game characters ever.

1349
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
He's amazing.

1350
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
There's also Brewster's coffee shop, so you can have a not Starbucks in your town.

1351
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That was Brewster. That's who you're thinking of.

1352
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Two types of police stations that you can have.

1353
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Mr. Resetti needs to be in the next Mario Kart game as one of the attacks.

1354
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Instead of the squid ink and stuff like that, it's just Mr. Resetti.

1355
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
He just blocks you with nothing but text for five seconds.

1356
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Is he in Smash Brothers?

1357
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
They have a...

1358
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Wasn't he a trophy or something, probably? I think there was a trophy.

1359
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
They have Animal Crossing level, I thought.

1360
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I can't remember if Resetti was in it or not. I think he was.

1361
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Anyway, let's move on with more rapid fire news with Dark Sakura.

1362
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Stuff happened, and things happened.

1363
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Nights HD is going to have Christmas nights, and it will be on PlayStation Network on October 2nd,

1364
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
and on Xbox Live October 5th.

1365
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Guess what? I already have it, except the HD looks super fucking pretty, and I want it.

1366
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It'll be ten bucks.

1367
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It does have Christmas nights.

1368
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah, but I've got it on the Saturn.

1369
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Shut up! We have it on the Saturn. You can sit there and shut up.

1370
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah, and I've got the Japanese one after... whatever.

1371
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:53,000
On this show before, you've talked about it's kind of a tradition for you to break out the Saturn every Christmas and play Christmas nights.

1372
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Is there any chance you'd replace it with HD, or is that done?

1373
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Hell no!

1374
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's a tradition for her to have me break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.

1375
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
You know what would be great about having it in HD, though?

1376
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
What's that?

1377
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
The fact that every year I go through, I unlock maybe half the presents. I know I had them all unlocked at once,

1378
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
but since the Saturn's internal memory dies in like, oh, twelve seconds, even with a brand new battery,

1379
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
every year I have to unlock all the presents again.

1380
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So, it'd be nice just to have them all unlocked.

1381
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Alright.

1382
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
But, with no Saturn analog controller, it just ain't going to play right.

1383
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Rob.

1384
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Alright, let's...

1385
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Yeah, Rob.

1386
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright, Rob!

1387
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Rob!

1388
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Rob, more coffee.

1389
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
No, neither one of you gets coffee.

1390
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Bioware has...

1391
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
No, you can have, you can have weed.

1392
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Dan, shut up.

1393
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Just kidding, I don't have weed. Don't do drugs.

1394
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
We need to go get some food.

1395
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Don't be like Fiona.

1396
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Let's do this show faster so we can go get dinner.

1397
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Free Fiona.

1398
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Okay, Bioware's at Dragon Age III Inquisition, the end.

1399
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Nobody expects the Dragon Age Inquisition.

1400
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You've been waiting like an hour and a half to make that joke.

1401
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Seriously, tell them.

1402
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You've been waiting an hour and a half to make that joke, haven't you?

1403
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Ever since I posted that story in the show, Rob.

1404
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But you have to do it in the right voice.

1405
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Nobody expects it.

1406
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
One more time, one more time, please.

1407
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
No, no, no, no, we're done. We already did the joke.

1408
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
No, you don't want a clean cut for the Parsec Award.

1409
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
He can't do squeaky voice.

1410
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I've never heard him do a proper squeaky voice.

1411
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh, a proper squeaky voice? I can do a proper squeaky voice.

1412
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1413
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Okay, close enough.

1414
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
There's other Bioware news too that's not a part of that story,

1415
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
and it was kind of something big that happened this week.

1416
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I don't know if you're aware, but the doctors that founded Bioware left.

1417
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Yeah, I know.

1418
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
LOL bye.

1419
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Dan told me, and I'm like, good for them.

1420
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Well, it's been kind of a crappy couple years for Bioware.

1421
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
They're taking a lot of shit about Mass Effect 3 ending.

1422
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
They're pissed off about all you people bitching about Mass Effect 3's ending.

1423
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Wait, don't point at us. We didn't...

1424
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Get over it. Oh no, Jamie did.

1425
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I heard her bitching about it the other day.

1426
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Star Wars The Old Republic didn't quite meet expectations.

1427
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Dragon Age 2 was no Dragon Age 1.

1428
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So, I mean, that's like three punches in the gut in a quick span.

1429
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
That's what happens when ZA sticks their nose into a good thing.

1430
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
That's very true.

1431
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Everyone's leaving to make beer, so I mean, that's good, right?

1432
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We can have Bioware beer.

1433
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite beer on the Citadel.

1434
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Now, the other...

1435
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Captain Shepherds.

1436
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
There were some very important things that were also confirmed.

1437
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Dark Sakura, pay attention.

1438
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Beer.

1439
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
The next Mass Effect 3 DLC has been announced.

1440
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It will be the taking back of Omega this fall.

1441
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Play the news. Don't fuck with Aria.

1442
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Also confirmed, because people are paranoid because these guys are leaving.

1443
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:13,000
They had to put it out on the table, and they did confirm another Mass Effect game is in development.

1444
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Now, they didn't say it's Mass Effect 4. That's all they said.

1445
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
They just said another...

1446
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It better be the Tale of Geras.

1447
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Another full Mass Effect game is in development.

1448
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Could be a prequel, could be a new trilogy, could be anything.

1449
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Shut up.

1450
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It could be like the new iPad, where it's just the new Mass Effect.

1451
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It would be Silent Scope featuring Geras.

1452
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Also, the same team led by Casey Hudson working on a new IP.

1453
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
That's supposed to be pushing the envelopes with game design.

1454
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Strong hints that it's for an unannounced console.

1455
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
There's gonna be a lot of hardcore gay sex in that one.

1456
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
We'll get cocked this time.

1457
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
One can hope.

1458
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's right.

1459
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
No, cocks and twats everywhere.

1460
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Pushing the pornography envelope. That's how Bioware's gonna sell some games.

1461
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Heck yeah.

1462
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, you know what's funny?

1463
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Cocks and twats?

1464
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
No, not cocks and twats.

1465
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Is that if you look at the date of their retirement announcement, it's almost exactly five years after the EA purchase of Bioware.

1466
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
One has to wonder if that was in the contract that their jobs would be protected for five years.

1467
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
No one can hear you when you are not talking on the microphone, Dan.

1468
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It's probably just that they had to stay with the company for five years.

1469
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They couldn't be like, thanks for the money. Bye.

1470
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I would leave wow for Mass Effect MMO just saying.

1471
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Shadow Next Gen says, I heard the next Mass Effect game probably won't include Shepard.

1472
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Well, duh.

1473
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Well, let me just put it this way.

1474
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
When you're writing fiction, you can do anything you want.

1475
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Especially when it's sci-fi.

1476
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Look at the shit they got away with on Star Trek for years.

1477
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Look at the shit they get away with in comics.

1478
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
How many times has Superman died? How many times has Batman died?

1479
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Isn't Captain America president now?

1480
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
How many more endings can they get Buzz Aldrin to narrate? Hello.

1481
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah, I know. Black Wolf in the chat says SWOTOR equals Mass Effect MMO.

1482
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
No.

1483
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Well, I think that's kind of why a Mass Effect MMO isn't exactly at the top of anybody's wish list right now.

1484
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Mass Effect would sell better.

1485
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But SWOTOR wasn't bad. That's the thing.

1486
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It wasn't strong enough to take down a game that it was emulating.

1487
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The fandom wasn't enough.

1488
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It just needs to go the Macross 2, Macross 7 route where it's just all about music.

1489
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And their weapon is music and they can get Psy to be the leader of whatever rebellion or whatever.

1490
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Just have them dancing.

1491
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I think the Old Republic would have been a lot better if they hadn't just put it out of the tail end of just running Star Wars into the ground as hard as they could.

1492
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
True.

1493
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I think back when they brought out the original...

1494
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Not Bioware's fault.

1495
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
No, not Bioware's fault at all.

1496
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
The game design is apparently really solid, but the Star Wars franchise has lost a lot of its shine.

1497
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's kind of sadly true.

1498
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:25,000
The Star Wars franchise hasn't had shine since they changed the first one to Episode 4.

1499
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Moving on.

1500
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Now I was going to say at least the third movie.

1501
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Anyway, forget it.

1502
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Moving on.

1503
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Now that we're done with rapid fire news, 30 minutes later.

1504
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
No foogle question of the week this week because I forgot to ask one.

1505
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
We'll bring one back next week.

1506
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But you should join our Facebook and Google Plus communities in anticipation.

1507
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And so that you have something to do on Google Plus.

1508
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Actually, hangouts are still cool.

1509
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm just saying.

1510
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Google Plus is kind of underappreciated, but I'll save that tangent for another week.

1511
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Let's get back into some long form news.

1512
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Hahaha, Loki.

1513
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So Zynga has bought a bit lucky.

1514
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And they're a developer of such wonderful games called Lucky Train and Lucky Space.

1515
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Lucky Charms?

1516
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
No Lucky Charms.

1517
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Perhaps that could be a sequel.

1518
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And also a game called Solstice Arena.

1519
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
This of course begs the question.

1520
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So Zynga, are you feeling lucky?

1521
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Maybe.

1522
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And they paid 20 million dollars for the company.

1523
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And apparently also in unrelated news, the executive at OMG Pop has left.

1524
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Wilson Kriegel, the former chief revenue officer.

1525
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Eh, revenue officer. That's just like the guy that handles money.

1526
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Oh, you know the guy that cut that deal where the company sold for what?

1527
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
100 million dollars or however much it went for?

1528
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
That crazy ass amount?

1529
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
He's retiring.

1530
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Fuck it, I would too.

1531
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
If I could sell Orange Lounge Radio for 100 million dollars.

1532
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I'd fuck you every time.

1533
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Five inches, have fun.

1534
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You'd be splitting that three ways.

1535
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I'm going to Tahiti.

1536
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I'd buy you Pinkberry.

1537
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
To quote my husband, it better be a Pinkberry franchise.

1538
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
We'll see.

1539
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Depends what flavors you carry.

1540
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Alright, moving on.

1541
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
For you Rob All Peach.

1542
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You know the funny thing is that that story went quicker than anything in rapid fire news.

1543
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Because it was a Zynga story.

1544
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And no one curr.

1545
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Lesson learned for producing future shows.

1546
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Alright, Dragon Quest X, listen up.

1547
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I know some people are excited about this.

1548
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Dragon Quest X, even though it's an MMO, which might turn some people off.

1549
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But I don't know, I'm curious about it.

1550
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Well Dragon Quest X, some more details of Tokyo Game Show.

1551
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You can play the entire game on the Wii U gamepad if you want.

1552
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
No one wants to.

1553
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Well I don't think that's too surprising either.

1554
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Because they've already talked about that there will be games that you can kind of play on the Wii U gamepad while people are watching whatever on TV.

1555
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Like you can kind of do that duel thing that was part of the point of having the gamepad.

1556
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But the fact that this is an MMO makes it very interesting.

1557
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Because people tend to get drawn to MMOs a little more.

1558
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Imagine if it was Warcraft.

1559
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You could sit on the couch and watch American Idol and play World of Warcraft at the same time.

1560
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Of course a lot of people kind of already do that with two monitors.

1561
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I don't see how this is even a big deal.

1562
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Some people we know just put a TV on their wall.

1563
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Because it's basically just like playing it on a small monitor.

1564
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Well they also talk about that you can switch between the two.

1565
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You can go between the TV screen and the gamepad in the menu under options smoothly.

1566
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Cool.

1567
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:57,000
But once again I don't think it's news at all that any of these games can be played on the gamepad or on the TV.

1568
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Ooh it's a display. It displays the game.

1569
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Ooh my TV's a display. It displays the game.

1570
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
That's not fucking news. That's a feature.

1571
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I thought that was sort of the whole idea, yes.

1572
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Well then I guess we're done with that story.

1573
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Because it's just like basically that just tells me that they really didn't need the whole Wii at all to do this Dragon Quest X.

1574
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Because it doesn't utilize anything other than a standard control set.

1575
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Cool.

1576
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
But it's Dragon Quest.

1577
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Yeah, cool.

1578
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Moving on to the mailbag!

1579
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1580
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
What?

1581
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
You still have Alan's name on it.

1582
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Well, oh my god I made a mistake from copy pasting last twist.

1583
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I am not that tall.

1584
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Maybe you have a scarlet letter A for another reason.

1585
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Asshole.

1586
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Alright, mailbag.

1587
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You were saying awesome but okay if you had to go there.

1588
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send Dark Sakura letters.

1589
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Whatever letter you want.

1590
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Send me lots of Q's.

1591
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
This one starts with an A.

1592
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's from AJ Twist.

1593
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Is that actually his name? AJ Twist? Babow?

1594
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
No. I was emphasizing.

1595
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You added flair.

1596
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
This is my flair.

1597
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Good day good hosts of OLR.

1598
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Howdy.

1599
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Stop it.

1600
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
What? I'm not allowed to respond to the greeting?

1601
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
What? If you say hi to me I just have to look at you?

1602
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah, what?

1603
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Girl.

1604
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I just finished watching a documentary on Netflix about video games.

1605
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You guys have mentioned the video game crash in the 1980's and I wanted to know what happened to cause this crash.

1606
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So I went looking for something on Netflix and I came across CNBC Originals Game On.

1607
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
The unauthorized history of video games.

1608
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It was a great outline of the video game history up until the release of the Nintendo Wii.

1609
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
What blew my mind about the documentary was a quote by the narrator, Bill Griffith, toward the end of the video.

1610
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
He said,

1611
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
The game machine is only as good as the games created for it.

1612
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Where have I heard that so many times before? But now I wonder, who coined the phrase first?

1613
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Me.

1614
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:19,000
First thing you should do about that documentary, which I've also watched, is just forget everything that you saw on it.

1615
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Because it's really, really, really bad.

1616
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I will tell you everything you need to know about the video game crash without having to watch the documentary.

1617
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Although I have not seen said documentary so I have no opinion on it.

1618
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Imagine that you have a system like the Atari 2600 and imagine they've created Yaris for the Atari 2600.

1619
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Imagine that 30 companies created Yaris for the Atari 2600 and they're charging you $60 a copy for Yaris.

1620
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
This marketplace was flooded with bullshit games like this and that's what caused the crash.

1621
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It'd be like if all of a sudden that the Apple store was selling physical copies of those knockoff games for $60 at retail and they were all clogging the shelves at Walmart or something like that.

1622
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That would be the video game crash.

1623
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Don't forget that there were like seven or eight competing consoles.

1624
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That's true too. And PC computing.

1625
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Well, that was actually kind of pre-PC being even a factor.

1626
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Okay, Commodore, TI-99, Apple II.

1627
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Motherfucker, do you even know who you are stepping to?

1628
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I will whoop that ass if you want to talk about this.

1629
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
That stuff all really rose up. I mean, it did play a part.

1630
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
The fact that the market switched to, hey, why spend the money on a game console when you can spend the money on a computer?

1631
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
But the gaming in computers really came after the crash because, you know, what were you going to get your games on?

1632
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,000
You know, so to an extent, but it was, yeah, market oversaturation, terrible quality control.

1633
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And at the time, video gaming really was kind of faddish, you know, and there was a big lull.

1634
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
They didn't realize that there was a cycle that you should upgrade it.

1635
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
There was no Angry Birds. All right, let's finish the email. Sorry.

1636
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
By the way, that would be there were no Angry Birds.

1637
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Actually, you were right. There was no because the game is singular.

1638
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Is that in the email?

1639
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Speaking of documentaries, I think you guys should check out Focus starring Mike Ross or I Got Next, which is free on Hulu.

1640
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
They're both about the fighting game community and tournaments.

1641
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Really recommend recommended if anyone is interested in seeing what the community is like.

1642
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I love the competitive gaming scene, but I don't have the time or motivation to get back into it.

1643
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Thanks for your time. I've been a podcast listener since 05. Love the show.

1644
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Wow. It's been a great inspiration for my own projects.

1645
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And you guys keep me awake during long, boring nights at work.

1646
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Shh, don't tell my boss. Keep up the greater than great work.

1647
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And that's from AJ Twist.

1648
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm just really sad that, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV never became part of the MLG scene because I could have fucking earned some money there.

1649
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Unfortunately, it's all call duty.

1650
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And I'm surprised this guy said we inspired him to do other projects, which is a great compliment.

1651
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And he refrained from plugging said projects. That's a great amount of restraint.

1652
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But, if you would like to, we're nice that way.

1653
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah, you can always tack them on.

1654
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
We support people.

1655
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And that's it.

1656
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That's it? One email?

1657
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I told you at the beginning of the show the only one.

1658
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I wasn't listening. One lousy email.

1659
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Jeez, Rob.

1660
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Mailbag at orangelandradi.com. Fill her up for next show.

1661
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
This is what happens when you tape mid-week.

1662
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
See, we'll get a bunch of emails on Sunday and then it'll be like, LOL didn't tape today.

1663
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week. This should be good.

1664
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

1665
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
This is fucked up.

1666
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Uh...

1667
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
You know, my FUs are really kind of, uh, personal this week.

1668
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
No, I don't want to say it to you. I'm over it.

1669
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Okay, fine. Fuck you for not buying me an iPad.

1670
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Or the hard drive I needed.

1671
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'd like to go ahead and accept the responsibility for this fuck you.

1672
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Not really so much because I upgraded my graphics card and didn't buy her anything.

1673
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Because, you know, she's a little miss grabby.

1674
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
But I have been really fucking with her all night on the show tonight.

1675
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It's been awesome.

1676
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I think you should bite my ass.

1677
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Loki?

1678
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Uh, I had something I was angry about earlier.

1679
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
But, you know, just after eating delicious teriyaki, it's just hard to be angry about anything.

1680
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So, I guess, uh, I guess that'd be the fact that I'm tired just because I've been seeing up until midnight playing Borderlands 2 every night.

1681
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Well, Minecraft, actually, with a knife.

1682
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:04,000
But I'm tired and wish I could take a day off to, like, sleep and play more Minecraft.

1683
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
May do that.

1684
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And...

1685
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I may or may not be taking Tuesday off to play World of Warcraft all day.

1686
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And, and FU too.

1687
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:20,000
To the fact that I probably am not going to be able to convince the wife to allow me to purchase a $1200 DDR machine that's in Modesto.

1688
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Because I really want it.

1689
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I've wanted one for years now.

1690
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Wife will be pissed.

1691
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Shut up!

1692
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Dan and Loki have very different outlooks.

1693
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
You should buy it. And I'll tell you why.

1694
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Number one, man, you having a DDR machine would be awesome.

1695
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Number two, she'll get over it. I mean, really.

1696
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And number three, awesome.

1697
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
This is coming from the guy who has...

1698
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I was going to talk to her last night, but she was really cranky yesterday.

1699
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
This is coming from the guy who has five pinball machines.

1700
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I only have three pinball machines. The other two are loners.

1701
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
My bad.

1702
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I thought we should have bought that Solo that was for sale for like 800 bucks, but Jamie said no Solo.

1703
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's still for sale.

1704
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
No, I didn't say no.

1705
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I thought we should have bought that Planet Harriers that was only $600, but Jamie said no.

1706
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No, you said no, you ass.

1707
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
You said we don't have room for it. Stop lying.

1708
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I thought we should have bought that Daytona USA dual that I saw for like 250 bucks.

1709
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Give me it.

1710
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
But she said no.

1711
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Give me the damn mic.

1712
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You're going to break it.

1713
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
You're breaking it. Let go.

1714
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I did the fact that I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack to buy a new mic.

1715
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Can I continue?

1716
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
The good news is I get an employee discount.

1717
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I want to say F.U.

1718
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I want to say F.U. to Apple.

1719
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Get the fuck off me.

1720
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I want to say F.U. to Apple for launching the new iPhone this weekend.

1721
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It's not really anything against Apple launching the new iPhone because that's fine,

1722
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
but I'd really, really rather be playing Borderlands all weekend,

1723
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
and now I can't because I've got to go and sell iPhones all weekend.

1724
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
This is about to get violent.

1725
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I looked on her shirt.

1726
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Can I do my F.U. please?

1727
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Can you finish? Can I finish?

1728
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Can I finish? Can I finish?

1729
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Dan is getting the mic again.

1730
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
My F.U. of the week just goes to being super busy and stressed.

1731
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I was so busy this week.

1732
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I think one day I had such low blood sugar I was about to pass out and faint.

1733
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Just between where, I mean cry me a river.

1734
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It's not like I don't volunteer for this shit,

1735
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
but I think I need to cool it in the future because I got too much going on.

1736
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So what do I do about it all?

1737
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Run out of town for four days.

1738
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Go to Disneyland.

1739
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That's the answer to everything.

1740
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
That does it for my F.U.s of the week.

1741
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
AlphaCanandagrams asked in chat,

1742
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Sky, do you still have that crappy mic that still cuts out?

1743
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
If so, Kickstarter.

1744
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yes, we have the crappy mic that cuts out.

1745
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And no Kickstarter.

1746
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
No Kickstarter.

1747
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
We actually, I do have money to get a new mic.

1748
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I need to get one.

1749
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
But the question is, do I want to get a mic-

1750
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
But Rob, you're Dutch.

1751
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
The question is, do I want to get a mic like this,

1752
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
or do I want to get like a super fancy condenser mic that's three digits in cost?

1753
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Kind of want the super fancy condenser mic for voiceovers.

1754
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I had one. I don't know what the fuck happened to that.

1755
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah, didn't we have one?

1756
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I had a condenser mic that at one time it was the ambient room mic

1757
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
because that shit picked up everything.

1758
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It broke.

1759
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Did it?

1760
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah, I think it broke.

1761
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It broke.

1762
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Eh, whatever.

1763
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Some of the Orange Lounge radios in the past,

1764
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I don't know if you remember the nights when we used to get so drunk.

1765
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
There was literally an episode of Orange Lounge Radio

1766
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
and it's like a double digit episode.

1767
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
That was one that I was asleep in your bed.

1768
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Jamie passes out in my bed.

1769
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I am kicking-

1770
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
No, I ate waffles in your bed.

1771
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I am kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the matrix.

1772
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I'm in the matrix.

1773
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
On the radio.

1774
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That was a great show.

1775
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
People were listening to this.

1776
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
That's how we win awards, man.

1777
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Huh?

1778
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
By the way, podcast award nominations should be coming soon, so, uh,

1779
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
you know, please consider us.

1780
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Here's- Okay.

1781
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
If we get nominated for a podcast award this year,

1782
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
here's the concessional, mate,

1783
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
if we can get nominated for a podcast award this year,

1784
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I will get drunk and likely kick the wall again.

1785
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That's the- that's the little promise I make to you.

1786
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
How's that sound?

1787
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Sounds fun.

1788
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And if we win,

1789
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
we'll get the cats drunk?

1790
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I don't know.

1791
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
No.

1792
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I don't know what else to add to that.

1793
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Alright.

1794
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Anyway.

1795
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Uh, okay.

1796
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So let's talk about stuff that we probably didn't really want,

1797
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
but they're gonna give us anyways.

1798
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Castlevania.

1799
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The movie.

1800
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's returning.

1801
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And, uh, how do we know it's returning?

1802
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Because Michael Dorn said so.

1803
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Michael Dorn, who played many things, including-

1804
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Mr. Worf is Dracula.

1805
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Yes, Mr. Worf.

1806
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
He is not Dracula.

1807
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
He is a werewolf.

1808
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And the joke I made earlier this week, were-warf.

1809
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But, cool.

1810
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And he says it's a fun little part.

1811
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's four days.

1812
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I'm playing a werewolf that's been around for a gajillion years.

1813
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
That's an actual term.

1814
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And, uh, who works for this vampire?

1815
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It's not too far from Worf because there's a lot of killing

1816
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
and jumping and sword fights and everything.

1817
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Basically, I guess he got involved because of Marina Sirtis,

1818
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
who, I don't know who she played.

1819
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Troy.

1820
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Troy, okay.

1821
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Well, and they were both also in the Mass Effect series,

1822
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
because he was one of the, um, other-

1823
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
No, he wasn't there.

1824
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
He was the guy with the green forehead that was hanging out with Rex.

1825
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm-

1826
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Reeve.

1827
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Yeah, not Reeve.

1828
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I kinda would want to see it because they're in it.

1829
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
You know what I mean?

1830
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Like, even if it was terrible, it would be like,

1831
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
hey, that's kinda cool.

1832
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Never trust a Klingon.

1833
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I trust a Klingon.

1834
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Captain Kirk said.

1835
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
As much as I'm like, alright, Castlevania movie, that's-

1836
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Let's just cast the rest of Castlevania with, like,

1837
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
old actors from, like, Next Generation and stuff.

1838
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Hey, I'm all about that, why not?

1839
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
We'll get, let's see, uh, we'll get Michael, uh, um-

1840
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
He was-

1841
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Let's get Bruce Campbell.

1842
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
He was Uvink.

1843
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
He wasn't Reeve, he was Uvink.

1844
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Let's get, like, classic-

1845
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Get Patrick Stewart as, uh, he can be Dracula.

1846
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Mm-hmm.

1847
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I mean, it's a weird casting, but sure.

1848
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Uh, we'll get, uh, Wil Wheaton.

1849
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
He can play, uh, you know, one of the-

1850
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
He can just be himself.

1851
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Wil Wheaton as, you know, badass vampire hunter.

1852
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah.

1853
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
To register participation for this week's episode of

1854
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1855
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
use the passphrase, quicksand.

1856
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's what I think of when I think of Wil Wheaton.

1857
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Alright, um, also, I need to say this comment from chat,

1858
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
because it's very important before I get to the last story here.

1859
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf has made an offer on the podcast awards.

1860
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
If you win, Bobby Blackwolf says,

1861
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I'll fly out and get drunk too.

1862
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Okay, remember, this is Bobby Blackwolf, host of the

1863
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
clean and family-friendly Bobby Blackwolf show,

1864
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
offering to come out here and get drunk with us.

1865
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That's awesome.

1866
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
All bets will be off.

1867
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
If that happens, we must win the award.

1868
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I'll bring my sleeping bag.

1869
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Seriously.

1870
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
If we win, marathon show.

1871
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Okay.

1872
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Alright, there you go.

1873
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Make it so.

1874
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Make it so.

1875
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Marathon show with drunk Bobby Blackwolf.

1876
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Make it so.

1877
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Dan has to come and drink too.

1878
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
We'll engage the listeners.

1879
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
We can set it up in the front room at our house.

1880
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
We will fix the warp core.

1881
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
The breach.

1882
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Alright.

1883
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Um, Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.

1884
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Do you even bother with Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade?

1885
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I don't right now, but the story's interesting.

1886
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Alright, update 1.8.2 for Minecraft on Xbox.

1887
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
We'll be adding the creative mode.

1888
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
There's gonna be new food, new monsters,

1889
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
and that means we're almost caught up to the PC version.

1890
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Eh, they're so ways off.

1891
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
They're adding the, like, random dungeon stuff,

1892
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
like the, you know, abandoned mine shafts,

1893
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
which I keep running into those in our game.

1894
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah, you have a lot of those in the vlog world.

1895
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Like, there's a lot.

1896
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And, um, also the villages.

1897
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Um, the, you know, villagers and endermen and all that stuff.

1898
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Now, do we have villagers in the vlog world?

1899
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I've been looking.

1900
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
There's just a lot of fucking ocean.

1901
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
That's all I've found.

1902
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Because, like I said, I went and I went into creative.

1903
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Atlantis. They're all underwater.

1904
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I went into creative and I flew around through the nether

1905
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
and I created a new portal because I couldn't remember

1906
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
where the hell the old portal was

1907
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
and I ended up in the middle of the ocean

1908
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
and I still don't know where the fuck I was.

1909
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
That's what I want to build is, like, an underwater lair.

1910
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Well, there's plenty of water.

1911
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That will not be a problem.

1912
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I mean, you can do that.

1913
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
All right.

1914
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Uh, also, okay, so they are, you know, doing, um,

1915
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
these updates to the Xbox version.

1916
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Now, they are talking about maybe doing some mods.

1917
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Maybe differentiating it a little bit from the PC version.

1918
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Now, the Xbox 360, according to 4J Studios,

1919
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
won't be able to have the mod system that gives

1920
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
such a variety of community additions to the game on PC,

1921
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
but we're looking at the elements of these

1922
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
that people seem to be enjoying the most

1923
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and deciding how we could tailor those elements

1924
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
into something for the Xbox.

1925
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
That'd be cool.

1926
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Xbox 360 players, they say it's because

1927
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
you're in a living room, you use a controller,

1928
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
so this is different the way you interact with the game.

1929
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I don't know that I play the controller on the PC version

1930
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and it's just fine.

1931
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
You're a freak.

1932
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
My coworker does, too, and he likes it.

1933
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
He has a little bit of getting used to it,

1934
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
but it's actually really easy to play with it

1935
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
and I love it.

1936
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It's great.

1937
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm looking forward to just whatever they're gonna do,

1938
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
you know, with Minecraft on the Xbox in the future.

1939
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I think it's great that despite the fact that

1940
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
they've already sold millions and millions of copies of it,

1941
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
they're not gonna stop updating it.

1942
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Like, that's, you know, I think a lot of people

1943
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
would just take the money and run,

1944
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
but they're still supporting it to sell even more copies.

1945
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I think that's great.

1946
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So, just throwing that out there.

1947
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Thank you, Rob.

1948
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

1949
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
What?

1950
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Take the money and run.

1951
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
You're welcome.

1952
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
All right, I'm gonna open up the Skype line right now.

1953
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1954
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
The 877 number doesn't work tonight

1955
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
because somebody forgot to pay the bill,

1956
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
but I don't want to pay the bill tonight.

1957
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Why would I pay the bill tonight

1958
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
when I'm not gonna use it tonight?

1959
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So, we'll have the 800 number back next week,

1960
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
but for now you can call us OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype,

1961
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
all one word.

1962
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
While we wait for any call,

1963
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I mean, we have way less listeners than usual tonight,

1964
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
obviously, because you guys had no warning this was happening,

1965
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
but while I wait to see if anybody is gonna call,

1966
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
do we have last minute stories?

1967
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I do have Twitter topics, but...

1968
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Slender's getting a sequel,

1969
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
so that creepy game on PC is getting a brand new sequel.

1970
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
They have a teaser up for it,

1971
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
and it's supposed to have better graphics.

1972
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Looks neat.

1973
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Also, there's a picture I saw of the new CirclePad Pro

1974
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
for the 3DS XL.

1975
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Talking about something that's bigger than the iPhone 5.

1976
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Man, that thing is fucking massive.

1977
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Is it like original Xbox controller big?

1978
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I think bigger.

1979
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It's seriously massive.

1980
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I just...

1981
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It looks stupid.

1982
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I mean, it seriously looks dumb that they have that.

1983
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It's like, come on, man.

1984
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
You had this 3DS system that you could...

1985
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
There's a spot that you could have put another CirclePad there,

1986
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
but no, you just had to go and say,

1987
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
eh, we're gonna add another attachment that no one fucking needs.

1988
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That's fantastic.

1989
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Let me go to some Twitter topics real quick

1990
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
while we wait and see if we get any calls.

1991
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1992
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I did not know about this.

1993
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
This is something that Tigerclaw sent,

1994
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
because Tigerclaw always sends the tweets, even if it's Thursday.

1995
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
And this actually makes me really sad.

1996
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
This is news to me. I did not hear about this.

1997
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi and the games he's created.

1998
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Rez and Meteos and, you know, Luminous.

1999
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
He's made all these great games.

2000
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
He's apparently moving away from game production.

2001
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
He's gonna be doing more of a delegatory role in Q Entertainment.

2002
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
More playgrounds.

2003
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
What's that?

2004
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
He's making playgrounds, too.

2005
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I guess. I don't know.

2006
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Since finishing Child of Eden, apparently he's doing more academic work.

2007
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
They're saying he's more of a spokesperson.

2008
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
He's not developing stuff right now.

2009
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Well, why not? That makes me sad.

2010
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
There's been some other people that have left Q Entertainment.

2011
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:16,000
James Milke, I guess, was somebody that produced Luminous Electronic Symphony,

2012
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
and now he's with Q Games in Kyoto.

2013
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Very different.

2014
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So, huh.

2015
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Well, that's sad.

2016
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I hope Q Entertainment is able to make more of the music and puzzle

2017
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
and those kind of really innovative types of games like Rez and stuff,

2018
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and maybe less of the 99 Nights.

2019
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You know, I haven't played much of Luminous.

2020
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's great!

2021
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Alright, one more Twitter topic I have also from Tigerclaw.

2022
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
You the man.

2023
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Apparently some layoffs at Sony Public Relations.

2024
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I'll get to that in a minute, though, because we have a call coming in.

2025
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I don't want to miss it.

2026
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2027
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
What's up, guys? It's Codeman.

2028
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Codeman! What's on your mind, buddy?

2029
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Oh, not much.

2030
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Just got back on last Saturday from Gearbox Community Day.

2031
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I wanted to tell you guys about it.

2032
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yes, and thank you in advance for that stuff you got at the event.

2033
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
You rock.

2034
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Oh, no problem, guys.

2035
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I wanted to get you guys something because you guys deserve everything in the world

2036
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
for putting on this show every Sunday.

2037
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Flattery will get you everywhere.

2038
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I know. That's why I do it.

2039
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So, no, it was actually an amazing event.

2040
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Obviously, as everybody knows, Gearbox is a fantastic developer

2041
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
with their games and their fan service.

2042
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Their fan service is just ridiculous.

2043
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I was talking to devs just all day.

2044
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I talked to Randy Pitchford.

2045
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
It was crazy how much these guys

2046
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
just want to interact with their fans, and it was amazing.

2047
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
How did this event work? What was it?

2048
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Was it just a big showroom for Borderlands 2?

2049
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Was it Q&A panels? Was it more like a convention?

2050
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
How was this all set up?

2051
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Pretty much everything you just said.

2052
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
There were Q&A panels.

2053
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
They had a panel specifically for Borderlands 2,

2054
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
and then they had a panel for Aliens Colonial Marines,

2055
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
which they really didn't say a whole lot about it

2056
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
because I guess it's supposed to be out in 2013.

2057
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
But they had a room for Colonial Marines,

2058
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
which they only had two game types.

2059
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
They had a team deathmatch game type, which was actually quite fun.

2060
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You can actually play as humans against aliens,

2061
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
which was actually kind of neat.

2062
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And then they had an escape game type,

2063
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
which I guess it was just you were basically trying to escape this area

2064
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
where there was a whole bunch of aliens attacking you.

2065
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But, yeah, it was just a big event

2066
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
that just had all kinds of different stuff.

2067
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You get to talk to everyone. It was amazing.

2068
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
No Duke Nukem Forever presence?

2069
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
No, they had his chair there.

2070
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
But, no, there were no Duke Nukem anywhere.

2071
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I don't even think they even mentioned it, really.

2072
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
What a shock. What a shock.

2073
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I know, right?

2074
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So how are you enjoying Borderlands 2?

2075
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I seem to recall you're a bit of a Borderlands fan.

2076
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Oh, yeah. Well, I actually picked it up on launch day, of course.

2077
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I guess like every crazy person that loves Borderlands 2.

2078
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And I only have gotten to play it once.

2079
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I'm actually a dad, so I really get to play a whole lot of video games.

2080
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But when I do, I get to sit down for long periods of time and play them.

2081
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
But, no, I'm really enjoying it.

2082
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I have figured out, and, look, you probably know this,

2083
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
because you've been playing it a lot, too,

2084
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
and it actually has gotten a little harder.

2085
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I mean, the AI dodges your bullets now.

2086
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I mean, they're all over the place with the enemies.

2087
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So, I mean, it's pretty crazy.

2088
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
This is why I need BFF mode.

2089
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I know, right?

2090
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I'm still working on the first one, slowly.

2091
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I think I got to level 10, not that long ago.

2092
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
So I'm still working on it.

2093
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I do want to say they did kind of dance around the whole girlfriend mode thing in the panel.

2094
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
One of the guys said something, and then Randy was like,

2095
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
why don't you tell us about that?

2096
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And he's like, why don't you go fuck yourself?

2097
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
That was pretty funny.

2098
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I can plug Bobby Blackwell's show from this two weeks ago at this point now,

2099
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
and not last week but the week before.

2100
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
He had those guys on the show, and they talked openly about it.

2101
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
No go-fucking-yourself involved.

2102
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Oh, no, it was actually pretty funny,

2103
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
because it was just the panel that were talking back and forth.

2104
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I mean, he was talking to another dev that was talking to him,

2105
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
and I guess they've been giving him a whole lot of crap about this whole thing that got released

2106
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
and how the media just took it and ran with it.

2107
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And so I guess around the office they've just been giving him all kinds of crap,

2108
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
and they were just joking about it.

2109
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And Randy made a statement about it, how they're not discriminatory towards anybody in the whole entire world.

2110
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And he said people that discriminate towards other people just need to basically go die in a fire

2111
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
and all this stuff.

2112
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:15,000
It was crazy, because he really wanted to get out there that their company is just...

2113
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I mean, he was basically whoring their company out, just because it's a good company.

2114
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And I wouldn't say another company is bad, but this company is just so amazing.

2115
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I can't say...

2116
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And them actually being an independent company and not answering to anybody else,

2117
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I mean, that's just fantastic.

2118
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
It's pretty cool that they do something like this,

2119
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
because not every gaming company does something directly for the fans.

2120
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And, I mean, where was this at?

2121
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
It was in Texas somewhere? Where was this?

2122
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
It was in Dallas, Texas, at the Palladium Theater.

2123
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Well, I guess Dallas is still a pretty big city, all things considered.

2124
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
But usually these types of things only happen in the Bay Area or LA or New York,

2125
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
one of the big, big cities.

2126
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
You don't often hear about these events in the Midwest, so that's really cool.

2127
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
That and QuakeCon are the ones I can think of that are out there, so that's great.

2128
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
QuakeCon just happened before we got there, Community Day.

2129
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So, I mean, I saw a whole bunch of people wearing QuakeCon shirts and all kinds of stuff.

2130
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
So, I mean, it was a pretty big deal.

2131
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I mean, I think they estimated about probably around 700 people at this thing.

2132
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
So, I mean, it was a pretty big, big deal.

2133
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
But, I mean, we actually got to jump in line because we paid for tickets.

2134
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
They had free general admission, but we paid for tickets, me and my friend,

2135
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and so we got to jump in line a little bit and get in there quicker.

2136
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
But, yeah, I did play Borderlands on the PC, which really spoiled me

2137
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
because I was on the Xbox when I got it on Tuesday, and I was just like,

2138
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
oh, these graphics are horrible.

2139
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yeah, and the getting used to the controls when you can have such precision with a keyboard and mouse,

2140
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
that's a little bit rough.

2141
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
True, true. And then I also wanted to, and then I'll let you guys go,

2142
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:09,000
but I also wanted to say I actually, it's funny you mentioned the tester earlier in the show.

2143
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I actually grew up, I don't know if you guys, one of the panel, Brent Gokey,

2144
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I actually grew up with him.

2145
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
He lived down the street from me when I was a little kid.

2146
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:28,000
He actually mentioned that it is not on the table right now for tester for,

2147
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
but he said it could pop up in the future.

2148
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:39,000
They got tons of money and just stuff to support this show,

2149
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
and the turnout for people that watched it was amazing.

2150
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
He just said they got so many other things on the drawing board right now

2151
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
that they just can't worry about that.

2152
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm hoping that means maybe some more original programming.

2153
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I've said this before on the show, as much as we love to make fun of the tester,

2154
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
it actually wasn't terrible for what it was.

2155
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
True, true.

2156
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I mean, yes, the setup might have been a little bit hokey like,

2157
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
oh, you get to be a game tester, but by season three,

2158
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
they made it a little better where you were at least a little more involved,

2159
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
like what was it, you were an associate producer or something.

2160
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And most of the people who won the show,

2161
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
the gay guy that won the show in season two,

2162
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
he only did that for like six months,

2163
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
and now he works for Sony Pictures Entertainment.

2164
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
And I think the guy who won the first season

2165
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
ended up in some type of promotional position too.

2166
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I don't know about this guy that won the most recent season,

2167
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
but for what it is, they are working their way up in the company

2168
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
and apparently ending up pretty successful, so that's kind of neat.

2169
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I was disappointed that Dark Soccer didn't get on there.

2170
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
We all were.

2171
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I kind of just gave up on it.

2172
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
We all were, but we had Asuka,

2173
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
who apparently was a friend of an OLR listener,

2174
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
ended up calling into OLR one night.

2175
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
You have to go back in the archives to find her,

2176
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
but she called in and it ended up being like the day before she got,

2177
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
you know, voted off the island or whatever it is.

2178
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I heard that, I heard that show, I remember that show,

2179
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and it was very, I was very distraught because I kind of liked her.

2180
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Yeah, I know.

2181
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And when she got kicked off, I was like,

2182
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
aw man, she just had an amazing interview with Orange Lounge Radio

2183
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and now she got kicked off.

2184
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I had no idea that that was going to happen,

2185
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
and yes, it was just kind of, I was like,

2186
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
of course, of course, she was just on the show,

2187
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
and yeah, Kiss of Death or whatever,

2188
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
but that's, what a funny small world.

2189
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Yeah, that guy's like the Simon Cowell of the show,

2190
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and so that's kind of funny that you grew up with him.

2191
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
That's pretty crazy.

2192
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
What a small world.

2193
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I told you, we're like D-list video game celebs now.

2194
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Now we've got ties to two,

2195
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
now we have ties not only to tester contestants,

2196
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
but apparently the tester panel.

2197
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I'm this close to Adrian Curry, this close.

2198
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
All right.

2199
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Anyhow, we should probably let you go, dude.

2200
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Okay, man, well, I appreciate you taking my call,

2201
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and enjoy the poster, man.

2202
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I actually, I should have got them to write on their OLR,

2203
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
but I was like, it was just so fast and crazy

2204
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
that, you know, but yeah, everybody's on there,

2205
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
from the dev team to Randy Pitchford

2206
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,000
to the guardian angel who plays

2207
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
the guardian angel in Borderlands,

2208
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
she's on there, the girl who plays the siren

2209
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
in the second game is on there,

2210
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
like everybody's on there, so enjoy it.

2211
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Hey, we have a saying, beggars can't be choosers,

2212
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
so thank you very much,

2213
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
and maybe we'll get them on the show next time.

2214
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
That would be great.

2215
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Bobby got it this time,

2216
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
but maybe for Borderlands 3, we'll see.

2217
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
All right, take care, buddy.

2218
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Thank you very much, and keep doing what you're doing.

2219
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
We will.

2220
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Not slowing down anytime soon.

2221
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Bye.

2222
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
All right, we'll see you.

2223
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
All right.

2224
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I like talking to him.

2225
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
He's fun.

2226
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
He's full of energy, too.

2227
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
He's really happy, genuinely.

2228
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Quite so.

2229
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
What's up?

2230
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
The Midway Arcade Origins Collection

2231
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
does have super off-road.

2232
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Ooh, and where'd you hear that?

2233
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
They have the full list, actually.

2234
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Nice.

2235
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's 720 APB arch rivals, bubbles,

2236
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Championship Sprint, Tournament Cyberball 2072,

2237
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Defender, Defender 2, Gauntlet, Gauntlet 2,

2238
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Joust, Joust 2, Marble Madness, Pit Fighter,

2239
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Rampage, Rampart, Robotron 2084,

2240
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Rootbeard, Tapper, Satan's Hollow,

2241
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Cinestar, Smash TV, Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter 2,

2242
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Super Off-Road, Super Sprint,

2243
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Toobin, Total Carnage, Vindicators Part 2,

2244
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Wizards of War, Xenophobe, and Zybots.

2245
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
That's kind of the greatest hits of the three

2246
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
that were already out.

2247
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't think there's any of those.

2248
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I didn't think Marble Madness was in one of the other collections.

2249
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
And $29.99.

2250
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Huh.

2251
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's just, it's a bummer it's not online.

2252
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Or that they couldn't add something else to Sweet in the Pot.

2253
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Shitty.

2254
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Alright, back to the tweet I was on before the phone call came in.

2255
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Unfortunately, talking Sony and talking people moving up in Sony,

2256
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
unfortunately, some people moving out.

2257
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
There was reorganization that affected some PR people.

2258
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Hopefully not people I was just talking about.

2259
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
That's kind of too bad.

2260
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
All employees are now apparently in the Foster City headquarters,

2261
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
but there's no impact on game development.

2262
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So like Sony, Santa Monica, and all that's fine.

2263
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Apparently this is in an article I've been linked to on GameSpot.

2264
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,000
There was a re-org and some PR people were in San Diego were let go.

2265
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Which, funny enough, I think was the studio where all that tester stuff happened.

2266
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Which might explain a little bit about, oh that's really sad.

2267
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
That's too bad.

2268
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
But it's all in Foster City.

2269
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
So hopefully some people got relocated at least maybe.

2270
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
But, bummer bummer.

2271
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
This follows a closing of Zipper Interactive, which had happened back in March.

2272
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
They made SoCom and MAG.

2273
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And in April they said they were going to cut 10,000 jobs, but that was Sony-wide.

2274
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Wipeout developer studio Liverpool also had been closed this year.

2275
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So a bunch of bummer news from Sony.

2276
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
We hope they're able to land on their feet soon.

2277
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
And maybe they'll sell some VITAs so they can hire them back.

2278
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get into tonight?

2279
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Or Dark Soccer if you have any.

2280
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
No.

2281
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Castle of Crashers is coming to the Steam next week.

2282
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Nice.

2283
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
26.

2284
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Only took what, four years?

2285
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Nice.

2286
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
There's a Half-Life 3 rumor that it's open world and coming in 2013.

2287
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Oh my.

2288
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It's from an anonymous source too.

2289
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I think that's true.

2290
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Extremely trustworthy.

2291
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Extremely.

2292
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And I guess there's also an article I just read about publishers apparently trying to exploit Kickstarter.

2293
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Basically getting, this is actually coming from the last one.

2294
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It was Obsidian.

2295
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Now they have their Kickstarter.

2296
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
They said, we were actually contacted by some publishers over the last few months that wanted us to do a Kickstarter.

2297
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I said to them, so you want us to do a Kickstarter for using our name.

2298
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
We then get Kickstarter money to make a game.

2299
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Then you publish the game, but we don't get to keep the brand we make.

2300
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
We only get a portion of the profits.

2301
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And they said yes.

2302
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Wow.

2303
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
To which he said, fuck off.

2304
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
No surprise.

2305
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Anything else? That's it.

2306
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Well that brings us to the end of the show.

2307
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but that's what happens when we tape on a Sunday that we're not used to.

2308
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
But before we close out tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2309
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Before I get into that, I do want to thank everybody for listening and for being here this week.

2310
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
We will be back in our normal time slot live on Sunday night on the 30th with episode number 475.

2311
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
We are talking behind the scenes about some possible changes in the future Orange Launch Radio.

2312
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Nothing major.

2313
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I just wanted to leave you that little sampling to go with.

2314
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So that could be in the coming weeks.

2315
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Certainly before episode 500.

2316
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

2317
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Spread the word.

2318
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Leave us a nice review on iTunes.

2319
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Especially now that podcasting is in a separate application in the iOS 6.

2320
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
We can use all the word of mouth we can get.

2321
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Also there's some great third party apps like Stitcher that you can listen to Orange Launch Radio in.

2322
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And it looks like, looking at the stats on Stitcher, more and more of you are.

2323
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So we really appreciate that.

2324
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And if you've enjoyed our show on Stitcher, please consider sharing it with your friends.

2325
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And leaving some good comments on there too.

2326
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
You know, word of mouth is all we got right now.

2327
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And it's all we've had over the past 10 years.

2328
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Dan the man, thank you very much for being on the show tonight and fighting with your wife.

2329
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Always a good time to have that going on on air.

2330
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I like turtles.

2331
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Is that your final thought tonight? Do you have a final thought tonight, Dan?

2332
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
He's shaking his head. I guess it's I like turtles.

2333
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Alright, Dark Sakura.

2334
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I want dinner.

2335
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
You want dinner.

2336
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And I didn't make a fortune cookie.

2337
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
What do you want from Disneyland?

2338
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Stuff. You got it.

2339
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Duffy. Stuff. I guess.

2340
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Loki. Your final thought tonight?

2341
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I guess I'll play some more Minecraft.

2342
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
My final thought tonight is, don't hate me because I went to Disneyland.

2343
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It's the last trip for at least a year.

2344
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So, womp womp. Sadness.

2345
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
It's okay, I'm going in two weeks.

2346
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Alright, that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody.

2347
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We'll see you next time at Orange Launch Radio.

2348
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Thanks for listening to this slightly shorter edition.

2349
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
We'll see you next week for a full show. Good night.

2350
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Orange Launch Radio or FOG Network.

2351
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But you know they were all still true.

2352
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
See you next week.

2353
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Thanks for watching!
