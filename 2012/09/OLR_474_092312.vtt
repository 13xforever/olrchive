00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:27.000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie and Loki

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, kind of a special edition tonight.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Although they're all a little bit special, particularly tonight's episode if you're here on this special Thursday.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
In the head.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff over the next few hours with my co-host.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hi.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
How are you DarkSakura?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Educated.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Educated, edumacated. What did you learn today?

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
I learned that certain parties at my school have no concept of art.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
Oh, that's unfortunate. Are you talking about like political parties? Are you talking about like sock hop?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I refrain from comment.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
That and I hate this time of year because of all of the, do you want to, we want to talk to you about how you don't want to vote for this guy.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, especially at college campuses, my lord.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
No, on my cell phone.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, good times.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hi.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Loki, what should I vote for in November?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Your mom.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Pornography.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Vote for your mom. I'd vote for your mom.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
My mom's pretty awesome.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Cause your mom would just go, I can't believe you're all doing that. That's awful.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Rob, why, Rob, as president, I'm gonna ban that show, Rob.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You need to save your money.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
It's only taken ten years before I finally started getting the porn spam in the old mailbox.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Only.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Only ten years. That is slow for internet. I mean it should be like five seconds.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Alright, well also joining us somewhat in studio tonight, say hello to Dan the Man is back.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Yes, I am.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
How are you doing? Dan the Man?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Not average.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Good to hear.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, he's just average.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
He's just, you know, he's alright.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Dan's my means to an end tonight.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
Alright, so if you missed the memo during last week's show, and how dare you not listen to last week's show, but hey, at least you're listening tonight, so I forgive you, here's what's going on.

02:41.000 --> 02:51.000
We're taping a little bit earlier in the week. It's a Thursday night right now, and we are live at vognetwork.com, so if you're hearing like, usually I hear music on Thursday nights, why is there a show?

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
We're here, we're doing this special thing. It will rebroadcast on Sunday night in our normal time slot, and then the podcast folks will get it about the time they usually get a podcast.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
So if you're a podcast listener, you're like, oh, nothing's different except this week's a little bit shorter.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Well, because we are taping on an off night for us, so we got a little bit of a later start, and we'll have to get a little bit of an earlier finish.

03:10.000 --> 03:19.000
Anyhow, though, still lots of stuff going on in the gaming world, but just the disclaimer at the top, the news is delayed a couple days here.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
So there may be some things that have changed between Thursday, the day we tape, and Sunday night, Monday morning, the day the podcast goes out.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
So just putting that disclaimer out there. Unless you're live at VOG Network right now on Thursday, in that case, I guess it's all current, as current as can be.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
So if you do happen to be here live, I urge you guys to come in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and join us there.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
The Skype line will be open later, only the Skype line tonight, not the 800 number. That will be open a little bit later on.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
First off, Tokyo Game Show, without getting into the news about it too much, Tokyo Game Show's going on.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
Loki, you and I were talking a little bit before the show about some of the more surprising things that are not at Tokyo Game Show right now.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
So the not news. What's not news this week?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Dead Rising 3.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, what's up with that? Because we had some pretty juicy rumors on that a couple months ago about the story.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
I think it's going to be Dead Rising 3, to be honest. I think they just weren't ready yet.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
It was probably one of those, oh hey, we're going to show this, but then they're like, well, you know what?

04:19.000 --> 04:28.000
We still have a couple games in the pipeline that aren't even out yet, like Devil May Cry and Resident Evil, so let's not put Dead Rising 3 out there yet.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Because they don't probably have anything to show for it yet.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
But next E3, I bet they will.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
An E3 seems like the smarter time to, you know, well, I shouldn't say that, because certainly a lot of big stuff can debut at Tokyo Game Show.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
But maybe, isn't Dead Rising...

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
They also have Captivate, what they do.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Dead Rising a little bit more of a probably game that sells here in the States than it does over in Japan?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I think so.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, well that makes sense.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Let's see, what else is in it at Tokyo Game Show? There was something I was thinking of.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Oh, Square, I know they've got some things going on, but I haven't heard a lot coming out about the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't know if that's still coming, or what's going on.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
They should shoot something. They had, I think, a new trailer or something.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Did they? I know there's big Square news we'll get to later, but still no versus either, right?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
No, I'm not surprised.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
No Last Guardian, other than, yep, we're still working on it.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
It's happening. It hasn't disappeared yet.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Alright, well we will get into all the news that's going on.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
The Last Guardian is versus 13. Rumor!

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Do you guys have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point in your life?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I just want to go to Tokyo.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
You just want to go to Tokyo?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, and if I happen to be at the game show, then nice.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
You could always plan to be there about that time.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
To be honest, I'd rather go to Kyoto.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I'd rather go to Rockstar New York.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
You want to go to Rockstar?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Dan wants to go to Tokyo because he wants to go to Akihabara.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
That would be fun.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
So he can buy Turbo Graphics games.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Who wouldn't want to buy Turbo Graphics games? Sounds like fun.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
People who don't have Turbo Graphics.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Some folks in the chat, we do have a live chat room.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
It's a small turnout tonight because we didn't really announce this

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
because we didn't know exactly what time we'd be up and everything,

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
so we really have the VOG loyalists at the Voice of Geeks Network in chat tonight.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And ShadowNextGen says,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Sony's Tokyo Game Show press conference was horrible,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
but follows up with, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show at least once.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I'd like to go at least once, but it's really crowded from what I hear.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
That and Gamescom are both really crowded shows

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
because they are open to the public, and I bet it's just kind of a mess.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
You probably have to wait in Disneyland-style rides

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
to play anything out there on the floor.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
E3 was bad enough there for a while,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
especially before the big slim down back in 2006.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Loki, do you have any desire to go to Tokyo Game Show at some point?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Nope.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Why not?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Don't speak the language.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
That would be difficult with the whole language barrier,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
but does that mean you don't want to go to Gamescom either

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
because that's in Germany?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's still Europe.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Strudel.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It's still Europe, so they have some English speaking.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
The only thing I'd really want to go see at Tokyo Game Show

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
is D3's awesome booth.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
We did a whole recreation of Earth Defense Force and LEGO.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
They've been teasing it on their Facebook.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Of course. That's what you want to see.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
They've been teasing it on their Facebook.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm like, why the fuck are they making LEGO characters?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
It's kind of cool that they're doing the tank and the bugs and stuff like that in LEGO,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
but why are they doing that?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It all makes sense now. It's this giant recreation.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
That won't be there next year, though, unless you get lucky

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
and there's an Earth Defense Force 5.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
You know, technically,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
I mean, if I wanted to import it, next week is Earth Defense Force 3 Portable.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You thought about it?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
For the Vita.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
You thought about it?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
In Japan.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Is the Vita region free? I thought it wasn't.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh, I thought it wasn't for some reason.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
The digital marketplaces are, but...

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Ah.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
No, the 3DS is not.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Right, right.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
What?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, so I can't get that awesome game unless I have an import.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Wow, that is the stupidest thing Nintendo's ever done.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I need a Japanese DS.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You didn't know the 3DS was region-locked?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
After all this, how long has 3DS been out?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
How many 3DSs do you see me owning?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I looked at the hardware and was like,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
oh, it's the DS again.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Oh, and it's got blurry 3D.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, and they've got absolutely no games I'm interested in.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Okay, yeah, I'll live.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I want that project cross whatever it's called.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Here's the reason why you need a 3DS, okay?

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
You take 3D pictures of cats and send them to your friends via SwapNote.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Can the Vita do that? I don't think so.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Is the power of three-dimensional cats in the PlayStation 3?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Maybe, but they're not unleashing it.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The 3DS is where 3D cat pics are at, sir.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Technically, I think if you have a 3D TV, I think you can view 3D photos.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
You shut up!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I could give half a fuck.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Because I know...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
But I'm keeping my half a fuck for when I need it.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Because I think there are some Sony cameras that do shoot in 3D.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I guess that is true.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Stop making points, asshole!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How dare you prove me wrong?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't know if I'm just speculating.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, okay.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
But you see, I've got that aura about anything I say to people.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, that's plausible. I'm gonna go with that.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
If I look at the comments for last week's show on vognetwork.com,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
apparently you are now right.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I even had to butt in and say,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Hold on, guys. Hold on. Slow down.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Loki's not right all the time. Don't let his ego get too big.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
But apparently, Loki is like Miss Cleo now.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
He knows everything.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
So, kind of on a tangent here, but it's sort of...

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
I just started, out of curiosity, because I saw someone retweet him.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I started following Michael Pachter on Twitter.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
And, you know, he makes comments about things.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Some of his comments I just have...

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Famous games analyst, right? The one that all the news stations call.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
He's a game analyst. I don't like him because he's a game analyst.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And he does the same thing I do, except he gets paid, like, six figures or something like that.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Games analyst.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But anyways, so he's like...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And it didn't make any sense to me.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
He's basically talking about how he thinks the Wii U is gonna do roughly about 50% of the units that the Wii did at launch.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
But it's gonna have a good launch because it's already established.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
You've got the hardcore gamers that are gonna buy into it.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And also because of the lack of units out there.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm like, how the fuck does a shortage on the system mean it's gonna sell better?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Ask the Wii. It worked.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
It'll sell out because we've only put ten units out there.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Because it's what's gonna make the headlines on the local news.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Local news is stupid, okay.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
Crazy motherfuckers lining up to get a Wii U at Kmart, selling them on eBay for six figures, all that stuff.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Except, here's the problem.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Nintendo plays that game, too.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Nintendo always does the shit where it's like, oh, there's like ten of them out there.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
The only system that I don't think they really did that with was the 3DS, and look how that turned out.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, but here's the thing.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
So you know that those things are going to be fucking impossible to find.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Just because they're gonna be hoping that the hype machine takes over.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, but the problem is the hype machine also didn't have to compete against the whole presidential campaign that's going on around the same time.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That's gonna eat out of headlines.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna put this out there.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I think that they're probably not looking for the same demographic as paying attention to the presidential campaign.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Sad but true point.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
The Wii U is for, what's the word I'm looking for?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh yeah, grade schoolers.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
The presidential campaign is being run by grade schoolers.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
The Wii U is meant for people that already own the Wii, but yet want another system that plays the same shit.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
But nobody wants another system that plays the Wii.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That would be people that own the DS that bought the 3DS.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's very clear that 47-

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
He's not allowed to talk anymore.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
It's very clear that 47% of Americans don't care about the Wii U.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
More like 7 to 4.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Yes, that's gonna be every show until the Wii launches, and then some.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
On Bobby's last show, and this is all I hear.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
It means playing together with our friends and family.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
We as in multiple people.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Sexy party as in sexy party.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
It looks fucking awesome and you're gonna have a party because it's sexy graphics all up on your fucking walls.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Dark Sakura.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I played WoW.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I have a tune at 84.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And I've been playing Mass Effect 3, which I beat again.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Again.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Again.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Again.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Good times.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I love the comment from Black Wolf in our chat room right now.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Hey, sexy party.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's not too late to get-

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
We'll buy Xbox style.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You make him the fucking spokesman.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
That shit will sell.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Whoever can get that guy to sell their-

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That shit will sell.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Whoever can get that guy to do the dance for the console will sell.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Nintendo, you wanna turn this shit around?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
You know like, hey, you know, Wii would like to play?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
It's fucking inside, it comes up to your door and it just fucking breaks it.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Busts it out.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't even know what this commercial is for but I'm gonna buy it.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I think Nintendo had something to do with it but-

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
That is quite possibly the worst thing you've ever said.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Reggie's gonna hear this.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Right.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Reggie's gonna hear this and then he's gonna be like, we're gonna do that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And now the Wii's gonna be a big hit.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Good job.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm telling you man, you put that song, you put that guy in there, anything will sell.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I got some Peekman up in here.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It's another Mario game.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Hey.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Get a touch pad.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Alright, stop it now before this comes up funny.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Too late.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
You shut up.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Alright.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh yes, gaming weeks, where were we?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Jamie beat Mass Effect 3 again and somehow that led to Gangnam Style.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Low key.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I played three things this week.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
A little bit of multiplayer there.

15:49.000 --> 15:58.000
I played Borderlands 2 which is awesome because I only touched it for about like two hours on Sunday.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
So finally got a little bit more game time in this week and I have to say it's a lot different.

16:04.000 --> 16:11.000
Well, not a lot different from Borderlands but there's definitely more of a story in the game and the humor is hilarious.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
Just listening to Handsome Jack go on about Butt Stallion, his diamond horse is hilarious.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Or writing in the Claptrap who gives you a quest to go find his secret loot stash.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
He needs you to pick up a few rocks and then a little checkpoint thing comes up.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Find 133,000 rocks.

16:35.000 --> 16:46.000
Or you must bring me the staff of the Destroyer of Worlds and then you must do a dance for me.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's hilarious.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm really digging that game.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Then also I played a bit of Minecraft.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Still playing on the VoG network server.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Probably going to flip it over to creative mode in October here.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Can't wait.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
May do it sooner. Maybe next week even.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
Just so people can actually build some stuff without getting raped by Endermen.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
And then finally played Bungie Ferret Tossing.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
When I first played it I was actually ranked 4th for normal mode but I'm sure since I've only played it once I'm probably off.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Is that on the website?

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I forgot to... I didn't have my phone with me so I didn't get the copy.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know if you can look up your old codes.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
The one you see on the Xbox is local.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
So if you're 4th you're only 4th on your local warts.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
You gotta do the online one.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You sure? Because I thought it was with friends too.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Is it?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I think it's friends on there.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I don't know. I thought...

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Maybe. I don't know.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I thought you can't do that on Xbox Live.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
But then again I think one of the other indie games I seem to remember in the past did something like that.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
So maybe. I don't know.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Maybe. I don't know.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
But if there's a way to look up that code again or I'll just do it next time.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
We'll play it one more time and see where we get.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Bobby says he's waiting for creative mode to come build something.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
He's scared of the creepers.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
I'll flip it over tomorrow.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Good times.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
That's it.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
My gaming week?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Sadly not a lot.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I also play Bungie Paratossing which we've talked about during the show.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And right now I'm number one on the Internet Leaderboard.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Or at least I was the other day.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I haven't checked in like 48 hours.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
So maybe I've been dethroned.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
I don't know.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
But it's super adorable, cute.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I mean is it like gonna blow your mind?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Like is it the second coming of Mass Effect?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Or is it the next World of Warcraft?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
No it's not.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
There better be a second coming of Mass Effect.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Well actually we'll get into that later.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
It's funny you bring that up.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
But it's a dollar.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And for a dollar it's a great value.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Very 80's retro arcade vibe.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And kind of like it feels familiar yet it doesn't feel familiar.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
With the whole like being able to move the helicopter and the bungee separately is pretty cool.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
But you know disclaimer. Full disclosure.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
It was kind of our idea.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So of course we're gonna like it.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
And our voices and our logos and our cats are in it.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Otherwise not a lot of new stuff this week.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Still playing World of Warcraft because the big expansion is next week.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
So I'm trying to gear up.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
My characters get ready to go to level 90.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
I do plan on getting Torchlight 2 which came out today for 20 bucks.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Which is kind of the in a way answer to Diablo 3.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Because a lot of the people who worked on Diablo 1 and 2.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It's the 47% Diablo 3.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
It's the poor man's Diablo 3.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's the welfare Diablo 3. Thank you.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Well considering my copy of Diablo 3 was free though.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Because I signed the blood contract.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know what political system that would be.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
But who cares?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Socialism.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Who cares? They're video games.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So yeah I definitely plan on getting Torchlight 2.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And I'll be able to play that for like a day or two.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And then Mr. Pandaria is out and we all know.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Let's not even try to kid ourselves.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
It's gonna dominate my week.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
But I hope to get LittleBigPlanet Vita somewhere in there too.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
It's starting to be that season.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I'm gonna fall behind on all these games I gotta play.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
And it's all gonna be Warcraft's fault.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
There's only one thing I wanna get.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Never discussed how costly that is.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Oh.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You wanna talk about this on the air?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
No.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Wait for future week.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
There's a 99 point a billion chance that I'm not gonna.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Alright.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Well maybe we'll get it out of you on a future episode.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Uh, Dan.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
What have you been playing this week?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You wanna tell us about anything?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Borderlands 2.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
How do you like it?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's awesome.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Why?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Well it's like Borderlands 1.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Which was awesome.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
But there's more of it.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Sounds good to me.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Yes it does.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Dan the man everybody.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Well I think just like the characters are more developed in the game.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Like they actually.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't know.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It seems like they have a lot more to do.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You know.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
I think that the new characters are like way more generic than the original characters.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Which I don't like.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Like I looked at all four characters.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Which are basically the same four characters.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I know they're supposed to be like extra ones downloadable.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
But I'm looking at the soldier and I said and I'll be in a black guy.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's like you're generic sort of white guy.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And I'm like okay.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It's entertaining cause you know you need more.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Well yeah exactly.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm like well I'm gonna go ahead and like look around and check out all the different like customizable options.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Which is just mostly different colors and like two or three different heads per character.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
At the beginning you unlock more stuff.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And so then I checked out the hunter.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Who in the first game was kind of a cool character and I started with him.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
And now he just looks like a generic like Raiden cyber ninja sort of guy.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And I was like okay.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And then the girl who's still just a hot girl.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
And the berserker who's now the gunzerker and he's like a midget kind of berserker.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
With like giant guns.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And I'm just like oh I'm kinda gonna do this.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
But then I remembered how much I hated using the berserker and how much I liked using the soldier.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
So I went with Channing Tatum.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah I went with the assassin Zero.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
So I've got him going there and I'm digging it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I almost definitely do the assassin next.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Because I immediately started playing with sniper rifles and pistols.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And I was just like why did I choose the soldier?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And then I got my turret and I was like this is why I chose the soldier.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Because the turret is awesome.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Do you want to show back Rob?

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Doesn't matter but I'll just say in Borderlands 1 the only character I've played.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Because I'm about five years behind the rest of you.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The only character I've played is the sexy lady.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
And I love being able to press the button and run like hell.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
So hopefully if the gal is kind of like a clone or whatever.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Then I hope I can run.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Well she's one of the sirens and apparently there's only like five sirens in the whole world or something like that.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
And it's cool because you run into all the old characters again.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
She shows up early on and beats that ass.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah it's pretty sweet.

22:48.000 --> 22:55.000
And then also they had an interview today or something that they said that they've built it where they can add more character classes later on DLC.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Because they already announced the fifth one that they're going to do.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Right it wasn't like the...

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
The mecromancer.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
The mecromancer.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And then they've got more that they could possibly do later on.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Here's the thing that's weird about Gearbox.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Gearbox and Borderlands are fucking just awesome.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's just like a great game.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And then they also did Duke Nukem Forever.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
They didn't do Duke Nukem Forever.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
All they did was take what was done, make it work, and put it out.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
So you can't blame Gearbox for Duke Nukem Forever.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And it had to be released.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
There's no way you couldn't have released that game.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
It had to be done.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
It had to be unleashed upon the world.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And if you want a copy now you can get one brand new for ten bucks.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Well they shouldn't have put their name on it then.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
They should have just finished it.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Can't blame them for that.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
You want to get paid right?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Shit! They could have put my name on it.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
That's all the text would have said on the back of the box.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Wouldn't have said Duke is back. Wouldn't have said he's a badass.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It would have literally said fuck it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
It had to be released.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Alright.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I think that's it for my gaming week.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Dan's going to be reading my stories tonight by the way.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Is he?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah he is.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Are you just fighting again? It's always awkward.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Dan wouldn't give me the mic back until I snatched it from him.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
He doesn't like sharing a mic with me.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't like sharing anything with you.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Alright.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
She was mad I bought a new video card.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Among other reasons.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
I got a new video card and now she's mad because my computer's got better graphics than hers.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Oh. That is a reason to be upset though.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I'm going to go ahead and put this out there.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
It has way better graphics than hers.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
I don't mean to get in the middle of arguments because that's not what it's trying to do.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Like mind numbingly better graphics.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
But if Alan did that to me, that would be grounds for sleeping on the couch.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
His computer already runs a little better than mine and I am a little jealous because I'm like your computer's not as good.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Why does it run better? I don't understand.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
This makes me upset.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Overclock?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't know.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Witchcraft.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
That's what. Powered by witchcraft.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Alright. Housekeeping tonight.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R and of course our Facebook community.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
We will be back with episode number 475 next Sunday.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
That would be Sunday the 30th.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
We'll be back. Last day of the month with episode 475.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Alright. Let's get into what's going on in video game news.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And we'll go back to Tokyo Game Show I guess.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Yes. We're going to talk about Sony and their little press conference that they had.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
They announced a new redesigned Playstation 3.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
It's flatter than ever before.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
It's like. Yeah. And it's got texture on top. Cool.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So it doesn't look as dusty?

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
No. Actually it looks. I like the little texture they have on it. But yeah. It's even thinner.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
It's like someone ran over it with an SUV or something like that. So. Neat.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
They're going to have a 250GB model which is going to be coming out I think next week actually.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
With the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
And then also 30 bucks towards Dust 514 in case you wanted to play that.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
And then of course later on in the year at the end of October a 500GB model will launch for $299.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
And they'll include. They're also going to have like an Assassin's Creed 3 bundle and stuff like that.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
It's weird though. In Europe and Hong Kong they also got a 12GB flash memory version.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And here's the strangest part about that is. You can add a hard drive to that.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
But when you add the hard drive to it. The 12GB of flash memory stopped working.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
It's probably like a bypass or something. It's a weird thing.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah. It's just. It's really strange. How do you load disks in the new one?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Same way as the old one.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Okay. So it's still like a tray? Yeah. Or like a slot?

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah. It makes sense because if they did a regular. I don't know. I don't know why.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
Looking at the picture it almost looked like one side slid over like it was a top loader.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
And I was just like. That's really bizarre. But if it's a slot loader I guess.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah. I don't even think they have any top loading Blu-ray players. I mean that would have been strange.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
Well it would have been a way to price it down another. Because it's only what? $30 less?

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Well yeah. It's $269. But I mean still that's pretty good for a 250GB system.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Isn't there a 600GB version?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Well $500. Okay $500. That's a lot of gigabytes.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
That's. I mean I have a 500GB hard drive in mind and I'll never fill that thing up.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
That's like a week worth of saving stuff for Jamie.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Let's say PlayStation Plus. In which case I could.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I have an $80 and I'm having a lot of issues. Like I do have to kind of cycle through stuff that I'm not really playing anymore.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
I got to delete it out. DC Universe Online or whatever had to go and you know. I'm having problems.

27:35.000 --> 27:43.000
And that's just $80. So I could use a 500GB or rig my PlayStation to use an external. I don't know.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Because I have a terabyte hard drive. I just use a supportable drive.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Also another thing they announced is that they're going to be doing the PlayStation Plus service.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's going to be coming to the Vita in November.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Yay! Free stuff on the Vita. Awesome.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Yes. So that's pretty awesome.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Not really free.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Well name free if you pay for it.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Freer than Xbox Live.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
True that.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
It's true. Also PlayStation Mobile is going to be launching on October 3rd as well.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So they've got that.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
I thought there already was PlayStation Mobile. What's the difference? I already thought there was.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Because I know Flaco Jones has one of those phones I think. I've heard them talk about it before.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
But I don't think that they've actually launched like any of the store for it yet.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I think they have some games that you can buy.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
There are at least like three games on it.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But I don't think that they have like the PlayStation store yet.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
But they're redoing the whole thing because now that they've broken up from Ericsson, like the whole PlayStation phone project, you know, what was it called? The Xperia, right? The Play.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
The Xperia Play, yeah.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
And they sold like eight of them. Really? Really?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Well the thing is those phones didn't look that bad.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
My wife is a snot.

28:50.000 --> 28:59.000
Their tablets that they have though are really weird looking. Like that one that looks like actually the new PlayStation 3 split in half and it's on a hinge or something like that.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Well you don't want to make it look like a tablet or Apple will sue the shit out of you.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
I was going to say, you know your stuff when it comes to phones because it's kind of like, you know, related to the job.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah, that's what I got to do these days.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
How do you feel about iPhone 5?

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
It's like a longer iPhone.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
It's like somebody dipped it in water.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
It's like a longer iPhone that's getting some Android features. So there you go. Good job.

29:23.000 --> 29:33.000
I like the iPhone. I'm actually a big fan of the iPhone. I don't have one anymore but I miss it because I like the way that Apple makes all their stuff play together and I think it's a great product. It's smooth and elegant.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
How about the Windows 8 phones?

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
I haven't really got to play with them. I mean I played with one of like, I guess it would be the Windows 7 phone, whatever the current generation of Windows phones are.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, they're cool. I mean there's nothing too bad to say about them but you can't beat the support that Apple has gotten for the iPhone.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I was just curious. No reason.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
The iPhone long.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Some of their apps need a little tweaking.

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
Well, here's the thing. I want to replace my iPhone 4 and I'm no longer in contract. So the logical choice is we have all the apps, blah, blah, blah, get an iPhone 5, stupid.

30:02.000 --> 30:16.000
But then I'm like, well, in my mind I'm justified if I just don't get an iPhone 5 because I have the iPad because clearly I've gone down on Apple several times in the past couple years.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Gone down.

30:17.000 --> 30:27.000
I have an iPad, the new iPad or whatever. So technically my apps, I have something to use them on. So I could go Android or something else but I don't know, I hear mixed things about it.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
To give you a perspective on it, I've had two Android phones now and the next time I come up for an upgrade, I'm probably getting another Apple.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm thinking about Windows 8 phones though, holding out for those. Although Windows 8 doesn't really excite me, I don't know.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
That sounds like a bad idea.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
What? You want the mic?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I have a Galaxy S2.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Come over here and take it from me.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
No.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
She wants to comment, let the lady have the mic.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Give it!

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
See, I've got my wonderful-

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Don't break, that's how mics get broken.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
I have my wonderful Samsung Galaxy S2 and it works just fine.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Alan wants an S3.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
So, first of all, from everyone I've heard who's tested Window 8, it's shit.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Let me finish-

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Shut up.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
After having used a Windows phone of my friends, it's shit.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I can only think that if you put shit on shit, it will get shittier.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
I don't think that you can- you have to put a seed of something in there to make the flowers grow and without that it's just shit.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
Yeah, Windows 8 I'm a little less excited about, but I thought maybe- since it kind of makes your desktop look like a tablet, I thought maybe the mobile version would kind of rock.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Tablet or ugly ass art display.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
It's like I'm walking into a fucking hipster art gallery staring at the damn Metro interface.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Alright.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Because they thought that neon orange, pink, green, and blue was a fucking fantastic idea.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
That'll be- that just won't burn my retinas.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
Let's move on before we get too far off track.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah, other real quick stuff.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Of course, also, the Vita's getting some new colors.

32:08.000 --> 32:14.000
Red and blue. I'm not gonna say cosmic red and sapphire blue because it's just fucking- just call it red.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Say PlayStation Vita red.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
PlayStation Vita blue.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
You don't have to get all sexy with the name.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Cosmic red!

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Sapphire blue!

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I'm just saying that's more of a cadmium color.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Saturday night vomit green!

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Is that like a Crayola?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Something like that.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Or is that a Pantone code?

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
Cadmium is used as a red dye on the warm tone.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
It's crimson's, like, especially an alizarin crimson that's on the cooler spectrum of red.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
And mommy says I'm not supposed to eat red dye.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
And some of the coolest news-

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Excuse me, this is made from bug butts.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Some of the coolest news about the Vita-

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Just true.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Muramasa the Demon Blade is gonna be coming onto the Vita at the end of March.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
So that's pretty sweet.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It is true, by the way.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Yes, I understand.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Red dye number 40 is made from beetles.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Muramasa the Demon Blade? Made from beetles?

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
Yeah. Vanilla Wear's really sexy looking 2D action game.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Alright, so that was it for Sony, yes?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
That was it.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.000
Let's talk about Microsoft for a minute over on this side of the pond because this did not come out of Tokyo Game Show

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
because, lol, Microsoft in Japan.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
But this is pretty big news here for, you know, the US and Europe and places where people are actually buying Xbox 360s.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
You know, they might do better in Japan if they had Sai, you know, pimping out the Xbox 360.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Buy Xbox style!

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Okay, forget it.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
Apparently Microsoft has hired a CBS executive.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
As in, you know, the network that has my favorite TV show, Big Brother.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh great, that with the Kinect cameras. I can't wait.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
Thank you.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
By a vote of 3 to 1, Dan, you have been evicted from the Kinect house.

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
Alright, uh, anyhow, apparently a new exec has been hired from CBS.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
It's Nancy Tellum and she was with CBS as entertainment president before.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I don't know exactly what she did as CB- oh, I mean, I know she was entertainment president.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
I don't know what she did or did not bring to the network.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
She brought wonderful puns with her last name.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
You tell him!

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
That wasn't very funny.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Get out.

34:23.000 --> 34:33.000
But CBS has been doing pretty well the past couple years, so I imagine it's pretty in part to whatever she's doing.

34:33.000 --> 34:42.000
Anyhow, she's going to be making content, or I guess leading this effort to make content on the Xbox 360 that will reach, quote, a very broad range of consumers.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
We're going to reach out to a very broad range of consumers.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
When I first got to CBS, we looked at what the core audience was and built from there.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
And that's just what I'm going to do again.

34:53.000 --> 35:04.000
Interesting, because if I were to look at the core audience of the Xbox 360, I'd basically be looking at, you know, making Spike TV or G4 or something like that all over again.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Now, CBS used to be the grandma network, right?

35:07.000 --> 35:12.000
Murder She Wrote, Diagnosis Murder, Chicago Hope, all that stuff.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
What is it about old people and murder shows?

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Because old people are paranoid and they think everyone's out to murder them.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
That's all old people can think about is death.

35:21.000 --> 35:28.000
It's good that they have an old person advocate for them that's stopping the murderer so that the old people can feel safe.

35:28.000 --> 35:36.000
Well, here's the thing. Murder She Wrote is exactly what the Xbox 360 needs to expand their audience.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
It'd be a point and click game.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That actually would be a good game.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
They already have that on PC.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah, I was going to say, I think they have those games. Nancy Drew games.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
That shit sells like crazy.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
It's kind of like the Undiscussed thing in gaming, like no podcast I know of talks about it.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
But those games sell.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
There's nothing left for old people anymore since Andy Griffith died.

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
Well, there's other celebrities that, you know, old people love.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Wilford Brimley.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Okay, you explain to me how Dancing with the Stars is popular.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Who's watching Dancing with the Stars?

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Stacy Keibler was on it and they keep hoping she'll come back.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Who's watching Dancing with the Stars? Who is watching it?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Somebody.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Old people.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
I watch it on YouTube.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Old people and Jamie are watching Dancing with the Stars.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
I watched three episodes of Dancing with the Stars when I was in the hospital.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
I watched while Stacy Keibler was on because she has pretty epic legs.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I watched no episodes of that.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
I was just wondering, I just kept thinking that they were moving independently of her, that they were their own entity.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Because, I mean, seriously, no one has legs that long.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Anyhow, back to the article in question.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
We don't know what type-

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
No! No!

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
You know what the scam of that is, is that Stacy Keibler is like a professionally trained dancer.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
So, why the fuck was she on Dancing with the Stars?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Well, it's just like that one guy from-

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
She didn't even win.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
The Drew Carey show or whatever.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
But, I will admit-

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
What's his name?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Drew Carey.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
She is smokingly hot.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.000
The year I watched, Christy Yamaguchi was on and it was clear that she was like a million li-

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Wait a minute.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
This show has just resorted to Dancing with the Stars talk.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I am drawing the fucking line here.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
The line must be drawn here!

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Back to the story.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
We don't know exactly what type of content this is.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Is it short little pieces like inside Xbox?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Rest in peace.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Is it longer pieces like TV shows?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Julie Chen hosted programming?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Who knows?

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Is it a crappy reality show where you vied to become a product tester?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Let's hope!

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Let's hope because we haven't heard anything about a tester before.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I didn't see online casting, so I'm thinking the tester got cancelled.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
I don't know.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
And there was much rejoicing.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Do we know?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Yay.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
We do.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
We have some-

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
We're-

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
The nice thing is, having this podcast for ten years,

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
I think we've finally ascended to about that D-list video game celebrity list,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
where we are on par with some of the tester contestants.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
So we-

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
We should get Kathy Griffin to be our advocate.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
You'd think one of them would have told us if they're doing a tester for or not.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
We haven't heard.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But anyway, I don't-

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
As far as the Xbox programming goes,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
what do you think?

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
I mean, what do you think this means for the direction of Microsoft in the future and all that?

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
I mean, it's very clear Microsoft is trying to infiltrate the living room

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
and maybe will broadcast programming all over your walls and who knows what.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I- Right now, you know, I can't get excited about anything

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
because when they were talking about all their, you know, TV network partnerships and stuff like that,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
it just became like a bunch of apps.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I just-

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Eh.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
It's an interesting idea.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
I just don't know if I trust that it'll work.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
You know what- You know what was a great idea?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
You know what was a great idea?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
One versus one hundred.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
One versus one hundred.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
That was a TV- That was your TV network.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Wasn't it?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Oh my god, Dan and I agree on something.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Hold on, I gotta chat with Dan.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Wasn't one versus one hundred awesome?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
One versus one hundred was great.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
People were like getting on Xbox Live and stuff just to play one versus one hundred.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Why did they get rid of one versus one hundred?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Because Microsoft sucks.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Thank you.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
We agree on something.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Moving on.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
More news.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Dark Sakura.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Well, I killed my husband five seconds ago.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
No, not really.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I just punched him in the kidneys.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So, there's been an announcement for PlayStation 3.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Ermahgerd!

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Ermahgerd, Kerndomhertz.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
Famitsu reported that it will be out next year for PlayStation 3,

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
and I have no idea what's gonna be special about it other than being HD.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Maybe I'll actually beat it.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
It's the actual Kingdom Hearts game.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
It's, er, Kingdom Hearts 1.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Erm, was it, er, one?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
The Chains of Memories.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Chains of Memories and 358.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, and 358.2dia.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
So, I kind of want it.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Which is a terrible name.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
Well 358.2, I had heard they don't know if they're really gonna port the game.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Has cutscenes.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
It's just gonna be the cutscenes.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
In pretty HD.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
That could be interesting.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
I kind of want it.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Now, here's the big question.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Is this building the hype train for a Kingdom Hearts 3?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Why don't they just put two in there too?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah, and where's two?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Or is this, you know, let's milk this slowly?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It's, it's Sony.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
And Disney.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
How many things are they gonna milk?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
All the things.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
One teat at a time.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
All the things.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
All of them.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
The things?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Shit.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
It's, it's Square Enix.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
And, you know, well, we're gonna get in this.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
All the things.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
They are milking their shit.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
Yet, yet we're saying all this and I will sit right here and tell you, I am buying this shit the day it comes out.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Abso-fucking-lutely.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I just said I wanted it.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Sign me up for corporate whoredom.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Nope.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Not you.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Not me.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Sitting out.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Probably one of the people at the corporate teat of Squeenix.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'll be, gimme.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
No you can't have it.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
I also missed.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
No you can't have it.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I also missed Chains of Memories.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
Before she can buy any more Kingdom Hearts games, she has to beat her copies of Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
No, I have to, you have to fix my copy of 2.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I can't, your copy of 2 is fine.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
You just need to restart.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I mean, it's not like you would know where you left off anyway.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
You haven't played it in like, what?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
I don't know where I left off.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
10 years?

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm, uh, fucking, I have to go back and do the pirate thing again.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
I was even further.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
And then she made me stop playing, cause she was not, that I was gonna beat the game first.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Give it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I said you could.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The thing is, all I did was just customize.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
The only guy that upgraded was Sora though.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Give.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
I didn't upgrade Donald or Goofy.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Give.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Loki, how's your dinner?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Tasty.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Give it.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Dan, go leave and get me something to eat.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I'll punch you in the kidney.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You'll pee blood for a year.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Next story.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Help.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
If he's peeing blood for a year, that's seriously a clotting problem.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Um.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
I'll give you a clot.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Anyways.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
So Valve.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
They've got some hardware coming.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Funny.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Valve hardware.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Valve is a piece of hardware.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Read the news.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Alright.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
So anyways.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Their hardware is going into the beta next year.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
But what is their hardware?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Eh, who knows.

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
But it's going, they're having internal beta tests of their hardware.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
I only hope that some sort of computer is shaped like one of the portal turrets.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Because then I'd have to buy it.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
I mean, come on.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
That'd be awesome.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
That would be kind of awesome, actually.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Did you see the video this week from Weta?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
I want one.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Yeah, I did.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Yeah.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
So.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Just try to get near that baby.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Interesting that it's going to be next year for the Valve hardware, right?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And not before the holiday season?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
It's going to be next year, yeah.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Is that because we're going to expect a big push?

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Although, 2013 seems like a bad time to release a console if you're somebody new.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Because you're going to have Sony and Microsoft enter the ring next year.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
As far as we know, they're both going to debut their consoles next year.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
Sony could go another year.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I think Microsoft will launch next year.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Sony might go wait until 2014.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
It's going to be rough.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
It's hard to say if any of them are going to launch next year.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
I mean, I think they could still be fine launching hardware.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Because I don't think they're really going to be competing against consoles.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I mean, they're kind of like, hey, here's a cool way you can play some awesome PC games.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It's almost like an on-live type thing.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
I just don't know how they're going to put out hardware.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Because that's one thing with PC is that you have to constantly upgrade.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
So, even if they put out some nice hardware that runs stuff now, two years from now, it's not going to run stuff that well.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
That's true.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Which is too bad.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Because that's kind of the dilemma I'm in right now.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
I use my laptop more.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Although my laptop has better specs than my PC.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
My PC is clocked faster and was my gaming machine for a while.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
But now it's old graphics cards and processor and stuff.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Can't keep up with it.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
And I've got to buy all new stuff to be able to do it.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
That's the thing, though.

44:12.000 --> 44:19.000
A console-like device for a PC is going to have to be constantly upgraded.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Good point.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Moving on to something else out of Tokyo Game Show.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
And speaking of consoles, this will be a big console game whenever it's released, I'm sure.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
It's a new game from Kiji Inafune, who was the guy that left Capcom.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Who used to do Mega Man, right?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
So, what's he doing now?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Oh, and Dead Rising?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Oh, yeah.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
So, what's he working on now?

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
It's a game called Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Yes, that Ninja Gaiden.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
It's not part of the other Ninja Gaiden trilogy.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
This is a new game.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
The trailer was very weird.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It was talking about zombies and stuff.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
And apparently, the new protagonist in this game, the mission is to kill Ryu Hayabusa.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So, that could be interesting.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
The trailer looked pretty sweet.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
It's got kind of like that cel-shading graphics and pretty action-packed.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
But it was very heavy on the cutscene, so you couldn't really tell what the game looked like.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
It's gotta have zombies in it.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Of course.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Sell millions more copies.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Why can't they have sea creatures?

45:23.000 --> 45:28.000
This is coming out from Tecmo, and they are partnering up with Spark, which is a western developer.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
So, that will be coming, I'm assuming, next year at some point.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
In the meantime...

45:34.000 --> 45:41.000
Well, there's actually been a trademark renewal that Microsoft has done for Killer Instinct.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
They've actually stated that they've either renewed or refiled the trademark applications.

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
But there was an interview not too long ago where one of their 3D modelers at Rare said that

45:54.000 --> 46:01.000
Microsoft wasn't interested in doing another fighting game, so they don't think it ever will be done.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But who knows? Maybe we'll get...

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Let's just hope he was lying.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Maybe he just didn't know.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Maybe now the time is right.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
I do think that a lot of it is wishful thinking.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
It's probably just that they have to renew the trademarks so somebody else doesn't come in and do a Killer Instinct game or whatever.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
But it certainly does raise hope.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
It would be a killer launch title for whatever the next Xbox is.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
We were just watching playthroughs the other day, and they have the worst necks.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And their skin looks like plastic.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
But some of the best music.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
I know, right?

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
Like freakin'...

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
What's-her-face music from KI2?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Orchid's music from KI2 was the best.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
The only one I have here handy real quick is...

46:46.000 --> 46:50.000
I remember when I lived in Alabama and Dan and I were just friends on the interwebs.

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
How he recorded, waited until the game started up with Orchid's music to record it for me.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
And didn't you say it took you like 30 minutes to do it?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Aww, that's kinda romantic.

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
I had a really hard time getting like the exact spot where it started because I don't know if there was a sound test or if I just wasn't smart enough to use it.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
That's like really sweet in a way.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
I'm a nice guy.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Look at you guys now.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yep.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
What happened? Oh, you got married. That's right. You got married.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Jimmy!

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Alright.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
I love that bastard.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
So I'm sure I speak for everybody when I say Killer Instinct 3, please.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
I wish.

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
Release dates! Let's travel around the world and talk about games that will actually be coming out sometime soon.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.000
Yes, this week we've got the Angry Birds trilogy on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the 3DS.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Whoopee!

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
You know, millions of other people disagree with you, but yes. I agree with you.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
I yawned.

47:47.000 --> 48:00.000
Uh, Wipeout 3 on 3DS, Xbox 360, and Wii. No, it's not the cool racing game Wipeout, but more of the obstacle show game.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Oh god.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
The Testament of Sherlock Holmes on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
Puzzler World 2012 3D on the 3DS.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
Disney Princess My Fairy Tale Adventure on the Wii, 3DS, and DS.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
Uh, some game called World of Warcraft Missa Pandaria.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
That's coming out.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
And, uh, No Unker.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
Yeah. Dead or Alive 5 on PS3 and 360.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
FIFA Soccer 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Vita, and 3DS.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
And... that's it.

48:48.000 --> 48:53.000
You forgot the most important title, although it's download, so that's why you missed it.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Tokyo Jungle is out this next week on the PlayStation 3.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
That's pretty awesome.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
That's pretty awesome.

48:59.000 --> 49:07.000
Honestly, like, I might have to not play World of Warcraft for a little bit to go play Tokyo Jungle,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
because that game looks... lolsy. I can't wait.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
And that's the, if you don't know Tokyo Jungle, that's the game where basically you play, like, animals trying to survive.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's like 28 days later with animals.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
And they're killing other animals, and you get to eat animals.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
And you get to be, like, a pug in good times. A poodle, and...

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
But it's not Nintendogs. It's Nintendogs if they killed each other.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
It's like Nintendogs meets Hunger Games.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
How about Nintendferrets?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
That's the game that Nintendo should make.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Nintendogs to the death.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Oh, that's terrible, Dan!

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Thank God he didn't have a mic. He said Nintendogs, Michael Vick edition. That's terrible.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Oh, you said thank God he didn't have a mic, and then you repeated it.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
That means you're going to hell with him.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, now it's not funny anymore.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
It's not funny when it's real.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Alright, moving on to Japanese release dates.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
On the Xbox 360 on September 27th.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Dead or Alive 5.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
Love Tori, sweet version in regular and limited edition.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
They're not dead, they're just sleeping.

50:16.000 --> 50:23.000
Sleeping Dogs, Hong Kong Himitsu Keisatsu comes out on the Xbox 360 this week.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
On the Playstation 3, also Dead or Alive 5 and Sleeping Dogs, that same game.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
As well as a new headset, if you're so inclined.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
I think it's a third-party headset, but probably to support that official Playstation 1 that just came out not that long ago.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
On the Vita this week, DJ Max Technica Tune.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
I think there might be a few people I know that are interested in that one.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
That is coming out.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Dan Ball.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
That's what it's called. Dan Ball's second game.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Yay! Dan's Balls.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Nobunaga no Yabu, Tenduo with a power-up kit.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
And it looks like these are Ys games.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
Ys Selectica no Jukai, it's a 25th anniversary limited edition of Ys, so that's pretty cool.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
And some game I've never heard of called Earth Defense Force 3 Portable, also on the Vita this week.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Lastly, taking a look at the 3DS this week.

51:17.000 --> 51:25.000
Chibi Devil, Kokuga 3DS LL, I'm thinking that's their version of the XL in pink and white.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
And Wagamama Fashion, Girls Mode, Yokubari Sengen.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
The only thing that's not cool about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is it's $72.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Ouch.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm not importing that.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Ouch.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
I'm trying to see what this Fashion Girls game is, but they don't actually show screenshots.

51:42.000 --> 51:48.000
It's just the little cover art is this very badly drawn anime chick who has no neck.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
She has a neck?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
No, it's...

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
She has a neck?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
It's weird.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
She's got a neck.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
And she's carrying this little, like, coach purse and... yeah, whatever.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I kind of want it.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
No you don't.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Yeah, I do.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Alright.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Other release dates for other countries. Dark Sakura.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
I'm gonna start with the 20th, because that's today.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
We have Rayman Jungle Run on Android and iPad, but no one has an Android, so it's fine.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Torchlight 2 for PC.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
On the 21st, F1 2012, One Piece Kaizoku Musou.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
We have One Piece Pirate Warriors. Is it the same game?

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Oh.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
It is.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah, then why did they list it twice? They're stupid.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Oh, we did this last week.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Okay, Borderlands 2. Blah.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
On the 25th, World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria. Oh my god, Pandas.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
26th, Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
27th, Bad Piggies.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
And Half-Minute Heroes Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for PC.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
And 28th, Carrier Command Gaia Mission. It doesn't say Gaia, it says Gaia.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
FIFA 13 and Inazuma Eleven Strikers.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
And I'm spent.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Alright.

52:58.000 --> 53:06.000
Well, let's take a trip back to a time when gaming was a little bit simpler and, you know, we didn't have crazy games like Tokyo Jungle.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, the games were actually kind of crazy in their own special way.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
I totally want to play Tokyo Jungle.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
Uh, it is the classic game of the week. Where's my cue music? There it is.

53:17.000 --> 53:24.000
Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, asshole, play this game.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
In this case, it was, you didn't pick a classic game, pick one while I'm in the car. So...

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
That may have happened, yes.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
So, uh, it's Vectorman.

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
Because Dan was watching a playthrough of this the other day and I was like, I remember that game.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
It was full of green balls.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Dan says, coolest title screen ever, which I agree. Fairly cool.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Very, uh, early 90s.

53:49.000 --> 53:57.000
Um, so it's basically a run and gun kind of game. It was done by Blue Sky Software and published for Sega for the Mega Drive slash Genesis.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
Came out October 24th, 1995 in North America and on the 30th in Europe.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Sorry, November 30th in Europe.

54:04.000 --> 54:14.000
It's been out on a bunch of other stuff, usually in various Genesis collections for other handheld systems and virtual console and whatnot.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
But it was originally a Genesis game.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
And it had a console on the cover.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
So, Vectorman.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Basically, it's got orbots in it, but they're not mighty.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
And if anyone remembers that show, which I'm sure Dan does.

54:28.000 --> 54:38.000
Um, so, uh, you have to stop this particular orbot who gets merged with a nuclear missile and goes insane and becomes Warhead, which is the coolest name ever.

54:38.000 --> 54:45.000
And then, um, Vectorman has to go around and clean up some toxic crap and shoot some TVs and save the earth.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Save the earth. Kill your TV.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Really, you do shoot, like, TVs everywhere.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Yeah, you do. I'm watching this playthrough right now.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Um, I'll go ahead and talk about Vectorman 2, the sequel.

54:55.000 --> 55:02.000
Um, basically, it's, uh, you have to basically clean up mutant insects and kill the Black Widow Queen.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Oh, shit!

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
Vectorman's another game that if you knew the storyline, it was actually a way better game.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
It was sort of like Wall-E, where the earth was rendered uninhabitable, like, thousands of years in the future.

55:15.000 --> 55:21.000
And there was this, like, really awesome robot, not Vectorman, who was, like, sent to clean it up.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
But they accidentally attached a nuclear missile to his head, and he became Warhead.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
And then Vectorman, and he turned all the robots on Earth evil.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And when the humans came back, he was gonna whoop that ass.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
Now, Vectorman was, like, driving his barge of garbage to the sun, and he came back and decided,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Man, I gotta take these guys out.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
And then you run around shooting shit in a fairly generic shooter.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
It had really good graphics.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Vectorman was an awesome game for the Genesis.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Jamie doesn't know shit about it.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
She'd pick it at random.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Wall-E was such a good movie, though.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Don't do what?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
This is what I do.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Moving on with Classic Game of the Week.

56:02.000 --> 56:12.000
So, as I said, it had a play-to-win contest that went with it, where you could win $25,000 or $10,000 or a Sega Saturn.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
So, yay.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
It was pretty much a success.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
It had great level design, great graphics, as my wonderful, tactful spouse has said.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
And it won EGM's best Sega Mega Drive game of 1995.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
There was a third game in the works, and it was cancelled in 2003.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It was gonna be on the PlayStation.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
The character actually looked very similar to Master Chief.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
He kinda does, actually.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Well, for Vectorman 3.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Oh, I see. I can see, though, where it could, you know, come from this guy.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
I think I played this for, like, 15 seconds in one of the Sega collections I had, and I was like,

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
eh, I don't get it.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
I went back to Sonic.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
My ex-roommate, like, would just play these games for hours and just beat the hell out of him.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
She was really good.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Yeah?

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Cool. Alright, there it is.

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
Your classic game of the week, Vectorman on the Sega Genesis, Mega Drive, whatever you want to call it.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
There you go.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
No break tonight.

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
We're going right through, and we'll kick off with some rapid-fire news up next.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Loki.

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
Alright, so Humble Indie Bundle 6 is available now, and you can check it out.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
This time around, they've got some pretty cool games.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
I actually picked it up already.

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
And in it, let's see, Dust Force, which you can unlock if you pay more than the average.

57:39.000 --> 57:47.000
Rashard, Shatter, Spaz, Torchlight, Vessel, and at least that's it right now.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Who knows?

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
They probably will add more stuff, probably the previous pack at some point soon.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Still a great deal.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Torchlight's a great game if you somehow still have not played it.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
I'm not as familiar with the other games in the bundle, I don't think.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Let me look again at the list.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
But I think I've bought all but one of these, so I'll probably get this one too.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Right, yeah.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It's a great, great thing.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
Right now, the average is $5.79.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
And let's be honest, if you don't want to pick up Dust Force, and you want to be kind of a dick about it,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
you can pay a penny and still get, you know.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
But you shouldn't do that.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Six, you know, five games.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
Give the money to charity if you must, you know.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
You should still pay at least five bucks.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
These are all really good games.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
So that's pretty cool.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And the soundtracks too.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
That's part of the reason why I want to get it, even though I already own Torchlight.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Just to get the soundtracks.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Yeah.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
So they've got that.

58:45.000 --> 58:52.000
And then of course, also, there's a new game that's on iOS from Square Enix.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
And Square Enix likes to charge a lot for their games.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
Now this one isn't that expensive.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
It's $6.99.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
The game's called Demon's Score.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
And it's a rhythm action game from Anise, which you may remember.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You know, Lead Beat Agents.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Anyways, so it's kind of a rhythm music game.

59:12.000 --> 59:19.000
But then you can also unlock, like, different characters in it.

59:19.000 --> 59:25.000
And when you unlock those characters, you have to pay $3 to actually play as those characters.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
And apparently there's about, oh, I don't know, $40 worth of DLC in this game.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
So to actually play as those other characters, it would cost you another $40 on an iOS game.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
I'm sorry, $30 worth of extra content.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Funk that.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Yeah.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
All the characters seem to be big-breasted women, so I'm not really sure what's going on.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
Oh, well, now I'm kind of interested again all of a sudden.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
No. Not really.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
We just had a Square Enix music game, too, which is kind of weird, the theater rhythm.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
But I know this is different, because it's not even the same design or anything.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
But it's just weird that we have these different music games with an abundance of DLC, kind of almost back-to-back.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And I guess each character has a different style of music.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So you might have one that has, like, funk.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
One that's, you know, classical, or looks like Latin, and I don't know.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Well, speaking of milking it for all it's worth, I can't believe this collection's coming again.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But I do love my classic game collections.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Might have to check out Midway Arcade Origins.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
It is a collection coming out for the Xbox and the PlayStation 3.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
More than 30 Midway titles from the golden age of arcades.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You can expect things like Gauntlet, Joust, Defender, Rampage, Spy Hunter.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I think every single one of those games was on the previous collection.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Marble Madness.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Marble Madness is in this collection, though.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I don't think that was in any of the previous ones.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I'm surprised it didn't.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Was it?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yes.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Damn it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's all re-releases.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's just a new factor for them.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I'm surprised they haven't done an HD remake of some of these arcades.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Not necessarily an HD remake, but just redo the graphics in HD.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
For a short time, there was Joust and Robotron.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And some of them were the early early Xbox arcade releases.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Remember when Xbox arcade was mostly just re-releases of old shit?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I think Gauntlet was one of them, too, really early on.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yeah, I bought that.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And they're not available anymore.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I want to say some of them had at least high definition smoothing.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And some of the cheap and easy effects on it.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But, yeah, not really a true HD remake.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Well, there will be no online multiplayer for this, sadly.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Which, you know, what a great way to add value to a collection that a lot of people probably already have on their stinkin' iPhones.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
There are achievements, trophies, leaderboards, whoopee.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
If you're a true achievement or trophy whore, then there you go.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It is coming out from Backbone.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Didn't they do those early Xbox releases, too?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I think they did.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
That's pretty much what they did.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
$30 in November.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Was Backbone the one that did, um...

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Was it the other arcade thing that they had?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Um, they did Street Fighter II puzzle turbo thing.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Who was the one that did the one that was like, uh...

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Like Wolf of the Battlefield.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
No, no, not even that.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It was like, um...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Remember the thing that they actually had on Xbox where you get to make your own arcade collections and stuff like that?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Oh, Game Room!

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, Game Room.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
No, Backbone did not do Game Room. That developer closed.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It was somebody out of Australia, I think.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Remember, they shut down and then Game Room just suddenly stopped updating.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
That was really important.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
God.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Oh, it's been at least...

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Another misstep.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's been a good six months since I've ranted about Game Room and how that should have been so much better than it was.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Anyway.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Who was that again?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Blah, blah, blah.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
No, Backbone pretty much just does arcade translations, classic collections, and like new versions of old games.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Like they did Wolf of the Battlefield. They did, uh...

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Whatever the 1940...

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The 1940-whatever series game that they did straight for the Xbox and PS3, like the remake.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
That's just kind of what they do.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Oh, I am being corrected by chat.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The perks of having a live chat room is that they correct you when you're wrong.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Actually, the Midway ones were Digital Eclipse.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So I was wrong. It was not Backbone. Sorry.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
AlphaCananagram does state, though, Backbone did do Yaris.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's not exactly one to get really excited about, just saying.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's the best free game based on a cheap Toyota ever made.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Thank you. BobbyBlackWolf to the rescue.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Chrome Studios is the name. I knew it was K-something.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Chrome Studios did Game Room.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And ShadowNextGen agrees Game Room is such a missed opportunity by Microsoft.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Because, man, I desperately wanted to play in television games on my 360 and pay for it.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Now I want to know why is Dark Tetsuya talking about online Super Off-Road?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
He says,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I'm disappointed this collection doesn't have online. I would have loved online Super Off-Road.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Super Off-Road wasn't in the list.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But there is a trailer.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So now I feel the need to watch this trailer immediately just to see if it has Super Off-Road in it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Because I don't remember Super Off-Road being in the, uh...

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I didn't realize that was a Midway game.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's not. I mean, a lot of these aren't Midway games.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Now it's time to talk some classic games.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
A lot of these are like Atari games.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But Midway became the owner of Atari after Namco, actually, strangely enough.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And Leland actually was the company that released Super Off-Road.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And somehow they ended up with the rights to the Leland games as well.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I'm looking at this trailer and I'm definitely seeing some Spy Hunter and some Defender.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'm not seeing Off-Road, though.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Super Off-Road would be a good one.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I don't even think it had a...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I don't think it's had an Xbox Live release.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And can you imagine, though, if that was on this collection and you can't play online?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Like, damn, talk about a game from my childhood I'd like to be able to play online.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Well, it's because they're not doing any new code.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
It's just, you know, quick and dirty ROM, you know, ports.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Build an emulator, dump ROM.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Right, build an emulator, dump ROM, you know, question, question, question.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Dark Tetsuya says it was in Midway Treasures 3, and that was the one with all the racing games.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Yeah, let me look. I think I have it.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I don't know if Super Off-Road... Yeah, I think it was. I think it and the track pack both were.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I know it was Hydro Thunder. I know it's the later Off-Road game, like Off-Road Thunder.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And it was the Dreamcast port of Hydro Thunder, which pissed me off.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It was not Arctic Thunder because that would have been sweet.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Yep, Super Off-Road. I'm looking at it right here.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I actually have the Xbox version.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And it was the Dreamcast ports of Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh, and a really nice arcade port of Rush 2.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I can say this now because this company doesn't really exist anymore, but I got this copy free for Midway

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
because the chick and I were at the Classic Game Expo and I were just kind of like talking and she gave me a free copy.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I'm disappointed that that's going to be in Vegas this next time.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Well, it hasn't been in the Bay Area like forever.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Really?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, we went like a couple years when it was like in Burlingame. It was awesome.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I had such a good time. One year, I mean, me and Jamie must not have taken more than like 150 bucks.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.000
We got just a pristine, not a duo, but we got a Core Graphics, which is a PC Engine.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Just a stack of games. Just awesome.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I was disappointed they didn't have an Atari party this year.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I totally forgot. I totally forgot about Super Off-Road being in Midway Arcade Treasure 3.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I wonder if that's one of the backwards compatible games I can play on 360. If so, no? Curse you!

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But you can play the PS2 version on your 60 gig PS3.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Except I don't have a backwards compatible PlayStation 3.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh, that sucks. I guess I'll just have to play it on mine.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Now I see why they're re-releasing it all over again.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Rob, do you want to borrow our Xbox?

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I have an Xbox. Dan vetoed that real quick.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I have an old Xbox somewhere. I just can't guarantee if it'll work or not.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Let's sigh.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Alright, anyhow, that was supposed to be rapid fire news. Oops.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Animal Crossing Jump Out. Well, this ought to be quick.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Because we're going to talk about what's new in Animal Crossing Jump Out.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Crickets, crickets, crickets.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
No, there will be five new characters.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Frap, or Frappe, I like to use the E.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Frappe, who will be a lively penguin.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
A brisk hamster.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Frappe.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Tocoya, a carefree octopus.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Brittany, who is a mature pig.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Wait, that would be Tocoya.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Taco is octopus.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And Anthony, who is a smug horse.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Apparently smug is a new personality you will see throughout the game.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So does he go around going, no sir, I do not like it.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
He goes around going, nay.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah, I was just going to say, he goes around going, nay.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
There is also, Loki, this could be, here is something new.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You've been asking, you've been dying. What is going to be new in the new Animal Crossing game?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So here it is. I'm waiting for it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You ready?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
There is going to be a special tree that you plant when you become mayor,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
and it will grow as your city grows.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Bravo.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Bravo.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Pre-order it right now.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I'm going out tomorrow buying 3DS just for, no.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You know what?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I would do that just to start my toilet collection again.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Well, Dar Sakura, you might appreciate this, because it's kind of in your name.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
There will be new flowers in the game, and cherry blossoms are coming back.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Okay, we're getting it. Hold on.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
They've got to put NES games back in it.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You can, I guess, apparently put the reset management center anywhere you want.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I didn't realize Resetti got his own building now, so he can yell at you.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Oh, okay. I have to digress, Rob.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
What?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Uncracked.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
They did the what if minor characters in games got their own game,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and one of them was Mr. Resetti's game, and the thing was full of text.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It was great.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Mr. Resetti is one of the most underappreciated video game characters ever.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
He's amazing.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
There's also Brewster's coffee shop, so you can have a not Starbucks in your town.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That was Brewster. That's who you're thinking of.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Two types of police stations that you can have.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Mr. Resetti needs to be in the next Mario Kart game as one of the attacks.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Instead of the squid ink and stuff like that, it's just Mr. Resetti.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
He just blocks you with nothing but text for five seconds.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Is he in Smash Brothers?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
They have a...

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Wasn't he a trophy or something, probably? I think there was a trophy.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
They have Animal Crossing level, I thought.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I can't remember if Resetti was in it or not. I think he was.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Anyway, let's move on with more rapid fire news with Dark Sakura.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Stuff happened, and things happened.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Nights HD is going to have Christmas nights, and it will be on PlayStation Network on October 2nd,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
and on Xbox Live October 5th.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Guess what? I already have it, except the HD looks super fucking pretty, and I want it.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It'll be ten bucks.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It does have Christmas nights.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah, but I've got it on the Saturn.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Shut up! We have it on the Saturn. You can sit there and shut up.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Yeah, and I've got the Japanese one after... whatever.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:53.000
On this show before, you've talked about it's kind of a tradition for you to break out the Saturn every Christmas and play Christmas nights.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Is there any chance you'd replace it with HD, or is that done?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Hell no!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It's a tradition for her to have me break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
You know what would be great about having it in HD, though?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
What's that?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
The fact that every year I go through, I unlock maybe half the presents. I know I had them all unlocked at once,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but since the Saturn's internal memory dies in like, oh, twelve seconds, even with a brand new battery,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
every year I have to unlock all the presents again.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So, it'd be nice just to have them all unlocked.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Alright.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
But, with no Saturn analog controller, it just ain't going to play right.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Rob.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Alright, let's...

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Yeah, Rob.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Alright, Rob!

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Rob!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Rob, more coffee.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
No, neither one of you gets coffee.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Bioware has...

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
No, you can have, you can have weed.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Dan, shut up.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Just kidding, I don't have weed. Don't do drugs.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We need to go get some food.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Don't be like Fiona.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Let's do this show faster so we can go get dinner.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Free Fiona.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Okay, Bioware's at Dragon Age III Inquisition, the end.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Nobody expects the Dragon Age Inquisition.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
You've been waiting like an hour and a half to make that joke.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Seriously, tell them.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You've been waiting an hour and a half to make that joke, haven't you?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Ever since I posted that story in the show, Rob.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
But you have to do it in the right voice.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Nobody expects it.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
One more time, one more time, please.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
No, no, no, no, we're done. We already did the joke.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
No, you don't want a clean cut for the Parsec Award.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
He can't do squeaky voice.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I've never heard him do a proper squeaky voice.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Oh, a proper squeaky voice? I can do a proper squeaky voice.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Okay, close enough.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
There's other Bioware news too that's not a part of that story,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
and it was kind of something big that happened this week.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I don't know if you're aware, but the doctors that founded Bioware left.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Yeah, I know.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
LOL bye.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Dan told me, and I'm like, good for them.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Well, it's been kind of a crappy couple years for Bioware.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
They're taking a lot of shit about Mass Effect 3 ending.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
They're pissed off about all you people bitching about Mass Effect 3's ending.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Wait, don't point at us. We didn't...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Get over it. Oh no, Jamie did.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I heard her bitching about it the other day.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Star Wars The Old Republic didn't quite meet expectations.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Dragon Age 2 was no Dragon Age 1.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So, I mean, that's like three punches in the gut in a quick span.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
That's what happens when ZA sticks their nose into a good thing.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
That's very true.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Everyone's leaving to make beer, so I mean, that's good, right?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
We can have Bioware beer.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite beer on the Citadel.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Now, the other...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Captain Shepherds.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
There were some very important things that were also confirmed.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Dark Sakura, pay attention.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Beer.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
The next Mass Effect 3 DLC has been announced.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It will be the taking back of Omega this fall.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Play the news. Don't fuck with Aria.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Also confirmed, because people are paranoid because these guys are leaving.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:13.000
They had to put it out on the table, and they did confirm another Mass Effect game is in development.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Now, they didn't say it's Mass Effect 4. That's all they said.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
They just said another...

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It better be the Tale of Geras.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Another full Mass Effect game is in development.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Could be a prequel, could be a new trilogy, could be anything.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Shut up.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It could be like the new iPad, where it's just the new Mass Effect.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
It would be Silent Scope featuring Geras.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Also, the same team led by Casey Hudson working on a new IP.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
That's supposed to be pushing the envelopes with game design.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Strong hints that it's for an unannounced console.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
There's gonna be a lot of hardcore gay sex in that one.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
We'll get cocked this time.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
One can hope.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
That's right.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
No, cocks and twats everywhere.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Pushing the pornography envelope. That's how Bioware's gonna sell some games.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Heck yeah.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says, you know what's funny?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Cocks and twats?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
No, not cocks and twats.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Is that if you look at the date of their retirement announcement, it's almost exactly five years after the EA purchase of Bioware.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
One has to wonder if that was in the contract that their jobs would be protected for five years.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
No one can hear you when you are not talking on the microphone, Dan.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
It's probably just that they had to stay with the company for five years.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
They couldn't be like, thanks for the money. Bye.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I would leave wow for Mass Effect MMO just saying.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Shadow Next Gen says, I heard the next Mass Effect game probably won't include Shepard.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Well, duh.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Well, let me just put it this way.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
When you're writing fiction, you can do anything you want.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Especially when it's sci-fi.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Look at the shit they got away with on Star Trek for years.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Look at the shit they get away with in comics.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
How many times has Superman died? How many times has Batman died?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Isn't Captain America president now?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
How many more endings can they get Buzz Aldrin to narrate? Hello.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Yeah, I know. Black Wolf in the chat says SWOTOR equals Mass Effect MMO.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
No.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Well, I think that's kind of why a Mass Effect MMO isn't exactly at the top of anybody's wish list right now.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Mass Effect would sell better.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But SWOTOR wasn't bad. That's the thing.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
It wasn't strong enough to take down a game that it was emulating.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
The fandom wasn't enough.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It just needs to go the Macross 2, Macross 7 route where it's just all about music.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And their weapon is music and they can get Psy to be the leader of whatever rebellion or whatever.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Just have them dancing.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I think the Old Republic would have been a lot better if they hadn't just put it out of the tail end of just running Star Wars into the ground as hard as they could.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
True.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I think back when they brought out the original...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Not Bioware's fault.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
No, not Bioware's fault at all.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000
The game design is apparently really solid, but the Star Wars franchise has lost a lot of its shine.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
That's kind of sadly true.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.000
The Star Wars franchise hasn't had shine since they changed the first one to Episode 4.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Moving on.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Now I was going to say at least the third movie.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Anyway, forget it.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Moving on.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Now that we're done with rapid fire news, 30 minutes later.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No foogle question of the week this week because I forgot to ask one.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
We'll bring one back next week.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But you should join our Facebook and Google Plus communities in anticipation.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And so that you have something to do on Google Plus.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Actually, hangouts are still cool.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'm just saying.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Google Plus is kind of underappreciated, but I'll save that tangent for another week.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Let's get back into some long form news.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Hahaha, Loki.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So Zynga has bought a bit lucky.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And they're a developer of such wonderful games called Lucky Train and Lucky Space.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Lucky Charms?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
No Lucky Charms.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Perhaps that could be a sequel.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And also a game called Solstice Arena.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
This of course begs the question.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So Zynga, are you feeling lucky?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Maybe.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And they paid 20 million dollars for the company.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And apparently also in unrelated news, the executive at OMG Pop has left.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Wilson Kriegel, the former chief revenue officer.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Eh, revenue officer. That's just like the guy that handles money.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Oh, you know the guy that cut that deal where the company sold for what?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
100 million dollars or however much it went for?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
That crazy ass amount?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
He's retiring.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Fuck it, I would too.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
If I could sell Orange Lounge Radio for 100 million dollars.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I'd fuck you every time.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Five inches, have fun.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
You'd be splitting that three ways.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I'm going to Tahiti.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I'd buy you Pinkberry.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
To quote my husband, it better be a Pinkberry franchise.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
We'll see.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Depends what flavors you carry.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Alright, moving on.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
For you Rob All Peach.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
You know the funny thing is that that story went quicker than anything in rapid fire news.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Because it was a Zynga story.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And no one curr.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Lesson learned for producing future shows.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Alright, Dragon Quest X, listen up.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I know some people are excited about this.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Dragon Quest X, even though it's an MMO, which might turn some people off.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
But I don't know, I'm curious about it.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Well Dragon Quest X, some more details of Tokyo Game Show.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You can play the entire game on the Wii U gamepad if you want.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
No one wants to.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Well I don't think that's too surprising either.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Because they've already talked about that there will be games that you can kind of play on the Wii U gamepad while people are watching whatever on TV.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Like you can kind of do that duel thing that was part of the point of having the gamepad.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But the fact that this is an MMO makes it very interesting.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Because people tend to get drawn to MMOs a little more.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Imagine if it was Warcraft.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You could sit on the couch and watch American Idol and play World of Warcraft at the same time.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Of course a lot of people kind of already do that with two monitors.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I don't see how this is even a big deal.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Some people we know just put a TV on their wall.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Because it's basically just like playing it on a small monitor.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Well they also talk about that you can switch between the two.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
You can go between the TV screen and the gamepad in the menu under options smoothly.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Cool.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
But once again I don't think it's news at all that any of these games can be played on the gamepad or on the TV.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Ooh it's a display. It displays the game.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Ooh my TV's a display. It displays the game.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
That's not fucking news. That's a feature.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I thought that was sort of the whole idea, yes.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Well then I guess we're done with that story.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Because it's just like basically that just tells me that they really didn't need the whole Wii at all to do this Dragon Quest X.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Because it doesn't utilize anything other than a standard control set.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Cool.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
But it's Dragon Quest.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Yeah, cool.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Moving on to the mailbag!

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
What?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
You still have Alan's name on it.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Well, oh my god I made a mistake from copy pasting last twist.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I am not that tall.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Maybe you have a scarlet letter A for another reason.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Asshole.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Alright, mailbag.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You were saying awesome but okay if you had to go there.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send Dark Sakura letters.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Whatever letter you want.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Send me lots of Q's.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
This one starts with an A.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's from AJ Twist.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Is that actually his name? AJ Twist? Babow?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
No. I was emphasizing.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You added flair.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
This is my flair.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Good day good hosts of OLR.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Howdy.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Stop it.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
What? I'm not allowed to respond to the greeting?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
What? If you say hi to me I just have to look at you?

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah, what?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Girl.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I just finished watching a documentary on Netflix about video games.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You guys have mentioned the video game crash in the 1980's and I wanted to know what happened to cause this crash.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So I went looking for something on Netflix and I came across CNBC Originals Game On.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
The unauthorized history of video games.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000
It was a great outline of the video game history up until the release of the Nintendo Wii.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
What blew my mind about the documentary was a quote by the narrator, Bill Griffith, toward the end of the video.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
He said,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
The game machine is only as good as the games created for it.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Where have I heard that so many times before? But now I wonder, who coined the phrase first?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Me.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.000
First thing you should do about that documentary, which I've also watched, is just forget everything that you saw on it.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Because it's really, really, really bad.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I will tell you everything you need to know about the video game crash without having to watch the documentary.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Although I have not seen said documentary so I have no opinion on it.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Imagine that you have a system like the Atari 2600 and imagine they've created Yaris for the Atari 2600.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Imagine that 30 companies created Yaris for the Atari 2600 and they're charging you $60 a copy for Yaris.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
This marketplace was flooded with bullshit games like this and that's what caused the crash.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It'd be like if all of a sudden that the Apple store was selling physical copies of those knockoff games for $60 at retail and they were all clogging the shelves at Walmart or something like that.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That would be the video game crash.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Don't forget that there were like seven or eight competing consoles.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
That's true too. And PC computing.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Well, that was actually kind of pre-PC being even a factor.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Okay, Commodore, TI-99, Apple II.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Motherfucker, do you even know who you are stepping to?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I will whoop that ass if you want to talk about this.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
That stuff all really rose up. I mean, it did play a part.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
The fact that the market switched to, hey, why spend the money on a game console when you can spend the money on a computer?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But the gaming in computers really came after the crash because, you know, what were you going to get your games on?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
You know, so to an extent, but it was, yeah, market oversaturation, terrible quality control.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And at the time, video gaming really was kind of faddish, you know, and there was a big lull.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
They didn't realize that there was a cycle that you should upgrade it.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
There was no Angry Birds. All right, let's finish the email. Sorry.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
By the way, that would be there were no Angry Birds.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Actually, you were right. There was no because the game is singular.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Is that in the email?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Speaking of documentaries, I think you guys should check out Focus starring Mike Ross or I Got Next, which is free on Hulu.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
They're both about the fighting game community and tournaments.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Really recommend recommended if anyone is interested in seeing what the community is like.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I love the competitive gaming scene, but I don't have the time or motivation to get back into it.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Thanks for your time. I've been a podcast listener since 05. Love the show.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Wow. It's been a great inspiration for my own projects.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And you guys keep me awake during long, boring nights at work.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Shh, don't tell my boss. Keep up the greater than great work.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And that's from AJ Twist.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I'm just really sad that, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV never became part of the MLG scene because I could have fucking earned some money there.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Unfortunately, it's all call duty.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And I'm surprised this guy said we inspired him to do other projects, which is a great compliment.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And he refrained from plugging said projects. That's a great amount of restraint.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
But, if you would like to, we're nice that way.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Yeah, you can always tack them on.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
We support people.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And that's it.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
That's it? One email?

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I told you at the beginning of the show the only one.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I wasn't listening. One lousy email.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Jeez, Rob.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Mailbag at orangelandradi.com. Fill her up for next show.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
This is what happens when you tape mid-week.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
See, we'll get a bunch of emails on Sunday and then it'll be like, LOL didn't tape today.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week. This should be good.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
This is fucked up.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Uh...

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
You know, my FUs are really kind of, uh, personal this week.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
No, I don't want to say it to you. I'm over it.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Okay, fine. Fuck you for not buying me an iPad.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Or the hard drive I needed.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I'd like to go ahead and accept the responsibility for this fuck you.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Not really so much because I upgraded my graphics card and didn't buy her anything.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Because, you know, she's a little miss grabby.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
But I have been really fucking with her all night on the show tonight.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
It's been awesome.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I think you should bite my ass.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Loki?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Uh, I had something I was angry about earlier.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But, you know, just after eating delicious teriyaki, it's just hard to be angry about anything.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:57.000
So, I guess, uh, I guess that'd be the fact that I'm tired just because I've been seeing up until midnight playing Borderlands 2 every night.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Well, Minecraft, actually, with a knife.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But I'm tired and wish I could take a day off to, like, sleep and play more Minecraft.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
May do that.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And...

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I may or may not be taking Tuesday off to play World of Warcraft all day.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And, and FU too.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:20.000
To the fact that I probably am not going to be able to convince the wife to allow me to purchase a $1200 DDR machine that's in Modesto.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Because I really want it.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I've wanted one for years now.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Wife will be pissed.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Shut up!

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Dan and Loki have very different outlooks.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
You should buy it. And I'll tell you why.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Number one, man, you having a DDR machine would be awesome.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Number two, she'll get over it. I mean, really.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And number three, awesome.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
This is coming from the guy who has...

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I was going to talk to her last night, but she was really cranky yesterday.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
This is coming from the guy who has five pinball machines.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
I only have three pinball machines. The other two are loners.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
My bad.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I thought we should have bought that Solo that was for sale for like 800 bucks, but Jamie said no Solo.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's still for sale.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
No, I didn't say no.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I thought we should have bought that Planet Harriers that was only $600, but Jamie said no.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
No, you said no, you ass.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
You said we don't have room for it. Stop lying.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I thought we should have bought that Daytona USA dual that I saw for like 250 bucks.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Give me it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
But she said no.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Give me the damn mic.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You're going to break it.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You're breaking it. Let go.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I did the fact that I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack to buy a new mic.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Can I continue?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
The good news is I get an employee discount.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I want to say F.U.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
I want to say F.U. to Apple.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Get the fuck off me.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I want to say F.U. to Apple for launching the new iPhone this weekend.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
It's not really anything against Apple launching the new iPhone because that's fine,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
but I'd really, really rather be playing Borderlands all weekend,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
and now I can't because I've got to go and sell iPhones all weekend.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
This is about to get violent.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I looked on her shirt.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Can I do my F.U. please?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Can you finish? Can I finish?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Can I finish? Can I finish?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Dan is getting the mic again.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
My F.U. of the week just goes to being super busy and stressed.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I was so busy this week.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I think one day I had such low blood sugar I was about to pass out and faint.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Just between where, I mean cry me a river.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It's not like I don't volunteer for this shit,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
but I think I need to cool it in the future because I got too much going on.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So what do I do about it all?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Run out of town for four days.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Go to Disneyland.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
That's the answer to everything.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
That does it for my F.U.s of the week.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
AlphaCanandagrams asked in chat,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Sky, do you still have that crappy mic that still cuts out?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
If so, Kickstarter.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Yes, we have the crappy mic that cuts out.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And no Kickstarter.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
No Kickstarter.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
We actually, I do have money to get a new mic.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I need to get one.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
But the question is, do I want to get a mic-

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
But Rob, you're Dutch.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
The question is, do I want to get a mic like this,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000
or do I want to get like a super fancy condenser mic that's three digits in cost?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Kind of want the super fancy condenser mic for voiceovers.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I had one. I don't know what the fuck happened to that.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Yeah, didn't we have one?

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I had a condenser mic that at one time it was the ambient room mic

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
because that shit picked up everything.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It broke.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Did it?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Yeah, I think it broke.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It broke.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Eh, whatever.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Some of the Orange Lounge radios in the past,

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I don't know if you remember the nights when we used to get so drunk.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
There was literally an episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
and it's like a double digit episode.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
That was one that I was asleep in your bed.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Jamie passes out in my bed.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I am kicking-

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
No, I ate waffles in your bed.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I am kicking the wall, yelling, I'm in the matrix.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
I'm in the matrix.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
On the radio.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
That was a great show.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
People were listening to this.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
That's how we win awards, man.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Huh?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
By the way, podcast award nominations should be coming soon, so, uh,

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
you know, please consider us.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Here's- Okay.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
If we get nominated for a podcast award this year,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
here's the concessional, mate,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
if we can get nominated for a podcast award this year,

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I will get drunk and likely kick the wall again.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That's the- that's the little promise I make to you.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
How's that sound?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Sounds fun.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And if we win,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
we'll get the cats drunk?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I don't know.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
No.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I don't know what else to add to that.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Alright.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Anyway.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Uh, okay.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So let's talk about stuff that we probably didn't really want,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
but they're gonna give us anyways.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Castlevania.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The movie.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
It's returning.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And, uh, how do we know it's returning?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Because Michael Dorn said so.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Michael Dorn, who played many things, including-

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Mr. Worf is Dracula.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Yes, Mr. Worf.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
He is not Dracula.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
He is a werewolf.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And the joke I made earlier this week, were-warf.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
But, cool.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And he says it's a fun little part.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It's four days.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I'm playing a werewolf that's been around for a gajillion years.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
That's an actual term.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And, uh, who works for this vampire?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
It's not too far from Worf because there's a lot of killing

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and jumping and sword fights and everything.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Basically, I guess he got involved because of Marina Sirtis,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
who, I don't know who she played.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Troy.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Troy, okay.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Well, and they were both also in the Mass Effect series,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
because he was one of the, um, other-

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
No, he wasn't there.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
He was the guy with the green forehead that was hanging out with Rex.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I'm-

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Reeve.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah, not Reeve.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I kinda would want to see it because they're in it.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You know what I mean?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Like, even if it was terrible, it would be like,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
hey, that's kinda cool.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Never trust a Klingon.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I trust a Klingon.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Captain Kirk said.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
As much as I'm like, alright, Castlevania movie, that's-

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Let's just cast the rest of Castlevania with, like,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
old actors from, like, Next Generation and stuff.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Hey, I'm all about that, why not?

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
We'll get, let's see, uh, we'll get Michael, uh, um-

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
He was-

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Let's get Bruce Campbell.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.000
He was Uvink.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
He wasn't Reeve, he was Uvink.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Let's get, like, classic-

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Get Patrick Stewart as, uh, he can be Dracula.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Mm-hmm.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I mean, it's a weird casting, but sure.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Uh, we'll get, uh, Wil Wheaton.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
He can play, uh, you know, one of the-

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
He can just be himself.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Wil Wheaton as, you know, badass vampire hunter.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
To register participation for this week's episode of

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
use the passphrase, quicksand.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That's what I think of when I think of Wil Wheaton.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Alright, um, also, I need to say this comment from chat,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
because it's very important before I get to the last story here.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf has made an offer on the podcast awards.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
If you win, Bobby Blackwolf says,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I'll fly out and get drunk too.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Okay, remember, this is Bobby Blackwolf, host of the

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
clean and family-friendly Bobby Blackwolf show,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
offering to come out here and get drunk with us.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
That's awesome.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
All bets will be off.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
If that happens, we must win the award.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I'll bring my sleeping bag.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Seriously.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
If we win, marathon show.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Okay.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Alright, there you go.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Make it so.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Make it so.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Marathon show with drunk Bobby Blackwolf.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Make it so.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Dan has to come and drink too.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
We'll engage the listeners.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
We can set it up in the front room at our house.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
We will fix the warp core.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
The breach.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Alright.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Um, Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Do you even bother with Minecraft on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I don't right now, but the story's interesting.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Alright, update 1.8.2 for Minecraft on Xbox.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
We'll be adding the creative mode.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
There's gonna be new food, new monsters,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
and that means we're almost caught up to the PC version.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Eh, they're so ways off.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
They're adding the, like, random dungeon stuff,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
like the, you know, abandoned mine shafts,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
which I keep running into those in our game.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Yeah, you have a lot of those in the vlog world.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Like, there's a lot.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And, um, also the villages.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Um, the, you know, villagers and endermen and all that stuff.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Now, do we have villagers in the vlog world?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I've been looking.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
There's just a lot of fucking ocean.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
That's all I've found.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Because, like I said, I went and I went into creative.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Atlantis. They're all underwater.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I went into creative and I flew around through the nether

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
and I created a new portal because I couldn't remember

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
where the hell the old portal was

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and I ended up in the middle of the ocean

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
and I still don't know where the fuck I was.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
That's what I want to build is, like, an underwater lair.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Well, there's plenty of water.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
That will not be a problem.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I mean, you can do that.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
All right.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Uh, also, okay, so they are, you know, doing, um,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
these updates to the Xbox version.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Now, they are talking about maybe doing some mods.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Maybe differentiating it a little bit from the PC version.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Now, the Xbox 360, according to 4J Studios,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
won't be able to have the mod system that gives

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
such a variety of community additions to the game on PC,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
but we're looking at the elements of these

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
that people seem to be enjoying the most

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
and deciding how we could tailor those elements

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
into something for the Xbox.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
That'd be cool.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Xbox 360 players, they say it's because

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
you're in a living room, you use a controller,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
so this is different the way you interact with the game.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I don't know that I play the controller on the PC version

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
and it's just fine.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
You're a freak.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
My coworker does, too, and he likes it.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
He has a little bit of getting used to it,

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
but it's actually really easy to play with it

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
and I love it.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
It's great.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'm looking forward to just whatever they're gonna do,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
you know, with Minecraft on the Xbox in the future.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I think it's great that despite the fact that

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
they've already sold millions and millions of copies of it,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
they're not gonna stop updating it.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Like, that's, you know, I think a lot of people

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
would just take the money and run,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
but they're still supporting it to sell even more copies.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I think that's great.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So, just throwing that out there.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Thank you, Rob.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
What?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Take the money and run.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
You're welcome.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
All right, I'm gonna open up the Skype line right now.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
The 877 number doesn't work tonight

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
because somebody forgot to pay the bill,

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
but I don't want to pay the bill tonight.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Why would I pay the bill tonight

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
when I'm not gonna use it tonight?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So, we'll have the 800 number back next week,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
but for now you can call us OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
all one word.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
While we wait for any call,

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I mean, we have way less listeners than usual tonight,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
obviously, because you guys had no warning this was happening,

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
but while I wait to see if anybody is gonna call,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
do we have last minute stories?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I do have Twitter topics, but...

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Slender's getting a sequel,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
so that creepy game on PC is getting a brand new sequel.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
They have a teaser up for it,

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
and it's supposed to have better graphics.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Looks neat.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Also, there's a picture I saw of the new CirclePad Pro

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
for the 3DS XL.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Talking about something that's bigger than the iPhone 5.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Man, that thing is fucking massive.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Is it like original Xbox controller big?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
I think bigger.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It's seriously massive.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I just...

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
It looks stupid.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I mean, it seriously looks dumb that they have that.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
It's like, come on, man.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You had this 3DS system that you could...

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
There's a spot that you could have put another CirclePad there,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
but no, you just had to go and say,

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
eh, we're gonna add another attachment that no one fucking needs.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That's fantastic.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Let me go to some Twitter topics real quick

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
while we wait and see if we get any calls.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I did not know about this.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
This is something that Tigerclaw sent,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
because Tigerclaw always sends the tweets, even if it's Thursday.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And this actually makes me really sad.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
This is news to me. I did not hear about this.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi and the games he's created.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Rez and Meteos and, you know, Luminous.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
He's made all these great games.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
He's apparently moving away from game production.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
He's gonna be doing more of a delegatory role in Q Entertainment.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
More playgrounds.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
What's that?

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
He's making playgrounds, too.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I guess. I don't know.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Since finishing Child of Eden, apparently he's doing more academic work.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
They're saying he's more of a spokesperson.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
He's not developing stuff right now.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Well, why not? That makes me sad.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
There's been some other people that have left Q Entertainment.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.000
James Milke, I guess, was somebody that produced Luminous Electronic Symphony,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
and now he's with Q Games in Kyoto.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Very different.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
So, huh.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Well, that's sad.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I hope Q Entertainment is able to make more of the music and puzzle

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
and those kind of really innovative types of games like Rez and stuff,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
and maybe less of the 99 Nights.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
You know, I haven't played much of Luminous.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It's great!

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Alright, one more Twitter topic I have also from Tigerclaw.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
You the man.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Apparently some layoffs at Sony Public Relations.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I'll get to that in a minute, though, because we have a call coming in.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I don't want to miss it.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
What's up, guys? It's Codeman.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Codeman! What's on your mind, buddy?

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Oh, not much.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Just got back on last Saturday from Gearbox Community Day.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I wanted to tell you guys about it.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Yes, and thank you in advance for that stuff you got at the event.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You rock.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Oh, no problem, guys.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I wanted to get you guys something because you guys deserve everything in the world

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
for putting on this show every Sunday.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Flattery will get you everywhere.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I know. That's why I do it.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So, no, it was actually an amazing event.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Obviously, as everybody knows, Gearbox is a fantastic developer

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
with their games and their fan service.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Their fan service is just ridiculous.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I was talking to devs just all day.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I talked to Randy Pitchford.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It was crazy how much these guys

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
just want to interact with their fans, and it was amazing.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
How did this event work? What was it?

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Was it just a big showroom for Borderlands 2?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Was it Q&A panels? Was it more like a convention?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
How was this all set up?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Pretty much everything you just said.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
There were Q&A panels.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
They had a panel specifically for Borderlands 2,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and then they had a panel for Aliens Colonial Marines,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
which they really didn't say a whole lot about it

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
because I guess it's supposed to be out in 2013.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
But they had a room for Colonial Marines,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
which they only had two game types.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
They had a team deathmatch game type, which was actually quite fun.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You can actually play as humans against aliens,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
which was actually kind of neat.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And then they had an escape game type,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
which I guess it was just you were basically trying to escape this area

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
where there was a whole bunch of aliens attacking you.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But, yeah, it was just a big event

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
that just had all kinds of different stuff.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
You get to talk to everyone. It was amazing.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
No Duke Nukem Forever presence?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000
No, they had his chair there.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
But, no, there were no Duke Nukem anywhere.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I don't even think they even mentioned it, really.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
What a shock. What a shock.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I know, right?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So how are you enjoying Borderlands 2?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I seem to recall you're a bit of a Borderlands fan.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Oh, yeah. Well, I actually picked it up on launch day, of course.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I guess like every crazy person that loves Borderlands 2.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
And I only have gotten to play it once.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I'm actually a dad, so I really get to play a whole lot of video games.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But when I do, I get to sit down for long periods of time and play them.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
But, no, I'm really enjoying it.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I have figured out, and, look, you probably know this,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
because you've been playing it a lot, too,

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000
and it actually has gotten a little harder.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I mean, the AI dodges your bullets now.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I mean, they're all over the place with the enemies.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So, I mean, it's pretty crazy.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
This is why I need BFF mode.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I know, right?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I'm still working on the first one, slowly.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I think I got to level 10, not that long ago.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
So I'm still working on it.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I do want to say they did kind of dance around the whole girlfriend mode thing in the panel.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
One of the guys said something, and then Randy was like,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
why don't you tell us about that?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And he's like, why don't you go fuck yourself?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
That was pretty funny.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I can plug Bobby Blackwell's show from this two weeks ago at this point now,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
and not last week but the week before.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
He had those guys on the show, and they talked openly about it.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
No go-fucking-yourself involved.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Oh, no, it was actually pretty funny,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
because it was just the panel that were talking back and forth.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I mean, he was talking to another dev that was talking to him,

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.000
and I guess they've been giving him a whole lot of crap about this whole thing that got released

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
and how the media just took it and ran with it.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And so I guess around the office they've just been giving him all kinds of crap,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and they were just joking about it.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And Randy made a statement about it, how they're not discriminatory towards anybody in the whole entire world.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And he said people that discriminate towards other people just need to basically go die in a fire

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
and all this stuff.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:15.000
It was crazy, because he really wanted to get out there that their company is just...

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I mean, he was basically whoring their company out, just because it's a good company.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And I wouldn't say another company is bad, but this company is just so amazing.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I can't say...

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
And them actually being an independent company and not answering to anybody else,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I mean, that's just fantastic.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It's pretty cool that they do something like this,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
because not every gaming company does something directly for the fans.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And, I mean, where was this at?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
It was in Texas somewhere? Where was this?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
It was in Dallas, Texas, at the Palladium Theater.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Well, I guess Dallas is still a pretty big city, all things considered.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
But usually these types of things only happen in the Bay Area or LA or New York,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
one of the big, big cities.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
You don't often hear about these events in the Midwest, so that's really cool.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
That and QuakeCon are the ones I can think of that are out there, so that's great.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
QuakeCon just happened before we got there, Community Day.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So, I mean, I saw a whole bunch of people wearing QuakeCon shirts and all kinds of stuff.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
So, I mean, it was a pretty big deal.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I mean, I think they estimated about probably around 700 people at this thing.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
So, I mean, it was a pretty big, big deal.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.000
But, I mean, we actually got to jump in line because we paid for tickets.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:34.000
They had free general admission, but we paid for tickets, me and my friend,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and so we got to jump in line a little bit and get in there quicker.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
But, yeah, I did play Borderlands on the PC, which really spoiled me

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
because I was on the Xbox when I got it on Tuesday, and I was just like,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
oh, these graphics are horrible.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Yeah, and the getting used to the controls when you can have such precision with a keyboard and mouse,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
that's a little bit rough.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
True, true. And then I also wanted to, and then I'll let you guys go,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.000
but I also wanted to say I actually, it's funny you mentioned the tester earlier in the show.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I actually grew up, I don't know if you guys, one of the panel, Brent Gokey,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I actually grew up with him.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
He lived down the street from me when I was a little kid.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000
He actually mentioned that it is not on the table right now for tester for,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
but he said it could pop up in the future.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They got tons of money and just stuff to support this show,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
and the turnout for people that watched it was amazing.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
He just said they got so many other things on the drawing board right now

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
that they just can't worry about that.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I'm hoping that means maybe some more original programming.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I've said this before on the show, as much as we love to make fun of the tester,

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
it actually wasn't terrible for what it was.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
True, true.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I mean, yes, the setup might have been a little bit hokey like,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
oh, you get to be a game tester, but by season three,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
they made it a little better where you were at least a little more involved,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
like what was it, you were an associate producer or something.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And most of the people who won the show,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
the gay guy that won the show in season two,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
he only did that for like six months,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
and now he works for Sony Pictures Entertainment.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And I think the guy who won the first season

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
ended up in some type of promotional position too.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I don't know about this guy that won the most recent season,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
but for what it is, they are working their way up in the company

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
and apparently ending up pretty successful, so that's kind of neat.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I was disappointed that Dark Soccer didn't get on there.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
We all were.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I kind of just gave up on it.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
We all were, but we had Asuka,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
who apparently was a friend of an OLR listener,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
ended up calling into OLR one night.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
You have to go back in the archives to find her,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
but she called in and it ended up being like the day before she got,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
you know, voted off the island or whatever it is.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I heard that, I heard that show, I remember that show,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
and it was very, I was very distraught because I kind of liked her.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Yeah, I know.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And when she got kicked off, I was like,

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
aw man, she just had an amazing interview with Orange Lounge Radio

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and now she got kicked off.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I had no idea that that was going to happen,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and yes, it was just kind of, I was like,

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
of course, of course, she was just on the show,

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
and yeah, Kiss of Death or whatever,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
but that's, what a funny small world.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Yeah, that guy's like the Simon Cowell of the show,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
and so that's kind of funny that you grew up with him.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
That's pretty crazy.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
What a small world.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I told you, we're like D-list video game celebs now.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Now we've got ties to two,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
now we have ties not only to tester contestants,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
but apparently the tester panel.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I'm this close to Adrian Curry, this close.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
All right.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Anyhow, we should probably let you go, dude.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Okay, man, well, I appreciate you taking my call,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and enjoy the poster, man.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I actually, I should have got them to write on their OLR,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
but I was like, it was just so fast and crazy

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
that, you know, but yeah, everybody's on there,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
from the dev team to Randy Pitchford

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
to the guardian angel who plays

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
the guardian angel in Borderlands,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
she's on there, the girl who plays the siren

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
in the second game is on there,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
like everybody's on there, so enjoy it.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Hey, we have a saying, beggars can't be choosers,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
so thank you very much,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
and maybe we'll get them on the show next time.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
That would be great.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Bobby got it this time,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
but maybe for Borderlands 3, we'll see.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
All right, take care, buddy.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Thank you very much, and keep doing what you're doing.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
We will.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Not slowing down anytime soon.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Bye.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
All right, we'll see you.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
All right.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I like talking to him.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
He's fun.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
He's full of energy, too.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
He's really happy, genuinely.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Quite so.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
What's up?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
The Midway Arcade Origins Collection

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
does have super off-road.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Ooh, and where'd you hear that?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
They have the full list, actually.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Nice.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It's 720 APB arch rivals, bubbles,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Championship Sprint, Tournament Cyberball 2072,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Defender, Defender 2, Gauntlet, Gauntlet 2,

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Joust, Joust 2, Marble Madness, Pit Fighter,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Rampage, Rampart, Robotron 2084,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Rootbeard, Tapper, Satan's Hollow,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Cinestar, Smash TV, Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter 2,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Super Off-Road, Super Sprint,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Toobin, Total Carnage, Vindicators Part 2,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Wizards of War, Xenophobe, and Zybots.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
That's kind of the greatest hits of the three

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000
that were already out.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I don't think there's any of those.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I didn't think Marble Madness was in one of the other collections.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And $29.99.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Huh.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
It's just, it's a bummer it's not online.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Or that they couldn't add something else to Sweet in the Pot.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Shitty.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Alright, back to the tweet I was on before the phone call came in.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Unfortunately, talking Sony and talking people moving up in Sony,

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
unfortunately, some people moving out.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
There was reorganization that affected some PR people.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Hopefully not people I was just talking about.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
That's kind of too bad.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
All employees are now apparently in the Foster City headquarters,

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
but there's no impact on game development.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
So like Sony, Santa Monica, and all that's fine.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Apparently this is in an article I've been linked to on GameSpot.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.000
There was a re-org and some PR people were in San Diego were let go.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Which, funny enough, I think was the studio where all that tester stuff happened.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Which might explain a little bit about, oh that's really sad.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
That's too bad.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
But it's all in Foster City.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
So hopefully some people got relocated at least maybe.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
But, bummer bummer.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000
This follows a closing of Zipper Interactive, which had happened back in March.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
They made SoCom and MAG.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And in April they said they were going to cut 10,000 jobs, but that was Sony-wide.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Wipeout developer studio Liverpool also had been closed this year.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
So a bunch of bummer news from Sony.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
We hope they're able to land on their feet soon.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And maybe they'll sell some VITAs so they can hire them back.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get into tonight?

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Or Dark Soccer if you have any.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
No.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Castle of Crashers is coming to the Steam next week.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Nice.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
26.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Only took what, four years?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Nice.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
There's a Half-Life 3 rumor that it's open world and coming in 2013.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Oh my.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It's from an anonymous source too.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I think that's true.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Extremely trustworthy.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Extremely.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And I guess there's also an article I just read about publishers apparently trying to exploit Kickstarter.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Basically getting, this is actually coming from the last one.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
It was Obsidian.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Now they have their Kickstarter.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.000
They said, we were actually contacted by some publishers over the last few months that wanted us to do a Kickstarter.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I said to them, so you want us to do a Kickstarter for using our name.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
We then get Kickstarter money to make a game.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Then you publish the game, but we don't get to keep the brand we make.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
We only get a portion of the profits.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And they said yes.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Wow.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
To which he said, fuck off.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
No surprise.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Anything else? That's it.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Well that brings us to the end of the show.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I know it was a little bit shorter tonight, but that's what happens when we tape on a Sunday that we're not used to.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
But before we close out tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Before I get into that, I do want to thank everybody for listening and for being here this week.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.000
We will be back in our normal time slot live on Sunday night on the 30th with episode number 475.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
We are talking behind the scenes about some possible changes in the future Orange Launch Radio.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Nothing major.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I just wanted to leave you that little sampling to go with.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
So that could be in the coming weeks.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Certainly before episode 500.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Spread the word.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Leave us a nice review on iTunes.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Especially now that podcasting is in a separate application in the iOS 6.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
We can use all the word of mouth we can get.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Also there's some great third party apps like Stitcher that you can listen to Orange Launch Radio in.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And it looks like, looking at the stats on Stitcher, more and more of you are.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
So we really appreciate that.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And if you've enjoyed our show on Stitcher, please consider sharing it with your friends.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And leaving some good comments on there too.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
You know, word of mouth is all we got right now.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And it's all we've had over the past 10 years.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Dan the man, thank you very much for being on the show tonight and fighting with your wife.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Always a good time to have that going on on air.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I like turtles.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Is that your final thought tonight? Do you have a final thought tonight, Dan?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
He's shaking his head. I guess it's I like turtles.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Alright, Dark Sakura.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I want dinner.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
You want dinner.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
And I didn't make a fortune cookie.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
What do you want from Disneyland?

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Stuff. You got it.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Duffy. Stuff. I guess.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Loki. Your final thought tonight?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I guess I'll play some more Minecraft.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
My final thought tonight is, don't hate me because I went to Disneyland.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
It's the last trip for at least a year.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
So, womp womp. Sadness.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
It's okay, I'm going in two weeks.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Alright, that's it. Have a wonderful night everybody.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
We'll see you next time at Orange Launch Radio.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Thanks for listening to this slightly shorter edition.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
We'll see you next week for a full show. Good night.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Orange Launch Radio or FOG Network.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
But you know they were all still true.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
See you next week.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Thanks for watching!
