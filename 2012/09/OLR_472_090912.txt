Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts?
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
Tonight September 9th, 2012
Rumors return about Valve creating a new console
The homebrew scene may have cracked the Vita
And one company finally decides to end their controversial DRM method
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 9th of 2012
Oh, it's September 9th, you know what that means
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear Dreamcast
Happy birthday to you
Okay, speed mix
I was gonna say it's a little early for my birthday
We're almost to your birthday though
That's right, you've got, your birthday's just two days away, Techmaster Loki
We've gone and screwed up the intro, everything is all amiss
Sorry, I can't talk yet
That's alright
I've been shunned
You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki
Please say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining us tonight
Hi, you can introduce Jamie first
I've decided to do things different tonight
Differently
Also say hello to Grammar Master Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
She'll cut a bitch
I will cut a bitch
I don't even care
How are you doing?
Um, yeah
Okay, great
We are live of course at The Voice of Geeks Network
VoGnetwork.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific
9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
I gotta say, props to Bobby
I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like
6, 7 years now
Had our shows back to back, he had an A plus show tonight
He had an interview with Gearbox Software
And some of the guys over there, it addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy
And then Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place
Must listen episode, loved it
So check that out at VoGnetwork.com, it'll be posted later tonight
I love when Bobby rants
But hopefully you'll listen to our show, I know usually he's so nice and inviting
And you know, oh we're gonna have the listeners on the show
And he doesn't get angry very often, but that was
I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley
Bang bang
A little bit, a little bit, alright
He needs more flannel vests in order to hold out
He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers
Well look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview
With the game developer this week
But we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio
The O.L. Army have been asking for for quite some time
We have the return surprise of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio
Say hello everybody to Dan
Dan is back tonight
Yo, what up?
How you doing Dan?
I'm doing good
For those who don't know Dan, I'm sorry
For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky
Dan is Dark Soccer's husband
Yes
Or me
It's gonna be one of those
Shut up
See, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight
They are just gonna fight all night long, good times
Just like any other day
Dan, since, how long has it been since you've been on the show?
It's been a good at least six months, right?
I don't know, it's been a while
Alright, well I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners
Between, you know, six months ago and now
So tell us a little bit about your gaming history
Why do you love video games?
And I know you love video games, don't even try to lie
I like to keep it special
Just show up once in a while, you know at random
Nobody knows when I'm coming
But the games, the games
I'm like a ninja
Why do you like video games?
I don't know
He's really having to think about this one
They've just always been there
Video games have always been there?
Yeah
Even when Jamie's yelling at you?
You can turn to video games?
No, no, I mean like, in the past
That's kinda how we met, kinda
That and anime
Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fan fiction
Kind of more anime
So, what is your favorite video game of all time?
I always like to ask guests on the show this
It's a tough question
It's supposed to be a tough question
Symphony of the Night
That's a damn good game
Metal Gear Solid
You can go back a little bit further
There's a couple other good ones
Gunstar Heroes
How do you feel about that?
I like Gunstar Heroes a lot
Now, we were off last week
Strider
We didn't have a show last week
I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day
At the various conventions going on everywhere
What have you
So we were gone last week
So we missed some of last week's news
You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan
How do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?
I'm feeling pretty good
I was watching the trailer and I'm just like
Oh my god, it's so long
He changed his wallpaper
They keep introducing all these people
Okay, okay, whatever
Hey, it's Solid Snake
Well, Naked Snake
Hey, it's Snake
Awesome
He changed his wallpaper
Yeah, I put my snake wallpaper back up
Or the big boss wallpaper
Yeah
Because big boss is a fucking gangster
Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her
No, it doesn't
It's like this big intense face
He's like looking out of the screen like
I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error
Blue Screen of Death that you had before
That one is awesome
That's old
Yeah, but it's awesome
But it's old
But it's awesome
My wallpaper is far better than yours, thank you
I don't care
So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced
While we were off on break
Was Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns
No, no, no
It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
How dare I?
No, that's not worth it
It's Final Fantasy XIII III
Let's be real
That's what it is
But it's one of those weird Square Enix games
Where they're like
Hey, you know what?
We're gonna put that subtitle first
It's not gonna be a sub anymore
It is a title
Final Fantasy will take the back end
We'll just step down for a second
Guess we'll take the back end this time
We're giving them the money shot
Lightning's gonna explore the back door
Like to savor the last shot before
Popping the heat sink
Alright
We're gonna start off the show tonight
We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit
But I have a little bit something
I have something special to get into
At the top of the show tonight here
I'm gonna play something for you guys
And unfortunately you only get to see the audio
Or you only get to hear the audio of this
Cause it is a podcast
But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes
I'm gonna give you guys the premiere
Of the new Xbox One
And the new Xbox One
And the premiere of the new Xbox Live indie game
Bungee Ferret Tossing
It is coming out very soon
In fact the designer is gonna be on the line with us
In just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys
To talk a little more about this game
And yes it is an OLR inspired game
You might remember we used to come up with these little
Dream games, things we wanted to see
Like what was the one we had the what-they-play.com snap
Which was the, it's like Pokemon Snap
But it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head
Shouting fuck
It's like a really old reference to a news article
From like 2008
Like right now you probably just think that's insanity
And it is, that's a fun thing
But
What on the show is this saying
I don't even remember what inspired it
But we added the game
Bungee Ferret Tossing to the list
And Aaron went
And he actually made a game
Called Bungee Ferret Tossing
And it looks awesome
Here's the debut trailer
Here on Orange Lounge Radio
Do you love flying a helicopter?
Yeah!
Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?
Yeah!
Do you love blowing stuff up?
Yeah!
Do you love terrorists?
Awkward
Do you love blowing up terrorists?
Yeah!
Do you love flying a helicopter
Swinging from a bungee cord
And blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?
What?
Because that's what you do in
Bungee Ferret Tossing
That's right
Bungee Ferret Tossing
The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona
Which is good because now there's something in Arizona
But it's bad because it's a terrorist base
So armed only with the most advanced ferret weapons technology
You must attempt to storm their desert base
They'll come at you with guns
Rockets
High powered rifles
Higher engines
And even insane laughter
But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets
Proximity ferrets
Homing ferrets
And even cluster ferrets
Will it be enough?
Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games
Bungee Ferret Tossing also features two player co-op
Free difficulty modes
Full of survival and time attack modes
And a great soundtrack
Intense action
Bullet dodging grills
And the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else
That's Bungee Ferret Tossing
On Xbox Live Indie Games
Love, love, love, yyrgames.com for more information on that
What do you think DarkSakura?
I am pleased
I think that might have been your idea
Are you happy with how that turned out?
Quite
And I named the dude, the last name
That's right
I forgot what I named him
Let's get Erin or YYR on the line right now
To talk a little more about Bungee Ferret Tossing
And you guys are probably thinking there at home
Like, God, Orange Laundry
You're really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top
Yes we are
Fuck yes we are
Heck I'm thinking that, I'm at the show
When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas
Hey Erin, you there?
I mean, yes, yes I am
Can I just start by saying
I love you man
I love you man, seriously
I love you guys too
You're making our dream come true and I love it
I figured I'd take the ball and run with it
I mean, it sat on my plate for a while
But hey, you guys told me to get on that
And so, eventually, I did
Well we are happy that you did
So how long of a process did it take to grow
Well actually, let me back up a little bit
Because Bungee Ferret Tossing, it's almost done, right?
Like, we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?
The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now
Where other game creators basically try it out
Make sure it doesn't crash
Make sure there's nothing objectionable
Make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially
And, you know, other things are accurate
And then, you know, once they find that there's nothing wrong with it
They pass it
And once enough people pass it, it's approved
And then once it's approved, I click a button and it's out
So, I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend
Let me tell you something, there is some stuff up there right now
I would not wish on any of you
I play the game so you don't have to, yes
But, yes, it's actually, I just checked before the show
And it is 75% of the way through review
And it's only been up there since Friday night
So, this is going to happen very soon
I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days
That's all I'm saying
Oh, well, I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it
And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card
I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with
So, I'm just basically going to email everybody and be like
Hey, guess what's happening, like, right now, this game, it's coming out
Here's the trailer, here's a press kit
Do you want a review code?
And I'd like to do that before the game comes out
So, basically, it means I'll probably be doing this, like, pretty soon
Alright, I understand, yeah
Yeah, then I'm going to push the button
I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest
I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway
And, actually, this is kind of interesting
Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?
I have, this is kind of the answer to the Summer Games Arcade
And all the winter, like, all the other promotions they do for the big boy games
From the big companies, right?
Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow
And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising
Is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe
So, I'm going to be right there with them
So, that's actually kind of exciting
Because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way
And also the fact that it's a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing
Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat, because this is too good
And, by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room
live.vognetwork.com
Now, we understand that Bungee Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter
But we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity
Will there be nudity in Bungee Ferret Tossing?
Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere
And, of course, it's very fake and cartoony looking
No, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity
And, by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment
But it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once
That's alright, I'll tell you what you need to know
Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel
I mean, I'll tell you something
I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous
In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes
Amazing, well, let's put boobs on the list
No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry
I have to draw a line somewhere
I want it to be as family friendly as possible
You should have darkly colored chickens
Huge dark chickens
Dark chickens?
Yeah, from another old joke, big black cock
Oh, stop
We can do dark chickens, I'll put that on the list
Alright, that'll work
Let me say this real quick, Jessica Harper
from Our Good Pals The Understanding Live
Saturday nights here at VOG says
The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me
Oh my god
Did you even think of that?
I did not
We gotta be careful, because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation
But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this, so
Exploding ferrets
This is a fantastic idea
At least now there will be something in Arizona, there you go
Yeah, honestly, everyone I've ever talked to who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona
has basically said the same thing to me
There's nothing there
That is the whole reason why I put that in there
Basically I'm acknowledging what they said
Very nice, very nice
Alright, so let me think, I gotta ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight
But I wanted to bring you on, because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here
And even though you're the one that's ultimately gonna profit from it, I still think it's great
It has my full blessing
Let me tell you something, if this game does really well
I am totally gonna fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff
Like that is gonna be
Beer works
You can pay us in beer, sir
You got it, you got it
Amazing, amazing
It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway, so
We're fun, we promise
No exploding ferrets in person though, let's stay away from that
Okay, so quickly
I don't know, we could put a firecracker in one of the little ferrets
A little more about the game
One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet
I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you
But I can tell it has a great old arcade style look and feel to it
As all your previous games really have
You're very inspired by old school 80's arcade games, aren't you?
Just arcade games and intense action packed games in general
That's the only kind of game I'm ever gonna make because that's what I'm most into
So yeah, I don't know if it has an old looking vibe or what
But it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe because I'm not very good at it
I wouldn't say it's old looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like
If an Atari 2600 game was modern and that's certainly not a bad thing
We killed hours and hours and hours of boom and stuff, you know what I mean?
It has a Defender-ish look to it
Actually you're not the first person that compares it to Defender
Obviously you're not saving people, you're destroying them with ferrets
Yes you should
But yes, it has been compared to Defender before
Nice, but it's a whole new, it's not a Defender clone at all
It's a whole new, there's bungee cords
Defender meets Bionic Commando
Kinda, it's just
Exploding ferrets
It's new while feeling retro
And I think that's true in all your games
It's just awesome
Boom
Alright, well Erin before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR
What's going on in the gaming world this week
Anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?
You know what, it's been a very long process
I actually started this project last May
So it's been in the works for a very long time
I nonetheless have had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it
And I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together
It'll be a dollar, it'll be free to try
And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it
Do you want to hear very quickly the wishlist for the sequel?
Absolutely
Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this
Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking
Alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers
Elemental ferrets, fire, ice and lightning
Strife amethysts
Yes, not chaos emeralds because we can't rip off anybody
Credits will contain a rhythm game
Other vehicles besides helicopter, like bungee from a motorboat, yes
Dedicated sound for missile launch
Screen-clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered anytime
Ferrets equipped with milk tea
Money should be used to buy stuff
Oh, yes, raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club
These trained ferrets would then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game
Deformable landscapes summon killer train to attack enemies
An eagle operating a crane needs to be a stage boss
Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city
Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, wow, Bungee Ferret Tossing 2 sounds epic
But hold on guys, don't sell the original short
The original is still going to be amazing and blow your mind
It's just, you know, this may soon, if it does well, wink wink nudge nudge
This may soon become the start of a new trilogy
You know what, I would love to bring that to you guys
I got a quick question
Yes, Dan?
Are there any zombies in it?
Not yet
Only you'll become if you play the game too much
There are no indie games without zombies
There's plenty of indie games
So you gotta put some zombies in
Let me tell you something
Every indie game has zombies
There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games
That's what I'm saying
I'm saying every indie game has zombies
So we need some zombie ferrets
You know what there is in the game though, and maybe I hope I'm not spoiling anything
There are kittens in the game
Are they zombies?
Maybe
They're just played on the screen when you run the game that says
Please don't throw animals in real life
Yeah we can't do that with my cat, she's too huge
Oh I could
There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens
But we'll see
Anyway, okay, Aaron I gotta wrap up and let you go
But everybody be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing
It will be out in the coming days
We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process
But it will be out very soon
And it's a dollar for heaven's sake
We never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio
But we're gonna say buy this
Because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games
That are having a lot of spotlight this week
We really want Aaron to be able to do well
So when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar
You probably already have it in your leftover points anyway
And go buy this game
If you follow Y Y R Games on Twitter you'll know exactly when it comes out
I will tweet the moment it releases
And check out the website of course Y Y R Games dot com
You have other games
We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight
But you have other games on the market place
Like Snake 360 and Falling
That are worth checking out absolutely
I appreciate that
Old arcade game style stuff
Alright, Aaron have a good one buddy
Thank you again
Hey you too
Thanks so much for having me on
Alright of course
Take care
Bye bye
You know, and if you're gonna make a game inspired by an Orange Zones Radio idea
I'll bring you on at the top of the show too
Let's be real
I am super excited
I know I can't wait to play it
And I'm not just saying that because we're involved
It just, it looks like fun
I can't wait
Ionotropic said ferret returns, bungee ferret tossing 13
I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels
But we gotta make this one a success first
Cause if this is a flop then Aaron's gonna be like
Maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money
Zombies
Zombies are overrated
Alright alright
Let's move into how was your gaming week
What types of video games
You obviously haven't been playing bungee ferret tossing
It's not out yet
But what have you been playing this week
Let's start with Dark Sakura
Wow, in mass effect
Three
For a change
And two
Shut up
Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night
It was the zombie one
See, zombies overrated
And I hadn't played through it yet
So
What the fuck man
I have also been doing school stuff this week
And writing
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming
And writing
So I have a life
Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week
How about you bite me
You just completely and totally squirt the whole segment
How about you bite me
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming either
How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me
Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio
Where every gamer has a voice
And they might use it to fight with their spouse
Live on air
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Dark Sakura
Of course not
And then I shot my husband in the face
It's just mass effect and World of Warcraft
Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan
How was your gaming week
I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare
That was it
But zombies
It was pretty good
Yeah
Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out
And it just sort of sat on the shelf
And then for whatever reason this week I was like
You know what, I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies
Oh, and I did
You like to do a lot of
Oh, and he cursed a lot too
You like to do
Oh, yeah
You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs too
Like you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV
So you can kind of like watch people play games
And stuff, right
Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube
Yeah, you think that's a weird thing
And wrestling
I don't think it's a weird thing
Kind of to an extent
Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling
Well, I will say this
I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week
It was something on the Game Boy
It was like, was it DuckTales on the game
No, it was something even more obscure
Was it Mega Man
No, it was even more obscure than that
It was some licensed game
Oh, The Simpsons
It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy
And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch
Oh, yeah
It was Bart vs The Juggernauts
Well, because a lot of these games are stuff that I've known existed
But I was always just like, what the fuck is this about
And there's like this World of Long Plays channel on YouTube
And they do just these really good high definition long plays of games
And to an extent it's like, I'd like to check this game out
But God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it
So that's kind of the best way to go
It's a good way to sample stuff too
A lot of the new stuff
Yeah, well, you know
A lot of these games suck
So it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them
Alright, fair enough
Alright, anything else you want to say about your gaming week, Dan?
Uh, no
Okay, let's go to Loki
Zombies
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3
A little bit of that
And then I also played McPixel
Because I bought that on my Android phone
And it's pretty fun, it's like a cross between
The old LucasArts point and click adventure games
And MacGyver
But really dirty
Dirty MacGyver?
Like dirty MacGyver
Okay
Because basically each one of the
Like every single puzzle in the game is
You have 20 seconds to defuse the bomb
You don't know where the bomb is
You don't know how you have to defuse it
But you just have to figure out how to interact with stuff
And what you need to do
And most of the, well a lot of the puzzles
Involve kicking someone in the nuts
And then some of them
To defuse a bomb?
To defuse a bomb
That's how I play Scribblenauts
Is the bomb in their pants?
Sometimes, yeah
It's just, it's such a weird game
And it's awesome though
I don't know why but I'm suddenly reminded of the game
Don't Shit Your Pants
Which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?
Yeah
But yeah, it just, it gets really strange
But it's definitely worth checking out
Either, I think it's also on PC as well
But yeah, McPixel
Really, really crazy but fun
So I played through the entire game of that
And then Minecraft
I've been playing a lot of Minecraft on PC
Finally launched the VoG network server
I actually have a remote server that I run now
Tell us more about this
Because we need more people on it
Yes, it's a server
It's a whitelisted server
So basically you go to the forum thread on the VoG forums
And you say, hey, I want to be let in
And I add your name to the whitelist
And you can go in and build
And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome
And up on a hill is the clubhouse
You go in there, take a set of tools
Or use that as a home base for a while
Until you figure out what you're going to do
And then go off and build
And it's just a survival thing
It's kind of fun
Maybe we could have OLR Village
Yeah, I think that's kind of the idea
Is that everybody would have their own little house and stuff
Yeah, you just build a house wherever
I still don't have the game and I'm probably not gonna
You got to check, even if you don't buy the game yourself
At some point have one of us give you a tour
Because it's pretty cool just seeing what other people have created
Like in retrospect
That's fun
In retrospect though, I think I might have built myself
Actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing
Which I don't, I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that
So maybe we can get something on YouTube
But anyway, we'll work on that later
But I was playing that this week on the server
And I built a sad little house
But I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode
You do have limited mobs
You're on like the easy mode
But you gotta have some mobs
To give some challenge, right?
Well, easy mode still has all the mobs
They just don't do all the damage
Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode
And the other day we were just fucking around
Because since I'm the admin
I can switch shit all the time
Like right now I'm basically playing
Or I was playing in creative mode
Because I was
Let's put it this way
When we first started the server
I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff
And then I had Bobby telling me
Hey, I can't go into the clubhouse
I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?
Yeah, the door doesn't work
Huh? That's weird
Okay, whatever
I was like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse
I'm like, what?
Why couldn't you go into the clubhouse?
Well, apparently I built it too close to the spawn point
And see, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point
And build stuff and stuff like that
Other players cannot
So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through
Because it wasn't updating the block that was there
So I had to tear it all down
And build it up on a hill
Which is kind of funny, but
It looks great though
Because now you have that waterfall and everything
Yeah, so we were doing that
But anyway, so
Like I said, I was fucking around
Because I was in creative mode
And so you can spawn whatever you want
Including monster eggs that spawn
Monsters
So my friend's like
You know, I was telling him about the endermen
And he's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those
I'm like, alright
So I spawned one and he fought it
And he killed it pretty easily
I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy
I'm like, okay
So I spawned 20 of them
But you will not make a habit out of spawning random endermen
No, no, no
This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch
Because we were just spawning all sorts of garbage
It was hilarious
It will be real
By the way, if you do go on the VoG Network server and play
It will be really easy to find my house
Because I thought I went way far away to go build it
But apparently not
Because Loki and I have already managed to connect our mines
It did not take very long
It's a temporary mine
I'm going to abandon mine anyways
Because I'm going to build somewhere else
It just wasn't very feasible right there
But yeah, there's stuff around
I've got to figure out a way to
Maybe we'll put up a sign on our house
That's like, hey, property blah blah blah
You know, so you don't like accidentally
I mean, because someone can go into my mine
And that's fine, I don't really give a crap
But yeah, there's a ton of
Go ahead
It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game
I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in the Sims
And build underground
Live in a cave
Which you can do
Oh yeah, I mean, that's easy
A lot of people kind of do that
They have their main house
And they build little outposts as they're in the mine
That's a very common thing to do
I mean, just living underground
Now I did see a cool video
Where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf
Area was in Lord of the Rings
Nice
It was really cool
Nice
Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that
It's more like just creative mode
Which we can, you know, if no one wants to play as a rival mode
We can do that
But I didn't want to do like creative mode
Because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything
Because it's like, eh, who cares
You know, I have all the objects
I don't need to go find whatever
I think it's fine
I haven't died yet
Yeah, I've come close
But I haven't died yet
This is still how I play the Sims
But, I mean, and trust me
When I'm not building that, you know, clubhouse
I am actually playing survival mode
And I'm not actually cheating
I don't have, like, diamond armor or anything
So I'm just playing legit
But, you know, aside from building the start area
You know, that obviously is doing creative
So vognetwork.com forums
If you want to join us, and please do
But don't destroy my house
Or I will find you and I will kill you
Yeah, and we've got plenty of server space
I can host up to 35 people at a time
And I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once
Good times
Yeah
Not yet
Please join
Not yet
Yes
Anything else for your gaming week?
No, that's it
Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already
I bought Minecraft PC this week
Solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server
So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there
That are not in the Xbox One
Is it worth the 20 bucks?
I think it's really fun
I do
I bought the 360 version
I thought it was pretty slick
And I started to get bored of it
And the PC version is, like, so much better
Yeah, the PC one you can mod
And do all that stuff too as well
Like, Alan's helping me get a map mod
Which I think would be very useful
Yeah, any of that stuff's okay
As long as it's not like, hey, mod two
You know, x-ray mod and stuff like that
And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin
So I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now
Walking around in armor, so, you know
But, yeah
Just like in real life
Yeah, just like in real life and I'm not wearing a shirt
Well, I was gonna say, yeah
It's definitely worth it and there's a lot more to do
Plus, the thing is
The one thing that really turned me off about Minecraft originally
Was using keyboard and mouse
Especially on my laptop, it's touchpad and keyboard
And I said, fuck that
So I actually have, and I even linked it in there
There's a, you know, program you can use with x-pad
Or to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller
And that's actually how it plays
With an Xbox 360 controller
And it's awesome
It's great if you play the 360 version
Sweet
Alright, the rest of my gaming week
I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news
Because we've been pretty lengthy so far
I'm just gonna say
More World of Warcraft, surprise
But I got my sixth level 85
Cue the womp womp
Whatever, don't judge me
And then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3
Because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now
So if you are a PlayStation Plus person
You can get Borderlands for free
Which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel
I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus
But I am not one to turn down a free game
Especially one that I was enjoying on the PC
And the only problem I'm having is that
It was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse
Than it is with the PlayStation 3 controller
That's the only bummer
But the game looks good
And it runs really smooth
You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3
Couple little graphical glitches here and there
But nothing that's a game ruining experience
A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands
And I really like the whole fusion of a role playing game in a first person shooter
It makes the first person shooters very accessible
So, love it
That's mostly it
So, for this week that I can think of
Let's do some housekeeping
And then we're gonna get into some big news tonight
Right at the top, right Loki?
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
If you wanna join us on Facebook
Twitter.com slash OLR
If you wanna join us on Twitter
And you can always follow us there
And keep on top of what's new with the show
And when we're gonna have weeks off or what have you
Speaking of weeks off
Dark Sakura will not be here next week
But we will still be doing a show
Maybe we can get Dan to come back
I don't know, we'll see
It's a holiday
Alright, moving on
Starting off
News tonight, Loki
So apparently there is a
There's this thing that went around the internet
It's funny cause I get to watch it happen
There's a distributor that leaked
The Wii U pricing and
The release date, that's just so weird
And they listed three skews
And the price is anywhere from
$249.99 to
$349.99 and
Yeah, it's so weird
Never heard that before, crazy
It's funny because
I saw it, I was actually reading
Go Nintendo and
Funny enough, it's actually my company
So a little bit
A little bit of shock there, I was like
But to be clear, it wasn't you
No, it wasn't me
That was the funny thing, it wasn't me
It was some dude goes by Hound Dog
On YouTube
Which we tracked down
Which I'll get into in just a second here
So yeah
It's a little weird, I don't like to talk about
Where I work because you know
It comes back to me sometimes
It did once before
It did once
It's documented, people know what happened
Honestly
Quite surprised that the Wii U stuff hasn't
But see
I've kind of removed anything that points
Me back to my company
But yeah
It's funny though, everybody
This is not necessarily a story about
Information I pretty much already told you guys
Based off of
This information
That I've known for a while now
And also other information pointing to the release
Date of the 18th
Which is
PDP leak and of course some other
Games that are going to be announced probably this week
That are going to be launching on
The 18th that kind of point to
That release date
Is how
The gaming media works
And watching how it works is really
Interesting
How there's literally
Copy pasted stories, no research done
And then it starts playing the telephone game
Where it gets even more ridiculous
And I kind of, I don't know if anyone's followed my
Twitter, you kind of saw a little bit of that
Because I kept posting articles like
LOL, did they really just do that?
So it started off in games facts
It went to go Nintendo
And other Nintendo kind of
Websites started running it
And one of the things that kind of got back
To the higher
Ups at our company because we
Started getting calls from our customers
Was the fact that
They go, oh
This distributor
Supplies Amazon over stock
And blah blah blah
True, we work, we do sell stuff
To Amazon but we're not the main
Supplier for Amazon
It makes it sound like
Basically a lot of these places
Were just like, oh Amazon distributor
Leaks price because that
Headline gets a lot more hits
And it adds a little bit more credence
To the information in there
Despite the fact the funny part is the date's
Wrong
It's a placeholder date, it's not right
At all, no one knows
What the real date is
Well, I mean I speculate what the real date
Is, but that date's not it
Which is funny because everyone's like
Well that doesn't go with the rumors
I've heard that it's the 18th
That's a week before, but it's a Sunday, I guess it's real
But like
CNET, I think out of all the
Stories I saw from
The different blogs, CNET's probably the
Funniest one, and I don't know who this
Guy is, but
He first, he put the text
You know, that was the text information
He's like, yeah okay, so it was the Wii U system
1111, and 249
299, 349
But then I got this
Additional information
A screenshot of the website
Oh, that backs up the information
Oh wait, I got another source
It's a video, it's like you're a fucking idiot
They're all the same goddamn thing
It's the same goddamn source
And you're like sourcing two other things
To make it sound like that it's
More legit
Some comments from our chatroom at
Live.vognetwork.com
Costa journalism
Frisbee says, control C, control
V, that's how the stories go from you
To me
I like that
There's like a little song about that
WhatupG says it would be cool if it was November 11th
But November 18th makes sense at least
Historically for Nintendo, that's the exact
Same day they released
The Wii, the GameCube?
One of the other systems was the exact same day
So, Mr. Dan
Having a background in video
Games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense
As a release date
Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays
It's really irritating
And it does also make sense about the 11th that
They will be sending them out early
Because, you know, the stores
Don't get it, you know, it doesn't just magically spawn
In the store Sunday morning
You know, we have it hidden away somewhere
So that you can't get it
You can't steal it
So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it
And post it on the internet
No, you never put other people down
Here's the funny part
Like I said before, you know
There is this guy, this anonymous guy
Hound dog, who leaked it
Dude
First rule of the internet
Anything that you post on the internet
Always stays on the internet
So, when you post
A video or whatever
And then
You know, think that we're not gonna figure it out
First off, his video
Basically it was a video of a screenshot
Had a time and date
In the bottom corner
Stupid
Because, you know what we could do?
We went back, we looked at our web access logs
And guess what?
We query every single search
On there
Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U
And
During that time frame, there was only two
And then
And then it was basically two different customers
Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs
And then
Oh, guess what? You do a Google
Cache search on, you know, Hound dog
And oh, he has a trailer
An advertisement for a certain
Store that happens to be one
Of the two customers
Oh, Guerrilla Games and Saint
Cloud
Don't hold back now
So what happened?
Did anybody go to the guy
And say, why'd you do it?
Honestly, I don't know
Because this was stuff that was handled
By managers and upper management
And stuff like that, because funny
Like I said, this had nothing to do with me
I do item setup sometimes
For a lot of games, but I don't do
First party because our buyer for some goddamn reason
Wants to hold on to first party even though
She fucks everything up
So
She set that up, she didn't
Flag it to not show up on our website
Even though maybe she should've
And it wasn't any of my
Customers that leaked the information
So I just sat back and kind of like
Lol
Frisbee said she should've used the free Wi-Fi
At Starbucks
Oh yeah, that was the other thing too, his IP
Pointed back to Saint Cloud as well
Whatever, anyway, this is all in
Moot Point come Thursday
Exactly, it's all in Moot Point and the whole thing
Blew over pretty fast, except for the fact that
Amazon's like, we need an apology
From you, we need you
Blah blah blah, Nintendo of course
On people's asses about, hey
You know, this is not supposed to be
Which only leads credit to the fact
That it's probably true
Except that the date's not right, but you know
I mean, some information's obviously
Accurate, like the pricing
And like I said
If you've been listening to this show
For the last few months
This is no
This is not news to you
Put it that way
I just find it funny though
Like how, seriously
Copy paste all these articles are
And like, big comp- like
IGN, and what the fuck, okay
Seriously, let's step aside here
What the fuck is it with IGN
And GameSpot where
You have an article, okay
And there's not that much information
In this article, it's like, okay
Distributor, three prices, three skews
November 11th date
They have an article, and then they have
A video in the article, that's talking about
The article
Why do they, and why is it some
British guy, it's always a British guy
People don't like to read
They're like, having some intern guy read this
Dude, and there's this like
This distributor, we can't get
Into their website because you need to log in
And password, but this guy got in
And he got this exclusive information
And blah blah blah, and
People don't like to read
It's ridiculous
I feel ignorant without IGN
Well it's funny you say that, because people
Can't read, but there is somewhat
Truth to that, because this makes a very
Interesting companion piece to
Bobby's show before us tonight, and the whole
Girlfriend mode thing
And how that kind of got carried away
And all that as well, and that's because people
Didn't really want to read the entire article
They just wanted to read the part where
Oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode
Because he clearly hates women
I think it was a poor
Choice of words, but really people just need to get over it
But, I mean, we all make poor
Choice of words sometimes, I mean, thank God
No one really does listen to this show, except
You know, you fell for, because God, we've
Said shit on this show that would have gotten us
Through the coals in the past, because
That's unfortunately the way
Our little internet medium works
Sometimes, and it's- There's no one, no one pays attention
To us, but they'll pay attention to like
Joe Schmo, I mean like
Seriously, like MTV
Like, it went
It went everywhere, it went to MTV's
Website, they're the gaming block, it went to
IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET, it went
Well CNET takes stuff from Yahoo
Or, I mean, vice versa
I think that's just saying that people want to know
The Wii U date already
I understand that, but it's just, it's so ridiculous
How, I literally got one
Email from an independent site
Asking the, you know, follow up on that
One person
Fucking hilarious, because what did Bobby
Ran about on his show, just, just
An hour ago, what was Bobby's ran on his show
About his exclusive interview with Gearbox
How did he get that exclusive interview?
He asked
And here's the other thing too that was funny about
Nobody else had asked
Here's the other thing that was funny about the CNET article
And then we went to our gaming gurus
In the, in the
In the office
And they, yeah we talked to this editor
And he said, yeah that sounds like that could be real
Really? Really? That is your
Fucking, like, proof
This guy just says, yeah that sounds like
Feasible information
Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a
Millionaire? Ask the experts
Are you on a game show?
It's like, yeah, yeah
That seems feasible
Hey Joe Schmo who plays some video games that
Delivers our mail, do you think that this release date
Sounds like it could be real?
Sounds right
It was the release date
I have no information to back that up
But it sounds like a date to me
I mean it is a date and it hasn't happened
Yet so um
I guess it could happen
Anyways, let me just, let me just stop right here
And reiterate what I've said
In the past
Okay, three SKUs, $249, $299
$349, $299 SKU I
Speculate, Wii U system
Tablet, that's it
It's in case you already have a Wii
A Wii system, Speculate
Okay, because I don't know any information other than
Three prices
Oh and November 18th release date, but that's also
Speculation based on information, but whatever
Um, not information that I have
From Nintendo, nothing from Nintendo
Um, $299
SKU, System
Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus
Nunchuck, in case you don't
Own a Wii U
Or a Wii system
$349 SKU
System, Gamepad, Nunchuck
Remote Plus
Nintendo Land, that's my guess
So we'll see in a few days if I'm right
We'll find out on Thursday
It's going to be a busy week between the iPhone 5
On Wednesday, and then Nintendo on Thursday
This is Tech Christmas in some ways
So we'll uh, the blogs
Will be busy this week copy pasting
From each other
When they're not live blogging
Because that's the other big thing, live blogging
Anyhow, I think I just
Gave Loki an aneurysm
Let's move on, let's move on to something a little more
Indie, shall we? Something a little more under the radar
Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to
It's Steam Greenlight
Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?
It's a chance for you to basically
Help, I don't want to say it's Kickstarter
Because it's not, but it's helped generate
Buzz for indie games
People that want to get their ideas
Out there to be approved by the community
To be sold on Steam
Well, when this first went live
A lot of people were putting
A lot of crap on there
Things like Half Life 3
Showed up on Steam Greenlight
And things of that sort
So in order to kind of curb this
Valve decided to set a $100
Fee to get your project listed
On Steam Greenlight
This fee goes to Child's Play
Pretty interesting solution
A pretty ingenious way to figure it out
The Valve UI designer
Alden Kroll said
Quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play
We have no interest in making money from this
But we do need to cut down the noise
In the system
Which is causing a little bit of controversy
Because some people think, well for a true indie
$100 is a lot of money
Blah blah blah blah blah
What do you guys think? Is this fair?
I think it's a good way to make sure
People are serious about it
I think it's fair
And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice
I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing
So, very cool
Also some other changes to the system
Now when you log in
And look at Steam Greenlight
You're gonna see a smaller list
You're not gonna get thrown everything at you
Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see
Popular games and new games
On Steam Greenlight
I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna
Does that have anything to do with
Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?
It's a sequel. It's the one that was on Kickstarter
I'm gonna go upvote that right after the show
They have a demo you can play
Really? Already?
Yeah, it's pretty sweet
Over 700 submissions already since August 30th
One thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight
Just for the record
Sex games
There was a game called Seduce Me
That was on Project Greenlight
And yes, it was removed
And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve
Said, quote,
Steam has never been a leading destination
For erotic material
Greenlight doesn't aim to change that
And what a shame
Alright, I guess we can understand
Why they don't want that stuff associated
With sex is overrated
Well, because of the media sensation that would occur
Think about it
If they were to sell Booby Game
Then suddenly it's gonna be on CNN
And there would be the commentators
On Fox News
Oh my god
Can you believe on Steam
The Booby Games that are corrupting our children
They don't let your dirty money
It's Booby Steam
So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that
But I wish people weren't so freakin'
Uptight? Stick up their ass?
Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes
Have their game, dammit
Hehe, boobs
You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing
When you tell a little kid they can't do something
What's the first thing they want to do?
Just go out and do it
Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things
You know, like, vowel language
Or fucking
People are just gonna want to see it more
Going to
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
Missworldnude13
For Greenlight
Excellent suggestion
Saig, who knows a thing or two about
Developing games, is in our chatroom saying
The Greenlight stuff is cheaper
Than any other commercial game seller
Steam is $100
For one time
iOS is $99 a year
Mac is another $99 a year
So, very interesting perspective
On what that $100
If that really is too much money
Or what, is that, you know
That's the same price you're gonna pay for iOS
Which is seen as a huge indie boom
I'm sorry, it's the same amount
For one year, and then you have to renew on
iOS where you don't with Steam
It's basically
Like the free to play model
If you think about it
You buy the game, or you buy, you know
You pay your $100, and you're done
So
Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says
Yeah, like
Unbaptized babies lactating out of
Cleopatra's nipple. Oops, that was
Dante's Inferno
Good point
Alright, let's move on
Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome
Dark Sakura
Well, I don't know how clean it is, but
It's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill
About the whole
Steam box thing that we've talked about before
There is a job listing
For an industrial designer
On Valve's website
And I'll read the quote on here
We're frustrated by the lack of innovation
In the computer hardware space
So we're jumping in
Even basic input, keyboard and mouse
Hasn't really changed any meaningful way over the years
So basically, they're trying to
I guess, expand further
But they're still kind of denying the whole
Steam box thing
Why do these rumors keep perpetuating
Everywhere? It's interesting
Although, it does have me thinking
If Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time
It's because they keep hiring
For people for that
That's why
When you have someone that's being hired for like
Hardware design
Steam software
It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year
Or anytime soon
For example, they hired console developers
For Diablo 3 at Blizzard
Doesn't mean that we've seen
Diablo 3 on consoles yet
Maybe it'll happen next year
Or maybe not
I don't even see it being its own sort of system
Maybe the potential of having something as a
Computer add-on
You know
Like a combination storage device
Maybe graphics boosting
It would seem so easy
To just do a little PC in a box
That plays very basic Steam games
You know, what the hell's an Ouya?
It's kind of like that
Very, very, very bare bones
Type of system that just plugs in your TV
Maybe Valve could pump
Another couple hundred dollars worth of tech
Into it and have something that could play Portal
See, I could do that. It's called my computer
Well, they could sell it
That I already have
That I play Mass Effect on
Alright, well since we are talking
About Valve, there was something else
Valve going on this week and
I want to invite our resident Valve fanboy
At Orange Lounge Radio here on the program
To talk a little bit about this
So welcome to the show everybody, Alan!
How you doing Alan?
How was your gaming week? What have you been playing lately?
Mass Effect 3
How's the multiplayer weekend going for you?
I haven't done it yet, I need to get on that
Oh my gosh, you better hurry, you don't have much time
Bejeweled? What's with this new Bejeweled addiction you got going on?
I just remembered that Bejeweled 2 was good
And I found a copy of 3
So why not?
So what did you want to talk about tonight?
I have Half-Life news
So
In June 2004
To show off the, at the time, brand new
Source engine
That Half-Life 2 was going to come out on
In November of that year
Valve put out Half-Life Source
They basically piped the original Half-Life game
Into the Source engine
And it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done
It's like, okay
It has better lights and physics
But otherwise, it's Half-Life
1998 game
And it kind of ticked off about it
So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source project
They are just amateur programmers
They're not professionals
Not getting paid to do this, and they said
We are going to take Half-Life
And literally redesign it and program it
From the ground up
Into the Half-Life 2 engine
They had a fiasco in 2009
Where they released a really awesome trailer
And ultimately
The game didn't come out because they're like
This isn't done
They went out on a media blackout
For the last three years
And it's coming September 14th, they finally announced
That's very interesting
So because they got burned the first time
It was entirely their fault
But they went underground with it
They didn't update the Twitter, YouTube
No leaked screenshots, they're like
We are off the grid, we're still working on it
Dan just said
Sounds like Valve to me
But this isn't Valve
But Valve is kind of embracing it
Some companies would cease and desist
The shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger
Remake in Square Enix
Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there
Right?
I think they asked them to change
The name because there was some confusion
That Valve was doing it
And Valve wasn't offended
That people thought
That they themselves were making it
But they were like, you guys need to name this something else
So that people will be aware that it's an indie project
And it's your project
This is your thing
I think it's already got its clearance on Steam
Green light
Shock
Steam is probably going to host it
What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life
If anything
Get people interested in the franchise
Again, considering that it's been
8 years since Half-Life 2
Proper came out
And a good 5 years
Since Episode 2 came out
And there's still not a people
About Valve for Half-Life 3
So they also
Said for this remake
They added some dialogue
They did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it
More interesting, but otherwise it's a shot for shot
Remake
The trailer is still on YouTube from 3 years ago
If you haven't seen the trailer, you should watch it
It's really awesome
And so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out?
It's free, why wouldn't I?
And you'll be playing through it?
So I'll see you in a week?
Before we say goodbye for now
Thank you for the update
I unfortunately am very ignorant
When it comes to Half-Life
We don't have time to play every single game
But Alan will make me play it
At some point I'm sure
And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it
Tigerclaw in our chat room says
It's better they continue working on it
And when they feel it's ready, to release it
No reason to release a buggy game
If Half-Life 3 ever comes out
It'll probably go multi-platform
The reason I'm teasing Alan with that idea
Is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles
Maybe it'll be a PC and
Playstation 4 exclusive
Or something like that
That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy
About the game
We shall see, however
Alright, let's move on with some other news
Loki
To register participation for this week's episode
Of Orange Lounge Radio on
vognetwork.com
Use the passphrase, thumb
So this is kind of interesting
I talked about a game I played during the week
Which is called McPixel
And this weekend they actually
Went about a unique way to advertise the game
It's on the front page
Of the Pirate Bay
Pirate Bay being a very notorious
Website for
Piracy
McPixel, they have a
Basically a little bit of a letter
To people, it's like
Hi, I'm SOS
Video games, but not in a big company
I make games I want to make
I know that not everyone
Can afford entertainment, but everyone needs it
And even though I make games
For a living
I am most happy to just see people
Enjoy them
So today you can download a torrent of my game
And if you like, throw some coins
In my general direction
And so they actually have that on there
You can download a torrent
For it and download it for free
Or you can
Once you've done that and you play it
You can decide to donate money to
You know, to them
Isn't this what Radiohead did for one of their albums
Like five years ago?
I don't remember, but I know that this is what
Also like
Oh, the RiffTrax guys do
Because they're like, listen, we know that
Not everybody, you know, downloads these from us
But, you know, if you like them
You know, maybe kick us some money
Well, RiffTrax is in a little
Bit of a stickier situation though
Because they are doing parody art
Of movies that you kind of already
Have to own, like they can't put it out there
Attaching it to the movie
So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff
For them to get that, but
You know, they're in a weird place
It's also a lot more convenient than trying to sync that stuff up
Because I've synced that stuff up before
Like I'll have, we watch all the Twilight movies
With the RiffTrax stuff on there
And I had the DVD for Twilight
But man, downloading the
Precinct stuff is way easier than
Having to have a second source
To play the MP3 at the same time as the audio
Because it gets off sync pretty easy
Alright
Um
What do you think, um, I mean
I don't know if there's a lot to think about this
Because clearly no big publisher is ever
Going to do anything like this, but
Do you think the guy will actually make some money?
He'll probably make some money, I mean the game's not that expensive
He probably didn't spend that much
Money on it, so
I mean, it's exposure to him
And, you know, if he figures that people are gonna
Pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces
And saying, hey, you know what
Um, at least donate some money
If you like it, you know, donate a dollar, five dollars
Whatever
It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity
About a game that, let's be real,
People probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway
Unfortunately
It's really hard for indie games to get press
Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere
Yeah, exactly, and the other thing too
Like, you look at some of the people, it's much like
The Humble Bundle, where, you know, some people
Just pay a penny or whatever to get it
But there's people that, like, donated a hundred
One dollar, or a hundred and forty-one dollars for this game
The Brony Bundle group
On Twitter or whatever? That always, um
I get a kick out of that
People that band together to donate lots of money
But it's, you know, it is a good cause
I love those Humble Bundles, those are always good times
But yeah, they've got, like, in fact, let's see here
Um, I was trying to see
The, uh, there's a couple of people
That did, uh, you know, a hundred and forty dollars
Uh, one hundred and thirty-three dollars
Sixty-seven, there's a bunch in the fifties
And the average right now, this is the average price
That people are paying for is two dollars and fifty-eight cents
Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment
Uh, Neesh said, um, Radiohead
Did this for their In Rainbows album
And said it brought more money to them
Than, um, all their other albums combined
You know why? Because they cut out
The record label by doing that
Well, yeah, but still
And if you are
I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners
Because this is only going for about another
Four hours
If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend
Go downloading the torrent
While you still can
And you can do that guilt-free
And you are totally a law-abiding citizen
Because the creator has given his blessing
He wants this to happen
To get the word out
Although, one little problem with that
Is that, you know, he says that
You know, you download the torrent
And there's, you know, it's only available
For four hours, but
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet
And there's going to be someone always hosting that game
Or hosting, you know, seeding it, so
Yeah
Alright, well, from one controversial viewpoint
On piracy to another, Ubisoft
You know, they're always on
DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap
Over the years, um, or I should say
Over the years, it's only really been about
A couple years, but, um, Ubisoft
Is now changing their policy on this
Always-on DRM, you know, it's just been too much
Headache and so forth, I think some of us
Saw this coming, but here's the new DRM
Policy, according to Stephanie
Parodi, who's the company's worldwide director
For online games, Ubisoft PC games
Are now going to require a one-time
Online activation when you first
Install the game, then you can
You are free to play the game offline
And they claim this has been Ubisoft's
Policy since June of 2011
But, uh, it's
Been noticed that maybe there's been some
Games that didn't get that memo, because
Always-on we've seen in some more recent releases
However, um
This is going to be their new policy moving
Forward. A fair compromise?
What do y'all think?
It's fair
I do think it's fair
But I always have concern
For people that can't get
That online connection
And, you know, there are still some people
In the world that can't get that online connection
I'm not just talking about people who live in the sticks
But I'm talking about, like, military service people
Overseas, you know, sometimes
Want to play some games to, you know,
Blow off steam a little bit
And, you know, I do realize they can use
The satellite connections and some of these things
But that's not always a reality, or it's expensive
Or what have you, so
I just hope there might be some workarounds
Some considerations made for people
Who really are trying to do the right
Thing. They usually do that
With a lot of software that phones
Home is they'll have, you know, the
Alternate means of, you know
It usually involves, you know, calling up a
Number and you give them, you know, whatever
And they give you authentication code or something
That would be fair. I hope there is some type of
Little plan B in the small print
For people that truly can't,
You know, which is how they create a lot of those
Cracks out there for software, but I'm
Just saying, you know, it's
I mean, they're already expected to be
Having 93% of their software
Pirated, so
Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85
Alright, anyhow, let's move on
We're running along this segment, of course
But we knew we would. DarkSakura
I'll try to keep this one short then
Basically, the
Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being
Developed by
Looks like Straight Right
Who is out of Australia
And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up
Basically saying that
They've been putting a lot of work into this
It's not going to be a rushed deal
They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's
Launch and that it's supposed to be amazing
Well, thank god they didn't
Come out and say, you know what, we're going to
Half-ass it
I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out
And say, eh, whatever
You know, you'll like what you get
Deal with it. They're saying it's supposed to look just
As good as the other console versions
And, I mean, I'm kind of
Interested to see exactly how it plays
With the little Wii U pad thing
Wait, did they really say that? Just as good
As the other console versions? That's exactly what they said
It will look just as good
Now, wouldn't you think
With a new console coming out
You'd want to say, better
A new console using old technology?
I just
How can it be any better? I'm just saying
It's not helping the case of the Wii U
It's using old tech. It's using the Wii
I'm just saying
So, I would expect it to look as good as a Wii
I'm being sensationalist
And latching onto that one quote
My headline, my pull quote
Mass Effect 3 will look about as good
As it does on the other consoles on the Wii U
There's my pull quote
Orange Lounge Radio exclusive
Rob
Yes?
There is a quote here
It says
This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time
There is a significant technical challenge
Bringing the game from its original format
To the Wii U. It's new, different
And sophisticated piece of hardware
As of
So there's a good deal of technical energy
That's being expended to make that happen
I mean, you have to see the size of the shoehorn
We need to have
In order to get that tablet to work
I mean, seriously
It's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns
Of that size
We used a hammer
Look, I will say
Because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy
I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version
I really kind of wanted to see how it works
With the screen and everything
I'm very curious. It could be interesting
This is me
With no fucks left to give
Stop
I'm just gonna play it on PC
It's already fun
Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen
Or something, but I don't care
If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there
And a copy of Mass Effect 3
You know when you come over you'd be like
I want to kind of see it
I want it to make me buy a Wii U
What would be enough
To make you buy a Wii U?
Fuck if I knew
How about a good system?
How about it being good?
How about it having good games?
I'm not saying it doesn't have good games
We don't know yet
This is the problem with Mass Effect 3
I already have Mass Effect 3
Shut up
Uh oh, uh oh
Dan's got something to say
See this is from the woman
Who wanted a Wii to start with
She waited in line overnight
I was like, fuck the Wii
It's last gen
This is the man who played
Twilight Princess for hours
I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours
I didn't play through Twilight Princess
The Zelda games are good
But at the same time
I try to do surgery
I just think it's a stupid idea
He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying
I already have Mass Effect
Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect
How about you shut the fuck up
And let me finish what I was saying
Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it
Yeah
That was what I was trying to say, dumb butt
Goody goody gumdrops
Give Rob back his mic
Give Rob back his mic
No
To be fair
Dan's making a point we've made on this show before
It's hard to get excited about
You know, Arkham City redone
Mass Effect 3 redone
It's not even that redone
You can tilt the Wii U tablet
To move the battering round
You can do that also with the 6 axis controller
On the PS3 version
I would love
Please Nintendo
Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday
And be like, here's what's coming
It better have like
Shut up Dan
Don't make me buy it, okay
But no seriously, they could come out Thursday and say
You know, we've got this Zelda
Or this F-Zero
Or this new IP that looks really cute
I would like for that to happen
That would make me very happy
The only thing I fear
Is that there's a new excite truck
I want the bite if it's a new excite truck
Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet
Are you kidding?
It would be amazing
It would be absolutely amazing
Use a mic
Alright
Let's move on
I was still
Oh I'm sorry, go ahead
Shut up
I'm done
Are you gonna let him win?
I'll get him later
Oh, okay
Let's travel around the world
And check out release dates of games that are coming out
A little sooner than a Wii U
There's actually some stuff coming out this week
Finding Nemo Escape to Big Blue
The special edition being
re-released now by Disney Interactive
As opposed to THQ because guess what?
They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo
That they're re-releasing into theaters
Kind of appropriate
It's also coming out on the 3DS as well
So it's not just the DS this time
Because I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements
What happened to movies on the 3DS?
Wasn't that supposed to be a thing?
Yeah
That's a serious question
They had a couple
They did the Tekken 1
Oh, that's right
I mean
The Tekken 1
Didn't they do Pokemon anime on Game Boy Advance cartridges?
Where's my Tron legacy?
It was a different time
That was in E3, remember?
When they had those demos for it
Because that technology just vaporized
And they gave you free headphones
Okay, let me put it this way
A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises
Never comes to fruition like online
But
There's a dig at the Wii U
I'm telling you that online's gonna suck
Battlefield 3
The premium edition for 60 bucks
You get all the DLC
It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360
This week
NHL 13 on PS3 and 360
Tekken Tag Tournament 2
For PS3 and 360
Also NHL The Stanley Cup Collector's Edition
Which is probably a complete waste of money
Unless you like DLC
That is coming out for 80 bucks on PS3 and 360
And
What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game
For 2012 and probably 2013
NBA Baller Beats
For Xbox 360
Fuck yes
The game where you have to dribble a basketball
To the beat of the music
On my carpet
In front of Kinect
Because that's gonna fucking work
That is coming out this week
This game is gonna scare the shit out of the cats
I can't wait
One week from today
Kirby's Dream Land
Collector's Special Edition
That's too many fucking adjectives
Collector's Special Edition is too much
Just call it a
Special Edition or Collector's Edition
It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition
Limited
It can't be a 20 years anniversary edition
Just call it
Virtual Console Games we could have released
But we decided to put them on a fucking cart
Or I'm sorry, CD
DVD, whatever, disc
It has a cart painted on it
Hey you know what though?
And it comes with a special gold cartridge
That has absolutely nothing inside it
At the very least, at least there is
More than one ROM on this fucking disc
As opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars
As a limited edition
More than having people buy it for $80
It has that little retrospective
Hallway new thing in it
Look at that
Well bravo for Nintendo
For putting a minute
Bit of effort into it
Act deft in our chatroom
At live.vognetwork.com
Fuck you Loki, Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants
Orange right says
Super Hyper Kirby EX
Plus Alpha Zero Turbo
And then I added for matching service
You know what? Kirby sucks
No, Kirby doesn't suck
Actually he does suck
That is the truth
He also blows
Kirby blows
He's gone from suck to blow
Moving on
Japanese releases
Tekken Tag Tournament 2
They get in on the fun this week as well
September 13 is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360
Going to the Playstation 3
Of course, same game there as well
And a game called Excel World
Ginyoku no Kakuse
Comes out, limited and regular editions
From also
That sounds terribly boring, a whole world based on
A database program
Not looking forward to that
Nothing on the Vita
The little big planet is just a couple weeks away
At this point in Japan
Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week
Metarot 7
Kabuto and Kuwagata versions
I don't know what game this
This is two separate editions
So it looks like little
This looks like fighting mech robots
Looks like you collect little mech robots
And fight them to the death
Oh shoot
I know what this is
Tell me that's not a total Pokemon inspired
Screenshot right there
I watched some of this
Where the guy gets
These little robots
It turned out that his dad
Played these two or something
He tried to beat up his little robot
But his robot wins
And tears up his house in the meantime
And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots
I don't remember
I only just saw it once
Robots tear up a house? Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?
Little teeny robots
Sengoku Musou
Chronicles 2
On the 3DS as well
You guys know what that is right?
Once again
And lastly but not least
Kiyoshitsu comes out from Nintendo
On the 3DS this week
This game is not something that looks
It's an artist program
Oh this was one of the crazy wacky games
It's art academy
I can't remember what it's coming out as
It's art drawing things
Still life, art
We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences
What the hell is this?
It's coming out in October over here
I like that painting of the doggy
Not bad
Alright there you go that's Japanese releases
I think it's like art academy you can draw everything
I think is what it's called or something
We'll figure it out
Go into the UK
I'm sorry I was still looking at this funny screenshot
So in the UK on the 11th
We have Battlefield 3 Armored Kill
On the 14th Joe Danger 2
The movie Tekken Tag Tournament 2
And Chaos Off Deponia
And
That's it
Alright just a couple more news stories
For you guys than the classic game of the week
But first Loki
So more Vita hacking
Independent developer
Yifan Lu
Has found an exploit that allows
Retail systems to run native
Homebrew Vita code
As opposed to running
PSP
Homebrew stuff because that's been the last few
Hacks
Okay hey we got some
Homebrew to run in the PSP mode or whatever
Using one of the games
That are out there that you can
Download to your console
Of course
He's basically
Saying you know we're not
I'm gonna not make anything that
Will benefit piracy
This tool is in fact
This tool in fact cannot be used for loading
Backups or pirated content even if I
Wanted to because of the physical limitations
Of the exploit however
He says that you know
This kind of stuff could lead
To people developing a better
Method that could lead to that stuff
But as of right now he is
In no way endorsing piracy
Even though everyone thinks that
Homebrew equals piracy but that's
Kind of the
Situation that we're in right now
Of course he hasn't released any information on it yet
Because like before whenever
They would release an exploit they would
Patch whatever game was involved with it
So hopefully
This one isn't game reliant
Like the last few have been
How quick do you think
Sony will patch this up I mean here we go
Again if it's game reliant pretty
Quick if it's not it might take a little
Bit or if it's even something they can
Patch it I mean they may they should be
Able to patch it pretty quick and so we don't know how they're
Doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to
Get the jump on because before it used to be like
You know even before they released something hey
You know this is the game
That you need to have in order to
You know run this modified
Save that loads you know the bootloader
For some PSP homebrew
Before that would run in PSP mode but now that
It's in Vita mode you have more
Access to memory
And processing power and that kind of stuff
It's not throttled like it was before
So hopefully
I mean I understand
He's hoping that by saying oh
Yeah it's not going to really run any
You know sort of exploit
That'll allow you the pirate games
That he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer
But I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that
Shit as soon as they can
Alright one more story for you guys
Before we get to the classic game of the week
And this is about what was a
Classic video game network at one
Point G4
Some rumors going around about G4 look I want to make
It clear G4 hasn't been a gaming
Network for several years at this point
You know they switched to that whole
Cops reruns and stuff quite some time
What are their ties to gaming at this point
X-Play and Attack of the Show
Sometimes but X-Play now doesn't have
Adam Sessler obviously
Cause he's gone
Is Morgan Webb still there though?
I think Morgan Webb's still there
Even Attack of the Show's lost a lot
Of their
Casts that people would watch it for
Well Variety published an article
This week that G4 is going geek
And more chic and this is rumor
Right now but because G4 is owned by
NBC Universal, Comcast
They want to change
G4 into a direction that's more
Like GQ
The modern male magazine
So basically I don't know how it's
More modern male
More refined I guess
I don't know what kind of programming that would entail
So basically Spike but for high brow
People
For hipsters
So we're not going to have episodes of
A Thousand Ways to Die
Involve women with big boobs
Bouncing up and down or explosions
I'm not really interested
Me neither because Logo still has
RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing
On cable worth watching
So high brow are they talking about more like GQ
So they're going to start rerunning episodes of
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that
Is that how they're going? Is it going to be like the
Metrosexual channel or something?
Who knows? I don't know
Maybe the guys who flip the
Million Dollar Homes
The real estate shows
It's going to be garbage whatever it is
We'll see we'll see but regardless
Any video game ties
You might have to this network are
Looking to be severed pretty soon
It hasn't been dumped from
Satellite providers at this point
They're not doing too well
Like you said there's been a huge turnover and so forth
So
American Ninja Warrior may not have
A place on GQ
That actually was a pretty good show
There's nothing to say about this
It's probably going to get a new name
That's the other reason that makes this a big deal
Is because G4 will probably become something
I can tell you right now American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike
So I'm sure that won't be gone for long
So there you go
We'll talk a little more about this story in Part B
With our FUGO Question of the Week
But for now
Let's take a trip down memory lane
For a moment shall we?
With a segment we call
The Classic Game of the Week
Where DarkSakura steps into the classic
Gaming vault
Moves Shirmi aside
Blows the dust off the cabinet
Shirmi's probably still sitting in her older box
Pulls out a game that she says
Hey! Play this game this week
You ungrateful little brat
This comes from a time before there was
Ultra Limited Collector
Mega Edition for Special
Week, whatever it is
Midnight Special Edition
That sounds kinky
Doesn't it? A little bit?
Well this game is not so kinky
But this is a game I looked at it and I went really?
In 200 episodes plus
Of this segment she has not done this game?
I checked
Well it's about fucking time this week DarkSakura
What is the Classic Game of the Week?
Blaster Master
In Japan it was called
Chōwakusei Senki Meta Fight
Which translates to
Planetary War Record Meta Fight
Which honestly is a really
Freaking cool name
It came out in the US in
November 1988 and in Europe
On April 25th, 1991
Yeah they had to wait a long ass time to get this
We just had to wait a few months after Japan
But yeah
This game went from having
A killer story in Japan
To having the dumbest
Story ever in the US
I mean that doesn't affect how awesome
The game itself was
Ok get this
The Japanese version you're like
An explorer landing on Sophia III
The planet
And you have to
Explore where this ancient civilization was
And stop this evil emperor
And go through the whole planet
Dan shut up
Hold on I'm getting Dan to comment
No seriously man
It's a game where you drive a tank to save a frog
In the US one
Jamie never played Blaster Master
She doesn't know nothing about Blaster Master
I'm gonna tell you about Blaster Master
Blaster Master is awesome
First of all it's by Sunsoft
So you know that the music is super
Choice for the NES
Second of all it's tough as fucking nails
The game is really
Really hard even for a NES game
I mean it is Nintendo hard
And there's no save function
Which is pretty brutal cause it's not a
Short game and you upgrade the tank
And when you die
And the tank is called Sophia in the NES version
Sophia III which I always thought was really
Kind of weird but it's cute in a way
And you can make it fly
You can drive on walls
You can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls
You can jump out of the tank
And your little dude runs around
Or you can go into like caves and you run around
Like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons
Independently of the character
Who's named Jason and the tank
Which once again is named Sophia
I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline
Cause who fucking cares
The Japanese version
The Japanese version was a
Failure
The Nintendo version is a classic
Is it both Nintendo?
No no no no
The NES version
Whatever you completely didn't
Listen to anything that I said
Rob take the mic please
The Japanese version of an epic storyline
It was so wonderful
The Nintendo version you drive a tank
To save a frog
It's awesome
Saves your frog
And you can use the pause trick and kill the bosses real easy
It's amazing
The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it and then they die
Now to be fair we might have somebody who's like 14
Listening to this program with their parents
For permission of course
Jamie please
Let's continue telling the listeners about
Master Master
Well as Dan said there is no save feature
Whatever
Shut up
Jason and Sophia
Have different power meters
So they can
They take
Dan you're flustering her
Let her get through the segment
And then fluster her while we're on break
I'm about to cut a bitch
At any rate
You've got different power meters
You can power up separately
You get 5 continues which he didn't say
And you can
Restart the game at the same level
In which you lost all of your lives
You have a hover gauge that
Controls how much thrust
Is left in your tank
I don't believe you brought up that the tank
Flies
He did
Oh my bad
Are you the king
Are you the king of blaster master
I'm the blaster master
James is like
I play blaster master
We can turn on the desk right now
We can actually turn on 2 nesses and we can have a blaster master
Race and I will fuck her shit up
But if we played mass effect
Yeah that wouldn't even be a good race
She'd murder the shit out of me
If we cut us out
Give me the mic
For other releases that came out
There was
A re-release on the playstation
For blaster master
Itself
Actually my apologies for meta fight
And ripple island
Came out on playstation in
The volume 4 of sunsoft memorial
Series in 2002
And then it came out on the Wii virtual console
On December 14th 2009
And um
There was
Meta fight was re-released for the
Virtual console on June 29th
2010
There was blaster master overdrive
That um
Honestly I didn't give a crap about
So I'm not gonna talk about it
Yeah
I actually played the Wii
Believe it or not I played the Wii remake
It's it just didn't
Have the charm of the original
For me like it just felt I remember the
Controls bugged me like I seem to
It was a few years ago but I remember the controls
Really bothered me that was an issue
That was released by victor ireland
From working design
And rest in peace
New company Gaijin works
Yeah Gaijin works There was also a sequel on the
Genesis which was not
Produced by the original creator which was not so
Good there was kind of a pseudo
Remake for the gameboy advance
Called uh like enemy within
Actually no it was for gameboy color
Which was also not as good
And there was a punishment from god
Succo on the playstation called blaster master
Blasting again
So really there's only one good blaster master game
The whole reason why the story
Was changed is because um
You have to give them credit
Frogs are pretty awesome
They're slimy and stupid
And they make you hallucinate
Anyway they changed it because they didn't think
That the space exploration
Would be popular in the US
That whole genre of anime
Hadn't really made it over
And so they changed it to Jason and his
Frog and used the name
Of the planet Sophia the third
There was a portion
Of the map in the fourth level
That did not map over
So actually you have to make this
Huge jump
Off a ladder suspended in mid air
I'm not gonna say anymore
Alright
It's an amazing
Game it's one of my favorite NES games
Ever and the soundtrack we can't say
Enough about the soundtrack I mean it's just
Like I love the soundtrack it's amazing
So good alright
So then that's it there it is your
Classic game of the week actually
Sophia the third made an appearance in
A flash game called Super Mario Brothers
Crossover that we've talked about on the show
Before how'd that kickstarter
Go for them they
Made it they made more than
Initial I figured they would
Good times
Alright this game is hard
As hell
Alright there it is blast I was just watching the
YouTube in the background remembering having a horrible
Horrible nightmares of the game alright there it is
I thought that that particular playthrough it was
Because it was a non machine assisted speed run
That takes
That looked like the
You can kind of tell when it's an emulator
And when it's that dirty connection
To the TV through an RCA cable like
You kind of tell the difference on YouTube and that was definitely
The TV being plugged in there so
Alright there it is your classic game of the week
Blaster Master
We're gonna take a break here but don't go anywhere
We've got plenty more of show to come
Yes there's more we're gonna talk
A little bit about the Ouya in part B
Tonight as well as some Final Fantasy
Collections and of course rapid fire news
Your phone calls as well you want to
Call in you want to get involved in
Dan and Jamie's discussions here's your chance
During the uh skype line
I don't want to be involved in our discussions
In part B tonight
But first a break we'll be right
Back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right
After this
Welcome back everybody
To Orange Lounge Radio
Live on September the 9th
2012 Dreamcast day
At vognetwork.com the voice of
Geeks network we've had a pretty exciting show
So far this tonight
Dark Sakura I think they hugged it out
During the break yes we're good
More like I collapsed on him because I have
A headache aw I'm sorry
It's okay and something
We didn't talk about during part A because we just had so
Much other stuff going on with the bungee ferret tossing
And all that we're having Mexican night
Here at Orange Lounge Radio
Where we've been eating burritos
And quesadillas and you know
Slinging guacamole sadly not
Real Mexican food like
Taco bell but much better because it's homemade
So kinda yeah
We went to the grocery store and got stuff
So there you go it's
That kind of night here at Orange Lounge Radio Studios
Okay a couple quick announcements for you guys
First off Dark Sakura wants to say something
And what did I have music for this?
Yes
Last Saturday was my
Advanced anniversary
We've been married for seven years
Or was it seven thousand
He says at least
We've been okay
In January
Coming up next year
We will have been together
For fifteen years but we've been married
For seven
Yes
You are such a dork
What am I supposed to say?
I don't know
I'm leaving you
Okay this is funny
Because Rob's cutting his quesadilla with fingers
You use a pizza cutter
Really?
Rob doesn't have a mic so you can't hear any of this
Anyway
So yeah
Dan and I have been married for seven years
Yay
The end
I love your vision
I did
I went back to Alabama and got my clique-o-vision
And brought it back
And then I found someone at work
That was selling a clique-o-vision
I found them on the work message boards
And told you about it
You are a liar
No I'm not
You are such a liar
Definitely married for seven years
Ladies and gentlemen, Jamie and Dan
Congratulations
Couple quick things
We are just a couple weeks away
From episode four hundred and seventy-five
Wait, one more thing
On September 2nd
I converted
I became Jewish
I thought you had already had that
No, not this last one
It meant two years past my conversion
It was the anniversary
And that's why you're not here next week
Because Rosh Hashanah starts
So Happy New Year all the Jews out there
Understandable, have a good week off
Hope you'll listen to the podcast during the week
Maybe
Anyhow, episode four seventy-five is coming up
We might have some surprises in store
So be sure you're here that night
Mostly for the long-time OLR fans
There's something brewing
Where you long-time OLR fans
Are going to be like, what?
That's all I'm going to say
Episode four seventy-five, be here
Alright
Because reasons
Rapid Fire News
Is up next
While I finish cutting my quesadilla
Which, by the way, smells delicious
You take all the pictures you want
Of my delicious quesadilla
From the work-provided quesadilla maker
That I won, thank you
Picture with scissors
So there's a new free Vita game
That you can download
It's called Treasure Park
And basically it's a game that allows you
To create your own grid-based puzzles
And with hidden objects and bombs and stuff
And you can share them with your friends in the near app
That might be a reason
For me to play my Vita
That I haven't played
Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet
Yeah, I heard it was really short though
It is, but they have all the online level
It's a good game
Alright, fine
And that pinball, that pinball, now that I haven't really played
But I hear it's good, I played it on Xbox
The Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection
As well as the God of War
PS3 collections
Those have been given
An update to allow for remote play
On the Vita
So now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix
On the go, which is pretty sweet
Of course
Those include the first two God of War games
Ego and Shadow of the Colossus
So that's pretty sweet
And last but not least
Angry Birds is getting
Yet another spinoff this time in the form
Of Bad Piggies
Where you're gonna take the
Villains, I guess, of the game and play as them
In puzzle-like fashion
I'm sure
And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac
September 27th
With other versions
Windows Phone, Windows 8
And PC
Later on, I guess
Oh, it doesn't sound very exciting
But I'm not a big Angry Birds fan
Nah
I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did
Of course
Alright, um
Metroid
On the Wii U
Do I have your attention?
Alright, well here's the unfortunate part
It's just part of Nintendo Land
But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat
A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version
Of the Battle.me prototype, if you ever saw that
During the trade shows
They showed this during the press conference
Yeah, but isn't this new?
The screenshots and everything that are out now?
Not really
I thought this was some new stuff, whatever
So fine, what's old is new again
I just got excited because it was Metroid
Alright, how about this?
This is something that's been going around for like five years
And finally, finally
Making its way this week
Dark Tetsuya, listen up
La Mulana, finally
On WiiWare, September 20th
Is the big day
This is a big sordid story here
It was gonna come out, and then it wasn't
Because they didn't think it would make money, da da da
They said it was gonna be cancelled
Then the internet got mad, so here it is
There was a lot of QQ
The most complete archaeology action and exploration game
Ever created
So that Indiana Jones game
That was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game
I guess that can suck it
Cause this is the most complete
Archaeology action and exploration game
Ever created, over 40 hours of play
No, for real
For like retro looking games, it looks awesome
I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight
Because here, okay
I gotta admit
The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs
Cause I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world
But the game blogs are saying
Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?
No
Shit
Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U
Is like saying the sun is gonna rise in the morning
That bears shit in the woods
That's what you call a safe bet
And also what you call
A headline that will get people to go
Oh my god, there's a Zelda game coming
I need to repog this everywhere
So your site gets
You know, hits
It's all about the hits, folks
Here's the thing though
Why would it be 2014? Why not next year?
They haven't announced one yet
They've already announced everything they've got coming
So what's gonna be their big thing next year?
They've gotta have something big, big, big next year
Next year
Well, unless it's a 3D Mario
A Donkey Kong poop throwing game
Smash Brothers are thinking
Remember in 2013
Those Smash Brothers games always take forever
I don't know
Alright, that's all I got
Dark Sakura
Well, other news
We have a
A new trademark from Squeenix
Called Circle of Mana
So maybe it's gonna
Be out in that series, who knows
The last one that came out was
Heroes of Mana, which I didn't even bother
No news
No news yet on Circle of Evermore?
No
And then Ace Attorney 5
Will be coming out
And
Let me
See if there is a date on here
Well, it doesn't say the date
But we're gonna be getting it here and
In Europe
I saw some of the
Pictures for it
Who was that other girl that has the side ponytail?
She looks awful
And then
Emma, I guess
I don't know, I hate her pigtail
And then
Rhythm Thief
Is supposed to be coming to the IOS
This winter
So this one is just gonna be
One player
And I think should have leaderboard options
So that's it
Sorry, my mouth is full
Of quesadilla
Rhythm Thief, I wanna play that though
Okay
I'm not stopping you
I played the demo on 3DS, it was good
What is Dan playing over there? It sounds like a Mario game
Is that Wario something something?
Mario 2
I didn't even know that thing was charged
That's amazing
Let's get to the foogle question of the week
Facebook, Google, put them together
You get foogle
And we ask a question every week
And we read some of the answers
I wanna reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset
That I don't read their answers
If I read all the answers, it would be a 5 hour show
So we picked some of the answers
To read from Google Plus and Facebook
About the question
The question ties into a story from part A
There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through
Some changes
Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech
Some time ago, we wanna ask you about video game television
Do you think a dedicated
Video game television station could work
In today's world?
If you do, what kind of shows would you wanna see on it?
If you don't think it would work, why not?
Entertainment on Google Plus starts
They tried it
It was G4 in the beginning
The problem was that G4 could never draw a large audience
As measured by the Nielsen rating system
The system is a critically flawed system
But it is the accepted system
Unless Nielsen changes to actually measure online
In DVR
Or until Nielsen is thrown out entirely
A cable network for gamers cannot survive for very long
Interesting
You know what?
I actually equivalent the Nielsen system
With using BMI to track health
Both of them are inherently
Flawed and useless
Technus replied on Google Plus and said
I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is
Long gone
The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns
So much, it was nuts
I remember getting the channel as a preview channel
And they would air the same old episodes that I saw
A few months ago
When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist
Pretty well with finally cutting out the excess
Of reruns and shows that nobody really watched
From both networks
And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV
And then they flushed it down the drain and so forth
He says at the end
Though it's all about video on demand
And IPTV services these days
And I think that's where a video game network can thrive
So he thinks in the traditional sense
It's done
And Jim replies and says it would never work
The channel wouldn't be able to be very critical
Of games or the industry in general
Because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars
Would have to come from
Because he thinks that the conflict
It would never work
I think there's some truth in that
They can be pretty mean sometimes
Alright, going over to Facebook
And checking out some of the answers on Facebook
Which there's a lot
And I'm never going to be able to get through some of these
Another comment from Dark Charger
About IPTV becoming the norm
Nutman says
I think a video game channel could work
But TV executives need to step out of the way
G4, like many other TV endeavors
Failed because guys in suits thought they knew
Better than the people they hired
Scott Rubin and others behind G4
Were met with opposition on everything
And eventually just gave up entirely
Executives set it up for failure
And then asked everybody why it failed
So they need to get rid of the management
Red the Haze says
Nope, every now and then I remember
Tech TV and G4 missed those channels
But then I remember we have the internet now
Ronnie says yes it would work
There will always be the casual market
That doesn't know as much as we do on the internet
I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4
I imagine it would be extremely casual
Tigerclaw says
The problem with having a cable network
Dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal
To a certain demographic which is relatively
Small to a mass audience
Who needs a 24 hour cable network devoted to video games
And you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online
Looking at some of the other answers
Degenerate Johnny says
Especially with the YouTube channels and internet shows
Being dedicated to video games
I think that a cable network channel would not work for long
So many of these e-shows and podcasts
Such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content
To satisfy gamers of all ages
Such features include up to date news
The latest reviews of games and DLC
Etcetera
These features are all that the average video gamer requires
It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV
For something that could easily be accessed on the internet
In an entertaining fashion
We killed G4
Degenerate Johnny
Mike simply says
Yes it would work
I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how to, achievements
Type shows
Wicked says
I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market
With how diverse and expansive the internet is
Gaming content that would be on a television network
Is numerous
But too far and wide for some
A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses
Would concentrate a lot of good shows
Topics and games in one location
For easy digestion
As for what should be on the network
That simple
Look at G4 Tech TV
Both separate entities during the merger
And name some various shows there
It was easy to fill up the network with gaming
Though a lot of it was tech
But also hey they knew the demographic
And I think if done properly it could thrive again
Just not as G4
God I hope not

Thanks to everybody and Google Plus as well
Search for Orange Lounge Radio
Plus and you'll find that
Thank you to everybody who answered
How about you folks here in studio
Would it work or is it done?
It's done
Well I mean really everyone said
It goes back to what the other people said
The internet's taken over
And besides that
I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game
On their TV than watch a show on their TV
I mean me I don't even watch TV
I download my shows on the internet
I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who
And that's it
If there was a dedicated video game station
Or station
A channel on TV I still wouldn't watch it
I remember there used to be a show on G4
That just showed nothing but gameplay footage
Like little five minute clips of gameplay footage
It was a way to like sample all the new games
It was interesting
I have the internet for that
I mean there's plenty of times when
Like Dan said
I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game
And look up
A particular path in a game that I want to do
Or
He watches playthroughs of stuff
All the time
It's really just
I don't think that
It would have to be one or the other
If TV was the only way to get the information
Then yeah then it would work
But there's so many other outlets
That are so convenient
And you don't have to wait for programming times
Or wait for it to record
It's there when you want it
The chatters jumped in
Cinematech was the show I was thinking of
Loki
Yeah it's going to be hard for them
I think the problem would be
It's too niche for them to have enough
Revenue
Revenue dollars from ads and stuff
To warrant keeping the station
It's just too
Before going away where it's so generic
Now that
You know it gets more viewers I guess
People like watching cops and stuff
At weird hours at night or they'll just shut
Off the station for a few hours
And run their infomercials that's what they do
Like late at night
My answer is yes and no
Because I think all
Networks in a sense traditional TV
And cable as we know it is all kind of
On a ticking clock here
And it's really about being able to evolve
And I think you see a lot of it with tying
Into the
Xbox style content
You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that
Even Comcast getting in on that
And a lot more of that on demand style stuff
Hulu, Netflix
I think if a gaming company could kind of build
Itself around that primary
And be a cable network secondary
They'd be in a much better place
Than say
Somebody coming around and just trying to copy
G4
It's going to be doomed
Dan
It could have been doable
I mean I don't know if it could still be doable
Because again the money is hard but
The problem is that they never played it straight
Like even the biggest names
You know when they had the video game shows
Like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag
He was just such a fucking retard
And you'd watch and just be like
I don't want to be associated with this guy
And then they had the girl
Who wasn't really good looking
Enough to be kind of eye candy
And people were just like
Well they're not really talking to gamers
They're kind of
Just doing their thing
And I believe that they were gamers
I believe that they cared about what they were doing
I just never thought that they were good
I don't think that they played it real
I think that if there was a show
I don't think there could be a network
But I think there could be a show
That did the trick
You know if it played it real and not douchey
I get what you're saying
I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows
Felt like they were catered to 12 year old boys
And it gets old
Talk up to me not down to me
Some folks in the chat
GDR dollar bill agreed with you
He said Sessler was a tool
But fifth dream does not
Sessler was pretty awesome
But Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV
Because that's all they really needed
Is one show dedicated to video games
And the rest was pretty awesome
That's the network you need to copy
If you're going to try to copy a network
Don't copy G4, copy tech TV
Because that was awesome
That's a network I think that could have actually made it
Give it a little bit more advertising
Alright, well
Go ahead, one last thought
I just don't really understand why
TV is still big
When you've got the internet
What Dan watches is like one show on TV now
MasterChef
And then the rest
And the rest of it we use
The internet, we have Hulu
We have everything else
I'm really paying an insane amount for cable
Cable is going to go
The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well
And Dan likes MasterChef
It's kind of going the way of the landline telephone
A lot of people get rid of those too
Alright, in the meantime
Let's move on with gaming news
Thank you again to the folks on Facebook and Google who answered
Loki, let's start off with more gaming news
Alright, let's talk a little bit about
GameStop
But let's also talk about Ouya
The GameStop of course is interested in
Ouya since
As of recently they've been
Interested in pretty much anything that runs Android
That they can turn around and
Get people to pre-order or resell or something like that
And it says of course
We will be a part of any console launch
In the future
That's when they were asked about Ouya
We think Ouya is cool
It has open source components
Everything we've read is great
And of course they're used to
Selling DLCs
So assuming that this is kind of like
Steam or Xbox Live Arcade
Or Playstation or something like that
They would probably have like
Codes that could be redeemed for
Apps and stuff on there
But at the same time
I don't think you can go to
GameStop and buy
An app that's on the Android marketplace
Or something like that or Google Play
You can't just go hey
Dan no one can hear you when you don't have a mic
It's just like
I don't know
I just don't know if people would really
They're kind of pointless
When it comes to
Buying stuff online
Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something
That I can purchase online without having to
Drive down to the store
Aside from I'm trading in something
But that only works if you're trading in like a console game
Because right now there's no trading on
Digital games
So if really you're playing on a system
Let's say you only own an OUYA
You're probably not going to be going down to them
For anything
Except for maybe hardware and accessories
Assuming you need like another
OUYA controller or something
If you didn't want to buy it online
Well this is all kind of about
Evolving to match what people want
Because if OUYA is
Going to be this big deal GameStop wants a piece of it
Because
GameStop's another one of those companies
Where as digital distribution becomes more and more
They're getting a little worried
And then another thing
There was a game that was on Kickstarter
Mercenary Kings
Of course they've surpassed their goal that they had
But now they're saying
They're going to be
Putting it on the OUYA as well
So right now they're
Allowing anybody
That's ordered a digital copy of the game
Which is $15 pledged
You'll get a copy of the
Steam key and you'll get a copy of
The OUYA key which they believe that there's going to be
A key system for that
Although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet
But in some way they'll try to
Get it so that you can
Play that and for those who are not aware
Mercenary Kings is a game that's
Kind of a cross between Metal Slug and
Minecraft I guess
You craft things based on the
Components that are dropped
By the enemies and it's also
Animated by Paul Robinson who does
Really kick ass
8 bit, 16 bit
Animated gifs and he also did the
Animation in the Scott
Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade
So it is worth checking out
I backed it
I love Paul Robinson
That sounds like something
To check out
He's got an awesome animated gif with a dog with an eye patch
And a robotic dog shooting
Bullets and glowing dogs
Nice
Alright well moving in a different direction here
Talking about MMOs for a little bit and a way
That you could make money off of MMOs
Sony Online Entertainment
Not to be totally confused
With Playstation 3 stuff because
The MMO business is a little
Different, it's another arm of the company
You do see crossover once in a while like
What was that, Free Realms or something
Is on Playstation 3
It's not worth your time but you might have heard
Things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2
DC Universe
That's a big one, thank you
These are all big games
SOE is looking into
Something where you the player
Can create in game items
And if Sony
Online Entertainment adds them to the shop
You would get a kick back
Once complete
Players are encouraged to name and create a description
For the item, describe how the item would fit
Into the perspective games ongoing narrative
Storyline and submit it to SOE
For review and possible inclusion in the SOE
Marketplace. If a player created
Item is selected for inclusion in the
Marketplace, SOE will share
40% of the net amount it receives
From the sale of the item with the player that created
The item. Now before you get too
Excited or wonder how SOE would
Not drown under these requests
Keep in mind to create these items
You're gonna have to know how to do 3D
Modeling. So if you don't know Maya
Or 3DS Max you
May not exactly get to get on this
Also you don't get to pick stats
That's something
Sony gets to do
You can do the design
You can do the item and the lore behind it
But ultimately it will be up to
Sony Online Entertainment
Very interesting
Sort of prospect but
Maybe they're thinking word of mouth
To help these games succeed because let's say I have
An item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of
I'm likely to start advertising
For the game and tell all these people
Hey go buy my item
And it kind of helps the game get more exposure
And possibly generate
More sales which
Sony gets a cut of
Not unlike the iOS Marketplace or what have you
So
It's definitely a neat idea
I think people
Will probably use it
If they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash
We'll see
There you go
Next story Dark Sakura
Sorry I had a little debate in the chat room
Oh anything you want to share?
Progress
Why I think radio is going to go away
And why TV
Is going to go away
Yeah but not tomorrow
No I didn't say that at all but I'm saying that
It may not even happen in our lifetime
But this format isn't going to be around anymore
I gotta admit I really like radio though
Obviously we're a
Podcast so there's a radio element to it
But traditional radio
Is in trouble because of things like us
And satellite and so forth
How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?
Yeah exactly
But in the car
I find myself listening to a lot of radio
And I do a lot of driving sometimes
So I think a lot of us do
And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically
Like at work while they're doing
Oh I feel sorry for them
Some type of job
I listen to BBC podcasts on history
Yeah
So I think there is still a demand
For the audio only
It just might be the traditional radio
I mean it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier
Where traditional TV is in trouble
I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow
No
But eventually it is going to go away
I can guarantee you that the TV set
That I owned when I was in high school
Wouldn't work now
It doesn't have any HD input
Almost all the stations
Have gone to an HD format
And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore
I've got video game systems
That we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it
Like that Odyssey that we have
We can't play it, we don't have anything it'll work on
You know
When was the last time you saw a video tape new?
In a store?
Been a while
Where were you at, the thrift store?
Radio Shack
That's Radio Shack, they're behind the times anyway
But the point is
And keep in mind
I'm in print media
And really how long do you think print is going to be around
Other than a specialty format
Game Guru
In our chat room says
Unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna
Radio and TV won't disappear
You kinda can, it's getting really close
Think of it this way
20 years ago
We got to the internet on dial up
20 years ago would have been 92
Maybe we were at the stage where like
28.8K
Dial up was kind of the big thing
About then
That was how we were connecting online and all that
So we progressed that much
From dial up modem 28.8K
To where we're at now
So think where we're going to be in 20 years
I think that whole internet off an antenna
Is right around the corner
I was thinking about this earlier because
There was actually a Cracked article talking about
Technology then and now
Saying that like half of a level
Of Angry Birds would not fit on
A duck hunt cartridge or something
And
Stan says way less than that
It's just a matter of progress
It's going to change everything
Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now
Doesn't exist today
And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside
Well one of the reasons that they work
You know kind of cutting every
Or making everybody go digital anyways
The whole switch over is
The analog frequencies and stuff
That are out there
You know that was 4 terrestrial broadcasts
And stuff that's all up in the air now
So now they can use that for broadcasting
Internet
And Stan learn InDesign if you're going to do print media
Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit
You're crazy!
Maybe this is a little too heavy
For our show
But what if
Maybe there comes a time
What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet
I'm not even going into that territory
What if
Well what if society rejected
That technology
Like I'm not saying everybody goes Amish
But there are Amish people in the world
They have a phone
Well not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace
Technology
And they have a neighborhood computer
Well that's kind of my point
Is that what if society
Doesn't want to keep going that direction
Or do you think
It might happen
If war broke out over it
It might happen
Nope, not even then
Because if war broke out over it then that means that they
Really want it
If war broke out over it it would be who controls it
Too heavy for the show
Because the people that wouldn't want it
They would just die eventually
I do like what Tecna said about it not going away
It will evolve
That's more what I'm thinking of
You're going to look
Ten years down the line when we've all got
Pocket broadband radios
We don't have
Wireless FM radios
We don't use radio waves we're using
Broadband signals
Well technically a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora
Is a broadband radio
In my pocket
But I mean
Older forms of
The same idea are going to fall by the wayside
That's what progress is
That's just how it happens
Do you have a Victrola Rob?
Do you know what one is?
A hand cranked phonograph
Not radio the record player
When was the last time you used a mimeograph?
Just saying
I want to see a DJ use those
Good times
Alright let's move on
Dark Soccer don't skip your story
I just wanted to make a point
That's all
Anyway
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker
It's gone from games on demand
It has been removed
And
They think they added it
On August 28th
And on it's Japanese support site
They just said we're sorry for the inconvenience
The resumption of delivery is being addressed now
Please wait for a while
Yeah
Nothing else they just said that we're looking into it
Don't worry we'll receive this about the same time
We decide to release a patch for the
Xbox 360 version of
Silent Hill HD Collection
Ever?
We'll just kind of file it back
Or the next DDR game
Just going to hope everyone forgets about it
Well I mean if it did have a lot of problems
Well at the end of the day how is it selling?
If it was selling decent enough they'll find a reason to put it back on there
But if not
Okay Stan your friend may have a Victrola
But tell me
Does it use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?
It's for the retro kitsch of it right?
Yeah it's a kitsch collectors thing
I would love to have a Victrola
I still have albums
I don't have anything to play it on
I used to have this rocking, bitching record player
when I was like 5 years old that I could play
Sesame Street records on and it would light
up like these really awesome red and green colors
in tone with the audio
I would love to have that shit again
You know what I had? An 8 track player
You know what I don't care if I ever have again?
An 8 track player
I downloaded my
favorite song from my Muppets 8 track
It was Lydia the tattooed lady
Just saying
Not the rainbow connection?
No it was Lydia the tattooed lady
Someday we'll find it
This was in 1979
When did the Muppet movie come out?
The original one?
Yeah
So yeah I had a Muppet
show best of 8 track
It was yellow and I remember how
many times I had to fish the damn tape
out of the 8 track player and fix it
Let's see
The Muppet movie was
1979
So it was right around the same time
Unfortunately I would have been
1 year old when this movie came out
I remember when I was a kid the big deal
was Sesame Street follow that
bird and that scarring
scene of the blue
big bird in the cage
Oh my god just
kill me as a child
and then return to Oz
Return to Oz was great
It was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80's
Well it was closer to the books anyway but yeah
Oh yes gaming news
Hi Loki
Well you know he did start off as a blue bird
It was still
an homage
He was sad and it was hard to see
Anyways let's talk about TV
and you know
there's a series of games
that were out on the PSP
called Invisibles
those will be coming out on the Vita
they're going to get a new game apparently
and it's going to be tied into a TV show
or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out
and it's going to have a section of the show
that's augmented reality
where basically you'll take your Vita
pointing at the screen and something fancy will happen
unlocking new content in your game
Cool
I'm guessing
that it's probably going to be some sort of
AR code or QR code
or something like that
which will probably just
Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes
they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship
that interacted with the thing on TV
and all it was doing was kind of like a
light gun type technology it just could see
what was on the screen and light
does its little things accordingly
like and you think you're interacting with the movie
but you're really not
Like the Action Max? Is that what it is?
I can't remember the name of it, probably
I had an Action Max. Did you really?
My dad used to buy all sorts of weird game
consoles, we had an Action Max
That's where you got it from
It's like my dad doesn't understand why I like video
games and I'm like dude you've
bought the ColecoVision, you bought me
a TI computer, you bought
an Action Max at one point
you had the Atari adapter and stuff
and you can't figure out why I like
video games? I don't get it, I can't get the cats
to get into video games no matter how hard I try
The cats, they're just defiant and everything
My cat used to sit on top
of my Nintendo. Have you tried the iPad game?
It was warm. I haven't because I'm
freaked out about the scratching thing
They can't scratch the screen
Everybody says that, but I don't believe it
Cut their claws! No! Why?
No, it's like cutting their little
No, it's not like
No, I'm not declawing them
Trim their damn nails, you're supposed to
That's part of cat care
That's, probably Alan does
Because they're Alan's cats is the point I was getting at
See that's what I do when my cat's being an asshole, I just cut her claws
and go ahead and scratch me
Because you have no fucking claws
Well, Shermie gets ingrown claws
Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways
But anyways, yeah, so
if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just
cut their claws
Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch
glass. My cat used to
paw at the TV, like my LCD
TV all the time, and if that
thing's not scratched up already by them, then
it's no big deal
I like what Infinal says in the chatroom
Put little gloves on their paws
Mitten mittens
It's your cat being too loud?
You should get the little cat claw
cappers that look like nail polish
Those things are awful
Again, not my cats
not my decision to make
Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her
Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me
the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday
Really?
Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but
it's cool
My struggles with cats goes back to
Oh, that's the freaking
Play it, play it, play it. No, that's not the actual commercial
That's the promo for the episode
I think it's this one
My struggle? No
Not that one
Great radio
Great radio right here
I saw it, I saw it
Donor and cat
enthusiast
Is your cat making too much
noise all the time?
Is your cat constantly stomping
around, driving you
crazy?
Is your cat clawing
at your furniture?
Think there's no answer?
You're so stupid
There is
Kitten Mittens
Finally, there's a
chance to get comfortable mitten for cats
I couldn't hear anything
Is your cat one legged?
Is your cat fat, skinny, or an
in between? That doesn't matter
Cause one size fits all
Kitten Mittens, you'll be smitten
So come on down to Patty's Pub
We're the home of the
original Kitten Mittens
Meow
The hell was that?
That's awesome
An amazing fucking television show
Which is why you should
watch your TV once in a while cause that show is
fucking hilarious
The official dick tell
Okay
Shermie would just shit
That's all she'd do
My favorite is
when the cat's walking across the table
Like, surely
PETA called in on that cause I was
borderline inhumane
Serious face
Back to gaming news
Oh yes, it's my turn
Final Fantasy
There is no transition
You know, if you
have a lot of money
and you've bought a lot of Kitten Mittens
Maybe have some more disposable income
Say $450
You could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation
It's coming out of Japan
Every game in
the series up through Final Fantasy 13
in the Ultimate Compilation
Does it have 11?
It even has 11
Does it have 14?
No it does not
Does it have Mystic Quest?
Will you shut up and let me talk about it?
Just the numbered ones
Is that Dirge of Cerberus?
Now I know how you felt when
Dan kept interrupting you during the classic game of the week
Hey Rob, Rob
What?
Final Fantasies 1 through 13
No 10-2s, no 13-2s
PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2
The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3
Cause they're not gonna bother to port it somewhere new, sorry
PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6
PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9
PlayStation 2 version of 10
As well as 11
And 12
And PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3
Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?
Oh yeah
So here's the bet
Wait a second here
But the problem is though you're gonna need to have an old style PlayStation 2 for that to work
I don't see a hard drive attached there too
I know it is kind of a little bit like
Won't work but whatever
Or if you have an old ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility
I believe there's a way to do it
I think they patched it in at one point
Anyway, 35,000 yen
That's about 450 dollars
There will also be a commemorative DVD
An art collection
And a 2-disc soundtrack
Cause there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan
There just haven't
They need it to be another
There it is
Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection
Something I probably won't be buying
Just cause I have all the ones I won already
I don't have 450
But if I had 450 dollars
I would pay to go to DragonCon or something
And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI
At this point
Come on, seriously
Get the Xbox 360 version
Seriously, if you're gonna buy a console version right now
The 360 version is probably the way to go
But PC is pretty good
Mailbag!
We haven't even done the mailbag yet
It's 8.30 and we haven't even done the mailbag
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Is the place to send us emails every week
There's the mailbag music
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
DarkSoccer dives in
Picks her favorites, reads them now
This comes from
Sam
Hi Sam
Hello OLR crew, I probably love the show
This one's missing
I might love the show
Do any of you think
The Wii U will become
The lead platform for development
Since it will be released before the next PlayStation
Xbox
No
Look at what's happening now
Let's look to the Dreamcast
Possibly
On a couple games maybe
If there's gonna be some stuff that's coming out
During that time
I can see them
Having slightly better looking games
But maybe I don't know if they're gonna necessarily be
Developing for Wii U first and then porting over
It's hard to say
It depends on when the next platforms are coming out
Everyone assumes it's gonna be the end of next year
But it could be in a couple years
In which case, yeah you may have a few games there like that
I am dying to see if there is gonna be a game
That is Wii U
And PS3, PS Vita
Cause it could happen
I'm dying to see if that happens
A third party could do it
Or
Xbox 360 and tablet
Oh yeah that whole
Thingy thing they said at E3
Smart glass, we haven't heard anything on in a while
That's true
They should call it smart ass
Okay, next email
This comes from Rababababa
I was playing Rock Band Blitz
The night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade
And up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz
I was thinking that
Would be a great name to play with someone
But there's no multiplayer
I just remembered the game I forgot to review
Then I saw
Then I saw
Score War Mode
And I thought, surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list
Nope, it just matches you up with
Any random guy 64
So no friends list competition either
It's just the leaderboards
Like many games before it, the game is meant
For a social gaming crowd but it isolates you
From your friends, fantastic
I think Rabababa found this
Because after he sent the email
Because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app
That's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz
Is there's a lot of enhanced
Things that are through Facebook
Which is good and it's bad
And I'll leave it at that
I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top
I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week
And I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show
I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week
I have played an awful lot of it
The short answer, it's good
But
Bless them at Harmonix
They're standing by their guns
I just think there's some mistakes they made
Um
But that's
No, I mean to be fair they make a lot of great games
I do like Rock Band Blitz
But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do
But bless them for trying and sticking to it
That's all I'll say for now
Okay
This last email is from Nasty Canasta
Um
Hi there OLR
If you recall back in the famously infamous
Episode 469
I offered a PSN code
For a live listener to claim
However that meant grumpy Mr. Bobby Blackwolf
Made a super duper offensive comment
That was along the lines of not
Including podcast listeners in that giveaway
Yeah Bobby Grumpwolf
Well Mr. Blackwolf here is my response
I left in the email a steam code
For depth of peril
An action RPG with some strategy elements
And random level generation
I'll leave it to the OLR crew
To come up with a way to give this code
Away to a lucky listener
Also have fun dealing with the brony fandom
Once again at the next Dragon Con Mr. Blackwolf
In addition
If Dark Sacra Sky or Loki is interested
I have one copy of hybrid RTS
FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on steam
Oooh
After you three fight to the death
Dance battle or whatever it is you three do to decide
On things please add me on steam
To get the game I apologize for not having
A code the Nuclear Dawn
Developers decided on gifting the
Option for those who have purchased the game
As part of a promotion I promise
To keep things discreet and platonic no homo
Maybe
Alright
We'll make this very simple email us
Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com
Tell us you want the code what's it for again?
Thank you by the way for the code
For depth of peril
Depth of peril Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com
And we'll give it away to one lucky listener
There you go
But that's just for not the live listeners
That was for podcast listeners
Well you're not going to know if they're one or the other
So it really ends up being for everybody
Well okay how about this
You can't email we won't take the emails
Until after the podcast airs
Oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely
Blackwolf says
And there are furries and bronies all
Over Dragon Con. Tara Strong was a guest
I barely saw them
Meaning they were all up on Tara
Lastly
For Loki did you know there's an official
Sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D
Yeah but the problem is
I don't really care too much about Chip's Challenge
I mean I cared about it back in the 90's
But now it's just like ehhh
Okay so you said
There was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded
In April and it's on Steam Greenlight
Cool
It's just yeah
You know what one I wish I did get in on it was Guncraft
Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft
But with guns and stuff that would have been pretty cool
That does sound kind of neat
Okay that's it for emails
Alright
We'll get to Twitter in a minute so your last chance
To get the tweets in Twitter.com slash O-L-R
But first it's time to get a little bit
Angsty in a segment we call
F-U
Um
Fuck this dad headache I've had
For the last two days
I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting
And I want my whatever it is
In my butt that's hurting
And no it's not like that it's one of the muscles
Around my left hip has been really
Killing me I would like for it to stop
Done
Um
Thank you for
No one being on while I'm on Minecraft
Like I'm on a lot
And there's no one there
This is the
First week you've been able to mention it on the podcast
Well that's true yeah I mean literally I started
And then I F-U'd myself
For accidentally kicking Bobby off the server
A few times back
You did it on purpose I was just getting
Revenge is yours I figured out
Take that Bobby Grumple
I just figured out how to finally
Do things on the server I mean
I've never run a Minecraft server before so
It's a little tricky but now I figured it out
Ignorance is no excuse
And
And just for that an Enderman will be spawning
In my house later tonight
I can make a lot of them
No I don't want that
They're actually really easy to kill
And they're afraid of water
Oh so it's like signs
Water damages them
Alright
My F-U I also give an F-U to headaches
Because I've been getting some killer ones lately
And it's no fun
F-U to kind of like stress
Because I've taken on a lot of projects
Over the next month it's already keeping me busy
And I'm starting to feel the pressures
Of a lot of that stress
I would have done it if I didn't want to but
I'm kind of just nephewed to the fact that
I haven't been hanging out
Enough with people
I don't see enough basically
So because I'm taking
A lot on it's a good thing because it's allowing
Me to hang out with people I haven't hung out with in a while
Or I'm hanging out with all new
But at the same time I'm starting to neglect those
I hung out with before and I don't want to like
That up so F-U to there not being
48 hours in the day basically
And F-U to needing sleep
Although sleep feels so good
Dan do you have any F-U's
You want to give?
He's busy playing game boy advance
He's lying out on the floor like a kid
Playing the advance it is kind of funny
You gotta admit that
My husband is adorable
I didn't go that far but alright
Alright just a couple more stories
For you guys and then the Skype line at 1877
Game O-L-R but first Loki
There's a little bit more information coming
Out now about the whole
Stardock lawsuit
I think we talked about it a couple
Weeks ago where
Stardock was accusing one of their employees who
Recently left the company of
Ruining a game
Because they claimed that she deleted
Stuff for it and because of that
That's what made the game terrible not because
Maybe the game was just terrible to begin with
Not as good as they had hoped
Well there's a little bit more being added
To that
Apparently the cases
Now that they're saying
Alexandria
Mazetta she had filed
A harassment
Lawsuit for well sex over
Harassment lawsuit against the
Head of the company
Before the whole
You know leaving the company thing
Seeking I guess
$25,000
In damage or something
And um
I'm sorry unspecified damages
In excess of $25,000
Um
And she you know had
Filed complaints at the EEOC
And claiming
Basically that the
Head of the
Company had done a lot of lewd things
Including you know linking to a
Sexually explicit YouTube video
Making comments like you know
Oh you're not chosen to go to some place
Because you're not
Just because you're hot or you know asking
Her to take a purity test question
Thing that had you know sexual
Taboo questions and stuff on there
Stuff that's no one else's business then?
You know have you engaged in group sex
I'd like to know that you know because I think
I have a you know
Good chance of the oral like it was
Also I guess there were some witnesses
That said oh
He described to her he said
Was it talking about the
Employees and their breasts and bra sizes
And said that you know
She should attend a media tour because
Her nipples look better on
TV
Wow
But you know like any court case or anything
There's people on both sides and
You know she
You know her
People or
Whatever you know made all those comments
That she of course
Send him a message basically saying okay
I don't want you to touch me
Or any parts of my body not even jokingly
I don't want you to make comments about
You know my boyfriend or future husband
Or anything like that I don't want you to make sexually
You know charged jokes
Which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent
Yes
Let's remind ourselves that email
Should not have had to have been sent
I mean never appropriate
Praise this girl for having the amazing
Self restraint
To be professional at this point about it
But despite whatever
Other allegations are out there
Fucking A
Apparently he responded though
To this email
Saying you know
I don't recall item one
But I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful
I understand number two but I'll be more conscious
However number three is unacceptable
To me I am an inappropriate
Sexist vulgar and embarrassing person
And I'm not inclined to change my behavior
If this is a problem for you
You'll need to find another job
Again I'm not willing to adapt
My behavior to suit others
If you find my behavior
Problematic I recommend finding another job
I'm not some manager or co-worker of yours
I own the company
It and your job here exists to suit
My purpose not vice versa
The company is an end to
Or is not an end
Unto itself
Is a means to an end
Which to further the objective of its shareholders
In this case me
Yeah but there's still laws
If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at
That's a law
You can't get around that
Even if you're a disgusting shit hole like
You know
Sorry
I mean
A man has no excuse
To ever act that way to another
To a woman or any human being
Has no right to act that way towards another
Person at all
And then of course he responded
You know the whole thing
Basically to this
Website quarter of three
You know saying
Okay I'm going to go ahead and respond
To this, the incident happened back in 2010
Myself and Alexandria and a few others
Were at a pub
Going to the
QT3 dinner
That Lloyd Case had
Set up
And while there
Alexandria got teased and got mad at the time
I didn't realize she was so upset about it
And blah blah blah
Later she emailed me about the incident
And stuff like that, basically he plays it off
Saying oh this stuff you know didn't happen
Or wasn't as bad as
Smoking mirrors, smoking mirrors
And basically seeing this as retaliatory
Or the charge that
Basically the whole thing was insinuating
That the retaliatory
The legit retaliatory lawsuit
Of her ruining their game
Was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place
So
It's all going to come out
They're accusing her of deleting all this
Stuff or whatever but it doesn't
It's one of those things where like you know
If the shoe fits, wear it
Or if the shoe, whatever
My point is
Her incredible professionalism
In that email and lack
Of restraint
Praise her for being able to show
That kind of restraint
Doesn't match that of somebody who would
Go in and delete everything
It's kind of like you got this over here
And this over here, it doesn't line up
You know what I mean? How do we know?
And again I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case
So I'm being a total couch
Jury right now which is probably bad
But just throwing it out there
If that's the environment this person
Created at this company where it's like
You deal with it because it's my company
Or what have you
How do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?
Maybe somebody else chose not to take
The high road. Just throwing it out there
Well also the thing too is like
They're talking about how she knew where
The files were and had access
To relevant Google Docs
Why are you using Google Docs as like
A lot of businesses use Google Docs
It just seems very
I've heard of that before
I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school too
You'd seem like you'd have your own
Intranet or something that you do that on
Anyhow
The moral of the story is
People need to
Not do this to
Other people and I'm talking the whole
Harassment thing in the first place
And that kind of bugs me
That in the response it's very
Smoke and mirrors like
Well there was teasing and da da da
But that doesn't give anybody the right to
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Here's what he's saying
There's no excuse for what happened
No he doesn't even
He doesn't even apologize
Now you can argue that I was a jerk
And how I responded to her
But it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and
Quitting without notice and using her network access
To wipe out our marketing access
How dare this person
Oh my god it's so infuriating
How dare you try to blame her
How dare you
I'd love to see somebody do it to him
That is an attitude
That very very bad people have
Since my self showing restraint
Honestly
His behavior is a sign of
Something fundamentally wrong with a person
Like I'm talking about mentally ill
This shit in the industry
Needs to stop because
It is making us all look bad
Knock it off
Thank you
This is fucking psychotic
Behavior
Well I don't even know
How to follow that up
How about a story about Mega Man
Mega Man
Mega person
Capcom, you might be wondering
Why hasn't there been a new Mega Man game
Or what is with all this shit about Mega Man projects
Getting cancelled and da da da da
Well Senior Vice President of Capcom
USA, Christian Svensson
Mentioned to members on Capcom
Unity's forum that the problem is
Mega Man had too many franchise
Or excuse me, too many competing
Sub series
Quote, thanks for the suggestion
I and probably I alone so please don't
Describe said belief to Capcom
Think one of the problems Mega Man has had
As a brand is that we've had too many
Competing splinter sub brands within it
I'm not sure starting yet another
Is the way to get the franchise as a whole
Back on track more than creating
Greater brand confusion but will take it
Under advisement
There's a bunch of shit right there because
The different series that they have were on different
Platforms that they didn't have other Mega Man games
It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy
Advance then you're playing Mega Man
Power or something or other
I don't remember what it was but um
It wasn't like oh hey you know we're gonna have
Mega Man this and Mega Man that and
You know they're gonna compete against each other
I don't think they really had that it was just
Different games especially nowadays
There are no Mega Man games
Like that are super old anymore
You're not gonna be having people you know
Oh hey I'm confused because I played this one on the
Game Boy Advance or hey I'm confused because
I played ZX on the DS or something
Like that I mean those games came out years ago
Except for
You know 9 and 10 those are pretty much
The last new Mega Man games that
Came out Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?
Well yeah they kinda
Let him go where he walked Ah that never stops people
In the industry Well I'm saying if he
Was the I mean he was a big wig
If he was the one driving Mega Man
Development and he's like okay I'm out
And everyone else is just like uh
What the fuck do we do? Let's just go
And put that one away I
Kinda think this and now granted
I'm reading way too much into this but I kinda think
This points towards there's gonna be some
Big reboot cause that's always
The fucking answer to every problem reboot
Of the Mega Man franchise in the future
I bet you anything there's gonna be a new
Mega Man game that's just Mega Man
And it's a reboot and there's
Some new creative person at the helm
And it's not Grin making it
Yeah it's not it lends
Itself perfectly to some type of reboot
Whether that be on the next consoles or
You know maybe a 3DS game
Probably no or a Vita game I think there
Will be a Mega Man reboot
Just Mega Man
Speculation rampant whatever
Fanboy wank call it what you want
I just kinda think that's where all the signs point towards
Especially with that type of rebuttal
There's too many franchises
So they're gonna bring it back to one
We'll see
I bet it's a reboot
Hey!
Let's go to the skype line
1877 game OLR our username
On skype is orange lounge radio we've had a heck of a show
So far tonight let's see what you guys want to talk about
The skype line is open
Again 1877 game OLR
Our username on skype is orange lounge radio
I'm gonna get to the tweets here in a moment
But first let me ask Loki do you have any
Last minute stories or dark soccer of course
If you have anything you want to throw out as well
I'm still in the middle of being disgusted
There's some stupid stories you've probably heard all these before
Where you know some teenager
Drives cross country to meet her boyfriend
So this uh
Girl Beth Robinson
Who was 13 met somebody
On Xbox Live who was 12
Actually 12 not necessarily a 4 year old
Who came to be 12 and he lived in Houston
And she lives in Kentucky
And I guess she ended up chatting with him
And then eventually stole her brother's car
Her mother's ATM card and then drove
To his house
And I guess she uh got as far as Nashville Tennessee
Before being stopped by police
So
And of course we must blame
Xbox Live for this not because
Her parents are retarded
Or you know
She's stupid for
Driving across
I have a belated F.U.
Um sure
To everyone taking a crap on
Mass Effect Paragon Lost
Looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it
So shut up
I'll reserve judgement until the first step's out
But I'm not gonna hate on it just cause
It's Vega
Vega was pretty cool
Alright He's like the bro of the ship
Shall I do some tweets? Sure
He's totally getting on with Cortez
Again 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype
Orange Launch Radio
Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says
How might one acquire episode 169
From the encore last week
And recording it
But since you asked nicely Dark Tetsuya
Uh talk to me offline and
We'll talk yeah
Um
Let's see another tweet from Salacious Pop
I know who that is
Who tweets something I forgot to mention
Earlier on the show but it is definitely
Uh important it's going on
Rest in peace city of heroes
That's right
Paragon Studios is closing
Taking city of heroes with it
They cut down by the end of the year and they got blindsided
They did not know it was coming cause one day
There's a post about oh here's all the cool stuff coming
At the end of the year and then the next day it's like
Bye
No firm date yet sent for the closure
But um that's kind of a
Bummer I know Allen played a lot
Of city of heroes he was into that game
I did not really get
Into it but I saw it and it was
It looked good
I guess maybe because
I didn't play it as part of the reason it was closing
I don't know
There's a lot of people like me
Let's go to the phones, hi you're on orange songs radio who's this?
I'm Zaku here
Hey Zaku long time no talk what's up buddy
Uh nothing much just
Chilling on this uh sleepy sunday
Yeah what's on your mind
Just like finishing off like a little bit of Skyrim
Not finishing the game
But just like finish playing some of it
You can never finish Skyrim
That's that's pretty much the story of my life
Anyways um
Zero to the knee
Yeah that whole thing
Um I'm looking right now through Kotaku
For a particular PAX
Incident that happened
Recently in uh in one of the
The Minecraft party
Where basically this
Apparently this pervert
Exposed himself
More importantly actually
Took the hand of a thumbnail
And actually placed it on his jump
And blogged
I don't know if you heard this
This is like a big deal
For the past couple of days that I was
You know that I was uh catching up on
Hold on
I'm gonna say before I let him finish the story
If that last thing made you mad
This will set you on fire
This is so fucked up
This story go ahead Zaku
Go ahead and tell us and
Brace yourselves this is bad
Okay let me see
Uh it was in
The V.I.P. section
For Minecraft and
This blogger
Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry
Long story short
She was in the V.I.P. section
When a guy right there
She was just minding her own business
And all of a sudden
A guy started off like showing her
Showing her pictures of
You know of chicks
Of girls that he actually took
You know of their breasts
This guy actually took pictures of women's
Breasts throughout the party
So I mean at first it was a bit creepy
But then it got
Then he really ratcheted up when
He basically exposed his penis
And he grabbed her
He grabbed her hand and placed it in his
Right there in his crotch
With the penis exposed
And she just like
Freaked out in the sense that
You know she panicked later on
To the point where she was like
Suffering from stress
She didn't even call like
The police or security
Okay I'm gonna stop you there
I'm gonna stop you there
Cause there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here
If you go to the source and read the original story
Cause this is the part that infuriated me
She went to the security at the club
And she told her friends about what was going on
Cause you can read this at the source
She talked to the security guards
And the security guards the answer was basically like
Well what are we supposed to do about it
That infuriated me
This has nothing
The problem is at the end of the day
This really doesn't have anything to do with
Video games or what have you
Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name
It gives
Male gamers like myself a bad rep
I mean I have a
Girl gamer girlfriend of mine
She's an awesome gamer
Just as hardcore as I am
But more but
The bottom line is that
Every time any other like
Woman would
Picture a gamer or even look at me
As a gamer
I don't want them to think that I'm some
Perv that just like
Flashes himself in front of everyone
Because that adds like
Negative connotations to the whole
To our whole culture
See
I have to say this cause I'm thinking back to
My uh
Before I hurt my ankle I used to
Take a couple different
Styles of martial arts
First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself
You punch him in the dick
Seriously
But that would be assault
That would be assault
I do not
I don't condone that but I don't
If it's somebody you know
Putting you in a situation
Cause technically he grabbed her that could be assault
Let us all agree
It's battery if you grab somebody
Without I mean battery is like
If you like hurt them and they don't
You know if you touch them without necessarily
Hurting them that is battery
He touched her first
Yeah and it's sexual battery if it
Here's the deal you guys are going into this crazy
What if whatever because obviously
In the moment hold on hold on
In the moment she didn't know
If security guards called the cops
Then it would be his word it would be her word
Against his and trying to sort out that mess
Unless they have
There's no way they can press charges
They can get like
They can convict him
Or at least you know put him behind
Put him in cuffs
If there were actual witnesses
That can attest to her story
Then she could easily press charges
Otherwise a cop would just leave
So they're going to believe him over her
You're basically saying that they're all sexist
And they're going to take his word immediately
It's basically he said she said
Even when he's got photos of people
From the post
He's got the photos on his phone
Don't tell me there's not going to be
Cameras at the club that could see what's going on
But the incident
It's at the heart of the matter where
He basically grabbed
Her hand into his crotch
Unless he has someone actually seeing
That then you can't
The cops can't really do anything
But there is other evidence
For stuff that is just like
Substantial at best
That doesn't mean you ignore it
It was totally wrong
What the security guard did
If he did it to her
That's likely not the first time he's done this
Probably in the same night
They would
Separate everybody and question
All the witnesses
Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal
I'm not talking about security guards
I'm saying if the police were called in
Yes
They would have to actually
Step the party down
And detain everyone and investigate
So why are you defending them?
I'm not trying to defend them
I'm just saying that given the circumstances
That it's really hard
It's kind of like a no win scenario
You either call the police
And see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds
To arrest him
On that particular charge
Or you do nothing
And you basically
Get chided for inaction
Him grabbing her hand
If you don't
Him grabbing her hand and putting it on his junk
Is sexual assault, end of story
Right, of course
But the security guard
He would still suffer consequences
Regardless of his actions
Even if he did call the police
As well he should
Yeah of course
No doubt
There was not that much he could have done
No it's the victim's responsibility
If she wants to get the police to call the police
The security guard is there to maintain the security
In the club, he's not there to enforce the law
He's there to keep people alive
And to keep the business running
He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer
You know
He can only ask them to leave
And if he assaults
If the patron in question
Assaults the security guard
Then yeah he has a right to defend himself
Other than that he can't really
Physically detain them
He can only ask them to leave
And only after that point
If they resist
And they start being aggressive
Then the guard has the right
To defend himself
The security guard is not a cop
I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls
But thank you very much for calling in
And sharing this unfortunate story with us
Alright, take care
Bye
I just
I don't know
What does it say about our culture?
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
I don't
There are so many people
How much
Can we all agree
How much of this fault is hers?
Zero
Zero
The behavior has to be addressed
The guy's a sociopath
I just
Something that went back and said
In the chat room is like
We have this environment here where they're telling women
Oh well don't dress
Provocatively you could get raped
Or you know
I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself
You could get raped
It shouldn't be don't get raped
It should be don't rape
Don't assault
To Zaku's credit
And in the interest of fairness
I get where he's going
When you're innocent until proven guilty
But all I'm saying
Is that an investigation
Needed to be done
An investigation needed to be done
And I do think it's on the onus of the club
And the people that knew about it
To make sure that investigation
Takes place
It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet
The job of the security guard
Is to protect the interest of the club
Protecting the interest of the club
Also includes protecting the safety
Of those who were there
Yeah you're right in protecting the interest of the club
Because if I were a game company or whatever
If I was Mojang I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club
For any future event after this story
Or nor would anybody
If I was the owner of the club I would have
Basically ended my contract with that security firm
And gotten one with a better reputation
But the victim needs to contact the authority
The victim does need to contact the authority
As Dan just said
I hope
I hope the internet
Made her feel like she can do that
I don't know what else to say
One thing that I think men need to understand
Is that we still live in an environment
Where women are basically still treated
As second class citizens
A man is
Dan's saying that's bullshit but it happens
It's happened to me
You don't get it because you're a guy
And just because you see it in the pornos
Where a woman catches sight of a penis
And all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis
It doesn't happen in reality
Guys don't see it
If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class
And you allow yourself to be treated second class
It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not
You believe that it's happening
That's why you feel like it's happening
No
That's exactly the problem
Let's cut this shit off, we'll talk about this later
What was that last story
We just talked about then
It's happening
What was that last story in the game industry
I'm not even saying woman
I'm saying person person
A person has
I said that in the last story too
What if it was a guy
Whips it up from another guy
Same story
I would say the exact same thing
Or a woman doing it to another woman
It's inappropriate
Or a woman doing it to a guy
Yeah absolutely
Absolutely still inappropriate
Just because
Somebody doesn't tell
Doesn't mean there wasn't a crime
That's not the point
The point is
No one can hear what you're saying
Hold on
That's not the point
The point is she needs to stand up for herself
That's
How the citrus is going to get fixed
That's how the slimeball is going to get his fucking comeuppance
If he victimizes somebody
And that victim steps up
And fucking puts him down
There is a degree of
Having to choose not to be a victim
Which I don't understand why anyone would choose
To keep a victim's mentality
I don't think it's a choice
But you have to be able to go ahead
And say look
This happened to me
I accepted this happened to me
And this is the action I'm going to take
To rectify that
Okay
And also pointing and laughing at his penis
Would have been funny too
Pretty quick
Yeah tiny penis
But again hindsight
Is 20
Hindsight is 20 20
Hindsight is 20 20
You know it's easy to sit here and say
I would have done this
Someone should have done this
It's easy to sit here and do that
But when it's happening to you in that moment
You don't have that luxury
And that doesn't make what she did
Wrong by any means
And we need to have a society that still
Protects people
From having this happen to them
Anyhow
Let's move on
Do we have a gaming story or something? Let me go to Twitter
Because the tweets were sent in a long time ago
So we might have some gaming tweets
Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate
Was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully
Just saying
Moving on
Ossifer on Twitter
With Mass Effect content
Ooh, Garris
Ossifer says
Just started Final Fantasy 13-2
And I freaked out a little
When I saw DLC for N7 armor
For the main characters
That's true
There was some really awesome DLC
In Final Fantasy 13-2 that incorporated the games
Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?
I think so
Let's see
Other tweets
A couple from Tigerclaw
We do an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to
On Twitter
At Twitter.com slash OLR
It's not loading for me right now
But I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week
That basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline
For Wii U
I don't think that necessarily means
They don't think they really have anything in the pipeline
Beyond
I don't know, they just released
Surely there's something we just don't know about
But nothing that they've announced
Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced
That have
You know, have yet to come out
I mean they have Dishonored coming out
But that's pretty much it
I guess if you count Zenimax
Releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition
But aside from stuff beyond
2012
There really isn't anything that's been announced yet
So
Yeah, I guess that's a true statement
Alright, another tweet from Tigerclaw
About Double Fine
Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test
He links us to a clip on
Gamasutra
This is not the big Kickstarter thing
It's a free-to-play superhero
Management game called Middle Manager of Justice
Okay, you have to admit
That's kind of funny
It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine
Obviously, because it's on iOS
Here's the thing, the game was not supposed to be out
For several weeks
So they pulled it from the iOS store
But a lot of people were able to download it anyway
So they're just considering it, eh, beta test
And you know what, they're owning up to it
Which I think is very interesting
One of the folks here, Ki Chi
Who is the project lead
Yep, it was totally my fault
With the way you submit things on the app store
You have to specify what the release date is
And a while back we had set the date to September
But at the time, we didn't know if that would be final or not
Once we submitted the game, we realized
We had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix
But at the same time, we didn't want to remove it
From the submission process in case Apple catches
Other things we need to take care of
Is to do a double submission
So, at least they're trying to
You know, make lemonade out of lemons
On getting the stuff released early
That's it for Twitter tonight
One last call for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR
Or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
Although I can't fault people
For not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion
If you, obviously
There's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Is a great place, you know
We are the show where every gamer has a voice
We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio
And those of you in the chat room
And so forth, we want everybody to be able to have
Their say, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
If you would like to get your two cents in
Of course there's always Facebook
And Twitter as well
Google Plus and what have you
Skype line ain't lighting up
I guess that means I'm gonna go ahead and close it
We'll try again next week
In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight
We did all last minute stories, do we have any more?
Loki?
Anything? I mean
This week will be interesting
Yeah, this coming week is gonna be very interesting
Between the iPhone 5 and the
Possible iPad mini
Nintendo
I don't know if we'll see that, but
What do you think of the new Kindles
That they have coming out?
I didn't really read up on them enough
Because we already have a Kindle
I'm not really in the market for a new one
The other one that sounded interesting was
I'm not in the market for tablet at all
It's the
Kindle Fire HD
The one that has the 9 inch screen
Or whatever
The 4G one has
A $50 a year data plan
250 megabytes a month
Data
You get with that
For 50 bucks a year, that's not bad
If you're not using a ton of data
For me, I normally wouldn't use
That much data, but I do stream
Pandora, so I've used up like
600-700 megabytes
This month, but
That's like the most I've ever
Used
I don't know, it looked interesting
But, you know
We'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff
Being the same, you know, the $199
They did drop the original Kindle Fire down
The $160 though, to try to
Undercut Google a little bit, but
Still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199
Can't you flash those or something?
You can flash any Android system
Any of those can be jailbroken
Yeah, my wife's Nook's
Jailbroken
It's kind of fun, you can do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to
Oh yeah, like what?
Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on
The Nook, so I added
That with an optional bootloader
And stuff on there, and so she can do that
Plus, if she wanted
To, she could pirate apps for it
I didn't do that
But I mainly
Went with Windows 4 to the other app store
So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps
And she's like, I don't want to get other apps
Fine, I did that all for nothing then
So
Alright
I guess that's it for
Someone call, please
No, I shut the Skype line, it's done
Oh, dang it, I want something happy
Well, we're after 9 o'clock
Dan's gonna take me to Pinkberry
That's a happy subject, Pinkberry's always a good thing
I was very sad though, they did not respond to our tweet
We celebrated the show by going shopping
For candles in the mall at Yankee Candle
And then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful
And Dan had made some type of comment like
Oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out
You're hanging out
Yep
Well
He didn't call, so I gotta put this out there
Don't know if he's listening
But if he is, Ronma, stay black
I think
He just joined us not that long ago, so there you go
I was just talking to him in private message, so
About private things
I know, right
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show
Dan, thank you very much for being here tonight
And bringing your always controversial opinions
I mean that in a great way
To the program, and best of all, the fights
We all love it
You don't fight
Dan, do you have any last words for our listeners tonight? Final thoughts?
Stay black, everyone
Will do
DarkSakura, you're his wife, why don't you go next?
Your final thought tonight
Fuck bitches
I'm kidding
Because dudes can be bitches too
You know what?
Sociopaths need to be locked up, end of story
My final thought is
I wanna thank Alan
For getting me Clue on Blu-ray
Because it's about time I have such an amazing movie
On Blu-ray
And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980's
You're doing yourself a disservice
They rerun it on TV all the time
And it's a cult classic
Please, there are ladies present
Loki, your final thought tonight
Go play Minecraft
Buy it for me
Join the VoG server
See, here's the thing
Technically I could set up the server in a way that you don't need to buy it
But
There is a way
Through a website called Mine Shafter
We wanna support Mojang
But there is a way through Mine Shafter
It's www.mineshafter.com
Where you can
Basically log in with that
Instead of
It's a patched
Proxy server or something like that
You run
The client through
But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers
Cracked servers are
Where they have the mode online toggled to false
Instead of true
I have mine on true right now
However, yesterday when their authentication server went down
I had it toggled to false
So I could log in still
And authenticate it
Technically there's some security holes if you leave it to false
People can spoof stuff
But being that we're a close-knit group
I could
Set it to false
But I'm gonna stick with the true right now
Alright
We wanna thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio
And showing us your support
We are an indie podcast
We don't have a giant website
Or commercial backing or what have you
So all we have is word of mouth
Please tell people about the show
And you know what, spread the word of other indie podcasts
You know, at vognetwork.com
There's a lot of great indie podcasts
And there's a lot of great indie podcasts all over the internet
Help spread the word guys, it's all we got
Hey Rob
The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it
We want oral love
A-U-R-A-L right?
No, oral with mouth
Right, alright, whatever
Spread the love
That's something I can get behind
In front of
We'll talk to you guys next week
Thank you guys for staying up late with us
And participating with the show
We'll see you next time
Big week next week with the Nintendo Conference
Be ready for it
I'm sure Loki's gonna have a lot to say
I'm ready to be underwhelmed
Is your body ready?
Oh my body's ready
What time is it at?
Is it in the morning?
I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit
Another live blog
I can't wait
What the hell is this shit?
We need to talk to Bobby real quick
And see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network
There's all these live streaming
Live blogging software things
I'm at work at that time
So we'll see
Excuse me
So your body is ready for the press conference
My body's ready for disappointment
Seriously
And the iOS conference as well
The iPhone and the iPad is gaming
So I'm curious to see what the next thing is
So we'll see them next week
Have a good week everybody
Are they gonna call it the new iPad or the new iPod
Or the new iPhone
Because that would be hilarious
Lastly
Oh my god
Act Def reminded us
We didn't even talk about it
You finally dressed as Tingle
And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show
Because it was like a week ago at this point
Tell us about the Tingle thing
I finally won that contest
The retweet thing
So she drew me as Tingle
That's the closest you're gonna get
And they did hit their goal
So Evilot is gonna get their orchestra soundtrack now
So that's pretty awesome
But yeah
She's awesome
Beatrix is awesome
And she drew a wonderful picture of me
My wife said
I drew a picture of Josh
I'm like crap
But you know whatever
Nah the one he used funnier
You know what first of all how old is your son now 2
He'll look different
He wouldn't appreciate it
Like for 5 seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else
Make it your twitter picture or something so we can see it
Alright
