1
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:26,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, September 16, 2012, the Wii U launch details are official, Zynga files a counterclaim against EA, and is Microsoft planning an immersive display experience for their next console?

2
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:43,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 473 for Sunday, September 16th, 2012.

4
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:53,084
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and gaming lols with my co-hosts,

5
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:57,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Not with us tonight, sadly, the one, the only, DarkSakura.

6
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:58,066
[SPEAKER_04]: She has the night off.

7
00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:59,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a holiday in her religion.

8
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:03,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So a happy Rosh Hashanah to those of you that celebrate it.

9
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have here tonight, though, in studio, Tech Master Loki joining us.

10
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

11
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Loki?

12
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:09,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing all right.

13
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

14
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:16,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And joining us in Jamie's absence, always a wonderful standby guest host we're happy to have here, as if he had a choice.

15
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Alan.

16
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

17
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:19,718
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Alan?

18
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:20,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

19
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:21,479
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with you lately?

20
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

21
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Working a lot.

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had time for any hobbies outside of video gaming and work?

24
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

25
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:27,983
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

26
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:28,363
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

27
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do you do on the interwebs?

28
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:30,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Tumblrs.

29
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:31,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Tumblrs?

30
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,346
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a big Tumblr fan?

31
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:32,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you like Tumblr?

33
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:36,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a hard time getting into Tumblr.

34
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for like funny reaction gifs and fandom stuff and screenshots, that's where everyone gets into that.

35
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:49,299
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an amazing gif I saw on Tumblr last night that said starships are meant to fly.

36
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:52,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was an old lady going up one of those moving chairs.

37
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you had to see it.

38
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:54,503
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

39
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:55,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

40
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:55,925
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

41
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:58,407
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk to Alan more as the show goes on.

42
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:03,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOG Network.

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: VOGnetwork.com is the place to be.

44
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:11,113
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

45
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Another quality show from Bobby tonight.

46
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And we even got into a little bit of a debate at the end there on a topic we'll be talking about here shortly.

47
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check that out at VOGnetwork.com when Bobby posts his show very soon.

48
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:23,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But you should be participating live.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also participate with us and chat in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com where we have some good well wishes tonight.

50
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:34,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma saying L'chaim, SSJ100Mad, Happy New Year.

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So some other well wishes there for those celebrating the holiday today.

52
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,798
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53
00:02:58,588 --> 00:02:59,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to start with this clip.

54
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:00,349
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two-minute clip.

55
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:06,153
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a clip from our show, episode 463, from July 1st.

56
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the clip.

57
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:10,995
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii U, I think, is a reasonable price.

58
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:13,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.

59
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:16,479
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with.

60
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,320
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in those SKUs?

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,120
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea.

62
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,662
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.

63
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:25,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99.

64
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's that.

65
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:35,430
[SPEAKER_03]: The next price up, $299.99, and then $349.99 are the three different price points.

66
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thoughts on what they are, because this is completely speculative.

67
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know for a fact this is what it is.

68
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:42,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

69
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:48,922
[SPEAKER_03]: 249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.

70
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now, you have all those Wii remotes and... Go on the online shop and enjoy.

71
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nunchucks...

72
00:03:59,053 --> 00:03:59,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

73
00:03:59,453 --> 00:03:59,893
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

74
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,894
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a system.

75
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:06,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.

76
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:17,341
[SPEAKER_03]: $299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii Remote Plus and an Unchuck, kind of like the Wii had.

77
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:26,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the GamePad controller, the Wii Remote Plus, the Nunchuck, and another pack-in game.

78
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:29,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land.

79
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.

80
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I do not think they're launching the system with two gamepads.

81
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no games that support it.

82
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And people will be like, it won't sell.

83
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads.

84
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, it's absolutely useless to do that.

85
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:49,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why they're not going to do that.

86
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:57,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September.

87
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are the price points.

88
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:01,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Release date is probably going to be the 18th of November.

89
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:02,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

90
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's somewhat reasonable.

91
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:06,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That again, a clip.

92
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:07,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

93
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:10,377
[SPEAKER_04]: The clip was from episode 463 on July 1st, 2012.

94
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:13,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me start by applauding you.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, clap, clap, clap.

96
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me anyone else that was that close.

97
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:18,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it perfect?

98
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

99
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You did make one major flaw.

100
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:21,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about the flaw.

101
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:23,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was the difference?

102
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, $299, $349 ended up being legit.

103
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You called multiple SKUs.

104
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,152
[SPEAKER_04]: The we did not, well, multiple bundles.

105
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't like it when you say SKU.

106
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiple bundles, you called that.

107
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:34,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have that.

108
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,800
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

109
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too confusing for the populace.

110
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:03,750
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they only launched with two SKUs for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

111
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: No one does more than two SKUs because it's too confusing.

112
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:11,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think they can't get the cost that low.

113
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't get the cost of the system to be $249.

114
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just dropped that bottom SKU.

115
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why they haven't announced the price yet.

116
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,424
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

117
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot higher than I would have thought.

118
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:50,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to me, that thing isn't much more than the bottom half of a DS, except a little bigger.

119
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:51,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say a DS XL.

120
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe it's a little bigger than that, too.

121
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of surprised it's got to go that high.

122
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And that certainly would set off a chain of events that would cause the 249 bundle to get eliminated.

123
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:07,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even their reasoning behind not having remotes and nunchucks in there, they're like, well, there's 10...

124
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

125
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,432
[SPEAKER_04]: WeMotionPlus enabled remote pluses.

126
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:57,976
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I think, like I said, that they cut the bottom skew just because they couldn't get the price cheap enough.

127
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:10,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, still, I mean, despite the fact that, you know, that part didn't end up being true, and you even said in that clip, you were kind of pulling what was in those bundles out of your ass, and you still kind of got the 349 one right.

128
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: You were pretty, I mean, there's a part in that clip I cut out where I went on this, I'm like, I think the 349 bundle will have two Wii tablets and da-da-da.

129
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:19,453
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I wrong?

130
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:21,174
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another reason why you're not, well,

131
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:23,775
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not seeing two tablets because, one, no game support.

132
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:33,441
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not seeing them sell the tablets separately because, once again, well, not here, because people will be confused and they'll think, oh, this is just an add-on for the Wii.

133
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to buy the tablet.

134
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And they go home and it doesn't fucking work in my Wii.

135
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does this work?

136
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,924
[SPEAKER_03]: This tablet's the Wii U, right?

137
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:42,246
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

138
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:49,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have to think about the consumer and whether they're going to be confused by what you're trying to sell to them.

139
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:55,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Giovedea agrees with you in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and puts it into slightly different words.

140
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:58,464
[SPEAKER_04]: The second-hand market comes from people upgrading as well.

141
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:02,307
[SPEAKER_04]: You need those parts even if you upgrade, so there isn't going to be a huge market.

142
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:03,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose that's true.

143
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:08,071
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to need those Wiimotes and things for the new system if they want to play all the games.

144
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:16,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Land, the pack-in game, that's the weird thing to me, that it isn't coming with another Wiimote, because doesn't Nintendo Land's minigames kind of require those Wiimotes?

145
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're all multiple.

146
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:29,059
[SPEAKER_03]: We play Wii Sports, whatever.

147
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:35,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically tech demos to get you familiar with how you use the controllers and stuff like that.

148
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also a multiplayer game.

149
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you buy it for your kid or something like that and you don't have a Wii...

150
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sucks to be you.

151
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:49,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be playing very much of it because you've got to go get those extra controllers and stuff.

152
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets confusing, I think, because you've got all these different control methods with this thing.

153
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:06,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the remotes, the nunchucks, the classic controllers, the pro controllers, this tablet thing.

154
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,883
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the balance board and...

155
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Just figuring out what you need for each game.

156
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

157
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nunchucks with everything, too.

158
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to get confusing.

159
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

160
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:22,127
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot.

161
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of peripherals over in Nintendo land.

162
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

163
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:36,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris109 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, My sister was thinking that the Wii U pad was just an add-on and that you write a U next to the... And it got cut off, but I'm assuming next to the word Wii.

164
00:10:37,711 --> 00:11:06,942
[SPEAKER_04]: so maybe not everybody is Jimmy Fallon I was going to reference that clip too there was that big clip a couple months ago where even Jimmy Fallon didn't get it and Reggie had to kind of hold on it's a whole new system but you can sit there and be a skeptic I can sit there and be a skeptic I'm not sure where Alan's at but we'll ask him in a little bit the fact of the matter is pre-orders are going fast as we have a story coming up later as we have to take the word from Nintendo that they're going fast well if you try to go to GameStop yourself they're not going to give you one right now

165
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:10,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because Nintendo tells GameStop how many they can sell.

166
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,165
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't know what that number is.

167
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course not.

168
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they want to make it sound like it's in high demand.

169
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they do with the Wii.

170
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:22,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember all those artificial... I'm sorry, real-life shortages.

171
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:25,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally not artificial shortages whatsoever.

172
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:29,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox 360 launch.

173
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I distinctly remember how long it took to find a stinking 360...

174
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,678
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to go on and check Best Buy's inventory every day.

175
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That crap was madness.

176
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, that may have lasted for a few months.

177
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's Wii launch lasted for a few years that they did that, okay?

178
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't even, you know, a few months.

179
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:56,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, okay, we got our supply line taken care of in a couple months, but the Wii, it was just like, oh, it's so hard to get, so hard to get.

180
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the must-have toy for, you know, your kids.

181
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, whatever, you know, I'm skeptical.

182
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:06,190
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some talk about the things that the Wii U could be leaving out.

183
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,196
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, The only thing you have to take into account is the Wii U is not GameCube compatible.

184
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you still play your GameCube games, you'll need to keep that Wii.

185
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Or find a GameCube, to be fair.

186
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,903
[SPEAKER_04]: You could find a GameCube really cheap.

187
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:23,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, Wiis aren't compatible with GameCube either.

188
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's right, SSJ100Matt followed up saying they dropped GameCube controller compatibility in new Wii models, so I wouldn't expect it on the Wii U. He left out the part about the games don't play in the new Wii models either, but certainly the controllers aren't there either.

189
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:44,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised that the system doesn't do... I guess I understand why they don't do it, so they can do their own HD remakes and stuff, but...

190
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,984
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:22,725
[SPEAKER_03]: to a little bit you know smaller extent they kind of smooth them out a little bit and even like uh you know the Xbox 360 did that with the Xbox games it kind of smoothed it out a little bit to make it look a little bit nicer but I'm surprised they don't do that with the Wii stuff it's just you would think that'd be kind of a cool selling point hey all your games look better now I mean because that might even be a way to get people to purchase one if they're not going to so

192
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:51,830
[SPEAKER_04]: well we'll talk a little bit more when we get into the news segment of our show the official news segment of our show on some more of the details with the Wii there's some pretty big ones we're leaving out right now but we'll come back to it in the official news segment talk a little more about it see where everybody here in studio is on if they're going to get one or not and then later when we get into the Fugle question of the week and throughout the show with our chatters we'll see where the listeners are at with do they want a Wii U or not because obviously this is kind of a very polarizing thing in the game in the gaming world right now

193
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: very back and forth on Twitter.

194
00:13:54,931 --> 00:14:01,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fanboys, lots of anti-fanboys, a few people in the middle, but not a lot.

195
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:10,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, though, want to take a second to say, though, you know, again, congrats, because you nailed the date back in July before any other rumor was out there.

196
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:17,159
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people jumped on the November train the closer we got here to the September conference, but you nailed it, so props to you.

197
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you, EpicMickey2.

198
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Because

199
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was the giveaway.

200
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:30,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that they're launching Epic Mickey 2 on all SKUs on the 18th, Disney never launches a game on Sunday.

201
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:30,807
[SPEAKER_03]: They never do that.

202
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was pretty obvious.

203
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That was your hint right there.

204
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:40,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever it was, props to you because I didn't hear anybody else get as close as you did, even some top industry analysts.

205
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's right, because no one noticed.

206
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:45,482
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

207
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on into our gaming weeks.

208
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:53,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, there's no chance to play a Wii U just yet, so we've been playing some other stuff to pass the time.

209
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, I haven't heard from you a lot yet, so let's start with you tonight.

210
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,026
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

211
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:58,686
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been up to?

212
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

213
00:14:59,646 --> 00:14:59,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

214
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:01,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Mesa Source.

215
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good, I lost my mind.

216
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:05,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so good.

217
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, back up a little bit.

218
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,540
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that may not know, what is Black Mesa Source?

219
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an 8 years in the making fan project to completely remake Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 Source Engine with completely new HD assets, new voice acting, new face models.

220
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:25,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It is indistinguishable from something that Valve could have made themselves.

221
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that good.

222
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:28,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty good endorsement right there.

223
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:28,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

224
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I read an email you sent me earlier in the week, if I can dig it up?

225
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

226
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Rob, I love you.

227
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,235
[SPEAKER_04]: XOXO.

228
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:36,675
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

229
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:37,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.

230
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, let's see.

231
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is it?

232
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that one you sent me?

233
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is great radio, isn't it?

234
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:48,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you just sent it to me.

235
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:57,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this mod may be the greatest accomplishment a fandom has ever produced for a franchise.

236
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious.

237
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:03,520
[SPEAKER_04]: There are tons of little added ambient dialogue bits and everything is professional.

238
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It is literally indistinguishable italicized

239
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,284
[SPEAKER_04]: from something Valve could have made themselves.

240
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:11,705
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a mod.

241
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:16,248
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a wholesale creation that had the added benefit of model to reference.

242
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:27,555
[SPEAKER_04]: These developers deserve college scholarships or offer letters from Valve and I'll be angry if Gabe Newell doesn't make some kind of statement by the end of the month acknowledging how fucking good this is.

243
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:36,841
[SPEAKER_04]: They perfectly mimic the lobby of Black Mesa that is referenced from the more recent Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that of course looks nothing like the same room in the 98 original.

244
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:41,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who still complains this took eight years to make is a fool.

245
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:45,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm allowed to have some hyperbole in my emails to my boyfriend, thank you.

246
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very heated.

247
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it certainly got the point across.

248
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:56,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, for something you didn't pay any money for, you felt... Well, I mean, it's a positive review, to be fair.

249
00:16:56,336 --> 00:17:05,702
[SPEAKER_02]: When the game loads up and you're on that monorail going through all of the extra rooms and shit they added, I had to pause it in, like, two places and be like, what the fuck am I looking at?

250
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,783
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, like... This is incredible.

251
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like what the trailer was that came out in 2009, but...

252
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:19,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-Life in itself is a fucking awesome game and this just complete for a fan project has blown my mind.

253
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:29,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And despite what you said in your email about college scholarships and Gabe Newell should essentially give them big hugs and what have you, you have to admit it is pretty impressive.

254
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:34,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve themselves said, cool, just don't call it Half-Life and we're good.

255
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:36,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't infringe on the trademark and we're good.

256
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,090
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we'll help you distribute it on Steam for free.

257
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on Greenlight, yeah.

258
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It is free.

259
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:43,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge.

260
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:46,793
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to own any Source game.

261
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:48,894
[SPEAKER_02]: If you own a fucking Portal game, you can get this.

262
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Which they've given away for free.

263
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:50,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

264
00:17:51,335 --> 00:18:00,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Portal, I think, is the most accessible title that you would have, that you could play this with, or Left 4 Dead, because Left 4 Dead is also crazy popular.

265
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:06,163
[SPEAKER_03]: What about, can't you download the client for Team Fortress 2 since that's Source 2, isn't it?

266
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:07,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that could also be it too.

267
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:07,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is free.

268
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:08,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

269
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:08,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha.

270
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:10,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, work in the system, like usual.

271
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:16,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you asked me, am I ever going to play Half-Life, either Half-Life the original or Half-Life Source?

272
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,332
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no reason to.

273
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:20,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Black Mesa Source is there.

274
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big endorsement from a Half-Life fan like you.

275
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:22,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

276
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:25,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the next question, where the fuck is Half-Life 3?

277
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:29,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Another eight years.

278
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

279
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:42,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are people on the forums kind of being smartasses, but they're right saying, when I legitimately thought that this fan project was vaporware, I had a little voice in the back of my head that said, even if this is vaporware, we're still going to see this before Half-Life 3.

280
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people are all right.

281
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

282
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:52,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat, Tigerclaw saying, I was hoping somebody would talk about Black Mesa.

283
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard Black Mesa doesn't have Zen.

284
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:56,838
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

285
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Gravity is weird.

286
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all these weird platforming bullshit puzzles in it for a first-person shooter.

287
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,740
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really want to do that.

288
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the biggest misstep in the original game.

289
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:25,004
[SPEAKER_02]: The Black Mesa Source developer said, we are putting out 90% of the game.

290
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you enter the portal to go into Xen,

291
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:33,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten there yet, but I imagine there's a screen that's like, we're saving your game, this is going to be patched in.

292
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, these people are terrified of giving deadlines.

293
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:40,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're like, it is coming, we're working on Xen, it's mostly done.

294
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Xen is coming later, and that's the end of the game.

295
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:51,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says, it's not finished yet, everything's remade up to Lambda Core, but they figured they'd release what they have now and the rest later.

296
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman asks, Jesus, did he play the game or marry it?

297
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:55,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

298
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:57,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No shame.

299
00:19:58,457 --> 00:19:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

300
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that.

301
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:16,871
[SPEAKER_04]: What has your fandom accomplished?

302
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:26,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they added women to... In the original game, all the security guards and scientists are just men just because it's only two or three different models, right?

303
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:27,635
[SPEAKER_02]: They added women.

304
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the guards and the scientists.

305
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:36,058
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 16 unique face models so that when you come across these NPCs, like, oh, this is like a new person.

306
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:36,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

307
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:47,686
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the added voice acting of just the guards being killed by monsters running around that you encounter, it sounds like they found the original people from the first game.

308
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just added all these lines of dialogue.

309
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:52,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy what they did with this.

310
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:55,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So props to the folks who put this together, certainly.

311
00:20:56,644 --> 00:21:00,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to make an argument not to go download this right now.

312
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a classic game, free.

313
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They made some little changes to the maps, because obviously someone like me, I've beaten the original Half-Life maybe eight times from start to finish, so I could zerk my way through it.

314
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:19,532
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, oh, they added this area, or oh, they closed this door that I used to go into, and now I have to go over here, and this is all new.

315
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:23,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They added their own little spice to it.

316
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,218
[SPEAKER_04]: DungeonBuster at live.vognetwork.com says, Black Mesa's really great work.

317
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:32,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad they kept the faith to continue with it for so long.

318
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:33,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good point as well.

319
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:41,027
[SPEAKER_02]: After what happened to them in 2009, where they came out, they said Q3 or Q4 of 2009, it's going to happen.

320
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:45,410
[SPEAKER_02]: They realized the parts that they had left to program were the hardest parts.

321
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,232
[SPEAKER_02]: They had at least a year's worth of work left to do.

322
00:21:49,052 --> 00:22:16,985
[SPEAKER_02]: and they made a design decision to basically cut out huge chunks of the game that they didn't know how to code and once 2010 hit they're like okay now that we've cut all of this shit out because it was too hard for us to do we're now embarrassed by this and we don't want to put it out like this so they're like fuck it media blackout they took down their twitter or they just they stopped updating their twitter and their youtube and they're like we're gonna put all this shit back in however long it takes us to do it and it took until September of this year

323
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:17,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

324
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:22,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing dedication because that sort of demotivation would have killed a lot of people.

325
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very impressive what fan communities do.

326
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've seen a lot of these stories throughout the years.

327
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:32,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I can remember way back when there was the fan translation of Final Fantasy V for emulators.

328
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:35,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that back in the day before there was a PlayStation release?

329
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And 3, I think, was the first one, right?

330
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:36,638
[SPEAKER_02]: The NES one?

331
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:37,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the first game we didn't get.

332
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:41,341
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think 5 got the translation first.

333
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:42,561
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 came soon afterwards.

334
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

335
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the NES was harder to patch or something.

336
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

337
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:46,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

338
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:52,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I also remember Second Densetsu 3 was the other huge, huge one that they did the fan translation for.

339
00:22:52,908 --> 00:23:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, I remember the, don't call it King's Quest, but the Silver Lining game that was heavily inspired by King's Quest and at one time was called King's Quest 9, but like Black Mesa, they had to take the King's Quest out of their name to avoid the legal situation they had found themselves in.

340
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's really impressive what a lot of like fan communities have accomplished and I'm like would I be that motivated to do anything like that oh yeah I have had a podcast for 10 years I guess that's kind of cool but this shit's easy Black Mesa I don't think that was nearly as easy so that's that's you know major props so well what else in your gaming week anything else

341
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:38,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tinkered around with a little WoW, checking out the balance changes and the class changes to my druid, who's my main, and I haven't really played as much WoW as I should.

342
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:42,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a little bit.

343
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,311
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a multiplayer weekend.

344
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:45,472
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit?

345
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:47,033
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit?

346
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: The last weekend when they had their, every other week they do log in and do this squad challenge and you get like a free rare elite weapon on Wednesday or whatever.

347
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely spaced it.

348
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,182
[SPEAKER_04]: What level are you in Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer?

349
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:01,203
[SPEAKER_02]: My N7 score?

350
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:01,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

351
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:02,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like about 680.

352
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:09,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll still log in in a match with someone with an N7 score of like 8,000.

353
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:10,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know what?

354
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:11,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that bad.

355
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:12,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that bad.

356
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:13,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that bad.

357
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sharing their account.

358
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:15,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's going on there.

359
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

360
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's it.

361
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:20,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Loki.

362
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

363
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:23,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I played lots of Minecraft.

364
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:34,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been just building this massive castle on the VOG Network server, which you should join, by the way, if you haven't already.

365
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:35,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

366
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:37,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a few people on there.

367
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:39,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a few people on there.

368
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:43,168
[SPEAKER_04]: That fucking castle you're building is astounding.

369
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that all the way from my little house that's like a ways away.

370
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're talking about a fake world.

371
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: But my house is like all the way away.

372
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:57,314
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that some smartass nutman put foreclosure signs all over.

373
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I show you that, Alan?

374
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:58,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

375
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:01,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who did it.

376
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:04,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, there's some people I can't... Like, there's some people I can't...

377
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,419
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some people that are on there right now.

378
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see them on the map.

379
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutman I haven't seen actually play, but there's a few spots because I need everybody to start posting.

380
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't already, put a sign out front of your house so I know whose it is because there's a bunch of spots.

381
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,342
[SPEAKER_03]: My coworker is the worst.

382
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,122
[SPEAKER_03]: He keeps starting new places.

383
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,583
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'm going to build on this island.

384
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you already have four fucking houses.

385
00:25:36,023 --> 00:25:39,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm breaking all of them if you don't fucking pick a spot.

386
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:40,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick a spot and stick to it.

387
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:59,532
[SPEAKER_03]: and like the other day he's like I think I'm gonna build over here I'm like no you're not you're building where you fucking said before and I actually had to go in there and like I switched up the creative to go and destroy his like other houses that he built because they were I don't want all these like half built things well I will let Nutman know the banker

388
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:17,198
[SPEAKER_04]: that I have started digging up clay from all the lakes I can find and started baking some bricks so I can make a house out of brick so go pick on the guys up on top of the hill who also have a stone house or go try to foreclose Loki's castle I know it's all in good fun I'm not really mad I laughed I really did laugh

389
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:18,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on the VOG server right now.

390
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:33,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

391
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:33,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

392
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:33,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

393
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:33,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

394
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:55,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why I haven't, that's why I run a vanilla server because I'm like, I don't know how to fucking set this up with bucket and stuff.

395
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, mods?

396
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,582
[SPEAKER_02]: The mods that I use are mostly just quality of life stuff.

397
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:05,563
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like spawn diamonds everywhere.

398
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:06,624
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

399
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki would frown on that, even though he's probably doing it himself.

400
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:13,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

401
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I do find myself in creative mode a little bit more than I probably should be, just to fly around.

402
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:18,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

403
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:25,038
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw those Endermen outside my house, I was like, no thank you, I'm going to log out for about 30 minutes and come back when those guys are gone.

404
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They honestly, because like I said, the other day we were fucking around with it and my friend took on like...

405
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 of them at once.

406
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:38,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're really not that... If you just don't look at their face, you can walk right past them.

407
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:39,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're scary.

408
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft's scary.

409
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,250
[SPEAKER_03]: They are kind of creepy.

410
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,151
[SPEAKER_03]: They are creepy.

411
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:42,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Survival horror.

412
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,012
[SPEAKER_03]: They're way scarier.

413
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:48,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hilarious, though, watching them in the rain because I was building in the rain.

414
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I see this red flash go past my screen.

415
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:52,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck was that?

416
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:54,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bug or something.

417
00:27:54,899 --> 00:28:00,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they're flipping out because they keep teleporting and they hit the rain and then they take damage so they teleport again.

418
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're teleporting all over the place.

419
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:03,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of funny.

420
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:05,286
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so I played lots of Minecraft.

421
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played, well, a little bit of Call of Duty.

422
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:15,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing some of that because we have some more people we're playing with now at work and stuff.

423
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But we haven't played Minecraft during our breaks, so that's kind of fun.

424
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I repurposed our arcade cabinet that we had running MAME and stuff to play Minecraft.

425
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: and then yesterday I started playing Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360.

426
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:34,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, little early or broken release street dates and all that kind of, okay.

427
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:35,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

428
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

429
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:48,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, right now I was kind of, I didn't know who I should play as so I played as Zero because it was kind of a little similar to Mordecai which is how I played the first game.

430
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:50,049
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sniper, pistol.

431
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:53,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's proficient in the pistol but I know he's proficient in sniper rifle.

432
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Sniper Pistol

433
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,770
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that in there, but then they take it a little bit further, and it's kind of funny.

434
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got that, and then there's a clear-cut villain in it, which is a little bit unique versus the last game.

435
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:26,274
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last game, there wasn't really a villain until kind of towards the end, and even then it was like, okay, well, the villain kept changing.

436
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:31,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little weird, but now there's a clear-cut villain in there, and he's awesome.

437
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:32,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, handsome Jack, so...

438
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:34,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sweet.

439
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game seems a little bit harder.

440
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:38,660
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, at least.

441
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: The enemies are a lot more mobile and they're less dumb.

442
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:47,326
[SPEAKER_03]: They will actually take cover a lot better than they did before.

443
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:51,148
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one has an easier... Because they have the BFF mode, right?

444
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't come out yet.

445
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,592
[SPEAKER_03]: BFF mode's in the MechRomancer, which is not until October.

446
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:59,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

447
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that.

448
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:01,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

449
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:02,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that.

450
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a skill tree.

451
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:09,839
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get skills, I think, until way later in the game.

452
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten the skill trees yet.

453
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you started getting those at level 5.

454
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, remember, I'm playing... Well, level 5, yeah, but I'm only level 4 right now.

455
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even gotten there yet.

456
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:19,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay.

457
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:21,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it takes a little bit.

458
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's nice.

459
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the game.

460
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

461
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will definitely be playing that.

462
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to balance my time between that and Minecraft.

463
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:29,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only level 4.

464
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:30,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're not playing it enough.

465
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I only played it for a couple hours last week.

466
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:36,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want to go back in Minecraft.

467
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,045
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I should play this.

468
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like me in Warcraft.

469
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

470
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, is that it for your gaming week?

471
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:44,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

472
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:44,766
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week.

473
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't talk about Rock Band Blitz last week, so I just want to quickly kind of give it a shout out.

474
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:58,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really, I've been wanting, meaning to write a review for vognetwork.com, but I've just been very busy between my day job and the show I'm directing for early October.

475
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a lot of time to just, when I do have free time, it's like, I don't want to do more work.

476
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize.

477
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rock Band Blitz, I'll tell you some of my early thoughts on it now.

478
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, how great is it to have an enhanced version

479
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

480
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,351
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that those songs will import into Rock Band 3 is great.

481
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:43,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And just if you have whored and downloaded as many songs for Rock Band the series as I have onto your 360, what an amazing value to have this new game that uses them in this whole new way.

482
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the things I didn't like, I don't think the game is as strong as frequency and amplitude.

483
00:31:51,096 --> 00:32:04,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, you know, the whole fact that it's like two buttons and has this kind of interesting mechanic where the way you increase your score is to try and get up all the multipliers by a certain point in the song.

484
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might have to know the song a little bit to know that, oh, your only chance to up the vocal multipliers is in this one part.

485
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:14,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little weird to get used to, but I'm okay with it.

486
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:19,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But the part that starts to bug me is then when you, if you really want to do well on a song, you got to use power-ups.

487
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:36,844
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the power-ups are pretty cool like I love the pinball and I love all that stuff but then we get all Facebook up in here the only way to get these power-ups is with coins and you get coins through either playing songs or completing challenges how do you sign up for challenges?

488
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:48,889
[SPEAKER_04]: you gotta link the game to your Facebook now I gotta say Harmonix does get props for thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different and integrating a game so well

489
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

490
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,690
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

491
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:43,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that, you know, I think it's just a little bit flawed.

492
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:54,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you kind of took something that was meant to be for a free-to-play game and tried to put it in this game, and it's not working out so well, as you can tell, because you're already changing the weights of things in the first couple weeks.

493
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But, again, $15, good songs, new game that uses your old DLC, not a bad deal.

494
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:04,682
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like music games, you probably already have it.

495
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:31,198
[SPEAKER_04]: um some other games I played this week Borderlands 1 because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now free with the quotes because PlayStation Plus isn't free but you know what I mean um ironic because I already own it on the PC but I don't know sometimes I just want to sit on the couch and play it that way with the controller even though I'm not as accurate with the controller I've already got farther on PlayStation 3 than I did on PC go figure but I'm having a good time uh the other new game I want to talk about

496
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:37,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Dragon Neon Speaking of free things on PlayStation Plus Did you know Double Dragon Neon came out this last week?

497
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Alan, I distinctly remember this There was a previous show you were on You were filling in for Jamie And you and I had played through Double Dragon on Xbox Because I just randomly had the version that was on Xbox like five years ago Yeah, and then Dan came in and yelled at us That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah And we played through it and we were like God

498
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: What... This game is shitty.

499
00:35:00,644 --> 00:35:04,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what were people... Why did we love this game growing up?

500
00:35:04,105 --> 00:35:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not age well.

501
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:10,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The clipping and the falling off platforms and just the difficulty and it was kind of janky and slow and yeah.

502
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:14,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so Dan came in and yelled at us going, shut up, Double Dragon's a great game.

503
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:16,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, we were like, ugh.

504
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:19,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's this remake, Double Dragon Neon, that came out.

505
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:27,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta admit, I approached this remake going, Double Dragon's stupid, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it, so whatever, I'll get on there and check it out.

506
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:31,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, well done way forward.

507
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:37,218
[SPEAKER_04]: They made Double Dragon kind of fun again.

508
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a straight up remake.

509
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a shot for shot remake type of thing.

510
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:43,504
[SPEAKER_04]: They added some new things into it.

511
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:45,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Billy and Jimmy can now throw fireballs.

512
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:47,528
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

513
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, release the Kraken!

514
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:09,622
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll start saying things like that.

515
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:10,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really stupid.

516
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's this whole stupid thing you can do.

517
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell was it called?

518
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:18,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, instead of co-op, it's called bro-op.

519
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:24,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can use the right stick or something to just give a high five to your bro.

520
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, high five, bro.

521
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

522
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:31,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so stupid, but I'm just eating it up.

523
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:43,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the guys that way forward who developed it, and to give this company props, they've done a lot of the other good remakes too, of which I'm drawing a blank right now, but I know there were some other really good ones they did.

524
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:44,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of a bitch.

525
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:45,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't I remember?

526
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in chat will help me out.

527
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:54,207
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like they kind of knew that it was a bad game they were adapting, but made it fun.

528
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:55,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love that.

529
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:59,249
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, I heard they changed how a Bobo looks in the new Double Dragon.

530
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they made him like twice the size.

531
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:07,432
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely some Ninja Turtle arcade game elements too, like the bad guys flash when they're getting weaker in health and stuff.

532
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that the game is self-aware.

533
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

534
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:12,668
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

535
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it gonna last past the first few LOLs and all that stuff?

536
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:34,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

537
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends how into these types of side-scrolling fighting games you are.

538
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:42,978
[SPEAKER_04]: If you liked games like Final Fight and all that back in the day, and of course the original Double Dragon, there's something here for you.

539
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:43,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll enjoy it.

540
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Turtles arcade game, I'd say it's on par with that.

541
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't enjoy those games, then it's probably a pass.

542
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:53,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably won't be as funny to you, but I think it's worth checking out.

543
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Game Guru in the chat room.

544
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra 4 was a great, great game that they did.

545
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of those, a lot of people missed that.

546
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on the DS, but yeah.

547
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:05,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Game Guru.

548
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew our chatters would help us out.

549
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:30,997
[SPEAKER_04]: ah Degenerate Johnny in the chat says Double Dragon Neon the ultimate bromance in a way it is the way Double Dragon should be it's great all right uh I guess that's it for my gaming week so now let's get into some housekeeping actually there is a bit of housekeeping tonight um first off the show uh we will not be here live next week

550
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:33,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Apologies guys, live listeners.

551
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going out of town so Studio OLR will be closed next Sunday.

552
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:44,763
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a new episode of OLR up so you can do that still next week.

553
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will be up.

554
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:50,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tape it earlier in the week and it will replay on Sunday night so you can hear that.

555
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:53,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just a special note for our live listeners.

556
00:38:53,888 --> 00:38:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to discourage you from tuning in, though, because Bobby has a really good interview next week.

557
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to get into that because this is a great media partnership for the network that we're on, the Voice of Geeks Network.

558
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:08,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we haven't been around that long, all things considered.

559
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:09,738
[SPEAKER_04]: We just launched, what?

560
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:11,799
[SPEAKER_04]: The official launch was June.

561
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a soft launch in May.

562
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:14,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, get this.

563
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:19,064
[SPEAKER_04]: The VOG Network is an official media partner of the Siege Network.

564
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:20,405
[SPEAKER_04]: GameDevelopersConference.com

565
00:39:39,218 --> 00:39:40,059
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in Florida.

566
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we got some listeners in Florida.

567
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:45,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in that area and you're interested in developing games, this is a great opportunity for you.

568
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: October 5th through 7th in Atlanta.

569
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:51,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf will be there representing the Voice of Geeks Network and he's going to be there.

570
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be covering the show on our website, of course, as well as his own show.

571
00:39:55,849 --> 00:40:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be helping out the Georgia Game Developers Association with doing audio and video from the panels and keynote speeches through the weekend.

572
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:04,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really cool.

573
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:05,715
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the sixth year of the Expo.

574
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people that are going to be there.

575
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:16,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Dustin Klingman, who's the executive director of the International Game Developers Association, Rob Carroll, who's the director of publishing for Tapjoy, and so on.

576
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Panels on programming, 3D modeling, game audio.

577
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:20,902
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not E3.

578
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:22,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No new game announcements here.

579
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:25,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be that type of expo.

580
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're curious about the industry, you want to know more about how to break into it, how are the games really made, what's going on in game development right now, and you're in that neck of the woods, I highly encourage you to go

581
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,912
[SPEAKER_04]: October 5th through 7th, Atlanta Marriott, Northwest, in Atlanta, Georgia.

582
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:48,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Passes are anywhere from $39.95 to $104.95 depending on your current membership with Georgia Game Developers Association or if you're a student or what have you.

583
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:50,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out more info at their website.

584
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It is siegecon.net.

585
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, S-I-E-G-E-C-O-N.net.

586
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:03,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And props to Bobby was obviously, because that's his backyard, a huge part of establishing that partnership.

587
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:17,928
[SPEAKER_04]: props to you my friend pushing our network forward one other big announcement I got a lot of stuff tonight for housekeeping and not just plugging the Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio or twitter at twitter.com slash olr though I just did

588
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:26,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, we had Aaron on the show, or YYR, and he was pimping his game, Bungie Ferret Tossing, and you might be asking yourself, where the hell is it?

589
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:30,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Aaron tweeted earlier, and he says, Monday.

590
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:38,342
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will be out tomorrow, so by the time most of you hear the podcast version of this, Bungie Ferret Tossing will be out on Xbox Live Indie Games.

591
00:41:38,402 --> 00:41:38,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys,

592
00:41:39,262 --> 00:42:01,013
[SPEAKER_04]: let's make this a success this is OLR inspired this is one of our dream games becoming a reality and it's one stinking dollar you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your wallet already so go get this game on Monday Bungie Ferret Tossing we will have links on the Twitters and on the Facebooks and all that good stuff as soon as the game is out and we can link you to it check that out

593
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:06,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now I'm done with housekeeping Yay, we got it, right?

594
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:15,925
[SPEAKER_04]: No live next week, but pre-recorded We have Siege and we have BFT on Monday Facebook, Twitter, busy busy Back to the Wii U then, Loki?

595
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:18,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some of the stuff we missed

596
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:27,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so a few things about the Wii U. Well, there's a lot of things about the Wii U. But first off, Bayonetta.

597
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:37,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta 2 is actually going to be an exclusive title for the Wii U that's coming through with a partnership between Platinum and Nintendo.

598
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:39,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got that.

599
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that they're talking about also, game pricing.

600
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone was kind of wondering when the pricing was.

601
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:45,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've mentioned this in the past.

602
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like the current gen consoles.

603
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:55,681
[SPEAKER_03]: $59.99 is going to be the kind of going price for Wii U games, which is kind of a duh.

604
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:59,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it makes sense that it would be that price.

605
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Those pro controllers are going to be going for $49.99.

606
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the different launches.

607
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:10,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we know we're getting it over here in North America on November 18th.

608
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:16,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe's getting it on November 30th, followed by Japan getting it on December 8th.

609
00:43:19,691 --> 00:43:21,092
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of interesting, too.

610
00:43:21,953 --> 00:43:27,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only does Japan get it on the 8th, but they're also getting their systems without sensor bars.

611
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,794
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

612
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:46,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an interesting choice.

613
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there is some other stuff.

614
00:43:53,671 --> 00:44:01,235
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the features that they were kind of pimping out was the Nintendo TV service, TVII.

615
00:44:02,255 --> 00:44:04,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta stick with the whole naming scheme.

616
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:06,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate on it all you want.

617
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:07,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute and it fits.

618
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:08,999
[SPEAKER_03]: The name's fine.

619
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:27,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm just saying, it's a little interesting, it's kind of like the same stuff that we're doing on the other consoles, where they've got a bunch of different streaming services bundled together, plus also you can watch live TV, because you can apparently hook it up to...

620
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:34,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they haven't shown it yet because no one's allowed to take pictures of the back panel, but the thought is that you're going to be able to hook it up to your cable line.

621
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:42,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does tie in with TiVo, Netflix, and I believe Amazon streaming services.

622
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:59,302
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course you can also set stuff to TiVo if you have your TiVo and apparently they're working with all the different subscribers, Comcast, all the cable and satellite providers

623
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:09,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this mean that it has the technology where like in your house let's say Loki you want to watch American Idol because I know you're such a Nicki Minaj fan you'll be watching this year.

624
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:16,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to watch American Idol on the big TV and then if Nelly doesn't want to watch that she can watch the Oprah Network on the Wii U device.

625
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:17,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it works like that.

626
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:18,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite like that?

627
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:19,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it works like that.

628
00:45:19,707 --> 00:45:21,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one's got to be Netflix.

629
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:27,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but see, at this point, everything streams Netflix.

630
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,100
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

631
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,201
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the 3DS streams Netflix.

632
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:34,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And because if you're a Nintendo fan, you probably have a 3DS as well.

633
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:37,023
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hell, your Wii streams Netflix.

634
00:45:37,263 --> 00:45:38,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Your phone streams Netflix.

635
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:40,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Your iPod streams Netflix.

636
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Your PC streams... Everything fucking streams Netflix.

637
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:45,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need another device to stream Netflix.

638
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:47,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, my pants do not yet stream Netflix.

639
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,286
[SPEAKER_03]: You need better pants.

640
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:56,016
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just, I mean, cool, okay, whatever.

641
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a selling point, whatever, they want to make that.

642
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they announced also that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, also 3DS.

643
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:13,892
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out next year though, March 31st is the tentative date right now, obviously it's placeholder, but...

644
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably March next year.

645
00:46:19,116 --> 00:46:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that the Wii U controllers are pretty expensive because they're selling them separately in Japan for some reason.

646
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there's no games that support it, but cool.

647
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to spend extra money, why not?

648
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:31,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

649
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's nothing about online other than that there's supposed to be some sort of premium service that they're going to give you 10% back on any downloads that you pay for.

650
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:48,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really bothered by the lack of online information.

651
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:50,899
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else is weird?

652
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they shown, like, this is what the Wii U looks like when you turn it on.

653
00:46:55,663 --> 00:46:56,564
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the interface.

654
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:57,405
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they talked about it.

655
00:46:57,445 --> 00:46:57,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they?

656
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:58,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I missed that.

657
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:05,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to just boot right into that Nintendo, the Mi Plaza Home thing or whatever the hell they're calling it.

658
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the thing with little messages that were showing up?

659
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:07,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

660
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like it could be interesting.

661
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:09,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

662
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:26,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but here's the other thing too that's kind of bothersome is the amount of storage that's on this thing I mean, 8 gigs for the cheap one and 32 for the more expensive one Well, they made the right decision though because Reggie confirmed in an interview that you can just plug in any old drive and it'll work

663
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but fuck that.

664
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a 250 gigabyte drive or something.

665
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, if they're going to be offering games digitally, and they've already said that these games, the disks are going to be up to 25 gigabytes, I'm going to get a third of a download for...

666
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:48,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's be real.

667
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:50,651
[SPEAKER_04]: How many games are going to really take up all that space?

668
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:59,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's like Blu-ray, then if it's a PlayStation 3 type game, a lot of them actually will take up over 20 gigs or at least up to 20 gigs.

669
00:48:00,415 --> 00:48:15,343
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a Wii set up to load games to a hard drive that you can plug in the Wii, which is something we've talked about on the show before, so that you can load discs that you own onto the Wii for quick access, whatever, you'd be surprised how small some of those games are.

670
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:17,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the Wii, though.

671
00:48:17,345 --> 00:48:19,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, the Wii is last-generation graphics.

672
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:23,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, anything is probably going to fit onto a single-layer DVD.

673
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:31,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they only had a couple dual-layer DVD games, whereas everything is a dual-layer DVD on the Xbox 360 and on the PlayStation 3.

674
00:48:32,218 --> 00:48:35,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, Blu-ray, and obviously those are going to be a lot bigger.

675
00:48:35,982 --> 00:48:37,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

676
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:39,945
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

677
00:48:58,106 --> 00:48:58,446
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

678
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:21,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of how exciting it'll be to spend all that money to buy those controllers.

679
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you did it when you had the Wii or you did it now because you don't own a Wii.

680
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to spend all that money.

681
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:39,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on top of that, if you want to digitally download stuff, like actually first party games or full console games, you're going to have to spend money to buy a hard drive.

682
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:42,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Which hard drives have come down in price, but still it's an added expense.

683
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have to do that.

684
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:44,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

685
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:51,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's kind of annoying that they have all these things that they cut out to make the console cheaper.

686
00:49:51,956 --> 00:50:01,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that we gave other console manufacturers crap for, like cutting out USB ports.

687
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:02,384
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing, too.

688
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:06,867
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to plug in some sort of USB drive into this thing, or like a...

689
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:08,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard drive or something.

690
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,230
[SPEAKER_03]: How many fucking USB ports on this thing?

691
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:10,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two?

692
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:16,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens when, you know, say I got to play another game that requires some other USB peripheral.

693
00:50:16,654 --> 00:50:17,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Would a hub work?

694
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:18,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

695
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,616
[SPEAKER_03]: At an expense.

696
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:20,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to buy a fucking hub now.

697
00:50:22,078 --> 00:50:22,678
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not that bad.

698
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:23,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter, though.

699
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to buy a fucking hub.

700
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:29,943
[SPEAKER_04]: If you bought three USB devices, you can spare the money for a hub or whatever.

701
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, you know, it's an extra expense that they're not talking to, you know, the consumers about or they're not even, they don't even know what their fucking online plan is yet.

702
00:50:41,313 --> 00:50:43,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we, yeah, that concerns me too.

703
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, I need to hear from Nintendo that they understand online now.

704
00:50:47,975 --> 00:50:51,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they haven't even said, here is, you know, our online.

705
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:55,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what it looks like, you know, requesting, you know, friend requests.

706
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's this and that.

707
00:50:56,818 --> 00:50:58,119
[SPEAKER_03]: All we've seen is just, you know,

708
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look, you can post stupid messages on a message board about this game.

709
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:03,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha, this level is hard!

710
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:04,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, smiley face!

711
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:15,851
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, that's all I really... Just so you know, Loki, the chatters are correcting you on something, starting with Blackwolf and JVMon following four USB ports, they said.

712
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:17,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Two in front, two in back.

713
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:18,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cool.

714
00:51:18,713 --> 00:51:19,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That should do it, then.

715
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:40,249
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh still though I don't want to have to buy all these extra things let's take a step back for a minute Alan I'm going to ask your opinion on all this too because you're being too quiet over there but hold on before I get to you uh I want to take a step back Bayonetta 2 because obviously that was the big thing that people walked away from this whole uh you know expo going

716
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, Bayonetta 2, it's real.

717
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

718
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And okay, it's on the Wii U. All right.

719
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:50,770
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, that's exactly the type of bullet Nintendo needed in their gun.

720
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, pun intended.

721
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:55,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That was... But for me, though, it wasn't quite enough.

722
00:51:56,192 --> 00:51:56,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm...

723
00:51:56,972 --> 00:52:03,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Nintendo saved it from not existing at all, and I'm glad that's a step in the right direction.

724
00:52:03,298 --> 00:52:08,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not enough in the right direction to really convince me, like, holy shit, I need one of these day one.

725
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:18,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed to see F-Zero, Metroid, Zelda, one of those Nintendo properties that's not just another Mario game in the same vein as the three that have already come out recently.

726
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:34,624
[SPEAKER_03]: well here's the thing too about Bayonetta too I mean Bayonetta didn't sell very well I mean it's a niche game I mean it didn't sell that great but now you're narrowing it down even more all those fans but it's fucking great I understand it but your devil may cry it's the same game and that game does well

727
00:52:34,804 --> 00:52:34,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

728
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:06,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the Bayonetta thing, for the last two years I've been asking, even if it's just in Japan and we don't get it, where's Bayonetta 2?

729
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, Japanese games, they love their sequels, right?

730
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:09,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, where is it?

731
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:10,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Bayonetta 2?

732
00:53:11,071 --> 00:53:12,252
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Platinum Games working on?

733
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:16,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I finally said Bayonetta 2 is real, but it's Wii U exclusive...

734
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:26,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still kind of disappointed and mad about that, but I'm going to think realistically, will it be ported to at least a 360 or PS3 within two years?

735
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:27,584
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

736
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,005
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not?

737
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:30,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's published by Nintendo.

738
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:30,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

739
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:31,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

740
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo has it by the balls.

741
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:33,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

742
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:53,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well there's that, but one, I guess I just won't play it then, and two, like what Bobby Blackwolf was saying, if it means Nintendo dropping a big sack of money in Platinum Games Labs, saying give us Bayonetta 2, if that had to happen or else Bayonetta 2 wasn't going to happen at all, then fine, yes, I would rather there be a Bayonetta 2...

743
00:53:54,993 --> 00:53:58,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't swell his ego anymore after tonight's show.

744
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:03,679
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to understand something about all these people going, oh my god, Bayonetta 2, the Wii U has it and all that stuff.

745
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they announce a fucking release date for it?

746
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, that wasn't there?

747
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee, I wonder why.

748
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Because maybe that Platinum Games right now is working on Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

749
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't come out until February.

750
00:54:14,687 --> 00:54:17,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means they're still going to be fucking working on that game until at least January.

751
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That trailer was literally nothing.

752
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:22,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it in that 50 game launch window thing?

753
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:22,573
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

754
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:39,689
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a launch title it's probably next year sometime you'd be lucky if it's next year holiday I bet you 2014 just like hey Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and everyone's like oh my god Smash Brothers I need to buy a Wii U it's not fucking coming out for years it's it's

755
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:43,086
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of the 3DS syndrome, I hate to say.

756
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:46,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Pilotwings Resort, not the killer game to launch your system with.

757
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:54,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They're teasing shit that's not going to be coming out forever because people are dumb enough to go, I'm buying the system for Bayonetta 2.

758
00:54:54,837 --> 00:55:00,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, you're buying that system, it's going to be fucking collecting dust until the two years from now that Bayonetta is going to be coming out.

759
00:55:00,562 --> 00:55:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, Nintendo Land, for what it is, a weeaboo collection of minigames and so forth,

760
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:08,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks pretty neat.

761
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of sold on Nintendo Land, I gotta say.

762
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

763
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:15,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably enjoy that more than I actually played Wii Sports.

764
00:55:16,873 --> 00:55:20,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Sports is one of those things that's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, oh, I get it.

765
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:27,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wish they would have something that would be, you know, oh my god, I have to have this system for it, but they just don't.

766
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:28,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my thing.

767
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:29,680
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm not getting one.

768
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:35,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that, oh, you're wrong for, you know, someone else is wrong for getting it because they have something that they're like, oh, my God, I want to play that.

769
00:55:36,284 --> 00:55:38,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, oh, God, I got to play, you know, Mario Brothers in HD.

770
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:41,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Pikmin has a cult following.

771
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:47,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my game that I ever really got into, but I could understand where somebody's like, fuck, yeah, Pikmin, I got to get this.

772
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Those games sell like crazy.

773
00:55:48,551 --> 00:55:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a success.

774
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because people buy anything that says Mario on it, okay?

775
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:55,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be Mario's Douche Factory and people eat that shit up, okay?

776
00:55:55,374 --> 00:55:55,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

777
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:15,662
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

778
00:56:15,782 --> 00:56:18,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I'm sure it's going to be a fun game.

779
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:22,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, for me, it's not that, like, wow.

780
00:56:23,068 --> 00:56:33,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that, it's the same experience I can get right now, you know, on 3DS or on Wii or something like that.

781
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:34,438
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my problem.

782
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:40,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the gimmicky thing of, hey, look, I can use this tablet and I can tap the screen and it makes platforms.

783
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, you could probably do that if you made some sort of connectivity between the DS version and the Wii version.

784
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:52,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do the same shit with your stylus on the touchscreen, but no, we're just not gonna do that.

785
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:57,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, you never got to finish your thought because Loki, you know, got on his tangent, but...

786
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:03,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'd rather there be a Bayonetta 2 that I'll never play than no Bayonetta 2 at all.

787
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:14,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Bobby was reading those tweets about, this is the worst thing since the Mass Effect 3 ending, I was like, oh Jesus Christ, go pee your bed.

788
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:15,642
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

789
00:57:15,843 --> 00:57:16,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

790
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:18,546
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a thing that people are talking about?

791
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:19,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.

792
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have no fucks to give for the Wii U. I don't care.

793
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't play it here.

794
00:57:26,455 --> 00:57:30,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one system that I don't bought that I didn't have my own copy of when I moved in with you.

795
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Wii Fit for like a week.

796
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:35,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while I get into Wii mode.

797
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:36,306
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to admit.

798
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:36,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

799
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:37,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while.

800
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:42,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to pick up We Fit You because We Fit You's got the crappy pedometer with your little me on it.

801
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:43,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

802
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:44,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

803
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:51,853
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's watching TV, you can look like a goddamn fool staring into a little tablet and exercising.

804
00:57:54,763 --> 00:58:01,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, let's... Alan, let's say you had the money, money's not a concern, and so forth.

805
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:08,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You still would not buy a Wii U on this principle of there's not really something you want to play on it right now, right?

806
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:08,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

807
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I agree with what Loki was saying.

808
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That 20, 25-second Bayonetta 2 reveal...

809
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:16,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Reveal trailer is literally nothing.

810
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:22,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, there's... They have not probably even started to work on this game even a little tiny bit yet.

811
00:58:22,197 --> 00:58:23,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's two years off.

812
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:28,260
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in a Wii, and you haven't pre-ordered it yet, you're probably not going to fucking get it at launch anyways.

813
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Just chill the fuck out.

814
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:34,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Let the whole, like, you know, oh my god, I'm a crack addict.

815
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I need my Nintendo crack, you know, right now.

816
00:58:36,705 --> 00:58:38,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let that, like, kind of calm down.

817
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:39,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out of your system.

818
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And just give it, like, a year.

819
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

820
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:59,580
[SPEAKER_02]: you know a Zelda game will be fucking coming out the system will probably drop in price and there'll be stuff that you'll actually want to play I think the 3DS is going to be an awesome system that is going to have dozens of must-have games for it in another two years the Vita is going to be an awesome system with dozens of must-have games for it in another two years so Wii U is probably going to be the same way

821
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru brings this comment to chat that has the facts I was looking for in arguing with Loki earlier.

822
00:59:05,903 --> 00:59:06,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, GameGuru.

823
00:59:07,304 --> 00:59:08,464
[SPEAKER_04]: New Super Mario Bros.

824
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: U sold 25... I think he meant to say New Super Mario Bros.

825
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:13,667
[SPEAKER_04]: New Super Mario Bros.

826
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:15,848
[SPEAKER_04]: sold 25 million copies.

827
00:59:16,108 --> 00:59:18,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.

828
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 million copies as a franchise or as a title?

829
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:24,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think that's as a title.

830
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:26,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a packing game.

831
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:27,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Semantics.

832
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:29,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

833
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge game.

834
00:59:30,939 --> 00:59:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: The point still stands.

835
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.

836
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:38,780
[SPEAKER_03]: or they could have made a new Mario game.

837
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Why settle for just the same franchise that you've already been pimping for a while?

838
00:59:43,044 --> 00:59:46,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those numbers look nice if you're talking franchise because you've only... How many new Super Mario Bros.

839
00:59:46,928 --> 00:59:47,728
[SPEAKER_03]: games have you released?

840
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

841
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to buy Legend of Zelda.

842
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:51,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The new one?

843
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:52,933
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all of them.

844
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:53,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Again and again.

845
00:59:55,395 --> 01:00:00,618
[SPEAKER_04]: But now let's go back to the real world for a minute here, Alan, because you're not living by yourself anymore.

846
01:00:00,678 --> 01:00:05,001
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in a committed relationship with an individual who tends to be a bit of a consumer whore.

847
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:09,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So there probably will be a Wii U in the house within the next year.

848
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,704
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that make you feel?

849
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:16,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about the Wii U. You won't even touch it?

850
01:00:17,388 --> 01:00:18,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't look at it?

851
01:00:18,588 --> 01:00:19,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's hooked up.

852
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it, but I mean... Well, it's there.

853
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:27,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have my hour where I go, oh, okay, it's the controller.

854
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then boom, never again.

855
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:32,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

856
01:00:34,105 --> 01:00:38,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Technis in chat wondering, so I wonder what will come out first, Bayonetta 2 or The Wonderful 101?

857
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

858
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly The Wonderful 101.

859
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:49,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Wonderful 101 because that's the launch window title and Bayonetta is not even fucking being worked on yet.

860
01:00:51,456 --> 01:00:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what though?

861
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:54,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I want to say props to Nintendo for the Bayonetta 2 thing.

862
01:00:55,139 --> 01:01:01,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Now give me like three more of those on that level and we're sitting really, really, really good.

863
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:04,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Platinum tends to release about one game a year, I think.

864
01:01:06,186 --> 01:01:07,467
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to be Platinum games.

865
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:10,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about other exclusive things would be great.

866
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:15,492
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking about Platinum games as the company being released.

867
01:01:16,013 --> 01:01:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: One title they work on about once a year, I think.

868
01:01:19,755 --> 01:01:25,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Platinum games did Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns in the US.

869
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:27,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though that's not out yet.

870
01:01:28,221 --> 01:01:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, they've got, you know, next year, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

871
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:33,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So, probably 2014.

872
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:36,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some more Nintendo news.

873
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,871
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a story on the Nintendo Network.

874
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:40,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of touched on this, so I'll make this quick.

875
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:47,752
[SPEAKER_04]: If you shell out the money for the higher-end Wii U, you're going to get not just some more gigabytes, you will get access to Nintendo Network Premium.

876
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:50,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Network is the online service.

877
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:57,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be free, but apparently Nintendo said at one point, well, maybe it won't always be free, we just don't know yet.

878
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:58,434
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot we're still figuring out.

879
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't figured out the whole network thing.

880
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like what we have now...

881
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Network Premium

882
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:20,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario Bros.

883
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 Gold Mania 3DS

884
01:02:41,115 --> 01:02:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: is this like a yearly subscription thing or is this just I buy the fancy system you buy the fancy system and you get it now the other thing from the Japanese conference only offered till December 2014

885
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:53,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

886
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

887
01:02:54,806 --> 01:02:58,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I be able to get it in this, like, two-year window?

888
01:02:58,529 --> 01:02:59,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

889
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:07,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, there's a lot of question mark here that I'm not, you know, and that's the problem is that after that press conference, there should not have been this many question marks.

890
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:08,816
[SPEAKER_03]: That's life expectancy of the console.

891
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two-year console cycle.

892
01:03:10,877 --> 01:03:11,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

893
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:12,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll have the Wii U U.

894
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:17,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I get if it's only free until December 2014, but then what?

895
01:03:17,444 --> 01:03:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: What do the non-deluxe people get?

896
01:03:19,206 --> 01:03:20,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all it is?

897
01:03:20,107 --> 01:03:21,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a discount program?

898
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:23,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we still on friend codes?

899
01:03:23,752 --> 01:03:25,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have Nintendo gamer tags now?

900
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

901
01:03:27,997 --> 01:03:28,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

902
01:03:28,378 --> 01:03:28,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

903
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:31,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm not supposed to ask those questions.

904
01:03:31,856 --> 01:03:33,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm supposed to say, ooh, Bayonetta, pretty.

905
01:03:35,017 --> 01:03:35,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

906
01:03:36,678 --> 01:03:37,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do more Nintendo news.

907
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:38,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

908
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:50,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So websites that are offering pre-orders for the Wii U system, either of the bundles, are marking themselves as being sold out.

909
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So the assumption that could be made is that this thing is selling like crazy, at least in the pre-order cycle.

910
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:04,800
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Target are sold out online of both versions.

911
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:11,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Sears and Kmart are only listing the Deluxe as sold out with the cheaper SKU not there at all.

912
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:15,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, GameStop online can't pre-order it.

913
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't really mention Amazon in this article that I'm referencing.

914
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:21,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's another issue going on there, but I'll come back to that.

915
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:26,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already kind of talked about this a little bit where Matt was saying, well, we don't know how much...

916
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:31,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Nintendo dictates to them what numbers there are before they have to consider themselves sold out.

917
01:04:31,992 --> 01:04:39,334
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like Walmart, grown, who's also making things more difficult because Walmart does their own bundle within the bundle.

918
01:04:39,814 --> 01:04:45,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Walmart Online is offering their Walmart Solution Bundle, which are even more expensive.

919
01:04:45,436 --> 01:04:51,037
[SPEAKER_02]: The basic one with the shit that they are bundling in is $400, and then $450 for the deluxe.

920
01:04:51,397 --> 01:04:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We use SKU plus whatever bullshit they're...

921
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:59,342
[SPEAKER_02]: and so if you want to get in on the Wii U pre-order, Walmart, I guess, is a good place to start.

922
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:08,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess Nintendo's not looking to have these long lines and stuff this time because if Target and Walmart both did pre-orders and that's where all the lines were showing up before.

923
01:05:08,267 --> 01:05:11,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, if they sold out in one day, it's...

924
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,091
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

925
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no stories about people lining up at the fucking store to make pre-orders.

926
01:05:17,134 --> 01:05:20,617
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way that there's a large amount of systems being pre-ordered.

927
01:05:20,757 --> 01:05:26,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if everybody fucking rushed down and bum-rushed GameStop, there's no way that they have a lot.

928
01:05:26,962 --> 01:05:30,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're doing it, though, so that it makes a good headline.

929
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: The system's selling out.

930
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how fast it sold out.

931
01:05:33,368 --> 01:05:37,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if I offered one for sale, it would sell out instantly.

932
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,614
[SPEAKER_02]: On a website where you can't see how many they have.

933
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fuck, look at the iPhone 5.

934
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that shit selling out?

935
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they're going to sell millions of those.

936
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:52,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a hard time believing that there's going to be a lot being sold.

937
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:53,534
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to carry the 3DS

938
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but exactly.

939
01:06:18,987 --> 01:06:21,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a 3DS game from them not that long ago.

940
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:23,008
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to carry the 3DS.

941
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3DS, they had a problem with people reporting broken hinges.

942
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they got returned to them.

943
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought is that they tried returning those to Nintendo.

944
01:06:31,432 --> 01:06:33,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo said, fuck you, you're stuck with them.

945
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:36,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're like, fuck you, we're not carrying your hardware.

946
01:06:36,894 --> 01:06:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is fine.

947
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:39,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to be honest, they don't need that shit.

948
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:40,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know why?

949
01:06:40,415 --> 01:06:42,736
[SPEAKER_03]: The hardware, there's no markup on the hardware.

950
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:44,277
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making nothing off that.

951
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no reason for them to carry it.

952
01:06:47,178 --> 01:06:49,900
[SPEAKER_04]: But Amazon, that's not the type of company Amazon is.

953
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:54,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon will slit throats to get you to go to their site and buy this shit on their site.

954
01:06:54,043 --> 01:07:00,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but if it's come down to where, you know, hey, we're losing hundreds of dollars on this thing.

955
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:04,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon lost their biggest competitive advantage yesterday.

956
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:09,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon is now in a whole new world as of yesterday.

957
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:11,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what changed at Amazon.com yesterday?

958
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Started charging tax.

959
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:13,236
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

960
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:13,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Sales tax.

961
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Sales tax in the state of California.

962
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think a few others too.

963
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's just California.

964
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you file for your state taxes every April in California, it says, did you order something online from out of state?

965
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:28,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Because please enter the amount here so that we can factor in sales tax.

966
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:29,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone goes next.

967
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:30,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no.

968
01:07:30,387 --> 01:07:33,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody has always been 100% honest and saved their receipts.

969
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:37,051
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a shoebox of receipts and Amazon invoices.

970
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:38,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but now it doesn't matter if you're in California.

971
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:39,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

972
01:07:39,193 --> 01:07:40,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me if I've ordered something.

973
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you don't know?

974
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:42,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I didn't.

975
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:42,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

976
01:07:42,555 --> 01:07:42,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

977
01:07:44,844 --> 01:07:45,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

978
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:57,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this that Bobby's linking me to?

979
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:01,929
[SPEAKER_04]: He's linking to an actual, it looks like a 3DS Cosmo Black.

980
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:03,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, here's the trick though.

981
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It says 17 left in stock sold by Emacs and fulfilled by Amazon.

982
01:08:08,253 --> 01:08:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically that's not Amazon.

983
01:08:09,474 --> 01:08:11,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of their little mini sub stores that's doing it.

984
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, you can get, okay, if you want to get me on a technicality, you can get the 3DS on Amazon, but it's not going to come from Amazon.

985
01:08:21,902 --> 01:08:23,703
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's going to come from a third party.

986
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:24,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

987
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:27,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting.

988
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:35,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I still am surprised that Amazon, you know, despite all that madness, would, you know, it's nothing that the other companies aren't having to put up with.

989
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:36,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take the returns then.

990
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it became a problem where, you know, customers were complaining that, you know, it's a defective system and they were just returning them in mass or something.

991
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

992
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:50,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would assume that would be the only reason why they wouldn't carry it.

993
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:50,990
Hmm.

994
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:56,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit something different than Nintendo for a while.

995
01:09:08,505 --> 01:09:10,447
[SPEAKER_04]: is huge gaming news, like it or not.

996
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:13,591
[SPEAKER_04]: They come out and say it's a huge gaming handheld.

997
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even more so than the iPhone 5.

998
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all need to not forget, because if you don't even want it for the phone or whatever, there is still the iPod Touch.

999
01:09:23,502 --> 01:09:45,485
[SPEAKER_04]: is that what they call the the ones that are the phones without the phone they announced that too that is basically an iPhone 5 and all those games and all that stuff so despite however you feel about Apple that is a huge you know the Angry Birds of the world is all going to be over there and stuff so that's pretty big gaming news I just wanted to get that out there because those were two big big big gaming stories this week

1000
01:09:46,718 --> 01:09:48,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, real racing's on it.

1001
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

1002
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:55,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the fact that it's a new resolution is a little bit strange, too.

1003
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they still talking iPad Mini?

1004
01:09:58,164 --> 01:10:00,005
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason for an iPad Mini.

1005
01:10:00,345 --> 01:10:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: An iPad Mini is an iPod Touch.

1006
01:10:03,926 --> 01:10:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we still have all these crazy rumors about the iPad Mini?

1007
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:06,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

1008
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,445
[SPEAKER_03]: because 7-inch tablets are popular.

1009
01:10:11,747 --> 01:10:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get the iPad.

1010
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't be disappointed.

1011
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:14,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty.

1012
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:18,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has Netflix.

1013
01:10:19,898 --> 01:10:21,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything fucking has Netflix, okay?

1014
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:23,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything.

1015
01:10:24,704 --> 01:10:25,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1016
01:10:27,213 --> 01:10:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, guitar.

1017
01:10:42,633 --> 01:10:47,896
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course, you know, they're saying, you know, today we respond to EA's claims which we believe have no merit.

1018
01:10:47,996 --> 01:10:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: We also filed a counterclaim which addresses actions by EA believed to be anti-competitive and unlawful business practices including legal threats, demands for no higher agreements.

1019
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:07,265
[SPEAKER_03]: We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts on delighting our players and then to which I add with our clone games.

1020
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but seriously, that's the whole thing.

1021
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:15,532
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like basically saying, oh yeah, no, we're not copying the SimSocial, no.

1022
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:16,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, they are.

1023
01:11:17,434 --> 01:11:19,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I mean, come on.

1024
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:26,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that probably listens to this show that's seen the evidence of them copying many other games, we know better.

1025
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who are they trying to fool?

1026
01:11:28,645 --> 01:11:29,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the court, but...

1027
01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is also one of those things where it's like a duh.

1028
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga's not going to take this long.

1029
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:35,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you caught us there.

1030
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:35,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did.

1031
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:36,669
[SPEAKER_04]: You're IDA.

1032
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were ripping off all your games.

1033
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:39,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1034
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:41,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the billion dollars you were asking for.

1035
01:11:41,952 --> 01:11:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not a surprise, right?

1036
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1037
01:11:45,194 --> 01:11:45,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

1038
01:11:45,694 --> 01:11:46,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1039
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:46,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

1040
01:11:48,866 --> 01:11:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I mean, of course, you know, they're... Breakman in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Zynga considers copying other people's games to be a completely legal process.

1041
01:11:59,878 --> 01:12:02,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to cut you off, but you sounded like you were trailing off with that thought there.

1042
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:06,425
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, they're basically saying, here's their whole reason.

1043
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:09,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay to do what we're doing, basically.

1044
01:12:12,071 --> 01:12:21,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain modes of expression are customary and necessary to express a genre, such as sitting on a couch, watching TV, taking a shower, and going to sleep in a bed.

1045
01:12:21,322 --> 01:12:27,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Such modes of expression are known as scenes affair, are not protectable.

1046
01:12:29,651 --> 01:12:52,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Allowing one company to own them would thwart competition, innovation, and creativity Employing scenes off air, functional elements is not a copyright infringement It is how a genre is expressed So what they're saying is, our game looks slightly different But just because a Sim or a Ville person sits down to take a crap Doesn't mean that it's the same thing

1047
01:12:58,234 --> 01:13:07,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Except, once again, they're not just copying the fact that this person can take a nap or this person cooks on a stove or something like that.

1048
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:18,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They're copying the character editor or the art style or the menus or the palette for your skin tones.

1049
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:20,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that kind of stuff.

1050
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1051
01:13:23,277 --> 01:13:24,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to other legal news.

1052
01:13:25,518 --> 01:13:26,919
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a tricky issue.

1053
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:29,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, this is, wow.

1054
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so who owns the word gamer?

1055
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:38,024
[SPEAKER_04]: G-A-Y-M-E-R, a word that describes a gay gamer.

1056
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:41,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a name that the community's taken up a little bit here.

1057
01:13:42,006 --> 01:13:48,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have heard of GamerCon was a big thing that we were talking about before on the show because I talked about that that's the only Kickstarter I've ever backed.

1058
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:55,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you may or may not have heard of a site, Gamer.org, G-A-Y-M-E-R.org.

1059
01:13:55,094 --> 01:14:03,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in 2007, the owner, Chris Vizzini, I hope I'm saying that right, announced that he was going to trademark the term gamer.

1060
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:08,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember reporting on this back then, because this show's been around a while.

1061
01:14:08,204 --> 01:14:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And I seem to remember reporting on this back then, saying, I'm not a big fan of this.

1062
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:15,890
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the fact that he's trying to trademark this word, and I don't think anybody did.

1063
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:18,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the part we missed...

1064
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:19,733
[SPEAKER_04]: He got the trademark.

1065
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:26,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The United States gave him the trademark on the word gamer for his website, gamer.org.

1066
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:35,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So the trademark applies to online communities hosting and maintaining an online website for others to discuss, receive, and disseminate information concerning video games.

1067
01:14:36,863 --> 01:14:40,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So he owns the trademark on that when it comes to online communities.

1068
01:14:41,146 --> 01:14:47,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this past week, a cease and desist letter from Chris Vizzini was sent to Reddit.

1069
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:47,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Reddit.

1070
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:51,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about a David vs. Goliath scenario.

1071
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:55,428
[SPEAKER_04]: The gamers community on Reddit is something like 17,000 some odd people.

1072
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:55,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer.org

1073
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really a big website.

1074
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:04,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good concept, but GayGamer.net kind of came around and did it better.

1075
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:10,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean any disrespect to Gamer.org because, you know, look at Orange Lounge Radio.

1076
01:15:10,752 --> 01:15:14,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, we've been around 10 years and we still haven't made it big, quote unquote.

1077
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:17,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I can kind of sympathize in that sort of regard.

1078
01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:21,056
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not so sure I would have picked my battle with Reddit either.

1079
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like... Redditors are crazy!

1080
01:15:27,299 --> 01:15:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We mean that in the nicest possible way.

1081
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:36,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, to quote a famous gif of Whoopi Goldberg, you in danger, girl.

1082
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So and Gamer.org ended up being shut down just like not even a day later with after this whole stuff.

1083
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:50,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the situation.

1084
01:15:50,936 --> 01:15:52,477
[SPEAKER_04]: He responded and so forth.

1085
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:53,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's his response.

1086
01:15:54,198 --> 01:16:03,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I informed the mod team of our gamers that we'd received a cease and desist for the infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed – I'm sorry.

1087
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:04,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this – I'm sorry.

1088
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:05,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I am reading –

1089
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:06,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Scratch that.

1090
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1091
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I am reading what the admin on Reddit said.

1092
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:10,830
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'm reading it here, it doesn't make sense.

1093
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1094
01:16:11,211 --> 01:16:11,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1095
01:16:12,552 --> 01:16:12,993
[SPEAKER_04]: How embarrassing.

1096
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:24,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I informed the mod team of our gamers that we received a cease and desist letter for infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed us that the letter presents a real threat that they would sue Reddit.

1097
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:32,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I let them know so that they could start planning how to respond, including seeing if there's any way for them to work things out with the owner of the trademark.

1098
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:36,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the response from gamer.org.

1099
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:44,970
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent the cease and desist because as a trademark holder, you have to defend your trademark or you will risk losing it.

1100
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:49,731
[SPEAKER_04]: He's emailed Reddit twice before and no response.

1101
01:16:51,471 --> 01:17:17,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I started Gamer.org in 2003 and began to build Gamer as a brand That's why I trademarked and wordmarked the name At that time there was only one other site around dedicated to gay gamers I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars on Gamer.org I have done so gladly as it's brought happiness to many people He is not pursuing GamerCon because his trademark is only about online communities

1102
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:27,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think though, GamerCon, if they're going to be as big as Fanime or PAX or any other big convention, will probably have an online forum at some point.

1103
01:17:27,618 --> 01:17:33,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would still be a little worried if I was on the planning board at GamerCon about the impact this could have.

1104
01:17:33,804 --> 01:17:33,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Now,

1105
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:57,761
[SPEAKER_04]: you might be curious about my thoughts as a gay gamer and my thoughts is I don't necessarily fault Chris in this circumstance because he does have to defend his trademark he should have never been given that trademark in the first place that's the problem why did they give him that?

1106
01:17:58,661 --> 01:18:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: he should have every right to gamer.org but the word gamer that's a really broad thing to have

1107
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:14,254
[SPEAKER_04]: and especially this far, I mean, there was a dude on the tester whose name was Gamer, his little online thing.

1108
01:18:14,855 --> 01:18:20,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That didn't ruffle any feathers, I guess, because again, Gamer doesn't have his own online community.

1109
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:30,268
[SPEAKER_04]: But as many of the folks on Reddit and all around the internet were quick to point out, that word Gamer has existed dating back to Yahoo groups and all this stuff before that.

1110
01:18:30,348 --> 01:18:32,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just kind of a little...

1111
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Play on word that makes a lot of sense.

1112
01:18:34,995 --> 01:18:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was he given the trademark in the first place?

1113
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:40,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the patent offices don't know better.

1114
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:41,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he filed first.

1115
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably no one thought about trademarking it, so he did.

1116
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:56,032
[SPEAKER_03]: What he could have done if he's just defending it because, oh, I need to and otherwise I will lose my trademark, whatever it is, he could license it to him for free.

1117
01:18:56,532 --> 01:19:06,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, you may use this as your forum thing or whatever, but I have the rights to, it is a trademark of blah, blah, blah.

1118
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:11,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be the nice thing to do, I guess.

1119
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:15,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma in chat says, Sky, a treaty alliance between both organizations.

1120
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:15,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish.

1121
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,440
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the nice thing to see here.

1122
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:23,521
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in a minority of a minority community, is this what we really need to have happening right now?

1123
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:24,401
[SPEAKER_04]: This sucks.

1124
01:19:25,141 --> 01:19:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, especially when things are kind of gaining steam with the convention and all this right now, this is a real shot in the foot.

1125
01:19:30,142 --> 01:19:32,083
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a terrible time for something like this to happen.

1126
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:41,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that Gamer.org feels the need to defend their trademark, and the thousands of dollars they've invested.

1127
01:19:42,329 --> 01:19:51,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, we've invested thousands of dollars in this program and the community we've built and all that stuff, but I just kind of think at a certain point, you have to let it go.

1128
01:19:52,296 --> 01:19:54,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And you kind of have to just admit...

1129
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:55,819
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1130
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,382
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Reddit.

1131
01:20:14,062 --> 01:20:24,370
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like he was updating it back in August and July and then kind of took off because to get his site back, he had to do a rollback of a month.

1132
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:28,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the stuff that was up there was disappeared because there was something up there on the OUYA.

1133
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:32,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I managed to see it before it went down and there was something on there about the OUYA and some of the other stuff.

1134
01:20:32,716 --> 01:20:34,317
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

1135
01:20:34,638 --> 01:20:35,438
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's the forums.

1136
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:38,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I mean no disrespect to that community because we have a small community and

1137
01:20:39,681 --> 01:21:08,992
[SPEAKER_04]: shit Loki named the Wii U release date in July and I bet you nobody knows that but I don't know but then of course you come around and say well if somebody tried to start a community called Orange Lounge Video would you have a problem with that and there's a part of me that's kind of like yes and no if you're just trying to piggyback on our success yes I'd have a problem with that but at the same time Orange Lounge Radio wasn't exactly our name 100% either and we've always admitted that

1138
01:21:09,792 --> 01:21:18,735
[SPEAKER_04]: We were inspired to name ourselves after something we were all fans of, the way a Beatles tribute band might call them Yellow Submarine or something like that.

1139
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:20,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very kind of akin to that.

1140
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:33,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But if Orange Lounge had this common meeting, like if Orange Lounge was suddenly the term that everybody called their video game room or something, I think there'd have to be a point where you just kind of let it go.

1141
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1142
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

1143
01:21:37,586 --> 01:21:39,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're on the outside looking in.

1144
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:44,336
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably have no reason to go to a gamer Reddit or gamer.org.

1145
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of all this kind of back and forth debacle?

1146
01:21:47,737 --> 01:21:51,360
[SPEAKER_03]: That's typical trademark copyright garbage.

1147
01:21:52,561 --> 01:21:53,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone trademarks.

1148
01:21:55,103 --> 01:22:04,470
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to totally make it non-sexually oriented at all, look at the guy that tried to trademark Mame a while back.

1149
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:13,317
[SPEAKER_04]: A great comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room about this is the USPTO, the same place that gave Langdell his trademark over Edge.

1150
01:22:13,877 --> 01:22:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

1151
01:22:15,785 --> 01:22:20,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's not just Edge, but then there is the... What is the other one?

1152
01:22:20,389 --> 01:22:22,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that hit against Elder Scrolls.

1153
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:23,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Scrolls?

1154
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:25,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the Mojang game.

1155
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Scrolls, right?

1156
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1157
01:22:26,954 --> 01:22:29,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there's that whole debacle too.

1158
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, holy hell do we need this stuff re-examined.

1159
01:22:33,259 --> 01:22:37,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're in this technological age where the laws from the 1700s and 1800s don't work anymore.

1160
01:22:41,812 --> 01:22:45,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I really feel like he should have never been given the trademark in the first place.

1161
01:22:46,374 --> 01:22:46,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1162
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:53,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can feel for the guy because it's like, oh, you were given this great thing and now the internet's trying to take it away.

1163
01:22:53,598 --> 01:22:55,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, you shouldn't have had that.

1164
01:22:55,759 --> 01:22:57,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have gotten gamer.org.

1165
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all yours, buddy.

1166
01:22:58,521 --> 01:22:59,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that.

1167
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:00,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

1168
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:05,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer probably to someone that's not familiar with anything on the internet, people that work at the patent office.

1169
01:23:07,205 --> 01:23:11,008
[SPEAKER_03]: and probably, you know, hey, that's a unique thing.

1170
01:23:11,048 --> 01:23:12,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll go ahead and give it to that guy.

1171
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:18,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they don't do any research, but that's the problem, though, is they'll just give it to whomever.

1172
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:29,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, it kind of sucks for everybody else, but I don't really know where, you know, something becomes so commonly used that they can't trademark it anymore or something.

1173
01:23:29,624 --> 01:23:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1174
01:23:30,164 --> 01:23:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know how that works.

1175
01:23:32,594 --> 01:23:44,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as somebody who's supporting GamerCon and would think that logically that's going to have a community at some point, and just like a gamer myself, I kind of think this guy needs to let it go.

1176
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:54,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand he wants to defend what he's invested his hard earned money in, but there's a way for everybody to win in this scenario.

1177
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: If he wanted more visibility for his site, why not work with Reddit?

1178
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:20,298
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a pretty powerful if you want to get yourself promoted you want to get the word around the internet reddit's a pretty fucking great place to go for that type of stuff you know there it seems like they could he could have got more for his site working with reddit than he's getting working against them and that goes for any large large large online community

1179
01:24:23,055 --> 01:24:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate seeing these factions fight.

1180
01:24:25,697 --> 01:24:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

1181
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:27,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1182
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:29,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I need some happier news or something.

1183
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you deliver, Alan?

1184
01:24:31,665 --> 01:24:34,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really happy news, but some sassy news.

1185
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll take sassy.

1186
01:24:35,568 --> 01:24:40,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably one of the most ludicrous stories that I've reported on whenever I've guest-hosted on this show.

1187
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:54,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Electronic arts usually, I won't say butted heads, but they've had snippy things to say about Valve and Steam in the past, where I guess that one EA guy was saying that...

1188
01:24:56,645 --> 01:25:26,288
[SPEAKER_02]: when Steam discounts games as much as it does and has those crazy 99 cent sales and stuff that it sort of devalues PC games and this that and the other even though indie developers have come out and said that putting their game on Steam versus Xbox Live was one of the best things they ever did blah blah blah the Origin client for which became a mandatory thing for Mass Effect 3 is fucking terrible and EA and Origin doesn't have the sales that Steam does and blah blah blah so EA is always trying to be up Valve's ass and

1189
01:25:26,448 --> 01:25:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess EA on two different occasions have tried to enter talks with Valve to purchase the company.

1190
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Going upwards of some of the preliminary talks they did offered up to a billion dollars if Valve was going to take the offer seriously.

1191
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:44,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how much they were willing to front to start the conversation.

1192
01:25:44,793 --> 01:25:50,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gabe Newell is like, no, that's not going to happen.

1193
01:25:51,274 --> 01:25:51,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote,

1194
01:25:54,295 --> 01:26:08,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Co-owner and company founder Gabe Newell, however, said that the likelihood of his fiercely independent company selling to an electronic arts or one of the other major multinational publishers like Activision or Ubisoft is about as likely as Nintendo selling off the Mario brand.

1195
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:13,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Newell said that Valve would sooner disintegrate than sell out to a major publisher.

1196
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say, let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to have our employment agreements terminate.

1197
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, EA, I guess, has tried to buy Valve.

1198
01:26:29,629 --> 01:26:30,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds ridiculous.

1199
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:31,650
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

1200
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:40,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't even know what Valve is doing with the fact that they're... The story that we covered last week where Valve's looking for industrial engineers for this maybe...

1201
01:26:41,716 --> 01:26:45,357
[SPEAKER_02]: PC box that's going to run Steam maybe on television sets.

1202
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:46,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people are speculating on.

1203
01:26:47,057 --> 01:26:52,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what Valve is up to, but obviously they're not in a position to be bought by anyone.

1204
01:26:53,899 --> 01:26:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have more money than God because Steam is like... Steam has how many?

1205
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:03,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Steam already commands a membership of 54 billion active users and growing.

1206
01:27:03,961 --> 01:27:06,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not in want for money.

1207
01:27:07,863 --> 01:27:08,704
[SPEAKER_02]: For EA to buy them.

1208
01:27:09,124 --> 01:27:12,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it's surprising that EA's tried to buy Valve.

1209
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:14,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's surprising.

1210
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:20,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives me warm fuzzies to know that Gabe Newell basically laughed in their face.

1211
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: That gives me warm fuzzies.

1212
01:27:23,581 --> 01:27:25,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially after that PopCap story from last week.

1213
01:27:25,962 --> 01:27:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, from a business standpoint, if you're a company as big as EA, hey, they make good shit.

1214
01:27:29,984 --> 01:27:31,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say, hey, hey, you guys for sale?

1215
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:32,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's legit.

1216
01:27:32,866 --> 01:27:34,626
[SPEAKER_02]: EA can ask that of whoever they want.

1217
01:27:34,687 --> 01:27:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: But Gabe Newell is like, no.

1218
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:39,189
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's funny.

1219
01:27:39,369 --> 01:27:41,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this comment from MM2K in our chat room.

1220
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:44,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God the people at Valve own Valve.

1221
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: EA buying it would be the coming of Satan.

1222
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:51,793
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a dramatic statement.

1223
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Would EA bring Half-Life 3 out faster?

1224
01:27:53,913 --> 01:27:54,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know.

1225
01:27:55,974 --> 01:27:57,214
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you didn't.

1226
01:27:57,474 --> 01:27:58,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you didn't.

1227
01:27:58,554 --> 01:28:00,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And Zynga buying it would be ultra Satan.

1228
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:06,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I want somebody to buy Valve and legitimize them.

1229
01:28:06,897 --> 01:28:07,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that possible?

1230
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:12,318
[SPEAKER_04]: EA should buy Zynga.

1231
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:14,479
[SPEAKER_04]: What better way to settle this whole thing?

1232
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:17,390
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be funny.

1233
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be hilarious.

1234
01:28:19,414 --> 01:28:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, that would happen.

1235
01:28:20,335 --> 01:28:24,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision buys Zynga and then rolls it in with Blizzard and the sky turns black.

1236
01:28:25,124 --> 01:28:28,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, can you imagine how terrible World of Warcraft would be?

1237
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:30,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

1238
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:34,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It already got worse when Activision bought them.

1239
01:28:34,063 --> 01:28:39,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, VOG, however, would not say F you to EA.

1240
01:28:39,545 --> 01:28:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: EA, bring your money trucks to my house, please.

1241
01:28:42,186 --> 01:28:43,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, Bobby.

1242
01:28:43,746 --> 01:28:45,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a gaming station.

1243
01:28:46,467 --> 01:28:49,568
[SPEAKER_04]: EA doesn't have interest in the... Gaming is one part of nerddom.

1244
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:51,409
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1245
01:28:51,429 --> 01:28:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: They can roll those money trucks up.

1246
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:55,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be able to sell my gaming part of it.

1247
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1248
01:28:56,371 --> 01:28:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all of us are sitting here going, yeah, we'd sell out.

1249
01:28:59,716 --> 01:28:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Money?

1250
01:29:00,076 --> 01:29:00,277

1263
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:57,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the collector's edition for Black Ops 2 looks pretty sweet.

1285
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Surface is the tablet.

1286
01:31:03,534 --> 01:31:07,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it's in Vegas for slot machines or in Digital Blackjack and that's it.

1287
01:31:07,855 --> 01:31:08,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

1288
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a great... I will say, when we went to PAX 08 or whatever, we had a great bonding time with Bobby sitting around one of those... Was somebody else with us too?

[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe for a little bit.

1290
01:31:18,161 --> 01:31:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say one of the gals from the Bay Area that's also podcasting was there with us.

1291
01:31:23,865 --> 01:31:26,127
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were having some bonding time around Microsoft Surface.

1292
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:26,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good times.

1293
01:31:27,628 --> 01:31:28,008

[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, hey!

1297
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:40,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new for Japan coming out of there.

1298
01:31:40,084 --> 01:31:41,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming this is some type of localized version.

1299
01:31:42,585 --> 01:31:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also Majiten, Majiditenshei Suksei Mita in limited and regular edition is coming out this week.

1300
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:55,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure exactly what this is, but based on some of the screenshots...

1301
01:31:56,853 --> 01:31:57,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah!

1302
01:31:58,414 --> 01:31:59,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's naked anime chicks!

1303
01:32:00,334 --> 01:32:01,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that boobie!

1304
01:32:01,935 --> 01:32:02,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me, not boobie.

1305
01:32:02,575 --> 01:32:03,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that booty!

1306
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:07,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, naked anime girls, but their faces look like they're 12.

1307
01:32:07,436 --> 01:32:09,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That is how the Xbox... Ew!

1308
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:11,918
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the Xbox 360's gonna sell in Japan.

1309
01:32:11,938 --> 01:32:13,338
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you sell a Wii U. That's...

1310
01:32:14,858 --> 01:32:16,299
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you steal a Wii U right there.

1311
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:23,966
[SPEAKER_02]: The little LCD controller is x-ray, so the TV, she's got her top on it, but then you lift the controller and it's... That's how you do it.

1312
01:32:24,266 --> 01:32:26,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly's watching American Idol on the TV.

1313
01:32:26,768 --> 01:32:28,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You're watching porn on the Wii U tablet.

1314
01:32:28,369 --> 01:32:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: They had, and I don't remember what the hell the game was called.

1315
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:32,993
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a game that came out in the UK.

1316
01:32:33,033 --> 01:32:35,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

1317
01:32:35,695 --> 01:32:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was like one of those not like a Leisure Suit Larry or like a Playboy the Mansion game but there was something like that where you're picking up women and you have to do weird things you know to get in their favor but one of the mini games had to do with manipulating their nipples and what were the nipples but the two analog sticks wow it was great awesome

1318
01:32:57,128 --> 01:33:00,391
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, PlayStation 3, big releases this week.

1320
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:08,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what game this translates to, but there's a regular and limited edition.

1321
01:33:08,878 --> 01:33:10,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like some type of online game.

1322
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:17,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a vibe similar to like a Final Fantasy XI-esque or a White Knight Chronicles almost even, this kind of looks like to me.

1323
01:33:17,546 --> 01:33:21,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Akatsuki no Gai Trinity Eureka 7 AO Jungfrau no Hanabana Tachi Video Game and Hybrid Anime Disc

1327
01:33:56,511 --> 01:33:57,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure what it is though.

1328
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw it the other day in their system.

1329
01:34:01,074 --> 01:34:01,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1330
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:04,056

[SPEAKER_04]: That's out in Japan this week.

1334

1341
01:35:07,803 --> 01:35:26,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom this is why I love having chatters live.vognetwork.com they set us straight when we're wrong Alpha Kanatagram says LittleBigPlanet Vita came out two days ago Sony said fuck it and released it early I'm playing it now the box version is not although now I have to charge my Vita

1342
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:54,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm all about LittleBigPlanet on the Vita, I'm excited about that I was just a target today, if I'd seen that I would have snatched it up It's not been released box, maybe digitally I think somebody broke street date, I think GameStop broke street date I seem to remember now, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine that said GameStop broke street date Oh, I'm not surprised, they do that shit all the time Oh, but if anyone else breaks street date, all hell's gonna break loose Ooh, somebody's bitter over there

1343
01:35:54,468 --> 01:36:00,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, seriously, they're the big proponents of not having street dates in the first place because they have a competitive advantage over everybody else.

1344
01:36:00,513 --> 01:36:03,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha Cananogram says, I have the box version.

1345
01:36:03,376 --> 01:36:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out.

1346
01:36:04,136 --> 01:36:13,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf says, it's only on sale at the Evil G. Black Wolf said, Sony told Evil G to break street dates.

1347
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:16,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

1348
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:17,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuckers!

1349
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:20,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not supposed to be out for a couple weeks, but okay.

1350
01:36:20,754 --> 01:36:21,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1351
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:24,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make for an interesting conversation.

1352
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting two weeks.

1353
01:36:25,397 --> 01:36:28,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to you-know-where just to get LittleBigPlanet.

1354
01:36:28,379 --> 01:36:30,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not that excited.

1355
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:36,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad, Sony, because a great way to get my attention would have been to do that before Mr. Pandaria's out.

1356
01:36:36,245 --> 01:36:41,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're going to try and get my attention after Mr. Pandaria's out, yeah, good luck.

1357
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Who am I kidding?

1358
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:44,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll still get LittleBigPlanet.

1359
01:36:44,738 --> 01:36:47,300
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1360
01:37:14,857 --> 01:37:21,964
[SPEAKER_03]: of military installations on the island of Lemnos, Greece.

1361
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course they were caught and they had the footage and stuff and apparently it's illegal, I'm surprised, legal to take video and photographs of military installations.

1362
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:38,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1363
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not good.

1364
01:37:43,102 --> 01:37:48,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, you know, Bohemia Interactive, you know, they've confirmed it, yes.

1365
01:37:48,326 --> 01:37:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they were arrested during their holiday trip, and it says they visited the island with the sole purpose of experiencing the island's beautiful surroundings.

1366
01:37:57,814 --> 01:37:57,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1367
01:38:01,781 --> 01:38:02,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

1368
01:38:03,302 --> 01:38:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of sucks.

1369
01:38:04,242 --> 01:38:08,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, it's against the law to take pictures of that stuff, so maybe you shouldn't.

1370
01:38:09,684 --> 01:38:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1371
01:38:11,104 --> 01:38:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know, the Greek military would not like you putting their military installation in your game.

1372
01:38:20,668 --> 01:38:21,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

1373
01:38:21,348 --> 01:38:22,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Might not be a good thing.

1374
01:38:22,248 --> 01:38:22,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Might not be a good thing.

1375
01:38:22,969 --> 01:38:23,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Might not be good.

1376
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's crazy.

1377
01:38:27,111 --> 01:38:27,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1378
01:38:28,292 --> 01:38:30,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I tell a true story that's completely random once?

1379
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:35,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Canada in 2006 with my good friend John at the time.

1380
01:38:36,162 --> 01:38:40,768
[SPEAKER_04]: He was my roommate when we had the studio in the garage, so I can't remember if he ever popped on OLR or not.

1381
01:38:40,788 --> 01:38:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: He played Final Fantasy, and that's about it.

1382
01:38:45,693 --> 01:38:48,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to Canada together and he's a big picture taker.

1383
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:49,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Takes pictures of everything.

1384
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll take pictures of food at the dinner table, take pictures of signs, whatever.

1385
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll take pictures of everything.

1386
01:38:54,737 --> 01:39:02,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in the little line waiting at the airport because the plane lands, you have to go through customs first before you get to technically enter the country, right?

1387
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:03,921
[SPEAKER_04]: He's taking pictures in customs.

1388
01:39:04,841 --> 01:39:07,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, okay, he's being a dumb tourist, whatever.

1389
01:39:07,764 --> 01:39:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get up to the front and the lady behind the thing is all, it's this one.

1390
01:39:11,908 --> 01:39:15,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And the security guard comes up and is like, what kind of pictures are you taking?

1391
01:39:15,772 --> 01:39:17,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like scared shitless.

1392
01:39:17,614 --> 01:39:20,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like showing the guy on the camera the pictures he's taken.

1393
01:39:20,837 --> 01:39:23,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the lady behind the counter is like, why are you shaking?

1394
01:39:23,059 --> 01:39:23,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you nervous?

1395
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:26,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, fucking Canada's hardcore.

1396
01:39:26,282 --> 01:39:26,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1397
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, this was only five years after a major event that changed the way we travel in many ways.

1398
01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was just like, honestly, he didn't know better.

1399
01:39:38,171 --> 01:39:40,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they don't fuck around with picture taking and stuff like that.

1400
01:39:40,852 --> 01:39:46,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though he was just taking pictures of the Canadian and the US flags together and the signs.

1401
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:49,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing you or I would think is bad, but they don't know that.

1402
01:39:49,878 --> 01:39:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently there's some top secret shit in there.

1403
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want people knowing how the system works or whatever.

1404
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:56,623
[SPEAKER_03]: The true origin of maple syrup.

1405
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:59,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It's people!

1406
01:40:00,098 --> 01:40:01,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's people!

1407
01:40:03,838 --> 01:40:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to a much simpler time.

1408
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:14,161
[SPEAKER_04]: When all you needed to get to Canada was a birth certificate, not a passport.

1409
01:40:14,961 --> 01:40:18,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a segment we call the classic game of the week.

1410
01:40:19,402 --> 01:40:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week, DarkSakura likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey, you kids ought to be playing this game this week.

1411
01:40:26,965 --> 01:40:27,945
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's not here.

1412
01:40:27,965 --> 01:40:28,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1413
01:40:29,886 --> 01:40:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get to tap into my brain instead tonight.

1414
01:40:33,409 --> 01:40:35,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes Alan will do this, sometimes Loki will do this.

1415
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:36,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight I'm doing it.

1416
01:40:36,704 --> 01:40:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So, tonight's classic game of the week is a real old, old game.

1417
01:40:41,706 --> 01:40:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's classic game of the week is Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.

1418
01:40:48,448 --> 01:40:49,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1419
01:40:51,069 --> 01:40:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns was on a lot of systems back in the 80s.

1420
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It dates all the way back to the Atari 2600, actually.

1421
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the original releases on the Atari 2600 from 1984.

1422
01:41:00,132 --> 01:41:03,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this game fondly from the Commodore 64 games.

1423
01:41:05,955 --> 01:41:07,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on a lot of different systems.

1424
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:11,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The 5200, the ColecoVision, the MSX, the ZX Spectrum, the PC Booter.

1425
01:41:11,827 --> 01:41:12,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple II.

1426
01:41:12,308 --> 01:41:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on a lot of different systems.

1427
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:22,975
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I picked Pitfall 2 over Pitfall 1 is that personally I have a lot more fond memories playing this one.

1428
01:41:23,776 --> 01:41:29,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this really lends itself to a lot of the games that we have today.

1429
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:37,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall 2 was about exploring the cavern, whereas Pitfall 1 was really just kind of like a very linear... Remember Pitfall 1 was just kind of like you didn't...

1430
01:41:38,408 --> 01:41:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go down in the cave and skip screens, but it was very linear.

1431
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:50,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall 2 really fleshed out that feeling of like, I can go down here and then I can backtrack and go back here and get the item I got here to go get the rat over here.

1432
01:41:51,411 --> 01:41:59,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of the first games on the Atari 2600 to have background music, a similar piece to the one you're hearing right now from the Commodore 64 version.

1433
01:42:03,888 --> 01:42:08,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall 2 was similar to Pitfall 1, but obviously Lost Caverns had a lot of different features.

1434
01:42:09,052 --> 01:42:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Pitfall Harry had unlimited time and lives.

1435
01:42:11,574 --> 01:42:13,996
[SPEAKER_04]: The original game was limited to, I think, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

1436
01:42:14,476 --> 01:42:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could never lose the game.

1437
01:42:16,698 --> 01:42:17,959
[SPEAKER_04]: You never could actually die.

1438
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:22,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you would get hit, you will just flash back and the sad little music plays.

1439
01:42:23,163 --> 01:42:24,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Pitfall 2 has 27 Horizontal Levels

1440
01:42:41,402 --> 01:42:46,307
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all about the same height, but sometimes there's balloons that will let you go up to new areas.

1441
01:42:47,348 --> 01:42:57,197
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no snakes or crocodiles like there were in Pitfall 1, but there are scorpions, there are bats, there's condors, electric eels in the water and frogs.

1442
01:42:58,638 --> 01:43:05,341
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also not just Pitfall Harry, but there was his little friends, the Mountain Lion, which was Quick Claw, and there was Ronda.

1443
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:06,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the object of the game.

1444
01:43:06,482 --> 01:43:12,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You were trying to save Ronda, Quick Claw, and I believe find a diamond ring was like all that stuff.

1445
01:43:13,044 --> 01:43:18,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All those characters ended up appearing on the Saturday Supercade children's cartoon that's based on Pitfall.

1446
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:24,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Ronda and Quick Claw were actually created for that before this game was released about a year sooner.

1447
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The maximum possible score in the game, 199,000 points.

1448
01:43:29,771 --> 01:43:33,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That is different from the Atari 8-bit and 52 version that I'll get into in a minute.

1449
01:43:34,913 --> 01:43:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually see Quick Claw, one of the goals of the game, you see him right under you when you start the game.

1450
01:43:41,355 --> 01:43:50,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool that like, that's probably the last thing you'll collect as you're doing the game, is that you kind of end up where you started.

1451
01:43:50,737 --> 01:43:55,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a neat little, you know, especially for game design back in the day, it was kind of neat that you ended up where you started there.

1452
01:43:57,579 --> 01:44:11,408
[SPEAKER_04]: of course the soundtrack as well that would change keys and stuff depending on how well you're doing what you're hearing in the background right now is kind of like the heroic theme whenever you collect a treasure you'll hear a ding and it starts over if you die there's a slower theme that plays

1453
01:44:12,208 --> 01:44:13,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a huge game on the Atari 2600.

1454
01:44:13,929 --> 01:44:16,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really pushing the envelope.

1455
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:24,455
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardware was six years old when this game came out, but Pitfall 2 brought scrolling, detailed animation, and of course the musical score.

1456
01:44:25,355 --> 01:44:35,801
[SPEAKER_04]: David Crane actually designed and patented a display processor chip which would enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and could process the music in three channels plus drums.

1457
01:44:36,661 --> 01:44:44,268
[SPEAKER_04]: They were hoping that this would push the limits of the Atari 2600, but considering this came out in 84, what else happened around that same time?

1458
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:45,769
[SPEAKER_04]: The video game crash.

1459
01:44:45,969 --> 01:44:48,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So this kind of came out when the party was already over.

1460
01:44:49,312 --> 01:44:51,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's another version of the game that's really cool.

1461
01:44:51,954 --> 01:44:53,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Adventurers Edition.

1462
01:44:53,675 --> 01:44:57,418
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only available on the 5200 and the Atari 8-bit versions.

1463
01:44:59,841 --> 01:44:59,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1464
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:30,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they came out and said, they being the marketing, they said, no, the two versions are not allowed to be different.

1465
01:45:30,952 --> 01:45:38,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you may think things are bad now where you have the same game on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.

1466
01:45:38,055 --> 01:45:44,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But back in the day, dude, it was Apple, Commodore, Coleco, Atari, Intellivision.

1467
01:45:44,877 --> 01:45:49,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can go find ads from old gaming magazines that would show you screenshots from ten different versions of the game.

1468
01:45:49,959 --> 01:45:50,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there were...

1469
01:45:51,259 --> 01:45:54,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually anywhere between six to eight valid platforms.

1470
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:56,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Really small niche ones during that time.

1471
01:45:56,682 --> 01:45:57,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Early 80s.

1472
01:45:57,583 --> 01:45:58,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1473
01:45:58,183 --> 01:46:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So marketing said, no, you can't have different sections of the game.

1474
01:46:02,146 --> 01:46:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened?

1475
01:46:03,947 --> 01:46:06,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Brad Freger, who is the producer...

1476
01:46:06,508 --> 01:46:08,509
[SPEAKER_04]: They left it in and made it an Easter egg.

1477
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just kind of hid it away in the game, but you can get it.

1478
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:15,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new level will have way more challenging stuff.

1479
01:46:15,832 --> 01:46:19,413
[SPEAKER_04]: There's new creatures, rabbit bats that fly more erratically.

1480
01:46:19,493 --> 01:46:21,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They also will reverse direction.

1481
01:46:22,274 --> 01:46:24,915
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also frogs that go all the way across the screen.

1482
01:46:25,355 --> 01:46:27,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire ants and piranha fish.

1483
01:46:27,836 --> 01:46:29,217
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fast creatures as well.

1484
01:46:30,518 --> 01:46:31,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all this stuff was new.

1485
01:46:31,799 --> 01:46:34,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to collect different items as well.

1486
01:46:35,161 --> 01:46:38,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You would get a rope, a pot, a trumpet, and a snake charmer.

1487
01:46:39,103 --> 01:46:44,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is that you get all the way to the last guy and it would scroll across the bottom of the screen.

1488
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Charming the golden rope is Pitfall Harry's only hope.

1489
01:46:47,609 --> 01:46:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So it brings the game full circle because if you have the rope, the pot, the trumpet, the snake charmer...

1490
01:46:52,512 --> 01:46:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1491
01:47:13,331 --> 01:47:16,092
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also, and I'll leave it at this, there was an arcade version.

1492
01:47:16,252 --> 01:47:18,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega made an arcade version in 1985.

1493
01:47:18,413 --> 01:47:20,454
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very different.

1494
01:47:20,854 --> 01:47:22,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked very cartoonish.

1495
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:23,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked very Alex Kidd to me.

1496
01:47:24,356 --> 01:47:25,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had definitely some elements.

1497
01:47:25,956 --> 01:47:27,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It had some of the similar music.

1498
01:47:27,237 --> 01:47:31,239
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, do we have... I think I should have here ready... Yes.

1499
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:32,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the Sega version.

1500
01:47:32,859 --> 01:47:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can hear it's a little bit similar here.

1501
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:36,461
[SPEAKER_04]: If we actually fast forward...

1502
01:47:41,892 --> 01:47:44,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like similar, but the game design is very different.

1503
01:47:44,653 --> 01:47:46,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's split up into four stages.

1504
01:47:46,734 --> 01:47:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a timer because it was an arcade game.

1505
01:47:50,396 --> 01:47:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there is kind of a definitive beginning and end that doesn't have to do with collecting the same things you did.

1506
01:47:55,878 --> 01:48:00,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of like they took the name and the idea and made this completely different type of game out of it.

1507
01:48:00,401 --> 01:48:01,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's worth checking out.

1508
01:48:01,361 --> 01:48:05,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, of course, the Sega version of Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns that was out in the arcade.

1509
01:48:06,143 --> 01:48:07,464
[SPEAKER_04]: One other port...

1510
01:48:08,264 --> 01:48:09,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Pitfall on the NES

1511
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: The week it was released because I was such a fan of Pitfall 2 Super Pitfall is absolute fucking garbage It is one of the worst games they ever released on the NES It is buggy as shit There's flickering Go look at some of the long plays that are on YouTube People walking through walls and shit Like Waters...

1512
01:48:49,876 --> 01:49:17,745
[SPEAKER_04]: water caverns that just suddenly end and you can fall down a waterfall to like a whole new level things like that like it just doesn't fucking make sense like it's one of the seriously it is like somebody pooed in a cartridge and put it out it is one of the worst NES games they ever made and when you're that young or at least in my experience it takes because we're not obviously we weren't as discriminating back then to realize oh no I was I played it and I was like this is fucking garbage

1513
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:20,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Even as a 10-year-old, I was like, what the shit?

1514
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:21,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It took like a day or two, though, right?

1515
01:49:21,832 --> 01:49:22,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no?

1516
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:22,574
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1517
01:49:23,155 --> 01:49:26,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, even the first time I played it, I was like, that doesn't even look like Pitfall Harry.

1518
01:49:26,462 --> 01:49:29,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this blue munchkin with the mustache?

1519
01:49:30,516 --> 01:49:32,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this guy in the hard hat.

1520
01:49:33,478 --> 01:49:34,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

1521
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:35,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

1522
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:38,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman in chat backing me up.

1523
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky is a million percent correct.

1524
01:49:39,601 --> 01:49:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Pitfall is one of the worst games ever made.

1525
01:49:42,202 --> 01:49:43,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It is such garbage.

1526
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love for some month on the show to have Jamie change this segment and do the unclassic game of the week.

1527
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:54,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you, Super Pitfall is one of the worst games that ought to be featured.

1528
01:49:55,629 --> 01:49:57,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's not focus on the bad.

1529
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:58,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to the good.

1530
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to play an Atari 2600 game at some point in your life, because maybe you weren't born yet when the Atari 2600 was kind of a big deal, go play Pitfall 2.

1531
01:50:08,298 --> 01:50:11,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great game that really pushed the envelope for the technology of the Atari 2600.

1532
01:50:13,672 --> 01:50:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1533
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:17,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on and take a break.

1534
01:50:17,855 --> 01:50:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more show to come, which is great because Part A was two hours.

1535
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:32,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to come back with some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, as well as more news stories, including a really interesting Microsoft patent we've got to talk about when we come back.

1536
01:50:32,847 --> 01:50:38,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Your emails, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics, and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1537
01:50:45,294 --> 01:50:52,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 473rd episode for this September the 16th of 2012.

1538
01:50:53,436 --> 01:51:00,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a long show so far, but lots of talk this week about the news on Wii U and all that good stuff in Part A, and then there was other stuff, too.

1539
01:51:01,258 --> 01:51:05,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think Loki has gotten to officially talk about Earth Defense Sports, the new one, yet.

1540
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that even on the show roll?

1541
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:07,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, probably not.

1542
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:08,460
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that happen?

1543
01:51:10,162 --> 01:51:11,143
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1544
01:51:37,137 --> 01:51:44,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast listeners, you won't notice a thing different except the fact that the show was taped a little bit early, so the news might be just a couple days behind.

1545
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:49,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But you should still have the same great show, and DarkSakura will be back for that taping on Thursday.

1546
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:51,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1547
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I cover everything?

1548
01:51:52,821 --> 01:51:53,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1549
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:56,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're getting ready to get back to it with some rapid-fire news.

1550
01:51:57,282 --> 01:51:58,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki.

1551
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we talk about Kickstarter pretty regularly, and there's a new Kickstarter from a developer that you might recognize, Obsidian, famous for Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout New Vegas, the new South Park game that's going to be coming out.

1552
01:52:20,785 --> 01:52:25,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're kickstarting a new project called Project Eternity for PC.

1553
01:52:25,408 --> 01:52:37,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new MMO, kind of like a fantasy world game, and their goal was to raise $1.1 million, and they pretty much have already hit their goal.

1554
01:52:38,798 --> 01:52:44,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they already have hit their goal, and they're going beyond that now to the stretch goals, but...

1555
01:52:45,923 --> 01:52:51,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to back them up, check out what they have to offer as far as what the game's going to be about.

1556
01:52:53,325 --> 01:52:53,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1557
01:52:55,166 --> 01:53:01,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I remember reading a tweet that Notch had kicked them, I think, 10 grand or something.

1558
01:53:01,687 --> 01:53:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

1559
01:53:03,428 --> 01:53:04,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1560
01:53:04,868 --> 01:53:11,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, if you're into some time waster stuff, there's a cool Flash game that was created by...

1561
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: IndieGames.com 2012-09 Freeware Game Pick Pac-Man Portal

1562
01:53:37,052 --> 01:53:42,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you can just search for Pac-Man Portal in Google and find it just as well.

1563
01:53:43,196 --> 01:53:43,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

1564
01:53:43,896 --> 01:53:46,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You can teleport around the map.

1565
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:51,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last but not least, a brand new update is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 very soon.

1566
01:53:53,761 --> 01:53:58,144
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.25, and that's going to be the update, of course, that's going to give the increased storage space for PlayStation Plus.

1567
01:53:58,524 --> 01:53:58,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1568
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:12,280
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1569
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:39,021
[SPEAKER_04]: If all you want is kind of the bare bones little portable Neo Geo X thing that I believe, if I remember right, you can hook it up to a television through the system as well.

1570
01:54:39,041 --> 01:54:39,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1571
01:54:39,442 --> 01:54:44,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like some of those bootleg Nintendos that are coming more and more prevalent you see now.

1572
01:54:44,446 --> 01:54:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that one you got me called?

1573
01:54:45,647 --> 01:54:47,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name of that thing now.

1574
01:54:47,608 --> 01:54:47,788
[SPEAKER_04]: The...

1575
01:54:48,909 --> 01:54:50,230
[SPEAKER_04]: FC Mobile, is that it?

1576
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:50,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that?

1577
01:54:51,531 --> 01:54:55,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, if you just want the little handheld device itself, it will be $130.

1578
01:54:55,715 --> 01:55:01,659
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a Neo Geo that comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo games.

1579
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:09,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could spend that money on a Neo Geo X, so 20 games, or almost have enough money for a Wii U tablet in Japan.

1580
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can buy a Dingu and it plays the same stuff.

1581
01:55:12,288 --> 01:55:12,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1582
01:55:13,849 --> 01:55:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dingu Ate My Baby Double Dragon Neon If you are listening live to Orange Lounge Radio you heard a song or two from the soundtrack during the break If you are on the podcast sadly I can't replay the songs due to rights issues during the break but good news you can get the soundtrack for free

1583
01:55:32,312 --> 01:55:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out.

1584
01:55:33,112 --> 01:55:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It is available for free on the site Bandcamp.

1585
01:55:36,973 --> 01:55:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: vert.bandcamp.com slash album slash double dash dragon dash neon.

1586
01:55:41,854 --> 01:55:43,454
[SPEAKER_04]: That link is floating around the internet.

1587
01:55:44,074 --> 01:55:44,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

1588
01:55:45,454 --> 01:55:48,195
[SPEAKER_04]: You can contribute however much you want.

1589
01:55:48,535 --> 01:55:57,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put a big fat zero in that box if you want, but if you have the money to chip in or you find you do enjoy the soundtrack, maybe go back and give a

1590
01:55:59,617 --> 01:56:01,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's basically making the soundtrack free.

1591
01:56:02,279 --> 01:56:04,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just remakes of the old songs.

1592
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also inspired music from the 80s.

1593
01:56:09,903 --> 01:56:14,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There was definitely a song in that first stage that sounded like it was Heart or some shit playing in the background.

1594
01:56:14,506 --> 01:56:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

1595
01:56:15,867 --> 01:56:16,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1596
01:56:17,548 --> 01:56:18,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So good job.

1597
01:56:18,668 --> 01:56:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That is Jake Kaufman who goes by Vert, which is why it's on vert.bandcamp.com.

1598
01:56:25,272 --> 01:56:28,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely wanted to tip the hat to this at some point tonight.

1599
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:30,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great cause.

1600
01:56:30,657 --> 01:56:33,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have a variety of different people that listen to OLR.

1601
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:39,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know for a fact that there's some people out there who are facing some disability in their gaming.

1602
01:56:39,345 --> 01:56:43,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps it's that they are blind, can't see at all.

1603
01:56:43,688 --> 01:56:50,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I've heard of some folks that are unable to use all of their limbs or some of the other things that people take for granted sometimes.

1604
01:56:51,315 --> 01:57:02,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Able Gamers Foundation created a 48-page document that they want to have be a how-to guide for developers and publishers on how to create more accessible games.

1605
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,981
[SPEAKER_04]: In a quote from founder Mark Barlett, quote, And I love this.

1606
01:57:20,126 --> 01:57:30,569
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually put like a little screenshot of Bejeweled 3 and they say, this is what Bejeweled 3 looks like to, you know, the most gamers, gamers that don't face a visual disability.

1607
01:57:31,089 --> 01:57:35,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they show, this is what it looks like to somebody who can only see in black and white.

1608
01:57:35,731 --> 01:57:41,672
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it looks like to somebody who has red colorblind or blue colorblind or whatever it is, green colorblind.

1609
01:57:42,132 --> 01:57:47,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows kind of the different ways the screens look and I think that's a great way to get somebody to, you know, think about their game.

1610
01:57:47,954 --> 01:58:00,754
[SPEAKER_04]: and I love this in the PDF document they actually show like a list they actually show like a checklist of you know keep this checklist handy this is what your game should have and it's things like remappable buttons

1611
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even really face a disability.

1612
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:11,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very thankful and fortunate and lucky that I don't have these same challenges that other people do in their lives.

1613
01:58:11,605 --> 01:58:14,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But even I can appreciate a game with remappable buttons.

1614
01:58:14,947 --> 01:58:19,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, damn, sometimes you look at the default controls and you're like, why is the game this way?

1615
01:58:19,869 --> 01:58:23,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Or sometimes you have a joystick that, you know, a controller or whatever that...

1616
01:58:24,452 --> 01:58:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: A button wears out on it.

1617
01:58:27,554 --> 01:58:33,596
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, these Microsoft controllers, the wired ones, the L3 button breaks a lot.

1618
01:58:34,437 --> 01:58:35,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be cool to remap that.

1619
01:58:35,757 --> 01:58:41,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And AbleGamers believes every game should have remappable buttons, which just makes sense.

1620
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's other things.

1621
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, think about the Vita.

1622
01:58:44,481 --> 01:58:51,645
[SPEAKER_04]: When the Vita first came out, if you're blind, you can't use a touchscreen the same way somebody that can see can.

1623
01:58:52,525 --> 01:59:20,554
[SPEAKER_04]: so why on earth would you not make it so that or why on earth would you make it so you can't use the controller to choose well thankfully the Vita patched that in in their last patch but it was because of response like this undoubtedly so anyway I know I spent a little time on that but I thought that was a great great document that they put out that I do think every game developer company out there ought to have a little printed copy of it somewhere for reference I think it would be a good thing Alan are you gonna go with your rapid-fire stories

1624
01:59:22,361 --> 01:59:25,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, just get the thing when it beeps.

1625
01:59:25,685 --> 01:59:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Terraria, a game that sold 1.6 million on PC, most of that probably through Steam, is coming to XBLA and PlayStation Network in early 2013.

1626
01:59:38,760 --> 02:00:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have Terraria I've only really tinkered with it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes but I know that it's I don't want to say that it's a 2D Minecraft but it's it's an adventure game with a lot of building and exploration you dig into tunnels and you find monsters and it's just a really huge indie hit from the last I think two years you have Terraria right didn't you didn't you have a bunch of people trying I do I bought it for like three other people too yeah I doubt and I bet none of them are playing it

1627
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:14,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Terraria, if you're a Terraria fan, the graphics are very cutesy, Super NES, 16-bit, pixely, cute look.

1628
02:00:14,953 --> 02:00:19,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says the Terraria hardcore are pissed about this news.

1629
02:00:20,695 --> 02:00:20,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1630
02:00:20,895 --> 02:00:23,236
[SPEAKER_04]: This is right up there with the Bayonetta 2 being on the Wii U.

1631
02:00:24,739 --> 02:00:30,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's Cool Kids Club is having its pretension barriers lifted.

1632
02:00:30,581 --> 02:00:35,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a saying, and it's deal with it, and then shades will fall from the sky and fall right on your nose.

1633
02:00:35,843 --> 02:00:39,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry that I'm not a part of the cult of Traria, but it's, you know.

1634
02:00:39,344 --> 02:00:40,265
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it you said earlier?

1635
02:00:40,345 --> 02:00:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Go pee your bed.

1636
02:00:41,305 --> 02:00:42,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go pee your bed.

1637
02:00:44,726 --> 02:00:45,687
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I have?

1638
02:00:48,295 --> 02:00:51,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Shifty Look, I'm not sure who that is.

1639
02:00:51,877 --> 02:00:54,319
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Katamari webcomic coming out by them.

1640
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:57,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And the art direction looks great.

1641
02:00:57,661 --> 02:01:00,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very weird and silly like Katamari does.

1642
02:01:01,183 --> 02:01:04,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And September... Oh, this is already out.

1643
02:01:05,245 --> 02:01:06,266
[SPEAKER_02]: No, tomorrow, actually.

1644
02:01:07,387 --> 02:01:10,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Katamari webcomic will debut on ShiftyLook.com on September 17, 2012.

1645
02:01:11,929 --> 02:01:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's tomorrow.

1646
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:16,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free-to-read series based on the popular junk-rolling package flashing...

1647
02:01:18,013 --> 02:01:19,954
[SPEAKER_02]: and Namco Bandai Gaming Franchise.

1648
02:01:20,514 --> 02:01:21,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be updated twice a week.

1649
02:01:22,815 --> 02:01:29,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, if you're into Katamari, there's going to be an official... Looks like this is a... Namco doesn't have a problem with it.

1650
02:01:29,878 --> 02:01:31,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Webcomic for you to read and enjoy.

1651
02:01:31,959 --> 02:01:36,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a... I can paste the link in the chat and you can see what the art is going to look like.

1652
02:01:38,602 --> 02:01:45,625
[SPEAKER_02]: My last quickfire news story is people are wondering, especially with Capcom, I guess the story we covered last week about...

1653
02:01:46,885 --> 02:01:47,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.

1654
02:01:47,145 --> 02:01:47,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.

1655
02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:27,948
[SPEAKER_02]: watch so yeah the 25th anniversary is looming and people are like saying Capcom's gonna do something but Capcom used to be that cool they're not that cool anymore if they were gonna release it they were gonna they would have announced it by now

1656
02:02:28,263 --> 02:02:29,304
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1657
02:02:47,154 --> 02:02:52,158
[SPEAKER_04]: The devs stopped supporting the PC version, said they weren't making any more updates.

1658
02:02:52,558 --> 02:02:55,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they announced a console version with new features.

1659
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:55,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That stank.

1660
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that is a little stank.

1661
02:02:57,622 --> 02:03:01,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's them pooping the bed, not you peeing it.

1662
02:03:03,307 --> 02:03:04,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Who pooped the bed?

1663
02:03:04,808 --> 02:03:05,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Who pooped the bed?

1664
02:03:05,688 --> 02:03:07,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Terraria developers did.

1665
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1666
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:12,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with the foogle question of the week.

1667
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:25,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we ask you guys a question on our fan communities on Facebook as well as Google+.

1668
02:03:25,879 --> 02:03:31,905
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to find us on Google+, well, there's no short links on Google+, so just search for Orange Lounge Radio.

1669
02:03:31,925 --> 02:03:32,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come right up.

1670
02:03:32,886 --> 02:03:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to find us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1671
02:03:41,209 --> 02:03:45,333
[SPEAKER_04]: This week's Google Question of the Week, it's all about the Wii U, because we haven't talked enough about it during the show.

1672
02:03:45,453 --> 02:03:49,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the Nintendo Wii U conference this week change your mind on if you wanted a Wii U or not?

1673
02:03:50,018 --> 02:03:54,622
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, are you planning on buying a Wii U between November 18th and the end of the year?

1674
02:03:55,723 --> 02:04:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Entertainment says on Google+, I want to buy a Wii U, but it probably won't happen until after the end of the year.

1675
02:04:01,308 --> 02:04:02,269
[SPEAKER_04]: He has other priorities.

1676
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:12,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, Well, I'm still not sold completely on the system, so I'll wait at least a year to get one and see what games will be released and see if the system is definitely worth a purchase or not.

1677
02:04:13,037 --> 02:04:15,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm currently doing with the 3DS.

1678
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Flacco Jones replied on Google+, and says, It convinced me that they're going to have more games on the system than just the Nintendo staples.

1679
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:50,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see myself buying one a year from now if they start getting the multi-platform games at the same time and if the price goes down or built-in memory goes way up they also need to bundle in a remote plus there are just too many hidden costs for me to afford when it launched that was an interesting response because he said it convinced me that they're gonna have this new stuff but I'll consider it a year from now which to be fair there's a lot of people that are in that boat I don't exactly blame him with that one

1680
02:04:51,445 --> 02:04:53,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.

1681
02:04:53,728 --> 02:04:55,590
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a lot of answers on Facebook.

1682
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:57,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be able to get through all these.

1683
02:04:57,752 --> 02:04:59,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize in advance.

1684
02:04:59,274 --> 02:05:03,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see all the answers, go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1685
02:05:03,178 --> 02:05:06,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to have to shorten a lot of these too to even get through some of them.

1686
02:05:07,843 --> 02:05:09,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hear me wrong, though.

1687
02:05:09,224 --> 02:05:11,145
[SPEAKER_04]: We love the fact that so many people are responding.

1688
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:17,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Lama Juice says, I went to a Nintendo event about a week ago where they let a small group of people in and played the Wii U stuff.

1689
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we had somebody call in on that a little while ago.

1690
02:05:20,171 --> 02:05:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: After an hour and a half with the system, I came to the conclusion it's not a system I want, but a system I'd want to play at a friend's house.

1691
02:05:27,934 --> 02:05:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Myth from our Monday, Wednesday, Friday show at Voicy Geeks Network replied and said, The Wii was fun for a couple weeks until it became apparent that the controls were too much trouble compared to the PS3 or 360.

1692
02:05:38,758 --> 02:05:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U takes that to the next level and doesn't have compelling excuses.

1693
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna pass.

1694
02:05:45,765 --> 02:05:53,150
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkCharger says as an owner of all current consoles and handhelds I will eventually pick up a Wii U but I see no reason to pick one up at launch.

1695
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Few games in the launch window interest me and history tells us that some of those will invariably get delayed.

1696
02:06:00,134 --> 02:06:03,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no doubt there will be an exclusive that will compel a purchase sometime next year.

1697
02:06:04,357 --> 02:06:05,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably Bayonetta 2.

1698
02:06:07,254 --> 02:06:10,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin S replied and said, I'd rather purchase an Ouya.

1699
02:06:10,277 --> 02:06:11,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo ruined it for me.

1700
02:06:11,658 --> 02:06:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: $100 is feasible.

1701
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:15,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of wish the answer was longer there.

1702
02:06:15,602 --> 02:06:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know more about the reasoning behind that answer because $100 is feasible for a new system?

1703
02:06:22,728 --> 02:06:25,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not dismissing the answer.

1704
02:06:25,531 --> 02:06:30,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying I wish he'd written more because I want to know more about why does the Ouya stand out?

1705
02:06:30,395 --> 02:06:31,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just the price?

1706
02:06:32,819 --> 02:06:35,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Stan replied and said, I'm sold.

1707
02:06:36,061 --> 02:06:39,984
[SPEAKER_04]: First Pikmin 3 was announced and I'm sure a new Mario Kart Smash Brothers will come out.

1708
02:06:40,084 --> 02:06:41,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Bayonetta 2 on top of that.

1709
02:06:41,745 --> 02:06:43,867
[SPEAKER_04]: As Fry would say, shut up and take my money.

1710
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:49,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara said, I'm still not interested, especially for the price point.

1711
02:06:50,053 --> 02:06:55,996
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a drastic price cut like there was with the 3DS, I may invest at a later point, but right now it's not worth the money.

1712
02:06:56,957 --> 02:07:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Giovadea says, with what I spent on the Wii and all the games that I own and don't play on that system, my answer is no.

1713
02:07:03,281 --> 02:07:09,585
[SPEAKER_04]: While I loved Bayonetta, I can't see the second one doing so well on Wii U that it stays an exclusive past the launch date.

1714
02:07:10,345 --> 02:07:14,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to clarify, though, even though a lot of people are theorizing that, Nintendo is publishing it.

1715
02:07:14,147 --> 02:07:15,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not be on any other system.

1716
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to happen.

1717
02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:20,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, that's the only game mentioned that I care about.

1718
02:07:22,691 --> 02:07:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Kareem J replied and said, Short answer, no.

1719
02:07:25,893 --> 02:07:30,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Storage is so cheap now, I don't know why Nintendo didn't opt for a 16 gig version instead of a 32 gig version.

1720
02:07:31,816 --> 02:07:33,418
[SPEAKER_04]: No one starts at 8 anymore.

1721
02:07:33,558 --> 02:07:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Apple moved away from that storage capacity.

1722
02:07:36,662 --> 02:07:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: 250 pounds for an 8 gig device.

1723
02:07:38,665 --> 02:07:41,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, 250 euros for an 8 gig device.

1724
02:07:41,268 --> 02:07:41,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a break.

1725
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:45,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Acidic Vampire says, no, not enough Imagine Babies games.

1726
02:07:47,421 --> 02:07:47,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait.

1727
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:49,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine babies will happen.

1728
02:07:49,062 --> 02:07:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta give it time, man.

1729
02:07:50,022 --> 02:07:50,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it time.

1730
02:07:51,042 --> 02:07:51,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it time.

1731
02:07:52,503 --> 02:07:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer Girl says, I'm not sure if I want one just yet.

1732
02:07:55,044 --> 02:07:56,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Might wait a while before deciding.

1733
02:07:57,985 --> 02:08:00,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, if I get one now, I'll just regret it later.

1734
02:08:00,486 --> 02:08:04,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I kinda wanna wait for the price to drop and more games added to the library.

1735
02:08:04,607 --> 02:08:06,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinda learned my lesson to the Wii.

1736
02:08:06,888 --> 02:08:09,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, but it's lacking in titles.

1737
02:08:09,809 --> 02:08:12,350
[SPEAKER_04]: James S. replied and said, Hi guys, I'm new to OLR.

1738
02:08:12,390 --> 02:08:13,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Stitcher.

1739
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:14,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

1740
02:08:14,511 --> 02:08:25,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Stitcher, where you can hear us, by the way, on Stitcher Radio, which is, in some ways, kind of like where podcasting's going right now is apps like Stitcher and TuneIn and all that, especially with podcasting becoming its own app.

1741
02:08:26,623 --> 02:08:27,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a discussion for another day.

1742
02:08:28,325 --> 02:08:30,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, and here's the answer.

1743
02:08:30,447 --> 02:08:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1744
02:09:00,216 --> 02:09:24,354
[SPEAKER_04]: uh he wants to throw in a plug why not plug plug search James Anthony on Amazon Kindle for my 99 cent highly rated horror comedy books fine I will give a listener a shout out um back to the answer though it's it's actually a real similar answer to where I'm at to be honest that's almost exactly what I said earlier right Bayonetta 2 fucking great not enough

1745
02:09:25,839 --> 02:09:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1746
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:29,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the answers on Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1747
02:09:29,522 --> 02:09:31,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them all.

1748
02:09:32,044 --> 02:09:33,886
[SPEAKER_04]: There was just like 20 of them and that's a lot.

1749
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:34,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So go read them.

1750
02:09:34,987 --> 02:09:39,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and then answer next week's when it comes up.

1751
02:09:40,712 --> 02:09:44,715
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says he made a quick link for the Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus page.

1752
02:09:44,755 --> 02:09:46,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.

1753
02:09:46,817 --> 02:09:50,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Gplus.to slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1754
02:09:51,761 --> 02:09:52,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

1755
02:09:52,281 --> 02:09:54,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much easier for me to give out than say

1756
02:09:54,622 --> 02:09:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Google and search for it.

1757
02:09:57,024 --> 02:09:57,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

1758
02:09:59,126 --> 02:10:01,288
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.

1759
02:10:01,428 --> 02:10:07,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to clarify, if there was any question here in studio, are you buying a Wii U?

1760
02:10:07,533 --> 02:10:08,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the conference change your mind?

1761
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:09,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1762
02:10:10,255 --> 02:10:13,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Not buying a Wii U. Did not change anything.

1763
02:10:14,579 --> 02:10:18,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, sorry, I know you're mid-bite there on that delicious quesadilla, but your thoughts?

1764
02:10:19,043 --> 02:10:20,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, I don't care enough.

1765
02:10:21,514 --> 02:10:43,786
[SPEAKER_04]: me I am still on the fence I really am it is going to come down to how much extra money do I have burning a hole in my pocket around that time I'm thinking probably not right away I just think I'm trying to save for other life priorities right now I just don't know but I could still be convinced Nintendo tell me that an F-Zero game's coming in 2013 and I'll be like

1766
02:10:46,397 --> 02:10:50,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania 2DX Volumes 1-15 Yeah, right.

1767
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:51,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get my hopes up.

1768
02:10:52,925 --> 02:10:55,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Beatmania 2DX was a great game.

1769
02:10:55,687 --> 02:10:58,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad that it's kind of a shadow of what it used to be.

1770
02:10:58,149 --> 02:10:59,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, that's for another day.

1771
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:00,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki!

1772
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:01,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we get back into some news?

1773
02:11:02,411 --> 02:11:10,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about some wonderful new, hopefully soon, tech from Microsoft.

1774
02:11:10,537 --> 02:11:15,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They patented a new immersive display experience.

1775
02:11:15,820 --> 02:11:19,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the way it works is in conjunction with Kinect,

1776
02:11:20,283 --> 02:11:26,405
[SPEAKER_03]: It would project a display on your walls, kind of like a projector would.

1777
02:11:27,245 --> 02:11:34,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually saw some... They have a video that they showed off, I think it was a couple of years ago or whatever.

1778
02:11:34,567 --> 02:11:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a similar type of thing.

1779
02:11:35,768 --> 02:11:41,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It was during one of their campus tours, kind of talking a little bit about home automation and stuff.

1780
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way it works is, in conjunction with the camera, it will detect different movements you're doing, but it'll also kind of...

1781
02:11:50,072 --> 02:11:51,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Adjust for your room.

1782
02:11:51,533 --> 02:11:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, they were talking about game applications that it would correct the perspective of the scene based on the objects you have in your room.

1783
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a chair or something like that, it'll know that the chair is there and it'll adjust the perspective of whatever object is being mapped onto it so that it looks like one seamless thing, which is pretty awesome.

1784
02:12:11,771 --> 02:12:19,898
[SPEAKER_03]: and some other applications they showed in the campus tour that they did in May 2011.

1785
02:12:20,538 --> 02:12:26,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more Windows-based, more computing.

1786
02:12:27,744 --> 02:12:30,126
[SPEAKER_03]: One example was a kid's room or something.

1787
02:12:30,186 --> 02:12:34,590
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a completely interactive display on their walls.

1788
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all projector-based.

1789
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:52,996
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had like you know tweets and social networking stuff was popping up on the wall and you know they could you know make a gesture or whatever and pull up music and you know just the interface was really huge and kind of cool very immersive I guess

1790
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,681
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a part of me that wants to say this is full of shit.

1791
02:12:57,041 --> 02:13:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the same thing we heard about the revolution in 2006.

1792
02:13:00,783 --> 02:13:02,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when the Wii was going to be called the revolution?

1793
02:13:03,244 --> 02:13:03,624
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL.

1794
02:13:04,204 --> 02:13:08,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talked about it was going to be fucking holograms in your room.

1795
02:13:09,526 --> 02:13:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back and listen to the shows from 2006.

1796
02:13:11,627 --> 02:13:16,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the rumors about the Nintendo Wii was that it was going to do holograms and all this shit.

1797
02:13:16,669 --> 02:13:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we kind of go again, I feel like, in a way.

1798
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:20,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way you describe it,

1799
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:26,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sound far off from where Microsoft's going.

1800
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:28,561
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot with it that I can dig.

1801
02:13:29,082 --> 02:13:38,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about it, we've kind of had that technology before where you can have like a thing that projects images on kids' walls and stuff.

1802
02:13:38,105 --> 02:13:41,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's how you have like the dancing circus animals and stuff.

1803
02:13:41,266 --> 02:13:44,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a very, very basic light with the cutouts, right?

1804
02:13:44,327 --> 02:13:45,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even if you're talking a little bit more politically.

1805
02:13:45,828 --> 02:13:46,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seriously cool looking.

1806
02:13:46,468 --> 02:13:47,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it on MS... Was it...

1807
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:17,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was MSN or something.

1808
02:14:17,461 --> 02:14:19,563
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like a seven minute long video.

1809
02:14:19,863 --> 02:14:23,526
[SPEAKER_03]: If you skip like five minutes into it and it shows... Now, I hadn't seen this before.

1810
02:14:23,746 --> 02:14:24,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.

1811
02:14:24,226 --> 02:14:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It wants me to put on Silverlight.

1812
02:14:25,728 --> 02:14:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do this other one?

1813
02:14:27,349 --> 02:14:28,410
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only like a minute.

1814
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That will still work.

1815
02:14:29,831 --> 02:14:31,332
[SPEAKER_03]: It's showing some of the other stuff.

1816
02:14:31,352 --> 02:14:33,954
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not the interactive one I was telling you about.

1817
02:14:34,235 --> 02:14:35,255
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, it gives you the idea.

1818
02:14:35,356 --> 02:14:36,496
[SPEAKER_03]: See how the room is whole.

1819
02:14:36,717 --> 02:14:37,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1820
02:14:37,617 --> 02:14:38,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Integrated into it.

1821
02:14:39,259 --> 02:14:42,041
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like the Interventions building at Disneyland.

1822
02:14:42,081 --> 02:14:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: The type of stuff that's in there.

1823
02:14:43,516 --> 02:14:44,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.

1824
02:14:44,276 --> 02:14:49,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, okay, it's not going to be like the holodeck from Star Trek.

1825
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look that good.

1826
02:14:50,759 --> 02:14:57,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like projections on a wall, but it's kind of rad in a real sci-fi kind of way, you know?

1827
02:14:57,902 --> 02:15:08,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, imagine if you will, like your apartment here, you just have this thing that's in the middle of the room and you're interacting with the entire room as like...

1828
02:15:09,761 --> 02:15:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox, fill my walls with boobies!

1829
02:15:37,335 --> 02:15:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can't... That is one of the things that I am... Loki could walk into his spare bedroom that could be his wall of boobies, his boobie palace, and just projections of boobies all over the wall, bouncing in slow motion.

1830
02:15:48,752 --> 02:15:48,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Or...

1831
02:15:50,868 --> 02:15:52,249
[SPEAKER_03]: MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K

1832
02:16:16,067 --> 02:16:16,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be cool.

1833
02:16:16,788 --> 02:16:19,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because you can use it with pretty much anything.

1834
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a display.

1835
02:16:21,373 --> 02:16:26,698
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, the Kinect looked really cool at first, but there's like two types of games for it.

1836
02:16:26,778 --> 02:16:29,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, the tech right now for the Kinect is terrible.

1837
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:39,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say right now it's terrible, but even the PC version is slightly better, but right now it's terrible, but next iteration of it may be better.

1838
02:16:39,751 --> 02:16:42,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, you know, the iToy camera.

1839
02:16:42,852 --> 02:16:44,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The iToy was crap.

1840
02:16:44,432 --> 02:16:49,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PlayStation Eye is less crappy, but it's still not quite there.

1841
02:16:49,594 --> 02:16:53,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But the technology is growing so fast that this is going to be possible.

1842
02:16:54,295 --> 02:16:56,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hell, it's possible now because they're showing it.

1843
02:16:56,816 --> 02:17:00,877
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to know is how the fuck is everything projecting on things because projectors aren't cheap.

1844
02:17:01,257 --> 02:17:04,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to know what kind of hardware I got to have.

1845
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:06,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to mount a fucking thing to my roof or something?

1846
02:17:06,379 --> 02:17:07,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how's this going to work?

1847
02:17:09,036 --> 02:17:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I'm going to mount a fucking thing on my roof if I can do that shit.

1848
02:17:12,257 --> 02:17:14,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the technology will always be glitchy.

1849
02:17:14,298 --> 02:17:23,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you tried to do that thing where you're like, Xbox, guns, it'll probably think you said Xbox, nuns, and there'll be people praying all over your walls for your soul.

1850
02:17:23,321 --> 02:17:24,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't even that.

1851
02:17:24,201 --> 02:17:29,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still motion censored and stuff, but I don't think the voice commands are going to be necessary.

1852
02:17:30,063 --> 02:17:36,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they've got a, you better connect, because I think a lot of the voice commands now are because connect doesn't really read you very well.

1853
02:17:38,026 --> 02:17:41,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really listen to you very well either, but, you know, I don't know.

1854
02:17:41,589 --> 02:17:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll work.

1855
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1856
02:17:43,390 --> 02:17:53,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, meanwhile, while Microsoft is working on, you know, projecting boobies on your wall, we have the 3DS that is working on getting Game Boy Advance games, possibly in the eShop.

1857
02:17:53,558 --> 02:17:54,979
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all a rumor right now.

1858
02:17:55,179 --> 02:17:55,860
[SPEAKER_04]: However...

1859
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:59,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Game Boy Advance games on the 3DS are nothing new.

1860
02:17:59,661 --> 02:18:03,183
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Ambassador program, and we did have some games that came out on that.

1861
02:18:03,243 --> 02:18:09,266
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were a 3DS early adopter, you got some pretty fucking good Game Boy Advance games, all things considered.

1862
02:18:09,286 --> 02:18:13,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there was the Metroid, not Zero Mission, but the other one, Metroid Fusion.

1863
02:18:13,707 --> 02:18:23,132
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Adventure remake, which I think was Advance 4?

1864
02:18:23,452 --> 02:18:23,792
I can't...

1865
02:18:24,472 --> 02:18:25,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost count.

1866
02:18:26,213 --> 02:18:27,334
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you had a lot of those games.

1867
02:18:27,394 --> 02:18:30,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire Emblem, there was a lot of good stuff that was a part of the ambassador program.

1868
02:18:30,676 --> 02:18:41,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, Nintendo Australia's eShop software page was recently updated, and it added a Game Boy Advance category to the virtual console spread.

1869
02:18:41,943 --> 02:18:47,047
[SPEAKER_04]: The only title that was listed there was Dr. Mario, as in the classic NES version.

1870
02:18:47,427 --> 02:18:51,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird, though, because why would they put that there instead of just a regular NES game?

1871
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:57,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it have been the Game Boy Advance version of the Nintendo game, which seems really redundant?

1872
02:18:57,634 --> 02:18:58,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but there it is.

1873
02:18:59,635 --> 02:19:04,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible that Nintendo Australia may have spilled the beans on that.

1874
02:19:04,298 --> 02:19:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it makes sense.

1875
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:10,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, didn't they say at one point, these games will never come out for sale?

1876
02:19:11,203 --> 02:19:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all sat here going, yeah, sure, yeah, right, they will come out for sale at some point.

1877
02:19:16,738 --> 02:19:17,439
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1878
02:19:39,818 --> 02:19:40,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

1879
02:19:41,639 --> 02:19:51,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few more news stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag and soon the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype if you want to add us, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1880
02:19:51,966 --> 02:19:53,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Alan.

1881
02:19:53,967 --> 02:19:55,688
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just given me all the Valve stories today.

1882
02:19:56,429 --> 02:19:57,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're a fan.

1883
02:19:57,430 --> 02:19:57,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1884
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:06,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Mesa, McPixel, and others are the first to pass through their Greenlight, Steam's Greenlight program.

1885
02:20:06,238 --> 02:20:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically indie developers pay a one-time fee to kind of keep the amount of crap submissions down.

1886
02:20:11,945 --> 02:20:13,166
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the story we covered last week.

1887
02:20:13,607 --> 02:20:17,271
[SPEAKER_02]: To have their game be say, hey, we want to distribute this on Steam.

1888
02:20:17,731 --> 02:20:22,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, because it's pretty much the best digital platform for buying games in existence right now.

1889
02:20:22,853 --> 02:20:23,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So vote for our game.

1890
02:20:25,313 --> 02:20:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 10 titles that have passed the gauntlet and gotten the amount of votes that they needed was Black Mesa Source, Cry of Fear, Dream, Heroes and Generals, Kenshi, McPixel, No More Room in Hell, Project Zomboid, Routine, and finally a game called Towns.

1891
02:20:44,579 --> 02:20:47,100
[SPEAKER_02]: These games will be released independently in the months ahead.

1892
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: as they are in varying stages of completion, Valve spokesman has said.

1893
02:20:52,823 --> 02:20:54,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually checked for Osfer in chat.

1894
02:20:55,204 --> 02:21:03,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Mesa source is not yet on Steam Greenlight because a big reason for that could be because the last stage of it, like the last 10% of the game, Xen,

1895
02:21:05,048 --> 02:21:10,050
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't in it yet, and this is pure speculation on my part, but it could be that.

1896
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:14,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously the game is being downloaded everywhere on their actual website.

1897
02:21:15,233 --> 02:21:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be that Valve could be like, you've already said that this game isn't completely done, so however long that takes.

1898
02:21:20,675 --> 02:21:26,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, some of these games should start appearing and be searchable through the Steam store.

1899
02:21:26,898 --> 02:21:27,878
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the first 10 to make it.

1900
02:21:29,415 --> 02:21:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

1901
02:21:29,955 --> 02:21:31,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congrats to those games.

1902
02:21:31,596 --> 02:21:39,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we need to convince Aaron to put Bungee Ferret Tossing as part of this Project Greenlight thing so we can get Bungee Ferret Tossing on Steam.

1903
02:21:39,701 --> 02:21:42,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad that the Xbox indie games don't support Kinect.

1904
02:21:44,424 --> 02:21:45,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It is too bad, isn't it?

1905
02:21:45,504 --> 02:21:46,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we could actually toss...

1906
02:21:47,185 --> 02:21:47,966
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1907
02:22:09,128 --> 02:22:14,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that some silly idea here on Orange Lounge Radio is now turning into a media empire.

1908
02:22:14,411 --> 02:22:17,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is an official soundtrack for six bucks.

1909
02:22:18,153 --> 02:22:24,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Dan Period is the guy that wrote... Do we want to play a little snippet of some of the music from Bungie Ferret Tossing here?

1910
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a song called Jungle War.

1911
02:22:26,958 --> 02:22:27,859
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a good title.

1912
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:28,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll present it.

1913
02:22:35,413 --> 02:22:39,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a bungee tail, or excuse me, a ferret tail whipping really quick.

1914
02:22:39,197 --> 02:22:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, whose dog's barking in the background there?

1915
02:22:43,301 --> 02:22:43,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good, though.

1916
02:22:43,821 --> 02:22:46,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very professional.

1917
02:22:51,414 --> 02:22:51,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

1918
02:22:52,455 --> 02:22:54,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that 80s power guitar in there.

1919
02:22:54,939 --> 02:22:56,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can check that out on Amazon.com right now.

1920
02:22:57,482 --> 02:23:01,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for giving me an excuse to somehow inadvertently plug Bungie Ferret Tossing again.

1921
02:23:02,128 --> 02:23:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, Project Greenlight.

1922
02:23:03,109 --> 02:23:04,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats to those developers.

1923
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:04,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1924
02:23:05,392 --> 02:23:07,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, weird... Excuse me.

1925
02:23:09,596 --> 02:23:11,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Steams, what's it called?

1926
02:23:12,757 --> 02:23:14,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Picture?

1927
02:23:14,238 --> 02:23:15,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Picture, yeah.

1928
02:23:15,498 --> 02:23:24,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I clicked on that, and it made my monitor not spaz out or anything, but it made my system run really slow, and then it's like, oh, you're supposed to hook this up to your TV.

1929
02:23:24,542 --> 02:23:29,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's for people that, like Dan and Jamie, have their computer on their TV so they can watch YouTubes and stuff.

1930
02:23:29,905 --> 02:23:36,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but my TV already has an HDMI on it, so why wouldn't I just run an HDMI from my PC to the TV?

1931
02:23:37,208 --> 02:23:59,062
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what they want you to do that's what they want you to do but it's it makes it so that you're not like windows because it looks different on a tv it's like all full screen basically like it looks more like a console i guess is the trick got it whatever it's optional right yeah so steam's just releasing either they're just going crazy because they've got the workshop for mods that was the first thing that was a

1932
02:24:04,914 --> 02:24:06,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Still need to play Skyrim on PC.

1933
02:24:07,215 --> 02:24:07,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

1934
02:24:08,135 --> 02:24:10,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And Portal 2 on PC that I still need to play with.

1935
02:24:10,655 --> 02:24:11,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

1936
02:24:12,136 --> 02:24:18,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I got Dawnguard like two weeks ago, or basically, yeah, about two weeks ago, and I haven't really played any of the new content yet.

1937
02:24:18,357 --> 02:24:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got me to load up Skyrim after taking a couple months off.

1938
02:24:20,597 --> 02:24:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I loaned my Xbox 360 copy to my sister because she wanted to play it, and she's a fan of glitchy games.

1939
02:24:26,418 --> 02:24:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she played Driver 3 forever, so, you know, Skyrim's really glitchy.

1940
02:24:33,015 --> 02:24:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: All the good domain names are taken at this point.

1941
02:24:57,052 --> 02:25:04,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you, this is free right here, free for whoever, you know, hears it first and decides to name their company this.

1942
02:25:06,215 --> 02:25:07,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get in the people's faces?

1943
02:25:07,795 --> 02:25:09,676
[SPEAKER_03]: You name your company, Ermagerd.

1944
02:25:15,658 --> 02:25:16,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's name recognition.

1945
02:25:16,518 --> 02:25:17,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Ermagerd Streaming.

1946
02:25:19,679 --> 02:25:20,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1947
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Ermagerd Germs.

1948
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:31,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Agawi, apparently they've announced a partnership with Microsoft and they're going to bring cloud streaming games to Windows 8.

1949
02:25:32,439 --> 02:25:41,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course it's going to tie in with Microsoft's Windows Azure Cloud Platform.

1950
02:25:45,348 --> 02:25:48,711
[SPEAKER_03]: They promise popular AAA games will be playable within the coming months.

1951
02:25:51,178 --> 02:25:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't really say how it's going to work with a tablet, but I guess virtual D-pads are some garbage.

1952
02:25:59,802 --> 02:26:00,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1953
02:26:01,842 --> 02:26:02,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Ermagerd Verg.

1954
02:26:05,084 --> 02:26:05,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Verg Network.

1955
02:26:07,321 --> 02:26:08,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, it doesn't have the same ring to it.

1956
02:26:09,463 --> 02:26:14,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one more story here before we get to the mailbag and see what people are emailing us and ermagirding about tonight.

1957
02:26:15,487 --> 02:26:18,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Ikaruga's creator is making a new game.

1958
02:26:18,329 --> 02:26:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1959
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:21,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Because who doesn't love Ikaruga?

1960
02:26:21,231 --> 02:26:22,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you, like, hate shooters.

1961
02:26:22,412 --> 02:26:24,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you in that case.

1962
02:26:24,474 --> 02:26:29,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiroshi Yuichi is going to release a new shooter called Kokuga.

1963
02:26:30,178 --> 02:26:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the 3DS.

1964
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:36,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And the trailer is now out, so if you are an Ikaruga fan...

1965
02:26:37,023 --> 02:26:39,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be time to get a 3DS because this is what awaits you there.

1966
02:26:39,546 --> 02:26:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks a lot more of the polygon-esque kind of 3D graphics going into this game.

1967
02:26:45,311 --> 02:26:46,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get in some Raiden vibes.

1968
02:26:46,973 --> 02:26:47,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit.

1969
02:26:47,533 --> 02:26:48,554
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit there.

1970
02:26:48,995 --> 02:26:49,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullet hell!

1971
02:26:49,896 --> 02:26:50,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullet hell!

1972
02:26:50,857 --> 02:26:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1973
02:26:52,618 --> 02:26:54,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that will make you barf in 3D.

1974
02:26:55,259 --> 02:26:55,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be fun.

1975
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:18,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1976
02:27:18,833 --> 02:27:25,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Sorry, I have to say this.

1977
02:27:27,596 --> 02:27:32,479
[SPEAKER_04]: MM2K says in chat, Ermagerd is patent too, just like gamer.

1978
02:27:32,899 --> 02:27:39,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, somebody needs to trademark Ermagerd and then sue the entirety of the internet for infringing on that trademark.

1979
02:27:40,363 --> 02:27:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing idea, MM2K.

1980
02:27:41,924 --> 02:27:43,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do that right now.

1981
02:27:43,525 --> 02:27:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1982
02:27:45,506 --> 02:27:47,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

1983
02:27:47,747 --> 02:27:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag every week and find some emails to read for you all.

1984
02:27:51,469 --> 02:27:52,590
[SPEAKER_04]: But since she's not here...

1985
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:57,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan has stolen her hazmat suit so that he can walk in the mailbag and find some email for you.

1986
02:27:58,194 --> 02:28:04,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading this first email and it sounds like it's talking about a cheat in Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

1987
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:06,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I read this if it tells you how to cheat?

1988
02:28:07,163 --> 02:28:08,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave that part out if you want.

1989
02:28:08,792 --> 02:28:13,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this email is from MM2K.

1990
02:28:14,956 --> 02:28:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I want to apologize if this is the second email you got for me.

1991
02:28:18,199 --> 02:28:23,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally went to the old R site to send, but the character limitations made it seem like a bunch of babble.

1992
02:28:23,562 --> 02:28:25,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my question for Rob and DarkSakura.

1993
02:28:26,884 --> 02:28:32,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer is rather tough on the game, and I had problems surviving past bronze difficulty.

1994
02:28:32,227 --> 02:28:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is me now inserting this.

1995
02:28:35,889 --> 02:28:37,710
[SPEAKER_02]: This is talking about Mass Effect multiplayer.

1996
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:42,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Then some cool people showed me the Striker Assault Rifle Cheat.

1997
02:28:42,532 --> 02:28:46,995
[SPEAKER_02]: This allows you to convert this weapon's ammo to cobra missiles, resulting in one-hit kills with each shot.

1998
02:28:48,035 --> 02:28:49,116
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's cheating.

1999
02:29:17,944 --> 02:29:23,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I see their shrieks as mindless chest pounding over game ranking, which again means jack shit if you're all at the level cap.

2000
02:29:23,992 --> 02:29:25,895
[SPEAKER_02]: If we win, we all get the same amount of cash.

2001
02:29:26,035 --> 02:29:27,277
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, we should be happy.

2002
02:29:27,357 --> 02:29:28,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assisting them to win.

2003
02:29:28,979 --> 02:29:29,801
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, they should be happy.

2004
02:29:29,821 --> 02:29:30,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assisting them to win.

2005
02:29:30,922 --> 02:29:39,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I also play the harder levels as a Turian soldier without the cheat and I tell you 80-85% of the people who play these levels have no idea what WTF they're doing anyway.

2006
02:29:40,244 --> 02:29:50,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Winning isn't everything but if it's the difference between us wasting power-ups to die at wave 3 and only get 20,000 credits or completing the playthrough and getting 75-240,000 credits God, that must be how much you get for platinum, that's crazy.

2007
02:29:51,827 --> 02:29:59,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be glad that someone was aboard that could help when we were all about to die as I was when I met the person who showed me the glitch.

2008
02:29:59,632 --> 02:29:59,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts?

2009
02:30:00,353 --> 02:30:07,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I thinking like the gaming jackass that many are claiming or do I have a fair point?

2010
02:30:07,637 --> 02:30:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2011
02:30:08,118 --> 02:30:09,679
[SPEAKER_02]: You and Bobby's show is the freaking best.

2012
02:30:10,539 --> 02:30:16,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should take over G4, turn it into a 24-hour radio show network and make Blair Herder, a.k.a.

2013
02:30:18,466 --> 02:30:19,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross from Friends.

2014
02:30:20,189 --> 02:30:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: That's David Schwimmer.

2015
02:30:22,232 --> 02:30:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that reference.

2016
02:30:22,993 --> 02:30:24,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was a character.

2017
02:30:24,276 --> 02:30:25,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.

2018
02:30:25,317 --> 02:30:27,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring you smoothies and Cheez-Its all day.

2019
02:30:28,089 --> 02:30:30,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That reference is lost on me, but thank you nonetheless.

2020
02:30:31,130 --> 02:30:34,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to the question at hand about the whole Mass Effect 3 cheat.

2021
02:30:34,271 --> 02:30:35,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the problem.

2022
02:30:35,632 --> 02:30:48,416
[SPEAKER_04]: You may think you're trying to do a good thing by helping these people out of trouble, but the problem with what you're doing, and in your mind you're thinking you're doing a good thing, and it's like, oh, hey, I'm saving you from death and losing all these credits.

2023
02:30:48,856 --> 02:30:54,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to remember you're making a big assumption here, that all these people that you're playing with are only in it for the credits.

2024
02:30:54,918 --> 02:30:56,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are in it for the challenge.

2025
02:30:57,299 --> 02:30:59,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are very anti-cheating.

2026
02:30:59,879 --> 02:31:06,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tend to notice that type of mentality usually comes when you're very passionate about a series like Mass Effect fans tend to be.

2027
02:31:07,021 --> 02:31:16,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people feel like, I don't want you to cheat because I don't want to be associated with you so that if Bioware catches you and you get banned, I get banned too.

2028
02:31:16,763 --> 02:31:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be around that shit.

2029
02:31:18,623 --> 02:31:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the problem with what you're doing is that you're bringing other people into it who didn't consent to do that.

2030
02:31:24,144 --> 02:31:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that and also there is a money element to this because I have my two or three favorite classes that I try to keep at level 20 when I want to try and do silvers and golds.

2031
02:31:34,709 --> 02:31:41,772
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I play silvers and golds at level 20 is because I want credits so I can buy the upgrade packs to unlock the new characters and the weapon upgrades and blah, blah, blah.

2032
02:31:42,152 --> 02:31:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I could also spend five bucks on Bioware's website and get a pack of like 300 Bioware points and then...

2033
02:31:50,416 --> 02:31:52,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Manually buy those with cash.

2034
02:31:52,637 --> 02:31:55,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know why you do that, but I'm sure there are tons of people that have spent hundreds of dollars.

2035
02:31:56,419 --> 02:32:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're helping people farm credits in that way, like if you were to do that in Firebase White with the geth, and I'm getting way too technical in the game, you're kind of screwing over the people that are paying money.

2036
02:32:10,225 --> 02:32:12,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense for those packs?

2037
02:32:12,186 --> 02:32:12,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2038
02:32:12,626 --> 02:32:16,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may be well-intentioned, but not everybody really understands that.

2039
02:32:16,688 --> 02:32:18,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's my advice to you.

2040
02:32:18,149 --> 02:32:21,331
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the way you want to play, and keep in mind, you're taking a risk.

2041
02:32:21,951 --> 02:32:25,853
[SPEAKER_04]: If BioWare catches you exploiting too many credits that way, you don't know what's going to happen.

2042
02:32:25,933 --> 02:32:27,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So use caution.

2043
02:32:27,194 --> 02:32:27,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

2044
02:32:29,435 --> 02:32:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it with a consenting audience.

2045
02:32:30,936 --> 02:32:34,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Only do that stuff with your friends, with the people that you know online.

2046
02:32:35,078 --> 02:32:38,380
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned in your email that somebody showed you how to do that.

2047
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,461
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2048
02:32:58,303 --> 02:33:04,812
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki's on the right track when he talks about his Grand Theft Auto 4 matches, that they cheat like hell in those matches.

2049
02:33:05,253 --> 02:33:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all internal.

2050
02:33:06,595 --> 02:33:08,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all people that know each other.

2051
02:33:08,557 --> 02:33:13,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all, you know, when, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, when you go on Xbox Live and play against strangers, you don't cheat.

2052
02:33:14,125 --> 02:33:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: You play it straight up.

2053
02:33:15,507 --> 02:33:18,431
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't play those mods anymore anyways.

2054
02:33:18,511 --> 02:33:25,140
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, when we were playing those mods, we only played against each other because we all had the same mods and it was all modding new weapons that were all balanced.

2055
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:28,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so that we could cheat other people.

2056
02:33:28,245 --> 02:33:31,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, look at all these crazy fucking weapons that we have.

2057
02:33:32,313 --> 02:33:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to shoot each other with them.

2058
02:33:34,194 --> 02:33:34,494
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2059
02:33:34,834 --> 02:33:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the moral of the story, and I'll end with this.

2060
02:33:38,135 --> 02:33:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Long story short, too late.

2061
02:33:39,936 --> 02:33:41,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it like Monopoly.

2062
02:33:41,757 --> 02:33:43,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Set the house rules in advance.

2063
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there going to be a jackpot when you land on free parking?

2064
02:33:48,599 --> 02:33:50,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, set all those house rules.

2065
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:52,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Do people really go to jail if they roll three doubles in a row?

2066
02:33:53,441 --> 02:33:55,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Set the house rules in advance.

2067
02:33:55,842 --> 02:33:59,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're going to play with strangers, then the house rules have already been set.

2068
02:34:00,124 --> 02:34:01,045
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no house rules.

2069
02:34:01,065 --> 02:34:02,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to play by Bioware's rules.

2070
02:34:02,265 --> 02:34:05,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just say, hey, can I rocket glitch this, bros?

2071
02:34:06,007 --> 02:34:07,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, can I rocket glitch?

2072
02:34:07,028 --> 02:34:11,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're like, no, fuck off, then maybe that's not the round for you.

2073
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2074
02:34:12,330 --> 02:34:15,711
[SPEAKER_04]: MM2K is actually in our chat tonight and wanted to give a follow-up to the email.

2075
02:34:16,171 --> 02:34:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the person that showed me got banned, so I stopped the day after I sent that email.

2076
02:34:22,372 --> 02:34:25,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the babble.

2077
02:34:25,693 --> 02:34:27,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I knew that, we kind of warned you.

2078
02:34:27,834 --> 02:34:31,555
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get caught, you'll be the one that gets banned and the people that want to be associated with you.

2079
02:34:31,835 --> 02:34:32,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2080
02:34:32,575 --> 02:34:36,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that that's already a resolved situation, I thought it was a good thing to talk about, so no worries.

2081
02:34:37,196 --> 02:34:41,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's plenty of other games and communities where something like this goes on.

2082
02:34:41,892 --> 02:34:42,132
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2083
02:34:43,993 --> 02:34:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2084
02:34:44,333 --> 02:34:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And next email is from Catastrophic Moggy.

2085
02:34:48,755 --> 02:34:50,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure I've heard this reader before.

2086
02:34:50,316 --> 02:34:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

2087
02:34:50,936 --> 02:34:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listener.

2088
02:34:52,837 --> 02:34:59,641
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR, no doubt you've already got the classic game of the week covered, but if you don't mind, I'd like to add my own, given that this game will likely be unheard of.

2089
02:35:00,121 --> 02:35:02,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's got a, they've got a gameplay link.

2090
02:35:02,962 --> 02:35:20,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I will bring that up here while you start to read it on YouTube school days for the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum if you're in the UK you play as a schoolboy named Eric though you could change the name if you wanted to and your goal is to get the combination to the safe that holds your permanent record

2091
02:35:21,365 --> 02:35:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the combination you have to grab or shoot these little shields scattered around the school with your catapult.

2092
02:35:26,786 --> 02:35:28,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as it sounds.

2093
02:35:28,807 --> 02:35:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Some you can't reach without knocking over your classmates to get a boost so you can jump higher or deflect shots off of a teacher's head.

2094
02:35:36,289 --> 02:35:39,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if catapult is British for a slingshot.

2095
02:35:40,506 --> 02:35:41,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2096
02:36:00,719 --> 02:36:02,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Get too many and you may be excluded.

2097
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine that's expelled.

2098
02:36:06,641 --> 02:36:16,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also got the other kids to deal with, particularly the bully who is trying to get you into trouble and the SWOT, S-W-O-T, who runs to the teachers whenever he sees you do anything wrong.

2099
02:36:17,324 --> 02:36:18,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a narc or a snitch, I guess.

2100
02:36:19,305 --> 02:36:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone interested in the game, there was a fan-made remake release called Class of 99, with improved graphics and sound.

2101
02:36:27,267 --> 02:36:30,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea if it works on Vista or Win 7, though.

2102
02:36:31,108 --> 02:36:31,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll link to that.

2103
02:36:32,368 --> 02:36:32,768
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2104
02:36:32,948 --> 02:36:38,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pissed at the moment because, predictably, Persona 4 Arena has been delayed in Europe to God knows when.

2105
02:36:38,909 --> 02:36:42,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So much for it coming out in all territories in quick succession, my F.U.,

2106
02:36:43,110 --> 02:36:44,371
[SPEAKER_02]: of the week is region locking.

2107
02:37:13,555 --> 02:37:14,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

2108
02:37:14,416 --> 02:37:17,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it.

2109
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get it?

2110
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:20,822
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's one more email.

2111
02:37:23,285 --> 02:37:26,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week's episode was weird because a lot of the content that was discussed.

2112
02:37:27,589 --> 02:37:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get into it.

2113
02:37:28,630 --> 02:37:29,811
[SPEAKER_02]: This email kind of addresses that.

2114
02:37:29,931 --> 02:37:30,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look at it real quick.

2115
02:37:32,373 --> 02:37:33,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we need to read...

2116
02:37:40,407 --> 02:37:41,110
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with this?

2117
02:37:41,411 --> 02:37:41,993
[SPEAKER_04]: This is funny.

2118
02:37:43,579 --> 02:37:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2119
02:37:44,924 --> 02:37:45,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we looking at the same one?

2120
02:37:45,847 --> 02:37:46,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The one from Osfer?

2121
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:46,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2122
02:37:48,246 --> 02:37:49,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is fine.

2123
02:37:50,147 --> 02:37:53,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear DarkSakura, I think it's in your best interest to not take Rob's advice.

2124
02:37:53,608 --> 02:38:00,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Diving headfirst into the mailbag is a horrible idea as you never know how deep or shallow in emails it will be.

2125
02:38:00,570 --> 02:38:03,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend stepping in slowly to test the depth.

2126
02:38:03,331 --> 02:38:06,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring Garrus along with you for sure as he can calibrate the mailbag afterwards.

2127
02:38:07,733 --> 02:38:09,333
[SPEAKER_04]: You read way too much.

2128
02:38:09,493 --> 02:38:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the controversy you saw in that email?

2129
02:38:12,714 --> 02:38:14,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see your name.

2130
02:38:14,555 --> 02:38:15,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Dan's.

2131
02:38:15,335 --> 02:38:15,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

2132
02:38:18,953 --> 02:38:20,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't take Dan's advice.

2133
02:38:20,733 --> 02:38:26,134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cute little pun on the, when I always say DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst.

2134
02:38:26,514 --> 02:38:28,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to make a funny joke awkward.

2135
02:38:28,475 --> 02:38:28,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2136
02:38:29,035 --> 02:38:29,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Womp womp.

2137
02:38:29,995 --> 02:38:31,935
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you don't get invited to parties, Alan.

2138
02:38:32,075 --> 02:38:32,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2139
02:38:35,696 --> 02:38:38,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, Oscar was like, ooh, who's gonna read my email?

2140
02:38:38,396 --> 02:38:39,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it's gonna be me.

2141
02:38:39,177 --> 02:38:40,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just pissed all over it.

2142
02:38:40,377 --> 02:38:41,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Austin, I'm very sorry.

2143
02:38:41,737 --> 02:38:43,817
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for Alan reading emails.

2144
02:38:45,478 --> 02:38:45,958
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

2145
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:49,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I read Your Name is Dance?

2146
02:38:50,401 --> 02:38:51,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I want to know.

2147
02:38:53,142 --> 02:38:56,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob and Dan don't even have same letters in common.

2148
02:38:57,143 --> 02:38:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what you saw?

2149
02:38:57,883 --> 02:39:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw Garrus as Dan, because Jamie always talks about how Garrus kind of reminds her of Dan, which is kind of cute in a really weird way.

2150
02:39:06,646 --> 02:39:13,468
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get her that Moe cuddle pillow for her of Garrus, and then Dan will be like, I don't want that in my house.

2151
02:39:14,108 --> 02:39:14,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for Mailbag.

2152
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:20,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job reading the mailbag tonight.

2153
02:39:21,042 --> 02:39:24,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you do a really bad job at something, then people will ask you to not do it anymore.

2154
02:39:28,169 --> 02:39:28,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a hint?

2155
02:39:29,430 --> 02:39:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a hint?

2156
02:39:32,067 --> 02:39:33,989
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the mailbag.

2157
02:39:34,029 --> 02:39:43,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR We'll get some Twitter topics in there as well.

2158
02:39:43,458 --> 02:39:45,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, a couple quick stories.

2159
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2160
02:39:46,561 --> 02:39:48,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought first we had the FUs of the week.

2161
02:39:48,483 --> 02:39:49,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, you're right.

2162
02:39:49,884 --> 02:39:51,546
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to me for getting the FUs of the week.

2163
02:39:51,946 --> 02:39:52,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

2164
02:39:53,968 --> 02:39:54,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan threw off my wrist.

2165
02:40:10,912 --> 02:40:20,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess F you to FedEx for not just losing one pallet of games, but two different pallets of the same game.

2166
02:40:22,179 --> 02:40:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointed Borderlands 2 fans.

2167
02:40:25,881 --> 02:40:28,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And also old people driving on the freeway there, driving like 30 miles an hour.

2168
02:40:29,283 --> 02:40:29,903
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

2169
02:40:29,943 --> 02:40:30,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously?

2170
02:40:30,744 --> 02:40:32,565
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 miles an hour on the freeway?

2171
02:40:34,705 --> 02:40:37,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Two missing pallets of a top-tier game?

2172
02:40:37,386 --> 02:40:38,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That shuts on eBay.

2173
02:40:38,426 --> 02:40:40,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone lifted that off a truck.

2174
02:40:40,247 --> 02:40:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was just misrided.

2175
02:40:41,707 --> 02:40:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2176
02:40:42,327 --> 02:40:42,907
[SPEAKER_03]: How convenient.

2177
02:40:43,248 --> 02:40:47,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so they're somewhere, they're just not where they need to be sold to people.

2178
02:40:47,429 --> 02:40:51,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They apparently flunked geography and thought that Oklahoma City was Memphis.

2179
02:40:53,390 --> 02:40:54,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I make that mistake all the time.

2180
02:40:55,131 --> 02:41:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so they shifted to Memphis and, oh, hey, shit, this isn't Oklahoma City.

2181
02:41:00,852 --> 02:41:02,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Elvis' mansion's in Oklahoma City, right?

2182
02:41:03,183 --> 02:41:06,271
[SPEAKER_03]: or Indianapolis instead of, you know, Perrysburg, Ohio.

2183
02:41:08,497 --> 02:41:10,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, do you have any interviews of the week you want to share?

2184
02:41:11,542 --> 02:41:23,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Very minor in first world, but we bought juice at Target, and orange juice is, like, really good, and we got two cartons of it, and apparently we just left it on the counter in the bag and fucking walked away and left and got into the car and drove away.

2185
02:41:23,947 --> 02:41:25,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.

2186
02:41:26,028 --> 02:41:28,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.

2187
02:41:28,188 --> 02:41:35,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, because it happened, I'm, but yeah, now it happened, I'm like, I really, for no reason, I want orange juice at, you know, 9 o'clock at night, because we forgot it.

2188
02:41:35,191 --> 02:41:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need me to go to Save Mart and get you some orange juice?

2189
02:41:38,137 --> 02:41:42,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So F you to just, I guess, walking away from a counter and leaving behind things that you paid for.

2190
02:41:43,186 --> 02:41:44,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's just $1.50 orange juice.

2191
02:41:46,587 --> 02:41:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2192
02:42:11,366 --> 02:42:13,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I'm having a gun held to my head.

2193
02:42:13,847 --> 02:42:15,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to be doing the things I'm doing.

2194
02:42:15,828 --> 02:42:19,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, it's keeping me very busy.

2195
02:42:19,670 --> 02:42:23,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm able to work in some good stuff, and I know there'll be a good payoff.

2196
02:42:24,773 --> 02:42:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2197
02:42:26,053 --> 02:42:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get into the next story, I want to say F you to one other thing as well.

2198
02:42:31,516 --> 02:42:36,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the fact that we got so tied up in that Wii U conversation earlier in the show...

2199
02:42:37,759 --> 02:42:42,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to embarrass Loki with the fact that his birthday was this past week.

2200
02:42:42,844 --> 02:42:43,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

2201
02:42:43,224 --> 02:42:44,506
[SPEAKER_04]: On September 11th.

2202
02:42:44,786 --> 02:42:48,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a hard day to, or it's an easy day to remember, I guess I'll put it that way.

2203
02:42:49,731 --> 02:42:50,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you end up doing for your birthday?

2204
02:42:51,808 --> 02:42:56,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to work, and then I went and saw The Expendables 2 afterwards.

2205
02:42:56,491 --> 02:42:58,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what a manly way to spend a birthday.

2206
02:42:58,593 --> 02:43:02,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, The Expendables 2 was better than the first movie.

2207
02:43:02,215 --> 02:43:03,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually entertaining.

2208
02:43:04,076 --> 02:43:05,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Chuck Norris is in it.

2209
02:43:05,297 --> 02:43:07,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Chuck Norris is awesome.

2210
02:43:07,138 --> 02:43:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother saw it and said it was awesome, but my brother's also like 18.

2211
02:43:11,041 --> 02:43:14,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Chuck Norris was awesome, though, because his character is like this lone wolf or whatever.

2212
02:43:14,803 --> 02:43:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: He just comes in, and it's like...

2213
02:43:16,264 --> 02:43:21,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just murdered everybody, because I'm Chuck Norris, and that's what the fuck I do.

2214
02:43:22,507 --> 02:43:26,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, F you to the fact that I'm having to have listeners remind me about my life.

2215
02:43:27,449 --> 02:43:30,531
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, don't you mean F you to that table that hit you in the face?

2216
02:43:30,771 --> 02:43:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, F you to the table that hit me in the face.

2217
02:43:33,492 --> 02:43:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, let's go back to Loki.

2218
02:43:35,293 --> 02:43:38,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was your birthday this past week, so Alan and I wanted to say happy birthday.

2219
02:43:38,935 --> 02:43:39,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, thank you.

2220
02:43:39,615 --> 02:43:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you something to open on air there.

2221
02:43:42,056 --> 02:43:42,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit of, oops.

2222
02:43:43,017 --> 02:43:44,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me put this down here.

2223
02:43:44,217 --> 02:43:44,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a card.

2224
02:43:46,198 --> 02:43:49,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably one of the worst wrapping jobs I've ever done.

2225
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:49,901
[SPEAKER_02]: We're boys.

2226
02:43:49,921 --> 02:43:50,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't wrap gifts.

2227
02:43:51,902 --> 02:43:57,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And we recycled... Look on the other side.

2228
02:44:00,188 --> 02:44:06,653
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a Skylanders portal keeper where he can keep all his little Skylanders dolls.

2229
02:44:06,693 --> 02:44:08,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And all your Skylanders toys.

2230
02:44:08,914 --> 02:44:11,376
[SPEAKER_04]: You can open it and you might find something a little more useful inside.

2231
02:44:11,837 --> 02:44:12,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylanders.

2232
02:44:12,997 --> 02:44:14,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's more Skylanders.

2233
02:44:15,339 --> 02:44:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sweet, 1600 point guard.

2234
02:44:16,521 --> 02:44:17,542
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

2235
02:44:17,743 --> 02:44:18,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little more useful.

2236
02:44:18,724 --> 02:44:23,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that, you know, it's cute that Josh can put stuff in it when he's old enough to.

2237
02:44:23,070 --> 02:44:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he does need a toolbox because he's got like some frou-frou, like flowery boxes he's keeping his tools in right now.

2238
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:31,220
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2239
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:36,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So we figured, even though you might not actually put portals in there, it's actually the perfect size for a little lunch or something.

2240
02:44:36,723 --> 02:44:37,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2241
02:44:37,563 --> 02:44:38,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another lunchbox.

2242
02:44:38,924 --> 02:44:40,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have to carry around a Skylanders purse.

2243
02:44:41,945 --> 02:44:50,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally joked that we should just get you one of the figures, but I'm like... I had some of the figures, actually, for a while, because I was selling them.

2244
02:44:52,170 --> 02:44:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it this way.

2245
02:44:52,970 --> 02:44:57,172
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be a gray market for Skylanders, and they just... Really fast.

2246
02:44:57,574 --> 02:44:58,134
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll get it.

2247
02:44:58,194 --> 02:45:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: The chatters are demanding a picture, so I'll get one of those really quick and get it up on orangelaundry.com.

2248
02:45:02,476 --> 02:45:03,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll grab the iPad.

2249
02:45:03,756 --> 02:45:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty also says, quit being sexist in our chat room.

2250
02:45:07,678 --> 02:45:09,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wrap presents for shit either.

2251
02:45:09,759 --> 02:45:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank fuck for gift bags.

2252
02:45:10,999 --> 02:45:12,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I normally don't wrap presents.

2253
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

2254
02:45:13,940 --> 02:45:15,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely right.

2255
02:45:15,401 --> 02:45:18,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank fuck for gift bags is absolutely right as well.

2256
02:45:19,822 --> 02:45:21,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Did not mean to stereotype.

2257
02:45:21,083 --> 02:45:21,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

2258
02:45:22,743 --> 02:45:23,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

2259
02:45:23,224 --> 02:45:23,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2260
02:45:23,564 --> 02:45:24,324
[SPEAKER_03]: The card's funny too.

2261
02:45:24,464 --> 02:45:24,924
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

2262
02:45:24,944 --> 02:45:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the card's funny too.

2263
02:45:27,545 --> 02:45:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2264
02:45:28,666 --> 02:45:28,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

2265
02:45:28,946 --> 02:45:30,987
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to wait for him to do the card because he has the next story.

2266
02:45:31,527 --> 02:45:32,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Birthday bad.

2267
02:45:32,988 --> 02:45:34,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Cake good.

2268
02:45:35,049 --> 02:45:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a fat cat on it.

2269
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:37,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my fat cat.

2270
02:45:37,830 --> 02:45:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's not fat, but she threw up last night again.

2271
02:45:40,692 --> 02:45:40,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2272
02:45:41,652 --> 02:45:42,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Hairballs.

2273
02:45:42,553 --> 02:45:43,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

2274
02:45:43,273 --> 02:45:47,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first card I was looking at was a cat on it saying, I'm getting all choked up because it's your birthday.

2275
02:45:47,215 --> 02:45:48,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he opened it up and it says, oh, just kidding.

2276
02:45:48,876 --> 02:45:49,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hairball.

2277
02:45:50,077 --> 02:45:51,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, if I'd known your story.

2278
02:45:51,737 --> 02:45:52,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

2279
02:45:52,558 --> 02:45:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2280
02:45:53,416 --> 02:46:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so you know of course Australia's got the brand new R18 Plus rating for their game ratings.

2281
02:46:02,445 --> 02:46:13,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they have guidelines for the classification and it should be no surprise, like anything that's rated out there, they're being stricter on games than any other form of media.

2282
02:46:15,238 --> 02:46:36,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, it says, Given the opposition to the introduction of the R18 Plus category from a vocal yet unrepresentative section of the community, along with a largely conservative group of attorneys-generals, it is no surprise that the new guidelines hold video games to a higher standard across a number of categories compared to film and what originally existed for video games.

2283
02:46:37,290 --> 02:46:41,573
[SPEAKER_03]: As we have previously stated, we are concerned with the acknowledgment

2284
02:46:43,514 --> 02:46:58,740
[SPEAKER_03]: are in the guidelines that the interactivity has a greater impact on the players despite the Federal Attorney General's Office Publishing and Literature Review in September 2010 that found no evidence to support these claims.

2285
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:11,045
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be continued debate about whether the interactivity of video games has a greater impact than other forms of media and we will continue to refer to the lack of evidence to support these claims.

2286
02:47:11,465 --> 02:47:12,226
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2287
02:47:29,594 --> 02:47:47,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd make me less violent because if there's an annoying character in a movie and I want to punch him in the face, that makes me want to punch somebody in the face, whereas if I have the ability to punch him in the face in the game, then I may not have that urge to punch somebody in the face because, well, I've taken out my aggression.

2288
02:47:49,706 --> 02:47:55,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least they can have the games out there on Australia that were banned previously.

2289
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:57,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at least there's that, so...

2290
02:47:58,917 --> 02:47:59,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2291
02:48:00,738 --> 02:48:01,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2292
02:48:02,358 --> 02:48:03,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to remember.

2293
02:48:03,298 --> 02:48:12,562
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a secret email you use to upload these pictures to and I can't remember what it is because remember our site got hella spammed once so we changed it and I don't remember the address.

2294
02:48:12,602 --> 02:48:13,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie has it saved on her phone.

2295
02:48:14,942 --> 02:48:15,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap.

2296
02:48:15,202 --> 02:48:16,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a sent items folder.

2297
02:48:19,307 --> 02:48:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it be piped to the OLR Tumblr?

2298
02:48:21,228 --> 02:48:23,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think Ramna's on.

2299
02:48:23,529 --> 02:48:25,050
[SPEAKER_04]: He does that, right?

2300
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:28,972
[SPEAKER_04]: How would I search for emails that I sent to an OrangeLaunchRadio.com address?

2301
02:48:30,533 --> 02:48:32,534
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go to your sent items.

2302
02:48:34,214 --> 02:48:36,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go into your sent folder and then do the search from.

2303
02:48:36,676 --> 02:48:39,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's live radio, but I need tips on how to use my mailbag.

2304
02:48:39,797 --> 02:48:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it's not OrangeLaunchRadio because they go to Flickr.

2305
02:48:43,079 --> 02:48:43,739
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.

2306
02:48:45,126 --> 02:48:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

2307
02:48:45,727 --> 02:48:46,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's this.

2308
02:48:46,868 --> 02:48:48,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say that on air, but I think this is it.

2309
02:48:49,331 --> 02:48:49,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2310
02:48:52,215 --> 02:48:52,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's it.

2311
02:48:53,196 --> 02:48:54,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I found it.

2312
02:48:54,257 --> 02:48:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2313
02:48:54,738 --> 02:49:00,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Just host fail because I forgot the correct that they went to Flickr, not to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

2314
02:49:00,465 --> 02:49:00,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Ahem.

2315
02:49:00,866 --> 02:49:01,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Ahem.

2316
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:05,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Great live radio, huh?

2317
02:49:28,667 --> 02:49:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie Game Stand will be a place that will sell a new indie game every four days for a pay-what-you-want fee.

2318
02:49:37,857 --> 02:49:39,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty bold way to do it.

2319
02:49:39,679 --> 02:49:41,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to launch September 26th.

2320
02:49:42,321 --> 02:49:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of Steam and Desura keys will be available on the game.

2321
02:49:47,046 --> 02:49:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% of whatever you do will benefit a charity of the developer's choice.

2322
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:53,912
[SPEAKER_04]: More than 50 indie developers are signed on to this right now.

2323
02:49:53,992 --> 02:49:59,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Spiderweb Software, Cypher Prime, Digital Eel, Magical Time Beam, and so on and so on.

2324
02:49:59,794 --> 02:50:05,597
[SPEAKER_04]: If you create an account before September 26th, you will get the platformer Chester for free.

2325
02:50:06,077 --> 02:50:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: IndieGameStand.com That's pretty cool.

2326
02:50:10,279 --> 02:50:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the whole charity aspect to that as well.

2327
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:14,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty bold to do pay what you want.

2328
02:50:14,361 --> 02:50:16,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised there's no minimum whatsoever.

2329
02:50:16,422 --> 02:50:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That's... Wow.

2330
02:50:20,934 --> 02:50:23,095
[SPEAKER_04]: OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny

2331
02:50:44,480 --> 02:50:48,944
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2332
02:50:48,984 --> 02:50:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is open right now for you to send in your phone calls.

2333
02:50:55,831 --> 02:51:08,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, it's going to take me a minute to get that picture up because I need to bring up Twitters on my iPad here so we can talk about tweets to twitter.com slash OLR.

2334
02:51:09,524 --> 02:51:10,865
[SPEAKER_04]: While I bring that up... Oh, never mind.

2335
02:51:10,885 --> 02:51:11,445
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a call.

2336
02:51:12,086 --> 02:51:13,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do last-minute stories in a minute, though.

2337
02:51:13,587 --> 02:51:15,248
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we have a call on the line.

2338
02:51:15,308 --> 02:51:16,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2339
02:51:16,288 --> 02:51:16,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2340
02:51:17,449 --> 02:51:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else but Ranma?

2341
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:19,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

2342
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:20,231
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2343
02:51:21,772 --> 02:51:22,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

2344
02:51:22,812 --> 02:51:23,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2345
02:51:24,333 --> 02:51:26,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U. All right.

2346
02:51:26,534 --> 02:51:27,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it.

2347
02:51:27,355 --> 02:51:28,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U. What's up?

2348
02:51:30,277 --> 02:51:37,201
[SPEAKER_01]: The money for that Wii U is staying in my bank account because I'm not buying into that bullshit.

2349
02:51:38,285 --> 02:51:39,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty strong word, bullshit.

2350
02:51:41,347 --> 02:51:48,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Because first things first, the price that they're asking for, I think, is a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it.

2351
02:51:48,931 --> 02:51:56,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing is, they haven't even said the specs behind the Wii U. I haven't been able to find anything in regards to it.

2352
02:51:56,816 --> 02:52:04,300
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only three games that they announced that I want, and truth be told, the console can stay on the shelf until those three games come out.

2353
02:52:05,851 --> 02:52:07,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not staying on the shelves.

2354
02:52:07,453 --> 02:52:08,975
[SPEAKER_04]: They're selling out the pre-orders.

2355
02:52:10,657 --> 02:52:11,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I can wait.

2356
02:52:11,278 --> 02:52:12,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very patient person.

2357
02:52:14,483 --> 02:52:15,664
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think it would take?

2358
02:52:16,465 --> 02:52:17,326
[SPEAKER_04]: What's missing here?

2359
02:52:17,426 --> 02:52:20,911
[SPEAKER_04]: What would it take for you to say, you know what?

2360
02:52:21,292 --> 02:52:22,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm plunking the money down.

2361
02:52:22,393 --> 02:52:22,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.

2362
02:52:24,582 --> 02:52:25,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack a Mario game.

2363
02:52:26,202 --> 02:52:28,103
[SPEAKER_01]: No, forget that whole Nintendo Land stuff.

2364
02:52:28,383 --> 02:52:32,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back to the old school when the NES came with Super Mario Brothers.

2365
02:52:33,064 --> 02:52:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: When Super Nintendo came with the Super Mario Brothers game.

2366
02:52:36,005 --> 02:52:37,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they changed things around.

2367
02:52:37,485 --> 02:52:38,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back to the old school.

2368
02:52:38,565 --> 02:52:40,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in an awesome Mario title.

2369
02:52:40,746 --> 02:52:41,766
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm looking at.

2370
02:52:42,166 --> 02:52:43,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is a Mario title.

2371
02:52:44,087 --> 02:52:45,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo Land doesn't count in my book.

2372
02:52:45,907 --> 02:52:49,408
[SPEAKER_04]: What about New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever it's called?

2373
02:52:49,844 --> 02:52:50,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an extra $60.

2374
02:52:50,465 --> 02:52:58,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you've noticed, the price that they're asking for the Wii U games brings me back to the days of Super Nintendo when games were $69.99 to $79.99 a pop.

2375
02:53:02,628 --> 02:53:08,992
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf in our chatroom, you know he's one ready to challenge you on things once in a while.

2376
02:53:09,412 --> 02:53:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, you're right, it's a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it, hence why it's currently sold out of the pre-orders.

2377
02:53:16,076 --> 02:53:21,640
[SPEAKER_04]: The price of the Wii U games brings me back to the days of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

2378
02:53:23,221 --> 02:53:24,281
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to admit that's funny.

2379
02:53:25,643 --> 02:53:33,553
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I look at it, the price kind of reminds me of the PS3 when it was so expensive because they're trying to put the Blu-ray players in everybody's living room.

2380
02:53:33,573 --> 02:53:36,476
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big difference between $2.99 and $5.99 as in half.

2381
02:53:40,043 --> 02:53:47,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I'm just saying that they're trying to get everyone on the whole tablet thing, which is why the console is so expensive.

2382
02:53:47,627 --> 02:53:53,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And truth be told, as much as I enjoy the features that the tablet's going to offer, I don't need it.

2383
02:53:53,369 --> 02:53:56,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give me a Wii U, a Pro Controller, and that's it.

2384
02:53:56,711 --> 02:53:57,851
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I really want.

2385
02:54:00,552 --> 02:54:02,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess you can't get that.

2386
02:54:03,996 --> 02:54:06,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, and I see that.

2387
02:54:07,698 --> 02:54:30,628
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sad yet interesting yet funny part is, even though Nintendo's playing catch-up with all of this, even if the Wii U falls flat on their face, they will still come out on top because remember, except for the 3DS when they did a price cut on, except until recently, every console Nintendo put out has made a profit off of.

2388
02:54:33,254 --> 02:54:35,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for that whole 3DS price cut.

2389
02:54:35,556 --> 02:54:36,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very true point.

2390
02:54:37,357 --> 02:54:41,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Microsoft and PlayStation took losses on theirs, so it is interesting.

2391
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:42,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2392
02:54:44,221 --> 02:54:49,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, what will you be playing this holiday season with no Wii U in your house?

2393
02:54:50,657 --> 02:54:55,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be probably playing more games on my PS3, my 360, and a tablet that I just bought.

2394
02:54:55,980 --> 02:55:06,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're also wondering, my younger brother begged me, so I will be going with him to Nintendo World dressed as Luigi during that weekend release of the Wii U because evidently I have nothing else better to do that weekend.

2395
02:55:06,685 --> 02:55:11,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though you're not going to buy the Wii U, you're going to pull out Black Luigi just because?

2396
02:55:12,369 --> 02:55:17,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to shamelessly plug out a couple of awesome sites that I help work for.

2397
02:55:17,613 --> 02:55:18,153
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2398
02:55:18,273 --> 02:55:19,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Take some VOG flyers.

2399
02:55:21,055 --> 02:55:22,816
[SPEAKER_01]: My business cards have VOG on them.

2400
02:55:23,056 --> 02:55:24,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good, good.

2401
02:55:24,637 --> 02:55:29,120
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, the chatters are complaining because somehow you broke the stream, but here's my question.

2402
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:32,182
[SPEAKER_04]: If the internet just went down, why are we still connected on Skype?

2403
02:55:32,903 --> 02:55:36,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're supported by my awesome files connection.

2404
02:55:36,746 --> 02:55:38,807
[SPEAKER_01]: 66 megabits down and 33 megabits going up.

2405
02:55:38,887 --> 02:55:39,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't beat that.

2406
02:55:39,708 --> 02:55:39,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2407
02:55:40,028 --> 02:55:40,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the size.

2408
02:55:40,728 --> 02:55:41,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how you use it.

2409
02:55:41,949 --> 02:55:45,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye Ranma, take care buddy.

2410
02:55:45,850 --> 02:55:46,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, stay fabulous.

2411
02:55:46,991 --> 02:55:47,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, always.

2412
02:55:48,531 --> 02:55:52,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lawn Tradio if you want to give us a call.

2413
02:55:53,633 --> 02:55:54,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get that picture up.

2414
02:55:56,273 --> 02:55:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to do?

2415
02:55:58,735 --> 02:56:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to mention there was a few things.

2416
02:56:01,636 --> 02:56:07,238
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an article I saw about the whole multiplayer, or the Just Cause 2 multiplayer project.

2417
02:56:08,178 --> 02:56:11,019
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got up to 1,800 people playing on one server.

2418
02:56:12,039 --> 02:56:15,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all fan done, you know, kind of talking a little bit about Black Mesa stuff.

2419
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:18,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, multiplayer in a game that doesn't have multiplayer.

2420
02:56:18,801 --> 02:56:20,862
[SPEAKER_03]: They have 1,800 people on that goddamn server.

2421
02:56:22,303 --> 02:56:23,604
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty impressive.

2422
02:56:24,766 --> 02:56:29,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also Black Ops 2 is supposed to have a zombie campaign, like as in a single player campaign.

2423
02:56:29,631 --> 02:56:30,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

2424
02:56:32,370 --> 02:56:34,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else?

2425
02:56:34,171 --> 02:56:40,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to mention I had actually, because I'm on Kickstarter a lot, I tweeted about this.

2426
02:56:40,915 --> 02:56:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a game called Rhythm Destruction.

2427
02:56:43,216 --> 02:56:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a game that's a cross between a shmup and a rhythm game and features music by Kyle Ward.

2428
02:56:51,761 --> 02:56:56,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to check that out, check out Rhythm Destruction on Kickstarter.

2429
02:56:56,743 --> 02:56:59,645
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got 18 days left, five bucks net to the game.

2430
02:56:59,945 --> 02:57:00,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not bad.

2431
02:57:01,986 --> 02:57:08,393
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's including, I think, a Steam key and they're supposed to be bringing that out, I think, on Xbox Indie games as well.

2432
02:57:08,493 --> 02:57:10,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It does support an Xbox 360 controller.

2433
02:57:10,636 --> 02:57:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also on Steam Greenlight.

2434
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:16,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2435
02:57:16,061 --> 02:57:19,305
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open.

2436
02:57:21,823 --> 02:57:22,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

2437
02:57:22,344 --> 02:57:28,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I was responding to folks in the chat room, apparently about the breaking of our stream or what have you.

2438
02:57:29,070 --> 02:57:34,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the Indie Games, or Indie Royale, they have a back-to-school bundle that's out with seven games.

2439
02:57:35,537 --> 02:57:36,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay what you want.

2440
02:57:37,499 --> 02:57:42,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Includes Lunar Flight, Bunny Must Die, Chelsea, and The Seven Devils.

2441
02:57:45,606 --> 02:57:54,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Clion, FlyingRedBarrel, Sequence, CuteThingsDyingViolently, and an 18-track chiptune album, Bias.

2442
02:58:04,597 --> 02:58:06,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, going to some tweet topics real quick.

2443
02:58:07,079 --> 02:58:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I want to say Bobby Blackwolf, who sent us a tweet to a story about how LittleBigPlanet Vita's street date was lifted.

2444
02:58:13,825 --> 02:58:14,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a jerk.

2445
02:58:15,707 --> 02:58:17,188
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, we already addressed this.

2446
02:58:17,729 --> 02:58:18,970
[SPEAKER_04]: The street date was lifted.

2447
02:58:19,711 --> 02:58:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony says retailers can begin selling the game once they receive copies.

2448
02:58:22,873 --> 02:58:25,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently my local Target didn't receive copies.

2449
02:58:25,416 --> 02:58:27,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So this news is still false, as far as I'm concerned.

2450
02:58:29,183 --> 02:58:30,484
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw sends us some tweets.

2451
02:58:31,465 --> 02:58:34,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this was really sad, and it does have a tie-in to the gaming world.

2452
02:58:35,467 --> 02:58:37,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if, well, hopefully you heard about this.

2453
02:58:37,469 --> 02:58:40,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you're not that shut off to the world around you, but there was a U.S.

2454
02:58:40,351 --> 02:58:46,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Embassy attack that happened in Libya, and it took the lives of a few people, and one of them was this huge EVE Online player.

2455
02:58:46,795 --> 02:58:49,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Like apparently he was really big in the EVE Online community.

2456
02:58:49,518 --> 02:58:56,486
[SPEAKER_04]: His nickname in the community was Vile Rat, but he was known to his friends and family also as Sean Smith.

2457
02:58:56,907 --> 02:59:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately he died in that senseless attack this week that was...

2458
02:59:02,313 --> 02:59:03,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Very unfortunate.

2459
02:59:04,774 --> 02:59:07,034
[SPEAKER_04]: The EVE community is grieving his loss.

2460
02:59:07,054 --> 02:59:15,497
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that over the years, Vile Rat rose to become one of the most well-known and respected diplomats for one of the most powerful alliances in EVE.

2461
02:59:15,897 --> 02:59:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: He was instrumental in shaping the universe we all play in today.

2462
02:59:19,958 --> 02:59:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Chairman Mark Hurd on the CSM behalf.

2463
02:59:24,179 --> 02:59:27,240
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the Council of Stellar Management for EVE Online.

2464
02:59:28,040 --> 02:59:48,986
[SPEAKER_04]: there you go uh very sad very sad um moving on another link from Tiger Claw uh consoles lacking in an important functionality for MMOs I want to see what this is about because I don't know this one so he sent us a story from GameSpot that talks about I don't want to see this give me this one here

2465
02:59:51,232 --> 02:59:53,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my iPad's acting up and not showing me the right story there.

2466
02:59:53,713 --> 02:59:57,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to call in.

2467
02:59:59,655 --> 03:00:06,518
[SPEAKER_04]: The VP of Publishing at Wargaming.net says, Long approval times on consoles are restricting development of MMOs.

2468
03:00:06,978 --> 03:00:10,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, they would be there if manufacturers made it easier for developers.

2469
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:17,622
[SPEAKER_04]: This is according to Andre Yaren...

2470
03:00:19,302 --> 03:00:24,826
[SPEAKER_04]: and Yaran Sao, who is at the World of Tanks World Championship Final.

2471
03:00:25,287 --> 03:00:27,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, have you heard about that MMO, World of Tanks?

2472
03:00:28,289 --> 03:00:28,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of that.

2473
03:00:28,809 --> 03:00:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of that before, too.

2474
03:00:29,910 --> 03:00:31,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be, like, massive.

2475
03:00:32,171 --> 03:00:41,458
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pimping it out over at the air show I went to, World of Tanks, and there's also some other one, World of War, or World of Planes or something.

2476
03:00:41,718 --> 03:00:42,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a quote.

2477
03:00:42,479 --> 03:00:43,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm reading this article.

2478
03:00:43,559 --> 03:00:47,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sight-reading this article for the first time because of the tweet we got from Tigerclaw.

2479
03:00:47,962 --> 03:00:53,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Consoles are a nice, attractive part of the market because there are no really well-known MMOs there, and the install base is huge.

2480
03:00:53,927 --> 03:00:57,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you know, the consoles are still lacking in important functionality.

2481
03:00:57,529 --> 03:01:01,872
[SPEAKER_04]: In MMOs, it is very important for developers to have a fast reaction time for the service.

2482
03:01:02,332 --> 03:01:09,477
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a big company like Sony or Microsoft, then the approval time for release candidates is so, so long, you can't change the game immediately."

2483
03:01:10,939 --> 03:01:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So interesting, kind of blaming the console development cycle for the reason that MMOs aren't coming out.

2484
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:29,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Square Enix might have something to say about that when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn, or whatever they're calling it, which is still coming out later this year, as far as I know, or at least it's going into testing.

2485
03:01:30,746 --> 03:01:33,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zaku in our chatroom reminds us about Final Fantasy XI.

2486
03:01:34,647 --> 03:01:40,910
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt, lastly on Twitter, wanted to remind us about the Bungie Ferret Tossing soundtrack, but I already plugged that earlier.

2487
03:01:41,670 --> 03:01:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it for tweets.

2488
03:01:43,231 --> 03:01:45,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last-minute stories, Logie?

2489
03:01:47,556 --> 03:01:48,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it.

2490
03:01:49,699 --> 03:01:50,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2491
03:01:50,721 --> 03:01:55,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Skyflying's not looking too popular tonight, so unfortunately I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.

2492
03:01:57,348 --> 03:02:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think of something later on, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be a great place to send an email to.

2493
03:02:02,352 --> 03:02:08,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But the show's running a little long anyway because we had a very long first half.

2494
03:02:09,138 --> 03:02:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's about time to wrap things up anyway.

2495
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:13,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, thank you for being here tonight as always.

2496
03:02:13,962 --> 03:02:17,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you filling in even though you feel like you have to do it apparently.

2497
03:02:18,145 --> 03:02:20,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't ask you next time then and see how you feel.

2498
03:02:21,428 --> 03:02:22,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy Black Mesa and all that.

2499
03:02:23,510 --> 03:02:25,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

2500
03:02:27,113 --> 03:02:29,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicken.

2501
03:02:29,855 --> 03:02:36,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to remind everybody that this show is free and we don't ask for much, but please tell a friend or two about the show.

2502
03:02:36,461 --> 03:02:37,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word, word of mouth.

2503
03:02:37,682 --> 03:02:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show and support independent podcasting, especially those shows at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

2504
03:02:49,512 --> 03:02:52,934
[SPEAKER_04]: We love being a part of this indie network that helps to bring...

2505
03:02:53,695 --> 03:03:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The voices of gamers everywhere to you even when they're being shy like they are tonight Ranma's not shy though at least, we know that Loki, thank you as always for being here and enjoy the Skylanders purse and the points more importantly that maybe can buy you something you'll actually be using but any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

2506
03:03:15,374 --> 03:03:27,252
[SPEAKER_03]: play on our Minecraft server if you haven't done that yet because it's awesome and you should check it out and then of course on Tuesday play Borderlands 2 with me because I need someone to play with

2507
03:03:28,596 --> 03:03:31,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought tonight is, yes, play those games.

2508
03:03:31,258 --> 03:03:34,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Play World of Warcraft and listen to Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

2509
03:03:35,281 --> 03:03:38,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're extifer, play Guild Wars 2 and still be on a Warcraft podcast.

2510
03:03:39,485 --> 03:03:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to that and also play Bungie Ferret Tossing tomorrow on Xbox Live Indie Games.

2511
03:03:46,470 --> 03:03:47,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Very exciting.

2512
03:03:47,971 --> 03:03:48,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, guys.

2513
03:03:48,831 --> 03:03:51,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2514
03:03:51,292 --> 03:03:52,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, as always, for tuning in.

2515
03:03:52,833 --> 03:03:56,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, we will not be live Sunday next week.

2516
03:03:56,434 --> 03:03:59,515
[SPEAKER_04]: However, a new episode will still be playing on the feed.

2517
03:03:59,895 --> 03:04:01,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast listeners, nothing will change for you.

2518
03:04:01,895 --> 03:04:03,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll still have a new show next week because I'm out of town.

2519
03:04:03,896 --> 03:04:05,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to remind everybody of that.

2520
03:04:05,556 --> 03:04:10,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back live in two weeks with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2521
03:04:10,978 --> 03:04:12,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be in two weeks, episode number 475.

2522
03:04:14,719 --> 03:04:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We're climbing on up.

2523
03:04:15,761 --> 03:04:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on up.

2524
03:04:17,623 --> 03:04:18,144
[SPEAKER_04]: 500's almost here.

2525
03:04:18,685 --> 03:04:19,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

2526
03:04:19,846 --> 03:04:20,107
