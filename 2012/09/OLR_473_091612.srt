00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,840
Tonight, September 16th, 2012, the Wii U launch details are official, Zynga files a counterclaim

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:29,840
against EA, and is Microsoft planning an immersive display experience for their next console?

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,560
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 473 for

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,920
Sunday, September 16th, 2012. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,640
next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and gaming

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,160
lols with my co-host, not with us tonight, sadly, the one, the only, Dark Sakura. She

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,120
has the night off, it is a holiday in her religion, so a happy Rosh Hashanah to those

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,400
of you that celebrate it. We do have here tonight, though, in-studio, Techmaster Loki

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
joining us.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hello.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
How are you, Loki?

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm doing alright.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
Awesome. And joining us in Jamie's absence, always a wonderful stand-by guest host we're

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,120
happy to have here, as if he had a choice, say hello to Alan.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Hello.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
How are you doing, Alan?

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Good.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,120
What's new with you lately?

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,640
Not much, working a lot.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Yeah? Have you had time for any hobbies outside of video gaming and work?

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
No.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
No?

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
No.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
What else do you do on the interwebs?

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Tumblers.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Tumblers, you're a big Tumblr fan?

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Yes.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,400
Why do you like Tumblr? I have a hard time getting into Tumblr.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,880
Because for like funny reaction gifs and fandom stuff and screenshots, that's where everyone

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,040
fits into that.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
There was an amazing-

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Is on there.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,740
There was an amazing gif I saw on Tumblr last night that was, it said, starships are meant

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,880
to fly and it was an old lady going up one of those moving chairs. I guess you had to

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
see it.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,400
All right. Anyhow, all right. We'll talk to Alan Moore as the show goes on. We do of course

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,280
tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOG Network. VOGnetwork.com

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,440
is the place to be. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,080
Another quality show from Bobby tonight. And we even got into a little bit of a debate

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,280
at the end there on a topic we'll be talking about here shortly. And you can check that

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,200
out at VOGnetwork.com when Bobby posts his show very soon. But you should be participating

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,920
live. You can also participate with us and chat in our chat room, live.VOGnetwork.com

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,040
where we have some good, some good well wishes tonight. Rama saying l'chaim SSG100 mad. Happy

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,200
new year. So some other well wishes there for those celebrating the holiday today.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,280
All right. We're going to break form a little bit tonight. We're going to get right into

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,460
some news tonight. Obviously there was huge news this week. Let's address that pink elephant

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
in the room.

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,680
It's the transforce four. I know it's amazing. It's going to be fantastic. And I can't wait

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
to play it.

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Not quite the same thing I had in mind, but all right. Uh, we're going to go to a clip

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,400
here. I want to start with this clip. It's a two minute clip. This is a clip from our

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,840
show episode four 63 from July 1st. Let's go to the clip. The Wii U, uh, I think is

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,900
a reasonable price. It's got a few reasonable prices. Actually. There's three different

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,860
skews they're going to be launching with. What's in those skews? No idea. Uh, what I

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,200
think they are, I'll get into in a second. So the cheapest you're going to find a Wii

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:34,280
U will be $249.99. So there's that. The next price up $299.99 and then $349.99 are the

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,480
three different price points. Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,400
speculative. I don't know for a fact this is what it is. Um, $249.99 is going to get

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,600
you a Wii U system with the game pad controller and that's it. So system, game pad. It's basically

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,000
you own a Wii right now. You have all this, you know, Wii remotes and... Go on the online

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,280
shop and enjoy. Yeah, nunchucks. Done. There you go. You've got a system. You're ready

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,600
to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U. $299.99 buys you a system

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,640
that's going to have the Wii U game pad and then additional Wii remote plus and a nunchuck.

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,400
Kind of like, you know, the Wii hat. And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,040
game pad controller, the Wii remote plus, the nunchuck, and another pack-in game. Because

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land. It just seems like such a pack-in

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,760
type game that I think they're going to do that. Honestly, I do not think they're launching

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,320
the system with two game pads because there's no games that support it and people will be

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,240
like, it won't sell. That may come later on when they have, you know, games that support

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,200
two game pads but right now it's absolutely useless to do that which is why they're not

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,840
going to do that. Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,240
the price points and release date in September but there are the price points. Release date

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,920
is probably going to be the 18th of November. So that's that. I think it's somewhat reasonable.

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,680
That again, a clip, it's done. The clip was from episode 463 on July 1st, 2012. Let me

76
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,160
start by applauding you. Honestly, clap, clap, clap. Show me anyone else that was that close.

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,420
Was it perfect? No. You did make one major flaw. Let's talk about the flaw. Where was

78
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,840
the different, obviously, $299.349 ended up being legit. You called multiple SKUs. The

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,200
Wii did not, well, multiple bundles. People don't like it when you say SKU. Multiple bundles,

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,640
you called that. We didn't have that but Wii U does. You did call that. You missed the

81
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,000
boat on there being this $249 bundle. Why do you think that happened? I think it happened

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,240
for a few reasons. One, three SKUs would be too confusing for the consumers or the average

83
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
consumers. People wouldn't know what to buy. They'd be like, okay, am I supposed to get

84
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,720
the $299 one, the $349 one, $249? It's just too confusing for the populace. That's why

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,920
they only launched the two SKUs for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. No one does more

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,720
than two SKUs because it's too confusing. I also think they can't get the cost that

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,740
low. They couldn't get the cost of the system to be $249 so they just dropped that bottom

88
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:24,000
SKU because I think that's why they haven't announced the price until now. It's because

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,400
they didn't know what the system was going to cost. They were trying to get that cost

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
down and probably at one point they did have the packing controllers and stuff but it was

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,440
just too expensive for them. Well, we know about what that tablet cost thanks to the

92
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,480
Japanese Nintendo Direct and I think what was the price? It would translate it to somewhere

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,700
around $150 US for just the tablet. That's a lot higher than I would have thought because

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,640
to me that thing isn't much more than the bottom half of a DS except a little bigger.

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,880
Let's say a DS XL. I guess maybe it's a little bigger than that too. I was kind of surprised

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,240
it's got to go that high and that certainly would set off a chain of events that would

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,360
cause the $249 bundle to get eliminated. Well, even their reasoning behind not having remotes

98
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,520
and nunchucks in there, they're like, well, there's 100 million remotes or like 10 million

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,080
remotes out there or something like that. I think it's 100 million remotes out there.

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,240
We don't need to include that because you probably already have one. Cool. You're talking

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,200
to somebody that owns a Wii system. What if I don't own a Wii system? Then I don't have

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,360
one. So I got to spend all this extra money to buy those. Well, to be fair, what about

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,200
the secondhand market? There's going to be tons of that stuff floating around as people

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,320
are... Yeah, but secondhand market's going to be... I don't think it's going to be a

105
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,080
lot of those remote pluses. I think it's going to be the remotes and then you got to buy

106
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,880
Wii Motion Plus to plug into that thing because they don't sell those anymore and a lot of

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,920
people trade in their old remotes to buy the Wii Motion Plus enabled remote pluses. But

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,460
I think, like I said, that they cut the bottom skew just because they couldn't get the price

109
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,160
cheap enough. Well, still, I mean, despite the fact that, you know, that part didn't

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,800
end up being true and you even said in that clip you were kind of pulling what was in

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,240
those bundles out of your ass and you still kind of got the $349 one right. You were pretty

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,360
cool. I mean, there's a part in that clip I cut out where I went on this... I'm like,

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,480
I think the $349 bundle will have two Wii tablets and dah, dah, dah. What was I wrong?

114
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,920
That's another reason why you're not, well, you're not seeing two tablets because one

115
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,840
no game support. You're not seeing them sell the tablets separately because... Here. Once

116
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,300
again, well, not here, because people will be confused and they'll think, oh, this is

117
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,640
just an add-on for the Wii. I'm going to buy the tablet and they go home and it doesn't

118
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,400
fucking work in my Wii. Why does this work? This tablet's the Wii U, right? No, it's not.

119
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,340
So you have to, you just have to think about the consumer and, you know, whether they're

120
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,580
going to be confused by what you're trying to sell to them.

121
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,120
GioVidea agrees with you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and puts it into slightly

122
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,320
different words. The secondhand market comes from people upgrading as well. You need those

123
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,000
parts even if you upgrade, so there isn't going to be a huge market. I suppose that's

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,080
true. People are going to need those Wiimotes and things for the new system if they want

125
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,300
to play all the games. Nintendo Land, the pack-in game, that's the weird thing to me,

126
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,580
that it isn't coming with another Wiimote because doesn't Nintendo Land's mini games

127
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,420
kind of require those Wiimotes? I think they're all multiplayer games. A better pack-in game

128
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,320
would have been the new Super Mario Brothers U. Now I understand why they did Nintendo

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
Land because Nintendo Land's like Wii Play, Wii Sports, whatever, it's basically tech

130
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,960
demos to get you familiar with how you use the controllers and stuff like that. But it's

131
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,360
also a multiplayer game, so if you buy it for your kid or something like that and you

132
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,720
don't have a Wii, well, sucks to be you and you're not going to be playing very much of

133
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,120
it because you've got to go get those extra controllers and stuff. And it gets confusing

134
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,720
I think because you've got all these different control methods with this thing. You've got

135
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,080
the remotes, the nunchucks, the classic controllers, the pro controllers, this tablet thing, you've

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,680
got the balance board and just figuring out what you need for each game. Oh, nunchucks

137
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,260
with everything too. It's just going to get confusing. It's interesting. There is a lot.

138
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,000
There's a lot of peripherals over in Nintendo Land, that's for sure. Chris109 in our chat

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,600
at live.fognetwork.com says, my sister was thinking that the Wii U pad was just an add-on

140
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,280
and that you write a U next to the, and it got cut off, but I'm assuming next to the

141
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,840
word, Wii. So maybe not everybody is still, I mean, Jimmy Fallon, I was going to reference

142
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,360
that clip too. There was that big clip a couple months ago where, you know, even Jimmy Fallon

143
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,880
didn't get it and Reggie had to kind of hold on. It's a whole new system, but you know,

144
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,140
you can sit there and be a skeptic. I can sit there and be a skeptic. I'm not sure where

145
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,160
Alan's at, but we'll ask him in a little bit. The fact of the matter is pre-orders are going

146
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,000
fast as we have a story coming up later on. As we have to take the word from Nintendo

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,200
that they're going fast. Well, if you try to go to GameStop yourself, they're not going

148
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,800
to give you one right now. Well, that's because Nintendo tells GameStop how many they can

149
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,440
sell. But we don't know what that number is. Of course not, because they want to make it

150
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,240
sound like it's in high demand, like they do with the Wii. Remember all those artificial,

151
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm sorry, real life shortages. Totally not artificial shortages whatsoever. Well, to

152
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,660
be fair, Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox 360 launch. I distinctly remember

153
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,440
how long it took to find a stinkin' 360, trying to go on and check Best Buy's inventory every

154
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,800
day. That crap was madness. Okay, yeah, that may have lasted for a few months. Nintendo's

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,720
Wii launch lasted for a few years that they did that, okay? It wasn't even, you know,

156
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,040
a few months. It was, okay, we got our supply line taken care of in a couple months, but

157
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,400
the Wii, it was just like, oh, it's so hard to get, it's so hard to get, it's the must-have

158
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,720
toy for, you know, your kids. I don't know, whatever, you know, I'm skeptical. There's

159
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,640
some talk about the things that the Wii U could be leaving out. Tigerclaw in our chat

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,640
at live.vognetwork.com says, the only thing you have to take into account is the Wii U

161
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,840
is not GameCube compatible, so if you still play your GameCube games, you'll need to keep

162
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,080
that Wii. Or find a GameCube, to be fair. You could find a GameCube, but it's cheap.

163
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Nowadays, Wiis aren't compatible with GameCube either. And that's right. Sj100matt followed

164
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,800
up saying they dropped GameCube controller compatibility in new Wii models, so I wouldn't

165
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,520
expect it on the Wii U. He left out the part about the games don't play in the new Wii

166
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,800
models either, but certainly the controllers aren't there either. You know, I'm surprised

167
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,760
that the system doesn't do, I guess I understand why they don't do it, so they can do their

168
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,720
own HD remakes and stuff, but I'm surprised, you know, since you can play these games on

169
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,280
your PC and emulator and HD and stuff, that it wouldn't be that hard to, you know, take

170
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,600
the old games and kind of upgrade them a little bit. And hell, I mean, even the Playstation

171
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,120
3 does that with Playstation 2 games and Playstation 1 games. To a little bit of, you know, smaller

172
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,520
extent they kind of smooth them out a little bit. And even like, you know, the Xbox 360

173
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,800
did that with the Xbox games, it kind of smoothed it out a little bit to make it look a little

174
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,920
bit nicer. But I'm surprised they don't do that with the Wii stuff. It's just, you would

175
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,320
think that would be kind of a cool selling point. Hey, all your games look better now.

176
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
I mean, because that might even be a way to get people to purchase one if they're not

177
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
going to.

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, we'll talk a little bit more when we get into the news segment of our show, the

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,920
official news segment of our show, on some more of the details with the Wii. There's

180
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,760
some pretty big ones we're leaving out right now, but we'll come back to it in the official

181
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,360
news segment, talk a little more about it, see where everybody here in studio is on if

182
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,120
they're going to get one or not, and then later when we get into the Fugu question

183
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,980
of the week, and throughout the show with our chatters, we'll see where the listeners

184
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,920
are at with do they want to Wii U or not, because obviously this is kind of a very polarizing

185
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,440
thing in the gaming world right now. Very back and forth on Twitter. Lots of fanboys,

186
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,680
lots of anti-fanboys, a few people in the middle, but not a lot.

187
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,880
I did, though, want to take a second to say, though, again, congrats, because you nailed

188
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,640
the date back in July before any other rumor was out there. A lot of people jumped on the

189
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,400
November train the closer we got here to the September conference, but you nailed it, so

190
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
props to you.

191
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Yes, thank you, EpicMickey2, because that was the giveaway, considering that they're

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,120
launching EpicMickey2 on all SKUs on the 18th. Disney never launches a game on Sunday. They

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,160
never do that, so it was pretty obvious.

194
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,520
That was your hint right there. Well, whatever it was, props to you, because I didn't hear

195
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,040
anybody else get as close as you did, even some top industry analysts.

196
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,520
But that's all right, because no one noticed.

197
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,480
All right, let's move on into our gaming weeks. Obviously, there's no chance to play a Wii

198
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,840
U just yet, so we've been playing some other stuff to pass the time. Alan, I haven't heard

199
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,280
from you a lot yet, so let's start with you tonight. How was your gaming week? What have

200
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
you been up to?

201
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Amazing.

202
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Yeah?

203
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,720
Black Mesa Soars. It's so good, I lost my mind. It is so good.

204
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,840
All right, back up a little bit. For those that may not know, what is Black Mesa Soars?

205
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,160
It is a eight years in the making fan project to completely remake Half Life 1 and the Half

206
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Life 2 source engine with completely new HD assets, new voice acting, new face models.

207
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,680
It is indistinguishable from something that Valve could have made themselves. It is that

208
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
good.

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
That's a pretty good endorsement right there.

210
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Yes.

211
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,600
Can I read an email you sent me earlier in the week, if I can dig it up?

212
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah.

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Dear Rob, I love you, XOXO. No, I'm just kidding.

214
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
That's not true.

215
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay. Let's see. Where is it? Where is that one you sent me? Oh, this is great radio,

216
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,480
isn't it? I think you just sent it to me. Okay, here it is. I think this mod may be

217
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,080
the greatest accomplishment a fandom has ever produced for a franchise. I'm serious. There

218
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,000
are tons of little added ambient dialogue bits and everything is professional. It is

219
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,760
literally indistinguishable, italicized, from something Valve could have made themselves.

220
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,800
This is not a mod. This is a wholesale creation that had the added benefit of model to reference.

221
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,440
These developers deserve college scholarships or offer letters from Valve. And I'll be

222
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,080
angry if Gabe Newell doesn't make some kind of statement by the end of the month acknowledging

223
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,160
how fucking good this is. They perfectly mimic the lobby of Black Mesa that is referenced

224
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,120
from the more recent Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that of course looks nothing like the same

225
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,720
room in the 98 original. Anyone who still complains this took eight years to make is

226
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
a fool.

227
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm allowed to have some hyperbole in my emails to my boyfriend, thank you. I was very

228
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
heated.

229
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Well, it certainly got the point across. But I mean, for something you didn't pay any

230
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
money for, you felt very... Well, I mean, it's a positive review.

231
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,200
When the game loads up and you're on that monorail going through all of the extra rooms

232
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,920
and shit they added, I had to pause it in like two places and be like, what the fuck

233
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,720
am I looking at? This is like, this is incredible. It's just like what the trailer was that came

234
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,920
out in 09. But better, it's... Half-Life in itself is a fucking awesome game. And this

235
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,760
just complete for a fan project has blown my mind.

236
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,400
Well, and despite, you know, what you said in your email about college scholarships and

237
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Gabe Newell should essentially give them big hugs and what have you, you have to admit

238
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,680
it is pretty impressive. Valve themselves said, cool, just don't call it Half-Life and

239
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
we're good.

240
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,440
You know, don't infringe on the trademark and we're good. In fact, we'll help you distribute

242
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
it on Steam.

243
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah, it's on Greenlight.

244
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
For free.

245
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
It's on Greenlight. Yeah.

246
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
It is free. That's huge.

247
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,040
You just have to own any source game. If you own a fucking Portal game, you can get this.

248
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,640
Which they've given away for free.

249
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Yes. So, Portal I think is the most accessible title that you would have that you could play

250
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,280
this with or Left 4 Dead because Left 4 Dead is also crazy popular.

251
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,880
Now, what about, can't you download the client for Team Fortress 2 since that's Source 2,

252
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
isn't it?

253
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Yeah, that could also be it too.

254
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
And that is free.

255
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Yeah.

256
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Aha. Loki working the system, like usual.

257
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,160
So yeah, you asked me, am I ever going to play Half-Life, either Half-Life the original

258
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,440
or Half-Life Source? No, there's no reason to because Black Mesa Source is there.

259
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,680
That's a big endorsement from a Half-Life fan like you.

260
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Yes.

261
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,560
So now the next question, where the fuck is Half-Life 3?

262
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Well, this is...

263
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Another eight years.

264
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,640
Yeah, I know. And there are people that are, there are people on the forums kind of being

265
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,000
smart asses, but they're right saying, when I legitimately thought that this fan project

266
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,480
was vaporware, I had a little voice in the back of my head that said, even if this is

267
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,000
vaporware, we're still going to see this before Half-Life 3. And those people are all right.

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,360
Amazing. Going to our chat, Tigerclaw saying, I was hoping somebody would talk about Black

269
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,400
Mesa. I heard Black Mesa doesn't have Xen.

270
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,440
That is true. They announced that two weeks ago when they finally put up the release date,

271
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,480
the seven-day counter. This is real. Xen was probably one of the first, one of the worst

272
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,560
parts of the original game. It's the last chapter. It's the last 10% of the game. You're

273
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,440
in an alien dimension. Gravity is weird. It's got all these weird platforming bullshit puzzles

274
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,280
in it for a first-person shooter. You don't really want to do that. It's probably the

275
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,080
biggest misstep in the original game. The Black Mesa source developer said, we are putting

276
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:30,320
out 90% of the game once you enter the portal to go into Xen. I haven't gotten there yet,

277
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,040
but I imagine there's a screen that's like, we're saving your game. This is going to be

278
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,680
patched in. They haven't, of course, they, these people are terrified of giving deadlines,

279
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,520
but they're like, it is coming. We're working on Xen. It's mostly done. Xen is just, Xen's

280
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,400
coming later and that's the end of the game.

281
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,120
Yeah. Dungeon Buster in chat says it's not finished yet. Everything's remade up to Lambda

282
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,640
Core, but they figured they'd release what they have now and the rest later. Breakman

283
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,680
asks, Jesus, did he play the game or marry it? No shame. I don't care. You know, and

284
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,720
I think the part here we don't want to overlook very important point. Valve didn't do this.

285
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,760
Valve embraced it, but they didn't do it. Fans did it. Think about that. What has your

286
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
fandom accomplished?

287
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:23,100
The, they, well, they added women to, cause the, in the original game, all the security

288
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,880
guards and scientists are just men just because it's only two or three different models, right?

289
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,220
They added women. There's the guards and the scientists. There's like 16 unique face models

290
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,000
so that when you come across these NPCs, like, Oh, this is like a new person. It's all of

291
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,920
the, the, the added voice acting of just the guards being killed by monsters running around

292
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,400
that you encounter. It sounds like they found the original people from the first game and

293
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
they just added all these lines of dialogue. It's, it's crazy what they did with this.

294
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
So props to the folks who put this together. Certainly. Uh, it's, it's hard to make an

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,600
argument not to go download this right now. Correct? It's a classic game, free. They,

296
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,520
they made some little changes to the maps because obviously someone like I've, I've

297
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,040
beaten the original half-life maybe eight times from start to finish so I could zerg

298
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,560
my way through it. But I'm like, Oh, they added this area or, Oh, they changed. They,

299
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,400
they closed this door that I used to go into and I have to go over here and this is all

300
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,480
new. So they know that they added their own little, they added their own little spice

301
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
to it.

302
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,760
Dungeon buster at live.vognetwork.com says black Mesa's really great work. Glad they

303
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,040
kept the, or glad they kept the faith to continue with it for so long. Very good point as well.

304
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,400
Consider what happened to them in 09 where they came out, they said Q3 or Q4 of 09, it's

305
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,940
going to happen. They realized the parts that they had left the program were the hardest

306
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,700
parts. They had at least a year's worth of work left to do. And they made a design decision

307
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,320
to basically cut out huge chunks of the game that they didn't know how to code. And once

308
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,200
010 or once 2010 hit, they're like, okay, now that we've take, now that we've cut all

309
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,080
of this shit out because it was too hard for us to do, we're now embarrassed by this and

310
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
we don't want to put it out like this.

311
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,880
So they're like, fuck it. Media blackout. They took down their Twitter or they just,

312
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,240
they stopped updating their Twitter and their YouTube and they're like, we're going to put

313
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,600
all this shit back in however long it takes us to do it. And it took until September of

314
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
this year.

315
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,040
Wow. Still, that's amazing dedication because that sort of demotivation would have killed

316
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,560
a lot of people. Yeah. It's very impressive what fan communities do. You know, we've seen

317
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,560
a lot of these stories throughout the years. I can remember way back when there was the

318
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,000
fan translation of final fantasy five for emulators. Remember that back in the day before

319
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,920
there was a PlayStation release three, I think was the first one, right? The next one. Cause

320
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,320
that's the first game we didn't get.

321
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,120
Uh, no, I think five got the translation first. Three came soon afterwards. Okay. Cause I

322
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,480
think the NES was harder to patch or something. I don't know. Um, I also remember second at

323
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
sets with three was the other huge, huge one that they did the fan translation for. Uh,

324
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,240
and then of course I remember the, um, don't call it King's quest, but the silver lining

325
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,400
name that was heavily inspired by King's quest at one time was called King's quest nine,

326
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,440
but like Black Mesa, they had to take the King's quest out of their name to avoid the

327
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,760
legal situation they had found themselves in. So it's really impressive what a lot of

328
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,600
like fan communities have accomplished. And I'm like, would I be that motivated to do

329
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,400
anything like that? Oh yeah. I have had a podcast for 10 years. I guess that's kind

330
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,320
of cool, but this shit's easy. Black Mesa. I don't think that was nearly as easy. So

331
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,520
that's, that's, you know, major props. So, well, what else in your gaming week? Anything

332
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
else?

333
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,480
Um, tinkered around with a little wow. Checking out the, the balance changes and the class

334
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,960
changes to my druid. She was my main and I haven't really played as much wow as I should.

335
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,560
And then, um, mass effect three multiplayer a little bit. They had a multiplayer weekend

336
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,560
last little bit, a little bit the last weekend when they had their, um, every other week

337
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,600
they do, um, log in and do this squad challenge and you get like a free rare all elite weapon

338
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,240
on Wednesday or whatever. I completely spaced it because I'm like, what level are you in

339
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,240
mass effect three multiple? My N seven score. It's like about six 80 and then I'll still

340
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,280
log in and in a match with someone with an N seven score of like 8,000 I'm like, you

341
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,280
know what? I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad. They're sharing their account. That's

342
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,680
what's going on there. All right. Um, anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

343
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,160
No, that's it. Let's go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, I played lots of

344
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:31,560
Minecraft. I've been just building this massive, massive, massive castle on the VOG network

345
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,880
server, which you should join by the way, if you haven't already. It's pretty fun. Get

346
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,240
a few people on there. Um, I see a few people on that fucking castle. You're building is

347
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,440
astounding. That I could see that all the way from my little house. That's like a ways

348
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,040
away. I can't believe we're talking about a fake world, but my house is like all the

349
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,280
way away. The one that some smart ass nut man to put four foreclosure signs all over.

350
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,120
Did I show you that? Yeah. Little troll. And you know what? Sad as I took retribution on

351
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,920
the wrong house because I'm like, Loki, who fucking did that? You're the server admin.

352
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Tell me who did it. And you're like, I think it was the guys up on the Hill from you, which

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,700
is like Logan 89 or something. And I would, there's some people I can't, like there's

354
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,560
some like I don't see them on the map. Like not man. I haven't seen actually play, but

355
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,080
there's like a few spots cause I need everybody to start like post. I mean, if you haven't

356
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,040
already like put a sign out front of your house. So I know who's it is cause there's

357
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,920
like a bunch of spots. Like I had my coworker is the worst. He keeps starting new places.

358
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,920
He's like, I want to build in this Island. I'm like, you already have four fucking houses.

359
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,480
I'm breaking all of them. If you don't fucking, you know, pick a spot, pick a spot and stick

360
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,240
to it. And like the other day he's like, I think I'm going to build over here. I'm like,

361
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,760
no, you're not. You're building where you fucking said before. And I actually had to

362
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,400
go in there and like I switched it up to creative to go and destroy his like other houses they

363
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,280
built because they were, I don't want all these like half built things. Well, I will

364
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,440
let nut man know the banker that I have started digging up clay from all the lakes I can find

365
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,400
and started baking some bricks so I can make a house out of brick. So go pick on the guys

366
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,000
up on top of the Hill who also have a stone house or go try to foreclose Loki's cows.

367
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,840
I know it's all in good fun. I'm not really mad. I laughed. I really did laugh. I made

368
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,880
a gate on my castle that works with pistons. Although I came back to it today and it was

369
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,800
all glitched out so I had to fix it again. But so surprisingly fun Minecraft multiplayer

370
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
and all that get on this, get on the fog server right now. The reason why I haven't checked

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,760
out the server yet is that I hadn't played it in so long. They went from patch one, two,

372
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,160
five to one, three, two. Yeah. And a lot of my, I don't say my mods are broken cause I'm

373
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,320
still able to load my world, but I need to go update all that shit. And it's just a pain

374
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,560
in the ass. Well, yeah, that's why I haven't, that's why I run a vanilla server because

375
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,160
I'm like, I don't know how to fucking set this up with bucket and stuff. I'm like, what

376
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:04,400
mods? The mods that I use are mostly just quality of life stuff. They're not like spawn

377
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,480
diamonds everywhere. No, no, no, no, no. I thought you would frown on that even though

378
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,720
he's probably doing it himself. I know I do find myself in creative mode a little bit

379
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,240
more than I probably should be. Just a flyer. You know what? When I saw those endermen outside

380
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,000
my house, I was like, no thank you. I'm going to log out for about 30 minutes and come back

381
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,880
on those guys. They honestly, uh, cause like I said, the other day we were fucking around

382
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,600
with it and my friend took on like 20 of them at once. I mean, they're really not that if

383
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,560
you just don't look at their face, you can walk right past them. They're scary. They

384
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,800
are kind of creepy. They are creepy survival horror. It is hilarious though, watching them

385
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,600
like in the rain because I was like building in the rain. I'll say I see this like red

386
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,920
flash go past my screen. Like what the fuck was that? It's like a bug or something. It's

387
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,360
because they're flipping out because they keep teleporting and they hit the rain and

388
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,960
then they take damage. So they teleport again. So they're teleporting all over the place.

389
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,440
It was kind of funny. But anyways, so I played lots of Minecraft. Um, and then I played a

390
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,560
little bit Call of Duty. I'm playing some of that cause we have some more people we're

391
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,280
playing with now at work and stuff. We haven't played Minecraft during our breaks, so that's

392
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,720
kind of fun. I repurposed our arcade cabinet that we had running MAME and stuff to play

393
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:31,520
Minecraft. And um, and then yesterday I started playing Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360. Ooh,

394
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,240
little early or broken release street dates and I'm like, okay. Whatever. It's, I like

395
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,880
it. It's um, you know, right now I was kind of, um, I didn't know who I should play as,

396
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,520
so I played as Zero cause it was kind of a little similar to Mordecai, which is how I

397
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,040
played the first game. You know, sniper, pistol. I don't know if he's a proficient in pistol,

398
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,340
but I know he's a proficient in sniper rifle. So I've been doing the sniper pistol thing

399
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:02,320
and um, I like it so far. What's kind of unique about this one versus the last game, uh, they

400
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,520
still have the same kind of jokes in there from like, you know, if you remember the intro

401
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,320
to the first game, you know, where this guy gets hit by a car. There's that in there,

402
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,520
then they take it a little bit further and it's kind of funny. Um, so they've got that

403
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,360
and then um, there's a clear cut villain in it, which is a little bit unique versus the

404
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,560
last game. In the last game there wasn't really a villain until like kind of towards the end

405
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,000
and even then it was like, okay, well the villain kept changing. It was a little weird,

406
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,400
but now there's a clear cut villain in there and he's awesome. You know, handsome Jack.

407
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,200
So um, it's pretty sweet. And the game seems a little bit harder. Um, for me at least,

408
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,040
like the enemies are a lot more mobile and they're less dumb. They will actually take

409
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,920
cover a lot better than they did before. But this one has like an easier, like cause they

410
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,380
have the BFF mode, right? It hasn't come out yet. Oh, BFF modes in the Macromancer, which

411
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,880
is, uh, I didn't realize that until October. Oh, okay. It doesn't matter. You don't need

412
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,380
that needs. You don't need, you don't need that if you want. I mean, it's just a skill

413
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,680
tree. You don't even get skills like I think until like way later in the game. Like I haven't

414
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,520
gotten the skill trees yet. So I thought you started getting those level five. Then again,

415
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,820
remember I'm playing level five. Yeah, but I'm only level four right now. I haven't even

416
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,480
gotten there. Wow. Okay. I mean, it takes a little bit, but um, it's, it's nice. I like

417
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,600
the game. It's fun. So I will definitely be playing that. Have to balance my time between

418
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,120
that and mine. You're only level four. It sounds like you're not playing it. And I only

419
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,280
played it for a couple hours. Okay. All right. I mean, cause I was like, well tell me to

420
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,080
go back in Minecraft. Oh, I should play this. You know, it's like me and Warcraft. Same

421
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,680
thing. Same thing. All right. Is that it for your gaming week? That's it. Uh, my gaming

422
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,080
week, I didn't talk about rock band blitz last week, so I just want to quickly kind

423
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,000
of give it a shout out. And I really, I've been wanting, meaning to write a review for

424
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,120
voggenetwork.com, but I've just been very busy between my day job and the show I'm directing

425
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,880
for early October. I haven't had a lot of time to just, when I do have free time, it's

426
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,280
like, I don't want to do more work. So I apologize. But, uh, rock band blitz, I'll tell you some

427
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,960
of my early thoughts on it now. Um, obviously how great is it to have an enhanced value

428
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,080
for all the DLC that you already have? And I think a lot of rock band blitz's strength

429
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,380
is just value, you know, $15 for not a bad brick of songs, you know, considering that

430
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,040
you have some top recent hits in there and so forth and some classics like queen and

431
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,720
so forth. Um, the fact that those songs will import into rock band three is great. And

432
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,240
just if you have hoard and downloaded as many songs for rock band, the series, as I have

433
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,840
on your three 60, what an amazing value to have this new game that uses them in this

434
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,740
whole new way. Um, some of the things I didn't like, I don't think the game is as strong

435
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,600
as frequency and amplitude. I think it's, you know, the whole fact that it's like two

436
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,480
buttons and has this kind of interesting mechanic where the way you increase your score is to

437
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,480
try and, uh, get up all the multipliers by a certain point in the song. But you might

438
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,380
have to know the song a little bit to know that, Oh, your only chance to up the vocal

439
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,840
multipliers is in this one part. That was a little weird to get used to, but I'm okay

440
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,800
with it. But the part that starts to bug me is then when you, if you really want to do

441
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,600
well on a song, you got to use power ups and some of the power ups are pretty cool. Like

442
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,200
I love the pinball and I love all that stuff, but then we get all Facebook up in here. The

443
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,500
only way to get these power ups is with coins and you get coins through either playing songs

444
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,240
or completing challenges. How do you sign up for challenges? You got to link the game

445
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,560
to your Facebook. Now I got to say Harmonics does get props for thinking outside of the

446
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,800
box and doing something a little different and integrating a game so well with the whole

447
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,620
Facebook thing and so forth. But I kind, and I, I, I'm also very thankful they resisted

448
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,360
the temptation to let you buy coins and I hope that never happens and go to that, you

449
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,220
know, free to play model when the game isn't really free. So I really am, I'm respectful

450
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,280
that they did that and I'm thankful they're not doing that. I just kind of think the whole

451
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,840
coins mechanic to begin with is just silly. You know, I, I props to you for thinking outside

452
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,600
the box. I think this is one of those things that doesn't stick. It doesn't really work

453
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,700
for me. And they've tried, they've, they've like tripled the number of coins you get from

454
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,360
challenges and they, they've done some kind of hot fixing on the fly. So I think they're

455
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,720
hearing that people aren't so big on this. So that's great. Harmonics does seem to give

456
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,400
a shit and I think that's very important when you're considering giving a company your money.

457
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,560
It's just that, you know, I think, um, I think it's just a little bit flawed. I think you

458
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,220
kind of took something that was meant to be for a free to play game and tried to put it

459
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,540
in this game and it's not working out so well as you can tell because you're already changing

460
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,360
the weights of things in the first couple of weeks. But again, 15 bucks, good songs,

461
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,080
new game that uses your old DLC. Not a bad deal. I, I, if you like music games, you probably

462
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,120
already have it. Um, some other games I've played this week. Borderlands one, cause it's

463
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,160
free on PlayStation plus right now. Free with the quotes cause PlayStation plus isn't free,

464
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,720
but you know what I mean? Um, ironic cause I already own it on the PC, but I don't know,

465
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
sometimes I just want to sit on the couch and play it that way with a controller, even

466
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,980
though I'm not as accurate with a controller. I've already got farther on PlayStation three

467
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,720
than I did on PC. Go figure, but I'm having a good time. Uh, the other new game I want

468
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,480
to talk about double dragon neon. Speaking of free things on PlayStation plus, did you

469
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,240
know double dragon neon came out this last week? Now, Alan, I distinctly remember this.

470
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,080
There was a previous show you were on, you were filling in for Jamie and you and I had

471
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,000
played through double dragon on Xbox cause I just randomly had the version that was on

472
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,760
Xbox like five years ago. Yeah. And then Dan came in and yelled at us. That's right. Yeah,

473
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,360
yeah, yeah. And we played through it and, and uh, we were like, God, what? This game

474
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,360
is shitty. Like what were people, why did we, why did we love this game? It did not

475
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,880
age well. The clipping and the falling off platforms and just the difficulty and is kind

476
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,480
of janky and slow and yeah. Yeah. And so Dan came in and yelled at us going, shut up. Double

477
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,520
dragon is a great game. But like, you know, we were like, uh, so now there's this remake

478
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,840
double dragon neon that came out and I got to admit I approached this remake going, double

479
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,600
dragon stupid, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it. So whatever, I'll get on

480
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:34,360
there and check it out. I got to say, well done way forward. They made double dragon

481
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,520
kind of fun again. They did the, you know, it's not, it's not a straight up remake. It's

482
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,920
not a shot for shot remake type of thing. They added some new things into it. Like Billy

483
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,680
and Jimmy can now throw fireballs. But what I love about the game is that it's so tongue

484
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,760
in cheek about how stupid it is. And there's a lot of over the top-ness of it, like an

485
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,840
awesome 80s soundtrack, right? And the, the things that people say, like, um, like you

486
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,360
can whip, like, you know how you can pick up the whip that the, um, lady baddies drop

487
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,200
and you can start whipping people. He'll go, yeah, release the crack and start saying things

488
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,040
like that. It's really stupid. And then there's this whole stupid thing you can do. What,

489
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,840
what the hell was it called? It was, um, instead of co-op, it's called bro op and you can use

490
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,360
the right stick or something to just give your high, give a high five to your bro. Yeah.

491
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,280
High five bro. You know, it's, it's ridiculous. It's so stupid, but I'm just eating it up.

492
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,520
Like it's, I feel like the guys that way forward who developed it and to give this company

493
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,000
props, they've done a lot of the other good remakes too, of which I'm drawing a blank

494
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,440
right now, but I know there were some other really good ones they did. Son of a bitch.

495
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,320
Why can't I remember? Somebody in chat will help me out. But, um, they, it's like they

496
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,640
kind of knew that it was a bad game. They were adapting, but you know, made it fun.

497
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,800
So I love that. Uh, tiger class says, I heard they changed how a Bobo looks in the new double

498
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,120
dragon. Yeah. They made them like twice the size. There's definitely some Ninja turtle

499
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,920
arcade game elements to like the bad guys flash when they're getting weaker in health

500
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,480
and stuff. I just, I love that the game is self-aware. It's great. That adds so much.

501
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,440
I love when a game developer just, just understands the game that they're making. So, um, I mean,

502
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,880
if you're a PlayStation plus user, this is a no brainer. Obviously go get it. It's free.

503
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,400
If you have to pay money for it, um, you know, the game itself, is it going to last past

504
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,200
the first few LOLs and all that stuff? I don't know. It just depends how into these types

505
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,720
of side scrolling fighting games you are. If you liked games like final fight and all

506
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,840
that back in the day, and of course the original double dragon, there's something here for

507
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,920
you. You'll enjoy it. Ninja turtles arcade game. I'd say it's, it's on par with that.

508
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,960
If you didn't enjoy those games, then it's probably a pass. Probably won't be as funny

509
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,200
to you, but I think it's worth checking out. Thank you. Game guru in the chat room. Contra

510
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,960
four was a great, great game that they did. That was one of those. Um, a lot of people

511
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,960
miss that it was on the DS, but, um, yeah, thank you. Game girl. I knew, I knew our chatters

512
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,160
would help us out. Ah, degenerate Johnny in the chat says double dragon neon, the ultimate

513
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,480
bromance in a way it is the way double dragon should be. It's great. All right. Uh, I guess

514
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,720
that's it for my gaming week. So now let's get into some housekeeping. Actually, there

515
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:30,080
is a bit of housekeeping tonight. Um, first off the show, uh, we will not be here live

516
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,800
next week. Apologies guys, live listeners. Um, I'm going out of town, so a studio OLR

517
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,780
will be closed next Sunday. There will be a new episode of OLR up, so you can do that

518
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,480
still next week. So that will be up. We're going to tape it earlier in the week and it

519
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,720
will replay on Sunday night so you can hear that. So that's just a special note for our

520
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
live listeners. I don't want to discourage you from a tuning in though because Bobby

521
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,640
has a really good interview next week and I want to get into that because this is a

522
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,440
great media partnership for the network that we're on, the voice of geeks network. Um,

523
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,880
you know, we haven't been around that long. All things considered, we just launched what?

524
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,960
Uh, the official launch was June. We did a soft launch in May. We'll get this. The VOG

525
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,200
network is an official media partner of the siege expo. This is the southern interactive

526
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,760
entertainment and game expo. It's going to be taking place October 5th through 7th in

527
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,720
Atlanta, Georgia. You can kind of think of this like game developers conference, but

528
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,280
a little more localized. If you're in the southeast area, if you're in Jamie's hometown

529
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,760
of Mobile, you're in Bobby's hometown of Atlanta, you're in Florida. I know we got some listeners

530
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,440
in Florida. If you're in that area and you're interested in developing games, this is a

531
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,760
great opportunity for you. October 5th through 7th in Atlanta. Bobby Blackwolf will be there

532
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,580
representing the voice of geeks network and he's going to be there. Um, he'll be covering

533
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,200
the show on our website, of course, as well as his own show. Uh, he'll be helping out

534
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,680
the Georgia Game Developers Association with doing audio and video from the panels and

535
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,120
keynote speeches through the weekend. So that's really cool. This is the sixth year of the

536
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,240
expo. Um, some people that are going to be there. Dustin Clingman, who's the executive

537
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,400
director of the International Game Developers Association. Rob Carroll, who's the director

538
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,920
of publishing for TapJoy, uh, and so on. Panels on programming, 3D modeling, game audio. This

539
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,600
is not E3. No new game announcements here. You know, it's not going to be that type of

540
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,320
expo. But if you're curious about the industry, you want to know more about how to break into

541
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,320
it. How are the games really made? What's going on in game development right now and

542
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,760
you're in that neck of the woods, I highly encourage you to go October 5th through 7th,

543
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,160
Atlanta Marriott, Northwest in Atlanta, Georgia. Passes are anywhere from $39.95 to $104.95

544
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,240
depending on your current membership with Georgia Game Developers Association or if

545
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,520
you're a student or what have you. You can check out more info at their website. It is

546
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:00,300
siegecon.net, net, excuse me, s-i-e-g-e-c-o-n dot net. And props to Bobby was obviously

547
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,120
because that's about his backyard, a huge part of establishing that partnership. Props

548
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:11,000
to you, my friend, pushing our network forward. Um, one other big announcement. I got a lot

549
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,200
of stuff tonight for housekeeping and not just plugging the Facebook at facebook.com

550
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,240
slash orange launch radio or twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r, though I just did. Last week

551
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,800
we had Aaron on the show or y-y-r and he was pimping his game Bungee Ferret Tossing and

552
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,520
you might be asking yourself, where the hell is it? Well, Aaron tweeted earlier and he

553
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,280
says Monday. The game will be out tomorrow so by the time most of you hear the podcast

554
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,400
version of this, Bungee Ferret Tossing will be out on Xbox Live Indie Games. Guys, let's

555
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,400
make this a success. This is o-l-r inspired. This is one of our dream games, becoming a

556
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,900
reality and it's one stinkin' dollar. You probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting

557
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,000
in your wallet already. So, go get this game on Monday. Bungee Ferret Tossing. We will

558
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,360
have links on the Twitters and on the Facebooks and all that good stuff as soon as the game

559
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:05,040
is out and we can link you to it. Check that out. Whoo, alright. Now I'm done with housekeeping.

560
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,600
Yay. We got it, right? No live next week but prerecorded. We have Siege and we have BFT

561
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,080
on Monday. Facebook, Twitter. Busy, busy. Back to the Wii U then, Loki? Yes. Let's talk

562
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:22,920
about some of the stuff we missed. Alright, so a few things about the Wii U. Well, there's

563
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,160
a lot of things about the Wii U but first off, Bayonetta. Bayonetta 2 is actually going

564
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,560
to be an exclusive title for the Wii U that's coming through with a partnership between

565
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:40,280
Platinum and Nintendo. So they've got that. One of the things that they're talking about

566
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,200
also, game pricing. Everyone was kind of wondering when the pricing was. I think I've mentioned

567
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,240
this in the past. It's going to be like the current gen consoles. $59.99 is going to be

568
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,480
the kind of going price for Wii U games which is kind of a duh. I mean, it makes sense that

569
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,320
it would be that price. Those pro controllers are going to be going for $49.99. Also, the

570
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,680
different launches. Of course, we know we're getting it over here in North America on November

571
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:19,720
18th. Europe's getting it on November 30th followed by Japan getting it on December 8th.

572
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,680
This is kind of interesting too. Not only does Japan get it on the 8th but they're also

573
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,720
getting their systems without sensor bars. They would never do that over here because

574
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,200
they never sold the sensor bar separately. Third party. Third party, yeah. Can you imagine

575
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,080
how confused people would be? Because, I don't know. That's really banking on people owning

576
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:53,680
the Wii. Yeah, it's an interesting choice. Of course, there is some other stuff. One

577
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:02,680
of the features that they were kind of pimping out was the Nintendo TV service. TVII. Gotta

578
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,360
stick with the whole naming scheme. Hate on it all you want. It's cute and it fits. The

579
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:15,960
name's fine. Alright, I'm just saying. It's a little interesting. It's kind of like the

580
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,000
same stuff that we're doing on the other consoles where they've got a bunch of different streaming

581
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,320
services bundled together plus also you can watch live TV because you can apparently hook

582
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,720
it up to, well, they haven't shown it yet because no one's allowed to take pictures

583
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,260
of the back panel, but the thought is that you're going to be able to hook it up to your

584
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:44,080
cable line. But it does tie in with TiVo, Netflix, and I believe Amazon streaming services.

585
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,160
And then of course you can also set stuff to TiVo if you have your TiVo. And apparently

586
00:44:49,160 --> 00:45:00,160
they're working with all the different subscribers, Comcast, all the cable and satellite providers.

587
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,600
Does this mean that it has the technology where like in your house, let's say, Loki,

588
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,720
you want to watch American Idol because I know you're such a Nicki Minaj fan, you'll

589
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,720
be watching this year. You're going to watch American Idol on the big TV and then if Nellie

590
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,840
doesn't want to watch that, she can watch the Oprah network on the Wii U device. I don't

591
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,440
think it works like that. Not quite like that? I don't think it works like that. Maybe one's

592
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:28,640
got to be Netflix? Yeah, but see at this point, everything streams Netflix. True. You know,

593
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,160
the 3DS streams Netflix. If you're a Nintendo fan, you probably have a 3DS as well. Hell,

594
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,400
your Wii streams Netflix. Your phone streams Netflix. Your iPod streams Netflix. Your PC

595
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,760
streams Netflix. Everything fucking streams Netflix. We don't need another device. My

596
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:55,400
pants do not yet stream Netflix. You need better pants. But it's just, I mean, cool,

597
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,920
okay, whatever. So that's the selling point, whatever, they want to make that. Of course,

598
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,000
they announced also that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is going to be coming to the Wii

599
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,200
U as well, also 3DS. That's coming out next year, though. March 31st is a tentative day

600
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,640
right now. Obviously, it's a placeholder, but probably March next year. We know that

601
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,760
the Wii U controllers are pretty expensive because they're selling them separately in

602
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,360
Japan for some reason, even though there's no games that support it, but cool. If you

603
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:38,680
want to spend extra money, why not? And yeah, that's nothing about online other than there's

604
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,480
supposedly some sort of premium service that they're going to give you 10% back on any

605
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,200
downloads that you pay for. I'm really bothered by the lack of online information. You know

606
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,160
what else is weird? Have they shown, like, this is what the Wii U looks like when you

607
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,840
turn it on. This is the interface. No, they talked about it. Did they? They said it's

608
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,760
going to just boot right into that Nintendo, the Mii Plaza home thing or whatever the hell

609
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,080
they're calling it. Was that the thing with the little messages that we're showing them?

610
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Yeah. It looks like it could be interesting. I don't know. But here's the other thing too

611
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,680
that's kind of bothersome is the amount of storage that's on this thing. I mean, 8 gigs

612
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,480
for the cheap one and 32 for the more expensive one. Well, they made the right decision though

613
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,160
because Reggie confirmed in an interview that you can just plug in any old drive and it

614
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,960
will work. I understand that, but fuck that. I get a 250 gigabyte drive or something, but

615
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,800
the thing is if they're going to be offering games digitally and they've already said that

616
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:45,160
these games, the disks are going to be up to 25 gigabytes, I'm going to get like a third

617
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,720
of a download for, you know. Well, let's be real. How many games are going to really take

618
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,800
up all that space? If it's like Blu-ray, then if it's a PlayStation 3 type game, a lot of

619
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,560
them actually will take up, you know, over 20 gigs or at least up to 20 gigs. If you

620
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,160
have a Wii set up to load games to a hard drive that you can plug in the Wii, which

621
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,800
is something we've talked about on the show before, so that you can load disks that you

622
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,680
own onto the Wii for quick access, whatever, you'd be surprised how small some of those

623
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,080
games are. Well that, but that's the Wii though. Remember the Wii is last generation graphics,

624
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,520
therefore it doesn't, anything is probably going to fit onto a single layer DVD. I mean

625
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,920
they only had a couple dual layer DVD games, whereas everything is a dual layer DVD on

626
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,120
the Xbox 360 and on the PlayStation 3 it's, you know, Blu-ray and obviously those are

627
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:42,840
going to be a lot bigger. I don't know. Once again, it's added expenses that, I mean, granted

628
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,880
the average consumer is probably not going to be downloading games, you know, other than

629
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,000
the WiiWare stuff or whatever, eShop crap, but they're not going to be digitally downloading

630
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,560
stuff. It's just, it's added expense stuff to it. Like if I'm buying this system and

631
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,480
I want to do the same type of things I can do on the PlayStation 3, you know, if I want

632
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,440
to play with my family or whatever, I've got to buy all these extra controllers because

633
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,760
God knows what configuration of controllers I'm going to need for whatever game I want

634
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,840
to play. You know, they're talking about up to five people in your household, you know,

635
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,100
playing a game on the Wii. Think of how exciting it will be to spend all that money to buy

636
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,520
those controllers. You know, whether you did it, you know, when you had the Wii or you

637
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,000
did it now because you don't own a Wii, so you have to spend all that money. Then on

638
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,520
top of that, if you want to digitally download stuff, you know, like actually first party

639
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,080
games or, you know, full console games, you're going to have to spend, you know, money to

640
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,360
buy a hard drive, which hard drives have come down in price, but still it's an added expense.

641
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,740
You know, you still have to do that and, I don't know, it's just, it's kind of annoying

642
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,960
that they have all these things that they cut out to make the console cheaper. You know,

643
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,200
stuff that we gave, you know, other console manufacturers crap for, you know, like cutting

644
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,680
out USB ports. That's another thing too. Like if I'm going to plug in like some sort of,

645
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,000
you know, USB drive into this thing or like a hard drive or something, how many fucking

646
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,960
USB ports on this thing? Like two? So what happens when, you know, say I got to play

647
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,240
another game that requires some other USB peripheral? Would a hub work? Like a, well,

648
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,160
yeah, at an expense. I got to buy a fucking hub now because they're not that, they're

649
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,880
not that bad. It doesn't matter though. I don't have to buy a fucking hub. If you bought

650
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:33,160
three USB devices, you can spare the money for a hub or whatever. I'm just saying, you

651
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,680
know, it's an extra expense that they're not talking to, you know, the consumers about

652
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,560
or they're not even, they don't even know what their fucking online plan is yet. Can

653
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,840
we, yeah, that, that concerns me too. I really, I need to hear from Nintendo that they understand

654
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,100
online now. Like they haven't even said, here, here is, you know, our online, here is, here's

655
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,540
what it looks like, you know, you know, requesting, you know, friend requests, here's this and

656
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,300
that. All we've seen is just, you know, hey look, you can post stupid messages on a message

657
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,860
port about this game. Haha, this level is hard. Whoa, smiley face. You know, I mean,

658
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,640
that's all it really just, just so you know, uh, Loki and the chat, the chatters are correcting

659
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,500
you on something, uh, starting with black Wolf and JVM on following four USB ports.

660
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,800
They said two in front, two in back. Well, cool. That, that should do it then. But, um,

661
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,760
still though, I don't want to have to buy all these extra things. Let's take a step

662
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,400
back for a minute. Alan, I'm going to ask your opinion on all this too, because you're

663
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,320
being too quiet over there. But hold on, before I get to you, uh, I want to take a step back

664
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,600
Bayonetta two, because obviously that was the big thing that people walked away from

665
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:44,520
this whole, uh, you know, expo going, Whoa, Bayonetta two it's real. Oh my gosh. And okay,

666
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,620
it's on the Wii U. All right. In my opinion, that's exactly the type of bullet Nintendo

667
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:55,220
needed in their gun, you know, pun intended. That was, but for me though, it wasn't quite

668
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,320
enough. I'm don't get me wrong. I'm glad Nintendo saved it from not existing at all. And I'm

669
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,600
glad that, you know, that that's a step in the right direction. It's just not enough

670
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,040
in the right direction to really convince me like, Holy shit, I need one of these day

671
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,820
one. I needed to see F zero, Metroid, Zelda, one of those Nintendo properties. That's not

672
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,280
just another Mario game in the same vein as the three that have already come out recently.

673
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,480
Well, here's the thing too about Bayonetta two. I mean, Bayonetta didn't sell very well.

674
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,120
I mean, it's a niche game. I mean, it didn't sell that great, but now you're narrowing

675
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,760
it down even more. All those fans, but it's fucking great. I understand it, but your devil

676
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,960
may cry. It's the same game and that game does well. You're looking at the same situation

677
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,440
with mad world. Mad world was an awesome game for the way they have, cause it's like fucking

678
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,400
look at, we understand adult games. We have a game that's, you know, just fucking awesome

679
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,880
that's on our platform and it sold like shit. So that's unfortunately a lot of the platinum

680
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,040
games. You know, granted, I'm sure that, you know, male horizon is probably gonna do really

681
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,000
well, but they haven't sold very well. Go ahead. So for the Bayonetta thing, for the

682
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,480
last two years I've been asking, even if it's just in Japan and we don't get it, where's

683
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,400
Bayonetta two? Because I mean, Japanese games, they love their sequels, right? So I'm like,

684
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,080
where is it? Where's Bayonetta two? What's platinum games working on? So when I finally

685
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:20,440
said Bayonetta two is real, but it's Wii U exclusive, I'm still kind of disappointed

686
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,240
and buttoned out about that, but I'm going to think realistically, will it be ported

687
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,440
to at least a 360 or PS3 within two years after the Wii U? No. No, it's not? It's published

688
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,120
by Nintendo. Yeah. Oh. Nintendo has it by the balls. Okay. All right. Well there's that,

689
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:41,760
but one, I guess I just won't play it then. And two, like what Bobby Blackwolf was saying,

690
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,080
if it means Nintendo dropping a big sack of money in platinum games laps saying give us

691
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,440
Bayonetta two, if that had to happen or else Bayonetta two wasn't going to happen at all,

692
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,360
then fine. Yes, I would rather there be a Bayonetta two. Don't swell his ego anymore.

693
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,440
You need to understand something about all these people going, Oh my God, Bayonetta two,

694
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,640
the Wii U has it all the time. Did they announce a fucking release date for it? Oh, wait, that

695
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,600
wasn't there? Gee, I wonder why, because maybe that platinum games right now is working on

696
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,120
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. That doesn't come out until February. So that means they're

697
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,160
still going to be fucking working on the game till at least January. What was in that? That

698
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,240
trailer was literally nothing. Was it in that 50 game launch window? No, it's not a launch

699
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,640
title. That's probably next year sometime. You'd be lucky if it's next year holiday.

700
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,360
I bet you 2014 just like, Hey, Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and everyone's like,

701
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,520
Oh my God, Smash Brothers, I need to buy a Wii U. It's not fucking coming out for years.

702
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:45,160
It's, it's, it's a lot of the 3DS syndrome. I hate to say pilot wings resort, not the killer

703
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,680
game to launch your system with. They're teasing shit. That's not going to be coming out forever

704
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,000
because it, people are dumb enough to go, well, I'm buying the system for Bayonetta two. Cool.

705
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,920
You're buying that system. It's going to be fucking collecting does until the two years

706
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:05,240
from now that Bayonetta is going to be fair. Nintendo land for what it is. Uh, uh, we have

707
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,200
the Abu collection of mini games and so forth. It looks pretty neat. I'm kind of sold on

708
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,360
Nintendo land, I gotta say. Cool. I'll probably enjoy that more than I actually played. We

709
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,640
sports, we sports is one of those things is fun for five minutes and then you're like,

710
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,080
Oh, I get it. I mean, I wish they would have something that would be, you know, Oh my God,

711
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,840
I have to have the system for it, but they just don't. And that's, that's my thing. That's

712
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,520
why I'm not getting one. I'm not saying that, Oh, you're wrong for, you know, someone else

713
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,400
is wrong for getting it because they have something that they're like, Oh my God, I

714
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,880
want to play that. You know, Oh God, I got to play Mario Brothers in HD. Peekman has

715
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,640
a cult following. That's not my game that I ever really got into, but I could understand

716
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,040
where somebody is like, fuck yeah, Pikmin. I got to get this. But that's the thing is

717
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,440
they're trying to grab all these niche areas. Like, okay, Pikmin has a following of like,

718
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,880
maybe there's a, they have a fucking Mario game coming out on it. Loki. That's your non

719
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:03,120
niche game. Mario that's been out. It looks very similar to the Mario that just came out

720
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:11,360
a second ago. Those games sell like crazy. It's going to be a success. It could be Mario's

721
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,800
douche factory and people will eat that shit up. Okay. I, it doesn't matter. It's just,

722
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:23,120
I'm sure it's going to be a fun game, but the thing is for me, it's not that like, wow,

723
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:31,960
it's not that it's, it's the same experience I can get right now, you know, on a 3DS or

724
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,440
on a Wii or something like that. That's, that's my problem. You know, and the gimmicky thing

725
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,960
of, Hey, look, I can use this tablet and I can tap the screen and it makes platforms.

726
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,920
Fuck. You could probably do that if you made some sort of connectivity between the DS version

727
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,200
and the Wii version. You could do the same shit with your stylus on the touch screen,

728
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,760
but no, we're just not going to do that. Alan, you never got to finish your thought

729
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,840
because Loki, you know, got on his tangent, but yeah, so I'd rather there be a bed Bayonetta

730
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:07,160
to that. I'll never play the no Bayonetta to at all. And when Bobby was reading those

731
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,080
tweets about this is the worst thing since the mass effect three ending, I was like,

732
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:17,840
Oh Jesus Christ, go pee your bed. What really? That's, this is the thing that people are

733
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,120
talking about, but yeah, whatever. But I really have no fucks to give for the Wii U. I don't

734
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,400
care. I'm the Wii, the Wii, we don't play it here. It's the one system that I don't

735
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,220
bought that I didn't have my own copy of when I moved in with you. So I played Wii Fit for

736
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,200
like a week. Once in a while I get into Wii mode. You have to admit, yeah. Once you're

737
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,840
gonna pick up, you're gonna pick up Wii Fit U because Wii Fit U's got the crappy pedometer

738
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,960
with your little Miya on it. Oh my God. And guess what? If someone's watching TV, you

739
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:55,640
can look like a goddamn fool staring into a little tablet and exercising. I, well, okay.

740
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:01,280
Let's Alan, let's say you had the, have had the money. Money's not a concern and so forth.

741
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,480
You still would not buy a Wii U on this principle of there's not really something you want to

742
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,640
play on it right now. Right? Correct. And I also, I agree with what Loki was saying

743
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,360
that 20, 25 second Bayonetta 2 reveal trailer is literally nothing. So like there's, they

744
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,200
have not probably even started to work on this game even a little tiny bit yet. Let's

745
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,440
be fair. It's two years off. Just, if you're interested in Wii and you haven't pre-ordered

746
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,040
it yet, you're probably not going to fucking get it at launch anyways. Just chill the fuck

747
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,760
out. Let the whole like, you know, oh my God, I'm a crack addict. I need my Nintendo crack,

748
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,360
you know, right now. Just let that like kind of calm down, get out of your system and just

749
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,640
give it like a year and then you know, a Zelda game will be fucking coming out. The system

750
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,560
will probably drop in price and there'll be stuff that you'll actually want to play. I

751
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,440
think the 3DS is going to be an awesome system that is going to have dozens of must have

752
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,300
games for it in another two years. The Vita is going to be an awesome system with dozens

753
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,440
of must have games for it in another two years. So Wii U is probably going to be the same

754
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,960
way. Uh, GameGuru brings this comment to chat that has the facts I was looking for and arguing

755
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,680
with Loki earlier. Thank you GameGuru. New Super Mario Brothers U sold 25, I think he

756
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,180
meant to say New Super Mario Brothers. New Super Mario Brothers sold 25 million copies.

757
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:22,200
It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U. 25 million copies as a franchise

758
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:28,480
or as a title because I don't think that's as a title. And it was a packing game. Semantics.

759
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,400
It doesn't matter. It's a huge game. The point still stands. It's the biggest title Nintendo

760
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:39,240
could bring out for Wii U. Or they could have made a new Mario game. You know, why settle

761
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,080
for just the same franchise that you know, you've already been pimping them for a while.

762
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,100
Yeah, those numbers look nice if you're talking franchise because you've only, how many New

763
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,120
Super Mario Brothers games have you released? Yeah, that's what I thought. I can't wait

764
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:55,480
to buy Legend of Zelda. The new one? No, all of them. Again and again. All right, look,

765
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,040
but now let's go back to the real world for a minute here, Alan, because you know, you're

766
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,880
not living by yourself anymore. You're in a committed relationship with an individual

767
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,640
who tends to be a bit of a consumer whore. Yes. So there probably will be a Wii U in

768
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:14,160
the house within the next year. Yes. How does that make you feel? I don't care about the

769
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:20,280
Wii U. You won't even touch it? You won't look at it? Well, it's hooked up. I'll play

770
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:27,600
it, but I mean... Well, it's there. I'll have my hour where I go, oh, okay, use the controller

771
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:35,760
and all right, then boom, never again. All right, fair enough. Technus in chat wondering,

772
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,360
so I wonder what will come out first, Bayonetta 2 or the Wonderful 101? Live.vognetwork.com.

773
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,720
Clearly the Wonderful 101, right? Yeah, Wonderful 101 because that's the launch window title

774
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:52,760
and Bayonetta is not even fucking being worked on yet. You know what, though? Again, I will

775
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,320
say props to Nintendo for the Bayonetta 2 thing. Now give me like three more of those

776
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,840
on that level and we're sitting really, really, really good. Platinum tends to release about

777
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:08,440
one game a year, I think. They don't have to be Platinum Games. I'm talking about other

778
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:14,960
exclusive things would be great. No, I'm talking about Platinum Games as the company being

779
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,260
released, you know, one title they work on about once a year, I think, because they did,

780
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:26,080
I think Platinum Games did, what was it, Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns in the US here,

781
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,200
you know, that's not out yet. Then, of course, they've got, you know, next year, Metal Gear

782
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,040
Rising Revengeance, so probably 2014. All right, let's move on with some more Nintendo

783
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,200
news. This is a story on the Nintendo Network. We've kind of touched on this, so I'll make

784
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,240
this quick. If you shell out the money for the higher end Wii U, you're going to get

785
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,680
not just some more gigabytes, you will get access to Nintendo Network Premium. Nintendo

786
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,600
Network is the online service. It's going to be free, but apparently Nintendo said at

787
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,320
one point, well, maybe it won't always be free, we just don't know yet. There's a lot

788
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,120
we're still figuring out. We haven't figured out the whole Network thing. So it looks like

789
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:08,000
what we have now is Nintendo Network Premium, and people were going so like Xbox Gold, PlayStation

790
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,520
Plus, what the hell. Nintendo Network Premium right now looks to be nothing more than rewards.

791
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,800
If you are one of these premium users, you get a game, you get 10% of the purchase in

792
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,920
points that you can exchange for a redemption code to trade in for other games or DLC. This

793
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,800
sounds a lot like that coins thing they already have in a way, except this is more encouraging

794
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,680
people to do stuff online, I guess, although they did that with the new Super Mario Brothers

795
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,000
2 Gold Mania or whatever the hell that's called on the 3DS. They were offering double coins

796
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,240
if you download it digitally. So is this like a yearly subscription thing or is this just

797
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,320
I buy the fancy system? You buy the fancy system and you get it. Now the other thing

798
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:54,760
from the Japanese conference only offered till December 2014. Okay. Oh my god, will

799
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,280
I be able to get it in this like two year window? Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot

800
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:05,120
of question mark here that I'm not, you know, and that's the problem is that after that

801
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,200
press conference, there should not have been this many question marks. That's a two year

802
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,220
console cycle. Stop. And they'll have the Wii UU. Well I get if it's only free until

803
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:20,080
December 2014. But then what? What do the non deluxe people get? Is that all it is as

804
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,640
a discount program? How do I, are we still on friend codes? Do we have Nintendo gamer

805
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:31,920
tags now? What's going on? Hello? I guess I'm not supposed to ask those questions. I'm

806
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:40,640
supposed to say, ooh Bayonetta, pretty. Moving on. Let's do more Nintendo news. Yes. So websites

807
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:49,520
that are offering preorders for the Wii U system, either of the bundles, are marking

808
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,020
themselves as being sold out. So the assumption that could be made is that this thing is selling

809
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:02,600
like crazy, at least in the preorder cycle. It looks like Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Target

810
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,720
are sold out online of both versions. Sears and Kmart are only listing the deluxe as

811
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:15,600
sold out with the cheaper SKU not there at all. Again, GameStop online can't preorder

812
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,180
it. Doesn't really mention Amazon in this article that I'm referencing. Well there's

813
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:23,120
another issue going on there, but I'll come back to that. So we already kind of talked

814
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,380
about this a little bit where, you know, Matt was saying, well, we don't know how much,

815
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,720
like Nintendo dictates to them what numbers there are before they have to consider themselves

816
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,960
sold out. But it looks like Walmart grown, who's also making things more difficult because

817
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:43,620
Walmart does their own bundle within the bundle. Walmart online is offering their Walmart solution

818
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,800
bundle which are even more expensive. The basic one with the shit that they are bundling

819
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,960
in is $400 and then $450 for the deluxe Wii U SKU plus whatever bullshit they're in. So

820
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:59,560
if you want to get in on the Wii U preorder, Walmart I guess is a good place to start.

821
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,180
So I guess Nintendo's not looking to have these long lines and stuff this time because

822
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:07,200
if Target and Walmart both did preorders and, you know, that's where all the lines were

823
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:13,780
showing up before. I'm telling you, if they sold out in one day, there's no way. There's

824
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,680
no stories about people lining up at the fucking store to make preorders. There's no way that

825
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,400
there's a large amount of systems being preordered. Even if everybody fucking rushed down and

826
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,440
bum rushed, you know, GameStop, there's no way that they have a lot. But they're doing

827
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,800
it though so that it makes a good headline. You know, the system's selling out, look how

828
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,240
fast it's sold out. Yeah, if I offered one for sale and, you know, it would sell out

829
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,280
instantly. I mean, so on a website where you can't see how many they have. I mean, fuck,

830
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,560
look at the iPhone 5. Is that shit selling out? And I'm sure they're going to sell millions

831
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:52,040
of those. So I mean, I just have a hard time believing that there's going to be a lot being

832
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,440
sold. Um, it seems like all hope is not lost though. There are some stores that just aren't

833
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,680
going to do preorders. Like Fry's is one that I can think of. They don't ever do preorders.

834
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,720
So if I really want to get a Wii U launch day, I'll just go there early, I guess. Um,

835
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,360
but I was surprised at the lack of Amazon, but apparently there's something deeper going

836
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:13,920
on here. And that's the whole fact that Amazon hasn't carried the 3DS or the 3DS XL and they

837
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,520
haven't said anything about the Wii U. They used to carry the 3DS. Exactly. I bought a

838
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,140
3DS game from them. They used to carry the 3DS. The 3DS, they had a problem with people

839
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:30,080
reporting broken hinges and so they got returned to them. And the thought is that they tried

840
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,120
returning those to Nintendo. Nintendo said, fuck you, you're stuck with them. And so they're

841
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,720
like, fuck you, we're not carrying your hardware. Which is fine. You know, to be honest, they

842
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,800
don't need that shit because you know why? The hardware, there is no markup on the hardware.

843
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:48,080
They're making nothing off that. So there's no reason for them to carry it. But Amazon,

844
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,200
that's not the type of company Amazon is. Amazon will slit throats to get you to go

845
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,920
to their site and buy this shit on their site. I understand that, but if, if it's come down

846
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,760
to where, you know, hey, we're losing hundreds of dollars on this thing. Amazon lost their

847
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:09,320
biggest competitive advantage yesterday. Amazon is now in a whole new world as of yesterday.

848
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,680
Guess what changed at Amazon.com yesterday? Started charging tax. That's right. Sales

849
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,280
tax. Sales tax in the state of California. And I think a few others too. I don't think

850
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:23,180
it's just California. Cause when you file for your state taxes every April in California,

851
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,560
it says, did you order something online from out of state? Because please enter the amount

852
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,440
here so that we can factor in sales tax. Everyone goes next. Fuck no. I'm sure everybody has

853
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,800
always been a hundred percent honest. They've got a shoe box of receipts and Amazon invoices.

854
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,360
Yeah. But now it doesn't matter if you're in California. You tell me if I've ordered

855
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:45,920
something. Oh, you don't know. Well then I didn't. Yeah. I love that system. We're going

856
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,160
to plead the honor system, right? You're like, you're going to be honest with me if you're

857
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:56,880
charging me too many taxes. No, you're not. Okay. So what's this that Bobby's linking

858
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,240
me to? He's linking to an actual, it looks like a 3ds Cosmo black. Ah, here's the trick

859
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:08,800
though. It says 17 left in stock sold by Emacs and fulfilled by Amazon. So technically that's

860
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,360
not Amazon. That's one of their little mini sub stores that's doing it. So yes, they have,

861
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:19,700
you can get, okay, if you want to get me on a technicality, you can get the 3ds on Amazon,

862
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:25,520
but it's not going to come from Amazon. No, it's going to come from a third party. Yeah.

863
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:31,520
So very interesting. Uh, I'm, I, I still am surprised that Amazon, you know, despite all

864
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,160
that madness would, you know, it's nothing that the other companies aren't having to

865
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,320
put up with. Don't take the returns then. Well, I think it became a problem where, you

866
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:44,040
know, customers were complaining that, you know, it's a defective system and they were

867
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:48,680
just returning them in mass or something. I don't know, but I, I would assume that'd

868
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:54,360
be the only reason why they wouldn't carry it. Hmm. Um, so let's talk a little bit, something,

869
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,120
something different than Nintendo for a while. Yes, please. Believe it or not, there was

870
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,020
other news this week besides Nintendo. Can I just take a minute real quick? It's nowhere

871
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,000
else on our show roll tonight. I can't believe it got left off. I just need to tip the hat.

872
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,260
You mentioned it. iPhone five is huge gaming news. Like it or not, they come out and say,

873
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,920
it's a huge gaming handheld. I think even more so than the iPhone five, I think we all

874
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,120
need to not forget there if, cause if you don't even want it for the phone or whatever,

875
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,480
there is still the iPod touch. Is that what they call the ones that are the phones without

876
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:30,400
the phone? They announced that too. That is basically an iPhone five and all those games

877
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,240
and all that stuff. So despite however you feel about Apple, that is a huge, you know,

878
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,060
the angry birds of the world is all going to be over there and stuff. So that's a pretty

879
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:44,440
big gaming news. I just wanted to get that out there cause those were two big, big, big

880
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:50,720
gaming stories this week. Cool. Real racing's on it. Fantastic. The fact that it's a new

881
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:57,240
resolution is a little bit strange too. And I, I, I still, why are they still talking

882
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:04,120
iPad mini? There is no reason for an iPad mini. An iPad mini is an iPod touch. Why do

883
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,880
we still have all these crazy rumors about the iPad mini? I don't get it because seven

884
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:16,920
inch tablets are popular. Just get the iPad. You won't be disappointed. It's pretty. And,

885
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:28,440
and as Netflix, everything fucking has Netflix. Okay. Everything seriously to register participation

886
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:35,120
for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase guitar.

887
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:43,000
So Zynga has filed a counter suit or filed, I guess, a counterclaim against EA. And of

888
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,600
course, you know, they're saying, you know, today we respond to EA's claims, which we

889
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:53,080
believe have no merit. We also filed a counterclaim, which addresses actions by EA. We'd be believed

890
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:58,080
to be anti-competitive and unlawful business practices, including legal threats, demands

891
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,200
for no higher agreements. We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts

892
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:09,520
on delighting our players. And then to which I add with our clone games. Um, but seriously,

893
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,880
that's the whole thing. There's like basically saying, Oh yeah, no, we're not copying the

894
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:21,640
Sims social. No, I'm sorry. They are. That's I mean, come on. Anybody that probably listens

895
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:27,040
to the show, that's seen the evidence of them copying many other games. We know better.

896
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,100
I mean, who are they trying to fool? Obviously the court, but well, they, I mean, this is

897
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,080
also one of those things though. It's like a does zinc is not going to take this long.

898
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,200
Well, you caught us there. Yeah, we did. You're IDA. Yeah. We were, we were ripping off all

899
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:43,000
your games. Here you go. Here's the billion dollars you were asking for. So this is not

900
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,600
a surprise, right? Yeah. Not at all. Come on. And so, um, I don't know. I mean, of course,

901
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:57,040
you know, they're break man and chat at live.vognetwork.com says Zinga considers copying other people's

902
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,120
games to be a completely legal process. I didn't mean to cut you off. You sound like

903
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,600
you were trailing off with that thought there. No, no, no. They're, they're basically saying

904
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:09,880
here's their whole reason there. It's, it's, it's okay to do what we're doing. Basically.

905
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,000
Um, you know, the, the alleged certain modes of expression are customary and necessary

906
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
to express the genres such as seeing on a couch, watching TV, taking a shower and going

907
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:27,160
to sleep in a bed. Such modes of expression are known as, uh, scenes affair, uh, are not

908
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:33,440
protectable. Uh, one company, uh, allowing one company to own them with work, competition,

909
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:39,360
innovation and creativity. Employing the scenes affair, um, common functions or functional

910
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,980
elements is not a copyright infringement. It is how a genre is expressed. So what they're

911
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:49,920
saying is our game looks slightly different, but just because, you know, Sims, I'm sorry,

912
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,040
him or Ville person, whoever, what the hell they're calling it, sits down to take a crap

913
01:12:54,040 --> 01:13:00,880
doesn't mean that, you know, it's the same thing. Except once again, it's, they're not

914
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,100
just copying the fact that, you know, this person takes, you know, can take a nap or

915
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,840
this person, you know, cooks on a stove or something like that. They're copying the character

916
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:18,360
editor or the art style or, you know, the menus or the, you know, palette for your skin

917
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,280
tones, you know, that kind of stuff.

918
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:27,520
All right, let's move on to other legal news. This one's, this one's a tricky issue. Oh

919
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:36,720
boy, this is, um, wow. Okay. So who owns the word gamer? G A Y M E R a word that describes

920
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,040
a gay gamer. It's kind of a name that the community's taken up a little bit here. Uh,

921
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,760
you've might've heard of gamer con was a big thing that we were talking about, uh, before

922
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,880
on the show. Cause I talked about that. That's the only Kickstarter I've ever backed. Well,

923
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:56,400
um, you may or may not have heard of a site gamer.org G A Y M E R.org. And back in 2007,

924
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,100
the owner, Chris Vizzini, I hope I'm saying that right. Um, announced that he was going

925
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:07,360
to trademark the term gamer. I seem to remember reporting on this back then because the show's

926
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,320
been around a while and I seem to remember reporting on this back then saying, I'm not

927
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,860
a big fan of this. You know, the fact that he's trying to trademark this word and I don't

928
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:20,740
think anybody did. Well, I think the part we missed, he got the trademark. The United

929
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:28,100
States gave him the trademark on the word gamer for his website, gamer.org. So the trademark

930
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:32,800
applies to online communities, hosting and maintaining an online website for others to

931
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,600
discuss receive and disseminate information concerning video games. So he owns the trademark

932
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,320
on that when it comes to online communities. Well, this past week, a cease and desist letter

933
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:52,040
from Chris Vizzini was sent to Reddit. Talk about a David versus Goliath scenario. The

934
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:59,600
gamers community on Reddit is something like 17,000 some odd people. Gamer.org, not really

935
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,400
a big website. It was a good concept, but gaygamer.net kind of came around and did it

936
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:10,640
better. I don't mean any disrespect to gamer.org because, you know, look at Orange Lounge Radio.

937
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,960
Shit, we've been around 10 years and we still haven't made it big, quote unquote. So, you

938
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,320
know, I can kind of sympathize in that sort of regard, but I'm not so sure I would have

939
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:27,880
picked my battle with Reddit either. You know, like, Redditers are crazy. We mean that in

940
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:36,120
the nicest possible way. But like, to quote a famous gif of Whoopi Goldberg, you in danger

941
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:48,160
girl. So, and gamer.org ended up being shut down just like not even a day later with after

942
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:54,080
this whole stuff. So here's, here's the situation. He responded and so forth. Here's his response.

943
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,400
I informed the mod team of our gamers that we'd received a cease and desist for the infringement

944
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,400
of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed, I'm sorry, is this,

945
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,560
I'm sorry, I am reading, scratch that, my bad, I am reading what the admin on Reddit

946
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,640
said. Like, as I'm reading it here, it doesn't make sense. Okay, sorry. How embarrassing.

947
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,920
I informed the mod team of our gamers that we received a cease and desist letter for

948
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,920
infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed us that the

949
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,980
letter presents a real threat that they would sue Reddit. I let them know so that they could

950
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,080
start planning how to respond, including seeing if there's any way for them to work things

951
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:38,600
out with the owner of the trademark. Now the response from gamer.org. He sent the cease

952
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,800
and desist because as a trademark holder, you have to defend your trademark or you will

953
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:52,000
risk losing it. He's emailed Reddit twice before and no response. He says, I started

954
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,900
gamer.org in 2003 and began to build gamer as a brand. That's why I trademarked and word

955
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,800
marked the name. At that time, there was only one other site around dedicated to gay gamers.

956
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,480
I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars on gamer.org. I have done so gladly

957
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,960
as it's brought happiness to many people. He is not pursuing gamer con because his trademark

958
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,760
is only about online communities. I would think though, gamer con, if they're going

959
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,220
to be as big as Fanime or PAX or any other big convention, will probably have an online

960
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:31,800
forum at some point. So I would still be a little worried if I was on the planning board

961
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:38,680
at gamer con about the impact this could have. Now, you might be curious about my thoughts

962
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:46,400
as a gay gamer. And my thoughts is I don't necessarily fault Chris in this circumstance

963
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:53,440
because he does have to defend his trademark. He should have never been given that trademark

964
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:59,280
in the first place. That's the problem. Why did they give him that? He should have every

965
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:06,940
right to gamer.org. But the word gamer, that's a really broad thing to have. And especially

966
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:13,800
this far, I mean, there was a dude on the tester whose name was gamer, his little online

967
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,160
thing. That didn't ruffle any feathers, I guess, because again, gamer doesn't have his

968
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,200
own online community. But as many of the folks on Reddit and all around the internet were

969
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,160
quick to point out, that word gamer has existed dating back to Yahoo! groups and all this

970
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:34,400
stuff before that. I mean, it's just kind of a little play on word that makes a lot

971
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,800
of sense. Why was he given the trademark in the first place?

972
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,800
Because the patent offices don't know better. Because he filed first. Probably no one thought

973
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:49,680
about trademarking it, so he did. What he could have done if he's just defending it

974
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:55,160
because, oh, I need to and otherwise I will lose my trademark, whatever. He could license

975
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:02,800
it to him for free. Okay, yes, you may use this as your forum thing or whatever, but

976
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:10,600
I have the rights to. It is a trademark of blah, blah, blah. That'd be the nice thing

977
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,600
to do, I guess.

978
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,280
Rama in chat says, Sky, a treaty alliance between both organizations. I wish. That would

979
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:22,080
be the nice thing to see here. In a minority of a minority community, is this what we really

980
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,800
need to have happening right now? This sucks. Especially when things are kind of gaining

981
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,200
steam with the convention and all this right now, this is a real shot in the foot. This

982
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,880
is a terrible time for something like this to happen.

983
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:40,960
I get that gamer.org feels the need to defend their trademark and the thousands of dollars

984
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,840
they've invested. Shit, we've invested thousands of dollars in this program and the community

985
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,600
we've built and all that stuff, but I just kind of think at a certain point you have

986
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:57,160
to let it go. And you kind of have to just admit the term gamer has become something

987
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:03,200
much larger than gamer.org. I forgot there was a gamer.org until I saw this site earlier

988
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:09,600
this week. No offense, the site hasn't been able to keep itself in the public eye the

989
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:17,760
way gaygamer.net has. Or the Reddit. He looks like he was updating it back in August and

990
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,680
July and then kind of took off. Because he had to get his site back, he had to do a rollback

991
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,260
of a month. So a lot of the stuff that was up there disappeared. Because there was something

992
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,040
up there on the OUYA. I managed to see it before it went down and there was something

993
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,820
on there about the OUYA and some of the other stuff. But there's the forums. Again, I mean

994
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:41,200
no disrespect to that community because we have a small community. Shit, Loki named the

995
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:49,120
Wii U release date in July and I bet you nobody knows that. But I don't know. But then of

996
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,680
course you come around and say, well if somebody tried to start a community called Orange Lounge

997
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,980
Video, would you have a problem with that? And there's a part of me that's kind of like

998
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,540
yes and no. If you're just trying to piggyback on our success, yes I'd have a problem with

999
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:07,640
that. But at the same time, Orange Lounge Radio wasn't exactly our name 100% either.

1000
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:13,160
And we've always admitted that. We were inspired to name ourselves after something we were

1001
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,260
all fans of, the way a Beatles tribute band might call them Yellow Submarine or something

1002
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:25,040
like that. It's very kind of akin to that. But if Orange Lounge had this common meaning,

1003
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,640
if Orange Lounge was suddenly the term that everybody called their video game room or

1004
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:35,000
something, I think there'd have to be a point where you just kind of let it go. I don't

1005
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,440
know. Loki, you're on the outside looking in. You probably have no reason to go to a

1006
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,960
gamer reddit or gamer.org. What do you think of all this kind of back and forth debacle?

1007
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:55,080
That's typical, typical trademark copyright garbage. You know, someone trademark something.

1008
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:01,360
Like if we're going to totally make it non-sexually oriented at all. I mean look at the guy that

1009
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:07,200
tried to trademark Mame a while back. A great comment from Dungeon Buster in the chatroom

1010
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:14,400
about this is the USPTO, the same place that gave Langdell his trademark over Edge. Remember

1011
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,320
that? And then there's not just Edge, but then there is the, what is the other one?

1012
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,640
The one that hit against Elder Scrolls. Was it Scrolls? Yeah, it's the Mojang game. It's

1013
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:31,880
called Scrolls, right? So there's that whole debacle too. Like holy hell do we need this

1014
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:38,360
stuff reexamined. I mean we're in this technological age where the laws from the 17 and 1800s don't

1015
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:45,000
work anymore. Again, I really feel like he should have never been given the trademark

1016
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,200
in the first place. Stop, I mean I can feel for the guy because it's like, oh you were

1017
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:55,040
given this great thing and now the internet's trying to take it away. But it's like, you

1018
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,960
shouldn't have had that. You should have gotten gamer.org. That's all yours buddy. You get

1019
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,800
that. Let me put it this way. Gamer probably too, like someone that's not familiar with

1020
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,480
anything on the internet. You know, people that work at the patent office. Probably,

1021
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,840
you know, hey that's a unique thing. You know, we'll go ahead and give it to that guy. I

1022
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:17,760
mean they don't do any research, but that's the problem though is they'll just give it

1023
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,640
to whomever. And you know, yeah it kind of sucks for everybody else, but I don't really

1024
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:28,380
know where, you know, something becomes so commonly used that they can't trademark it

1025
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:33,280
anymore or something. I don't know. I don't really know how that works. Well as somebody

1026
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,840
who's supporting GamerCon and would think that logically that's going to have a community

1027
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:44,320
at some point, and just like a gamer myself, I kind of think this guy needs to let it go.

1028
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:51,760
I understand he wants to defend what he's invested his hard earned money in, but there's

1029
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:57,260
a way for everybody to win in this scenario. If he wanted more visibility for his site,

1030
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:03,080
why not work with Reddit? It's a pretty powerful, if you want to get yourself promoted, you

1031
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:07,040
want to get the word around the internet, Reddit's a pretty fucking great place to go

1032
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:12,720
for that type of stuff. You know, it seems like they could have, he could have got more

1033
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:17,880
for his site working with Reddit than he's getting working against them. And that goes

1034
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:25,660
for any large, large, large online community. And I hate seeing these, these factions fight.

1035
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:30,880
It sucks. Alright, moving on. I need some happier news or something. Can you deliver,

1036
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:36,200
Alan? Not really happy news, but some sassy news. Okay, I'll take sassy. So this is probably

1037
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:40,320
one of the most ludicrous stories that I've reported on whenever I've guest hosted on

1038
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:47,640
this show. Electronic Arts usually, they've, I don't want to say butted heads, but they've

1039
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,400
had snippy things to say about Valve and Steam in the past, where I guess that one EA guy,

1040
01:24:53,400 --> 01:25:00,160
excuse me, was saying that when Steam discounts games as much as it does and has those crazy

1041
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:06,040
99 cent sales and stuff, that it sort of devalues PC games and this, that, and the other, even

1042
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,580
though indie developers have come out and said that putting their game on Steam versus

1043
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:14,840
Xbox Live was one of the best things they ever did, blah, blah, blah. The Origin client,

1044
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:20,440
which became a mandatory thing for Mass Effect 3, is fucking terrible. And EA and Origin

1045
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,600
doesn't have the sales that Steam does and blah, blah, blah. So EA is always trying to

1046
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,560
be up Valve's ass. I guess EA on two different occasions have tried to enter talks with Valve

1047
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:36,480
to purchase the company. Going upwards of some of the preliminary talks they did offered

1048
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,400
up to a billion dollars if Valve was going to take the offer seriously. That's how much

1049
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:49,760
they were willing to front to start the conversation. And Gabe Newell is like, no, that's not going

1050
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:57,160
to happen. Quote, co-owner and company founder Gabe Newell, however, said that the likelihood

1051
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:02,640
of his fiercely independent company selling to an Electronic Arts or one of the other

1052
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,200
major multinational publishers like Activision or Ubisoft is about as likely as Nintendo

1053
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,160
selling off the Mario brand. Newell said that Valve would sooner disintegrate than sell

1054
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:20,160
out to a major publisher. It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say,

1055
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,960
let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to

1056
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:29,480
have our employment agreements terminate. So, yeah, EA I guess has tried to buy Valve

1057
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,160
and it sounds ridiculous. One of the dumbest things I've ever heard. And we don't even

1058
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:38,160
know what Valve is doing with the fact that the story that we covered last week where

1059
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:43,880
Valve's looking for industrial engineers for this maybe PC box that's going to run Steam

1060
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,760
maybe on television sets. That's what people are speculating on. So we don't know what

1061
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,120
Valve is up to, but obviously they're not in a position to be bought by anyone and they

1062
01:26:54,120 --> 01:27:02,760
have more money than God because Steam already commands a membership of 54 billion active

1063
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:09,040
users and growing. So they're not in want for money for EA to buy them.

1064
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:16,560
I would say it's surprising that EA's tried to buy Valve. I don't think that's surprising.

1065
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,500
It gives me warm fuzzies to know that Gabe Newell basically laughed in their face. That

1066
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,240
gives me warm fuzzies. Especially after that PopCap story from last week.

1067
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,120
From a business standpoint, if you're a company as big as EA, hey, they make good shit. Let's

1068
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:35,920
say, hey, hey, you guys for sale? That's legit. EA's can ask that if whoever they want. Gabe

1069
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:41,160
Newell is like, no. I love this. That's what's funny. I love this comment from mm2k in our

1070
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:46,680
chat room. Thank God the people at Valve own Valve. EA buying it would be the coming of

1071
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:54,120
Satan. Well, that's not a dramatic statement. Would EA bring Half-Life 3 out faster? Cause

1072
01:27:54,120 --> 01:28:00,080
I don't know. Oh no you didn't. Oh no you didn't. And Zynga buying it would be ultra

1073
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:12,280
Satan. I want somebody to buy Valve and legitimize them. Is that possible? EA should buy Zynga.

1074
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:20,440
What better way to settle this whole thing? That would be funny. It would be hilarious.

1075
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:25,960
Activision buys Zynga and then rolls it in with Blizzard and the sky turns black. Oh,

1076
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:33,200
can you imagine how terrible World of Warcraft would be? Possibly. It already got worse when

1077
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:37,800
Activision bought them. But anyway, BlackWolf in our chat room says, VoG, however, would

1078
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:43,840
not say F you to EA. EA bring your money trucks to my house, please. Wait a minute, Bobby.

1079
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:51,200
It's not a gaming station. EA doesn't have interest in that gaming is one part of nerdom.

1080
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,040
That's fine. They can roll those money trucks up. I'll be able to sell my gaming part of

1081
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,440
it. That's true. I think all of us are sitting here going, yeah, we'd sell out. Money? Sure.

1082
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,280
All right, let's move on. Travel around the world and check out some release dates and

1083
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:12,400
what is coming out near you in a country near you. Loki, start us off. There's some decent

1084
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,280
stuff coming out this week. Of course, we've got Borderlands 2 coming out on PlayStation

1085
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:26,720
3 and Xbox 360 and PC. The Kirby's Dream collector's special edition. That's way too many adjectives

1086
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:34,080
for that. That's coming out on the Wii this week. NCIS 3D on the 3DS. Hotel Transylvania

1087
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:40,720
on the DS and 3DS. Collector's Edition for Borderlands 2. Deluxe Vault Hunter Collector's

1088
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:46,640
Edition and the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition. That's coming out as well. F Ultimate Loot

1089
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:53,640
Chest Edition. I almost got that. The chest on that thing is huge. Although the collector's

1090
01:29:53,640 --> 01:30:00,320
edition for Black Ops 2 looks pretty sweet. And it has a bigger chest. It's all about

1091
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:07,920
the bigger chest. Formula 1 2012 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The Street Fighter 25th Anniversary

1092
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:18,760
Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3. And Connect Sports Ultimate Collection. It's a re-release

1093
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:26,000
of Connect Sports 1 and 2 on one disc. It's coming out on 360. Harley Pasternak's Hollywood

1094
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:34,160
Workout on Xbox 360 and the Wii. And this week we get our Connect TV games. Connect

1095
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:42,240
Sesame Street TV and Connect National Geo. Or Net Geo TV on 360 as well. When's Surface

1096
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:47,240
coming? Do we know? I'm sorry. What the hell was that thing called they showed at E3? The

1097
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:53,880
Surface? No, the name of the... Is it called Surface? The thing that will let my iPad be

1098
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,680
a touch controller. Oh, Smart Glass. Thank you, Smart Glass. That's in the fall update

1099
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,600
I think. Surface is the Microsoft touch. We still don't know when that's coming either.

1100
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:06,840
Surface is the tablet. I thought it's in Vegas for slot machines or in Digital Blackjack

1101
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:11,780
and that's it. We had a great, I will say, when we went to PAX08 or whatever, we had

1102
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:16,000
a great bonding time with Bobby sitting around one of those... Was somebody else with us

1103
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,840
too? Maybe for a little bit. I want to say one of the gals from the Bay Area that's also

1104
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,720
podcasting was there with us. But we were having some bonding time around Microsoft

1105
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:31,720
Surface. It was good times. Good times. All right, let's move on. Let's take a look at

1106
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:38,160
release dates in Japan, starting with the Xbox 360. Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning. Hey.

1107
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,760
It's new for Japan coming out of there. I'm assuming this is some type of localized version.

1108
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:50,600
There's also Majiten, Majidetenshe Suksemita in limited and regular edition is coming out

1109
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,840
this week. I'm not sure exactly what this is, but based on some of the screenshots...

1110
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:02,840
Yeah. It's naked anime chicks. Look at that booby. Or excuse me, not booby. Look at that

1111
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,280
booty. Yeah, naked anime girls, but their faces look like they're 12. That is how the

1112
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:15,400
Xbox 360 is going to sell in Japan. That's how you sell a Wii U. That's how you sell

1113
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:20,840
a Wii U right there. Yeah, the little LCD controller is x-ray, so the TV, she's got

1114
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,520
her top on, but then you have the controller and it's... That's how you do it. Nelly's

1115
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:29,760
watching American Idol on the TV. You're watching porn on the Wii U. They had, and I don't remember

1116
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,280
what the hell the game was called, they had a game that came out in the UK. It was on

1117
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:38,800
the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. And it was like one of those, not like a Leisure Sue Larry

1118
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,760
or like a Playboy the Mansion game, but there was something like that where you're picking

1119
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,320
up women and you have to do weird things, you know, to get in their favor. But one of

1120
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,120
the mini games had to do with manipulating their nipples. And what were the nipples?

1121
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:59,940
But the two analog sticks. Wow. That was great. Awesome. Alright, PlayStation 3, big releases

1122
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:06,520
this week. We have Daikokai Jidai Online Second Age. I don't know what game this translates

1123
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,760
to, but there's a regular and limited edition. It looks like some type of online game. I'm

1124
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,760
getting a vibe similar to like a Final Fantasy XI is, or a White Knight Chronicles almost

1125
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,680
even, this kind of looks like to me. But yeah, it's second age, so it's some type of second

1126
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,720
generation MMO I'm just not familiar with from the Japanese name. There's also a game

1127
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:30,000
called Akatsuki no Goei Trinity comes out in also a regular and limited edition this

1128
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:37,480
week in Japan. Eureka Seven AO, Jungfrau no Hanabanatachi game. It's one of those video

1129
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:46,240
game and the hybrid anime disc. F1 2011, Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning, Shin Sangoku Musou Six

1130
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:51,320
Empires, that's Dynasty Warrior if I'm not mistaken. And a new wireless headset from

1131
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,360
Sony is all coming out this week. Big week in Japan there on the PlayStation 3. Yeah,

1132
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,920
they do have a new wireless headset. I'm not really sure what it is though. I just saw

1133
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:03,560
it the other day in her system. Why not? Quickly looking at the handhelds, checking out the

1134
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,800
Vita. Oh, Little Big Planet, that's kind of a big release. That's out in Japan this week.

1135
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:12,320
Little Big Planet and did you say that's coming out here too? Little Big Planet is in a couple

1136
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:18,480
weeks. Damn, I really want to play that. Lastly on the 3DS, nothing this week strangely. Everything's

1137
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,240
next week for the 3DS. Nothing this week. Let's travel to the UK. Alan, are you able

1138
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:31,520
to fill in for Jamie tonight? Yes, over in the UK starting on September 18th, connect

1139
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,080
Nat Geo TV and connect Sesame Street TV. On the 19th of September, Little Big Planet

1140
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:44,120
on the Vita. 20th of September, Rayman Jungle Run on the Android and iPad. Torchlight 2

1141
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:52,960
for PC. September 21st, F1 2012 for PS3, PC and 360. I think this title is being listed

1142
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,800
twice, one in English, one in Japanese, but one piece Kaizoku Musou and also one piece

1143
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:02,720
Pirate Warriors that has the same box art, I'm assuming it's the same game. Borderlands

1144
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:08,960
2, woohoo, on September 21st and that's it for that week. AlphaKananagram in our chat

1145
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,800
room. This is why I love having chatters. Live.vognetwork.com, they set us straight

1146
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,320
when we were wrong. AlphaKananagram says Little Big Planet Vita came out two days ago. Sony

1147
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:25,320
said fuck it and released it early, I'm playing it now. The box version is not. Although I'll

1148
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,320
have to charge them a Vita. I know, I'm like, I'm all about Little Big Planet on the Vita,

1149
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,560
I'm excited about that. Nothing at all is disappointed about. I was just a target today,

1150
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,400
if I'd seen that I would have snatched it up. It's not been released boxed, it's maybe

1151
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,240
digitally. I think somebody broke Street Date. I think GameStop broke Street Date, I seem

1152
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,480
to remember now, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine that said GameStop broke

1153
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,840
Street Date. Oh, I'm not surprised, they do that shit all the time. Oh, but if anyone

1154
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,920
else breaks Street Date, all hell's gonna break loose. Oooh, somebody's bitter over

1155
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,400
there. Well no, seriously, they're the big proponents of not having Street Dates in the

1156
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,120
first place because they have a competitive advantage over everybody else. AlphaKananagram

1157
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:10,120
says I have the boxed version, it's out. BlackWolf says it's only on sale at the Evil G. BlackWolf

1158
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:18,400
said Sony told Evil G to break Street Date. Weird. Fuckers! It's not supposed to be out

1159
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:24,560
for a couple weeks, but okay. Cool. That'll make for an interesting conversation. I'm

1160
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,760
waiting two weeks, I'm not going to You-Know-Where just to get LittleBigPlanet. I'm excited

1161
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:33,000
about LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not that excited. Too bad, Sony, because a great way to get

1162
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,920
my attention would have been to do that before Mr. Pandaria's out. Because if you're gonna

1163
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,440
try and get my attention after Mr. Pandaria's out, yeah, good luck. Who am I kidding, I'll

1164
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,760
still get LittleBigPlanet. Alright, Loki, one more story and then we're gonna get to

1165
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:51,360
the classic game of the week, which I am stealing tonight in Dark Soccer's absence. Alright,

1166
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:59,600
so apparently the developers of the wonderful military game ARMA, Bohemian Interactive,

1167
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:06,640
there's a few employees that have been arrested on spying charges. Apparently they were out

1168
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:12,200
looking for, I guess, buildings and stuff that they can put in their game, so they're

1169
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:25,000
taking photographs and stuff of military installations on the island of Lemnos, Greece. And of course

1170
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:32,680
they were caught and they had the footage and stuff and apparently it's illegal, surprise,

1171
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:43,240
legal to take video and photographs of military installations. So, yeah, that's not good.

1172
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:50,680
And of course, you know, Bohemian Interactive, they've confirmed that yes, they were arrested

1173
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:54,760
during their holiday trip and it says they visited the island with the sole purpose of

1174
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:05,880
experiencing the island's beautiful surroundings and, yeah, that kinda sucks, but I mean, it's

1175
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:11,280
against the law to take pictures of that stuff so maybe you shouldn't. That's crazy. Maybe

1176
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:18,840
you know the Greek military would not like you putting their military installation in

1177
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,200
your game. Just saying. Might not be a good thing. Might not be a good thing. Might not

1178
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:30,240
be good. That's, wow, that's crazy. Alright. Can I tell a true story that's completely

1179
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:36,420
random once? I went to Canada in 2006 with my good friend John at the time. He was my

1180
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,120
roommate when we had the studio in the garage so I can't remember if he ever popped on OLR

1181
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:46,560
or not because he played Final Fantasy and that's about it. But we went to Canada together

1182
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,920
and he's a big picture taker, takes pictures of everything. He'll take pictures of food

1183
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:54,760
at the dinner table, take pictures of signs, whatever. He'll take pictures of everything.

1184
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,680
So we're in the little line waiting at the airport because the plane lands, you have

1185
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,740
to go through customs first before you get to technically enter the country, right? He's

1186
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:08,080
taking pictures in customs. Which, okay, he's being a dumb tourist, whatever. So we get

1187
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:12,960
up to the front and the lady behind the thing is all, it's this one. And the security guard

1188
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,640
comes up and is like, what kind of pictures are you taking? And he's like scared shitless.

1189
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:21,600
And so he's like showing the guy on the camera the pictures he's taken and like the lady

1190
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,880
behind the counter is like, why are you shaking? Why are you nervous? And we're like, fucking

1191
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:31,840
Canada's hardcore. But you know, keep in mind this wasn't, it was only five years after

1192
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,400
a major event that changed the way we travel in many ways. So he was just like, honestly,

1193
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,160
he didn't know better, but like, yeah, they don't fuck around with picture taking and

1194
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,960
stuff like that. Like even though he was just taking picture of like the Canadian and the

1195
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:49,360
U S flags together and the signs and say nothing you or I would think is bad, but they don't

1196
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:52,240
know that. And apparently there's some top secret shit in there. They don't want people

1197
01:39:52,240 --> 01:40:00,200
knowing how the system works or whatever. So the true origin of maple syrup, it's people,

1198
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:09,760
it's people. All right, let's, let's go to a much simpler time when all you needed to

1199
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:17,480
get to Canada was a birth certificate, not a passport. The segment we call the classic

1200
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:22,520
game of the week. Every week, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find

1201
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,400
a game that she says, Hey, you kids ought to be playing this game this week, but she's

1202
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:34,680
not here. So we get to tap into my brain instead tonight. Sometimes Alan will do this. Sometimes

1203
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:39,800
look, you'll do this tonight. I'm doing it. So tonight's classic game of the week is a

1204
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:48,720
real old, old game. Tonight's classic game of the week is pitfall to the lost caverns.

1205
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:54,120
That's right. Um, pitfall to the lost caverns was on a lot of systems back in the eighties.

1206
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:57,960
It dates all the way back to the Atari 2,600. Actually it was the original releases on the

1207
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:05,960
Atari 2,600 from 1984. I remember this game fondly from the Commodore 64 itself, but it

1208
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:10,960
was on a lot of different systems. The 5,200, the Coleco vision, the MSX, the ZX spectrum,

1209
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:16,560
the PC booter. I mean, it was, it was everywhere. Apple two, it was on a lot of different systems.

1210
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:21,600
The reason why I picked pitfall two over pitfall one is that personally I have a lot more fond

1211
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:28,000
memories playing this one. And I think this really lends itself to a lot of the games

1212
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,500
that we have today. Pitfall two was about exploring the cavern. Whereas pitfall one

1213
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:37,520
was really just kind of like a very linear, it was all remember pitfall one was just kind

1214
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,640
of like you didn't, you, you could go down in the cave and skip screens, but it was very

1215
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:46,400
limit linear. Pitfall two really fleshed out that feeling of like, I can go down here and

1216
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,880
then I can backtrack and go back here and get the item I got here to go get the rat

1217
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:57,080
over here. And it was one of the first games on the Atari 2600 to have background music.

1218
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:04,120
A similar piece to the one you're hearing right now from the Commodore 64 version. Pitfall

1219
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:09,340
two was similar to pitfall one, but obviously lost caverns had a lot of different features.

1220
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,840
Pitfall Harry had unlimited time and lives. The original game was limited to, I think

1221
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,640
20 minutes, 30 minutes. So you could never lose the game. You never could actually die.

1222
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,660
Whenever you would get hit, you will just flash back and the sad little music plays

1223
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:28,980
the little sadder music. And he goes back to the red cross and you lose points. So pitfall

1224
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:33,200
two, if you really wanted to be the master, you had to get the best possible score that

1225
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:39,560
would show that you never died. Pitfall two has 27 horizontal levels compared to pitfall

1226
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:45,100
one's two. They're all about the same height, but sometimes there's balloons that will let

1227
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:50,980
you go up to new areas. There are no snakes or crocodiles like there were in pitfall one,

1228
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:58,680
but there are scorpions, there are bats, there's condors, electric eels in the water and frogs.

1229
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:02,720
There was also not just pitfall Harry, but there was his little friends, the mountain

1230
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,480
lion, which was quick claw, and there was Rhonda. And that was the object of the game.

1231
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:11,060
You were trying to save Rhonda, quick claw, and I believe find a diamond ring was like

1232
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:16,520
all that stuff. All those characters ended up appearing on the Saturday Supercade children's

1233
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:22,320
cartoon that's based on pitfall. Rhonda and quick claw were actually created for that

1234
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:26,480
before this game was released about a year sooner. The maximum possible score in the

1235
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:33,040
game 199,000 points. That is different from the Atari eight bit and 52 version that I'll

1236
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:38,360
get into in a minute. You can actually see quick claw, one of the goals of the game,

1237
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,940
you see him right under you when you start the game. So that's kind of cool that like,

1238
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:49,040
that's probably the last thing you'll collect as you're doing the game is that you kind

1239
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,480
of end up where you started. It's kind of a neat little, you know, especially for game

1240
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:57,560
design back in the day, it was kind of neat that you ended up where you started there.

1241
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:01,540
Of course, the soundtrack as well that would change keys and stuff, depending on how well

1242
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:06,040
you're doing, what you're hearing in the background right now is kind of like the heroic theme.

1243
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:09,640
Whenever you collect a treasure, you'll hear a ding and it starts over. If you die, there's

1244
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:15,440
a slower theme that plays. So this was a huge game on the Atari 2600. It was really pushing

1245
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:21,280
the envelope. The hardware was six years old when this game came out, but pitfall two brought

1246
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:27,160
scrolling, detailed animation, and of course the musical score. David Crane actually designed

1247
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:32,960
and patented a display processor chip, which would enhance the 2600 graphics capabilities

1248
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,680
and could process the music in three channels plus drums. They were hoping that this would

1249
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:43,520
push the limits of the Atari 2600, but considering this came out in 84, what else happened around

1250
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,280
that same time? The video game crashed. So this kind of came out when the party was already

1251
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:53,720
over. Now there's another version of the game that's really cool. It's the Adventurers edition.

1252
01:44:53,720 --> 01:45:01,360
This is only available on the 5200 and the Atari 8-bit versions. They remade David Crane's

1253
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:05,960
version and Tom Schoder had to remake the game from the ground up for the Commodore

1254
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:11,680
version. Well, Mike Lorenzen, who did the Atari version, he reused David Crane's code

1255
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:17,640
from the 2600 version. So it's shorted the debugging process. So what did he do? He made

1256
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:22,300
a whole new level in the game, like almost like a second, like a Zelda second quest type

1257
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:29,160
of thing. Well, they came out and said, they being the marketing, they said, no, the two

1258
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:33,360
versions are not allowed to be different because you may think things are bad now where you

1259
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:39,640
have the same game on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. But back in the day, dude, it was

1260
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:47,520
Apple, Commodore, Coleco, Atari, and television. Like you can go find ads from old gaming magazines

1261
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,440
that would show you screenshots from 10 different versions of the game. Yeah, there were usually

1262
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:57,040
anywhere between six to eight valid platforms, really small niche ones during that time.

1263
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,200
Yeah, absolutely. So marketing said, no, you can't have different sections of the game.

1264
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:07,600
So what happened? Well, Brad Fregger, who is the producer, they left it in and made

1265
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:12,560
it an Easter egg. So they just kind of hit it away in the game, but you can get it. So

1266
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:18,040
the new level will have a way more challenging stuff. There's new creatures, rabbit bats

1267
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,360
that fly more erratically. They also will reverse direction. There's also frogs that

1268
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,840
go all the way across the screen. Fire ants and piranha fish were fast creatures as well.

1269
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:35,240
Yeah, all this stuff was new. And then you have to collect different items as well. You

1270
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:40,240
would get a rope, a pot, a trumpet, and a snake charmer. And what happens is that you

1271
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:45,000
get all the way to the last guy and it would scroll across the bottom of the screen. Charming

1272
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,400
the golden rope is Pitfall Harry's only hope. So it brings the game full circle because

1273
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:53,440
if you have the rope, the pot, the trumpet, the snake charmer, then the snake charmer

1274
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:59,080
will play the trumpet and the little rope will raise from the pot and all four of you

1275
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:03,680
escape the cave. So like you and Rhonda and quick law escape the cave. So it really brought

1276
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:07,520
it full circle. So it's kind of funny that this was all a hidden thing that marketing

1277
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:14,080
didn't really want to allow in the beginning. So yeah, very cool. Um, there is also, and

1278
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:19,200
I'll leave it at this. There was an arcade version. Sega made an arcade version in 1985.

1279
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:25,040
It was very different. It looked very cartoonish. It looked very Alex Kidd to me, but it had

1280
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,120
definitely some elements that had some of the similar music. In fact, do we have, I

1281
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:33,880
think I should have here ready? Yes. Here's the Sega version and you can hear it's a little

1282
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:43,400
bit similar here. If we actually fast forward. So it's kind of like similar, but the game

1283
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:48,380
design is very different. It's split up into four stages. There is a timer because it was

1284
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:53,160
an arcade game. Um, and you know, there is kind of a definitive beginning and end that

1285
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,640
doesn't have to do with collecting the same things you did. So it was kind of like they

1286
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:00,560
took the name and the idea and made this completely different type of game out of it. But it's

1287
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,480
worth checking out. That's of course the Sega version of pitfall to the lost caverns that

1288
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:12,660
was out in the arcade. One other port ask of this or a highly inspired by this game,

1289
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:18,360
super pitfall on the NES, not on the super NES on the NES was super pitfall because remember

1290
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:24,420
it was a sequel to an Atari 2,600 game super pitfall on the NES. I bought it the week it

1291
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:28,960
was released or well at that age I convinced my mom to buy it for me when I got straight

1292
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:35,020
A's the week it was released because I was such a fan of pitfall to super pitfall is

1293
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:40,520
absolute fucking garbage. It is one of the worst games they ever released on the NES.

1294
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:45,680
It is buggy as shit. There's flickering. Go look at some of the long plays that are on

1295
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:51,040
YouTube. People walking through walls and shit like waters, water caverns that just

1296
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:56,160
suddenly end and you can fall down a waterfall to like a whole new level things like that.

1297
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:00,960
Like it just doesn't fucking make sense. Like it's one of the, seriously, it is like somebody

1298
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:07,320
pooed in a cartridge and put it out. It is one of the worst NES games they ever made.

1299
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:11,600
And when you're that young or at least in my experience it takes, cause we're not obviously

1300
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:15,760
we weren't as discriminating back then to realize, Oh no, I was, I played it and I was

1301
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:21,840
like, this is fucking garbage. Even as like a 10 year old, I was like, what the shit?

1302
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,640
No, like even the first time I played it was like, that doesn't even look like pitfall

1303
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:36,640
Harry. Who's this blue munchkin with the mustache. Fuck this guy in the hard hat. It was terrible.

1304
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,360
Breakman and chat backing me up. Sky is a million percent correct. Super pitfalls, one

1305
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:46,040
of the worst games ever made. It is such garbage. I would love for some month on the show to

1306
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:51,800
have Jamie change the segment and do the unclassic game of the week. And I'll tell you super

1307
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:56,800
pitfalls, one of the worst games that ought to be featured. Anyhow, let's not focus on

1308
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,040
the bad. Let's go back to the good. If you're going to play an Atari 2,600 game at some

1309
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:05,280
point in your life, cause you know, maybe you weren't born yet when the Atari 2,600

1310
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,800
was kind of a big deal. Go play pitfall two. It was a great game that really pushed the

1311
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:17,880
envelope for the technology of the Atari 2,600. All right, let's move on and take a break.

1312
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:21,040
We're going to take a break and when we come back, we have plenty more show to come, which

1313
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:25,720
is great cause part A was two hours. So we're going to come back with some rapid fire news,

1314
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,580
the frugal question of the week, as well as more news stories, including a really interesting

1315
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:34,280
Microsoft patent we've got to talk about when we come back. Your emails, FUs of the week,

1316
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:38,880
Twitter topics and more, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

1317
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:45,520
this.

1318
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:51,600
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 473rd episode for this September

1319
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:57,040
the 16th of 2012. Kind of a long show so far, but lots of talk this week about the news

1320
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:01,400
on Wii U and all that good stuff in part A. And then there was other stuff too. I don't

1321
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:05,960
even think Loki has gotten to officially talk about earth defense sports, the new one yet.

1322
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:13,200
Is that even on the show? Roll? How did that happen? I know it is a crime. All right. Also

1323
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,840
not here tonight. Dark Sakura. She has the night off because of the holiday for her religion.

1324
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,520
So happy Rosh Hashanah to those of you celebrating and Yom Kippur because I know that's coming

1325
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:29,360
up as well. Again, for those joining us a little late live, just kind of a footnote.

1326
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:34,640
There is no live OLR next week. We are going to tape in advance, however, so that way you

1327
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:39,440
do still have a new show next week. Podcast listeners, you won't notice a thing different

1328
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:43,480
except the fact that the show is taped a little bit early. So the news might be just a couple

1329
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:47,720
days behind, but you should still have the same great show and Dark Sakura will be back

1330
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:53,840
for that taping on Thursday. Let's see. Did I cover everything? I think so. I think we're

1331
01:51:53,840 --> 01:52:00,160
getting ready to get back to it with some rapid fire news. So Loki. All right. So we

1332
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:08,560
talk about Kickstarter, you know, regularly, and there's a new Kickstarter for from a developer

1333
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:14,320
that you might recognize, Obsidian, you know, famous for Knights of the Old Republic 2,

1334
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,120
Neverwhere Nights, Fallout New Vegas, the new South Park game is going to be coming

1335
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:27,720
out. Well, there's kickstarting a new project called Project Eternity for PC. It's a new

1336
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:35,200
MMO, kind of like a fantasy world game, and their goal was to raise 1.1 million dollars,

1337
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:40,040
and they pretty much have already hit their goal. Actually, they already have hit their

1338
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:46,240
goal and they're going beyond that now to the stretch goals, but, you know, so if you

1339
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:50,960
want to back them up and check out what they have to offer as far as, you know, what the

1340
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:58,040
game's going to be about, cool. And I know I remember reading a tweet that Notch had,

1341
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:04,960
you know, kicked him, I think, 10 grand or something, so that's kind of cool. Yeah. And

1342
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:11,040
then of course if you're into some time waster stuff, there's a cool Flash game that was

1343
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:21,000
created by a Russian programmer named, or calling himself DJ Smart, and it's a Pac-Man

1344
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:28,880
game with a portal gun, Pac-Man portal, and you can check it out on his website, or actually

1345
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:36,200
it's a website at IndieGames.com slash 2012 slash 09 slash freeware game, pick Pac-Man

1346
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:42,240
port. I'm sure you can just search for portal Pac-Man, or Pac-Man portal in Google and find

1347
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:47,840
it just as well. It's kind of neat, you can teleport around the map. And then last but

1348
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:53,800
not least, brand new update is going to be coming to the Playstation 3 very soon, 4.25,

1349
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,600
and that's going to be the update, of course, that's going to give the increased storage

1350
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:00,840
space for Playstation Plus. I think it rolled out this week. Yeah. I think my Playstation

1351
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:07,560
grabbed it. So it's one gig space instead of what it was previously, and of course save

1352
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:13,200
game data is going to be increased as well. Nice. Alright, well the Wii U wasn't the only

1353
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:18,120
console that had some news this week. Remember the Neo Geo? We've been following this a little

1354
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,560
bit. I know this isn't the first time we've talked to this new Neo Geo coming out, but

1355
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:27,480
there is going to be the Neo Geo X standalone system. It's going to be $130. This is different

1356
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:32,440
from the $200 gold version that has a charging dock and joystick. If all you want is kind

1357
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:36,760
of the bare bones, little portable Neo Geo X thing that I believe, if I remember right,

1358
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,640
you can hook it up to a television through the system as well. Probably. Kind of like

1359
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:44,440
some of those bootleg Nintendos that are coming more and more prevalent you see now. What

1360
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:49,240
was that one you got me called? I can't remember the name of that thing now. The FC Mobile?

1361
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:54,760
Is that it? Something like that? Anyhow, if you just want the little handheld device itself,

1362
01:54:54,760 --> 01:55:03,120
it will be $130. This is a Neo Geo that comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo games. So, you could

1363
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:08,760
spend that money on a Neo Geo X, 20 games, or almost have enough money for a Wii U tablet

1364
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:16,000
in Japan. We're gonna buy a Dingu and it plays the same stuff. The Dingu ate my baby. Double

1365
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,320
Dragon Neon. If you are listening live to Orange Lounge Radio, you heard a song or two

1366
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:26,200
from the soundtrack during the break. If you are on the podcast, sadly, I can't replay

1367
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:30,480
the songs due to rights issues during the break, but good news, you can get the soundtrack

1368
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:38,440
for free. Check that out. It is available for free on the site Bandcamp, vert.bandcamp.com

1369
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:44,160
slash album slash double dash dragon dash neon. That link is floating around the internet.

1370
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:49,560
Here's the thing though, you can contribute however much you want. You can put a big fat

1371
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:54,800
zero in that box if you want, but you know, if you have the money to chip in or you find

1372
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,840
you do enjoy the soundtrack, maybe go back and, you know, give a couple bucks to this

1373
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:04,800
guy who's basically making the soundtrack free. It's not just remakes of the old songs.

1374
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:10,800
There's also like inspired music from the eighties. Like there was definitely a song

1375
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,440
in that first stage that sounded like it was heart or some shit playing in the background.

1376
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:21,740
It was great. It's great. So good job. Uh, that is Jake Kaufman who goes by vert, which

1377
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:28,520
is why it's on vert.bandcamp.com and I definitely wanted to tip the hat to this at some point

1378
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:32,720
tonight. I think this is a great cause and I know we have a variety of different people

1379
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:37,440
that listen to OLR and I know for a fact that there's some people out there who are, um,

1380
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:42,640
facing some disability in their gaming. Perhaps, you know, it's, it's that they are blind,

1381
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:46,980
can't see at all, or I've heard of some folks that are, you know, unable to use, you know,

1382
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:50,480
all of their limbs or, you know, some of the other things that people take for granted

1383
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:56,420
sometimes. Well, the AbleGamers Foundation created a 48 page document that they want

1384
01:56:56,420 --> 01:57:01,920
to have be a how to guide for developers and publishers on how to create more accessible

1385
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:07,620
games. In a quote from founder Mark Barlett, quote, we are gamers first. To us, that means

1386
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:12,200
the core of the game should never be changed or altered in any way. Our mission has been

1387
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:16,880
and always will be to include as many accessibility options for those who need them that are also

1388
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,820
invisible to those who don't. And I love this. They actually put like a little screenshot

1389
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:27,680
of Bejeweled 3 and they say, this is what Bejeweled 3 looks like to, you know, the,

1390
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:32,520
the most gamer, gamers that don't face a visual disability. But then they show, this is what

1391
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:36,840
it looks like to somebody who can only see in black and white. This is what is some,

1392
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,240
this is what it looks like to somebody who has red color blind or blue color blind or

1393
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:44,280
whatever it is, green color blind. It shows kind of the different ways the screens look.

1394
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:48,080
And I think that's a great way to get somebody to, you know, think about their game. And

1395
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:53,280
I love this. In the PDF document, they actually show like a list. They actually show like

1396
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:58,360
a checklist of, you know, keep this checklist handy. This is what your game should have.

1397
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:04,800
And it's things like remappable buttons. I, I don't even really face a disability. I'm

1398
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,160
very thankful that, you know, I'm fortunate and lucky that, you know, I don't have these

1399
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:13,320
same challenges that other people do in their lives. But even I can appreciate a game with

1400
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:18,880
remappable buttons. Cause damn, sometimes you look at the default controls and you're

1401
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,520
like, why is the game this way? Or sometimes you have a joystick that, you know, a controller

1402
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:28,040
or whatever, that a button wears out on it. Like my wired controller, for some reason

1403
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:34,760
these Microsoft controllers, the wired ones, uh, the L3 button breaks a lot. So it'd be

1404
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:39,140
cool to remap that. And AbleGamers believes everybody should be able, every game should

1405
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:42,940
have remappable buttons, which just makes sense. And then it's other things like sometimes,

1406
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:47,400
you know, like think about the Vita. When the Vita first came out, if you're blind,

1407
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:52,920
you can't use a touch screen the same way, you know, somebody that can see can. So why

1408
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,080
on earth would you not make it so that, or why on earth would you make it so you can't

1409
01:58:57,080 --> 01:59:02,000
use the controller to choose? Well, thankfully the Vita patched that in in their last patch,

1410
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,560
but it was because of response like this, undoubtedly. So anyway, I know I spent a little

1411
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,920
time on that, but I thought, uh, that was a great, great document that they put out

1412
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:15,080
that I do think every game developer company out there ought to have a little printed copy

1413
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:19,200
of it somewhere for reference. I think it would be a good thing. Alan, are you going

1414
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:24,760
to go with your rapid fire stories? Uh, yes. Just get the thing when it beeps. Yep. I will.

1415
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:31,880
You got it. Um, Terraria game sold 1.6 million on PC. Most of that probably through steam

1416
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:40,160
is coming to XBLA and a PlayStation network in early 2013. And I have Terraria. I've only

1417
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:45,040
really tinkered with it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but I know that it's, I don't want

1418
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:48,780
to say that it's a 2d Minecraft, but it's, it's an adventure game with a lot of building

1419
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:55,020
and exploration. You dig into tunnels and you find monsters and it's just a really huge

1420
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:58,600
indie hit from the last, I think two years. You have Terraria, right? Didn't you, didn't

1421
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,760
you have a bunch of people trying to do it? I do. I bought it for like three other people

1422
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:07,080
too. I doubt, I bet none of them are playing it. Yeah. So Terraria, if you're a Terraria

1423
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:15,160
fan, it's the graphics are very cutesy super nest, 16 bit pixely cute, cute look. Uh, Bobby

1424
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:21,040
Blackwolf in our chat room says the Terraria hardcore are pissed about this news. Oh, this

1425
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:26,320
is right up there with the Bayonetta 2 being on the Wii U. Someone's cool kids club is

1426
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:33,360
having its pretension barriers lifted. We have a saying and it's deal with it and then

1427
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:37,000
shades will fall from the sky and fall right on your nose. Yeah. Sorry that I'm not a part

1428
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,760
of the cult of Terraria, but it's, you know, what was it you said earlier? Go pee your

1429
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:50,160
bed. Yeah. Go, go pee your bed. Um, what else do I have? Uh, a shifty look. I'm not sure

1430
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:57,360
who that is. Uh, there's a Katamari web comic coming out by them and the art direction looks

1431
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:04,080
great. It looks very weird and silly like, like Katamari does. And, uh, September, oh,

1432
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:09,080
this is already out or no tomorrow actually. Um, the new Katamari web comic will debut

1433
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:13,400
on shifty look.com on September 17th, 2012. So that's tomorrow. It's a free to read series

1434
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:20,640
based on the popular junk rolling package flashing Namco Bandai gaming franchise. It

1435
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:24,640
will be updated twice a week. So yeah, if you're into Katamari, there's going to be

1436
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:30,000
an official, um, it looks like this is a, Namco doesn't have a problem with it, a web

1437
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,020
comic for you to read and enjoy. And there's a, um, I can paste the link into chat and

1438
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:40,640
you can see what the art is going to look like. Um, my last quick fire news story is,

1439
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,040
uh, people are wondering, especially with Capcom, I guess the story we covered last

1440
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:51,360
week about Mega Man had too many competing franchises that were stealing sales from each

1441
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:55,220
other. So not one single franchise was selling well. And it's like, okay, well who's fucking

1442
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:00,640
fault was that Capcom? And there's a rumor that a new Mega Man game may be on the 25th

1443
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:06,720
anniversary. Um, Capcom says, don't get your hopes up. Uh, I know Rob was theorizing that

1444
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:10,360
they're going to just reboot Mega Man altogether. They're going to reboot it with a new creative

1445
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:17,200
person watch, watch. So yeah, the 25th anniversary is looming and people are like saying Capcom's

1446
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:24,520
gonna do something, but Capcom used to be that cool. They're not that cool anymore.

1447
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:28,320
If they were going to release it, they were gonna, they would have announced it by now.

1448
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:32,960
Let me go back to your Terraria story for a minute here. Cause Black Wolf gives a further

1449
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:40,240
insight. I did not frequent the fan community, so I did not see why they were so mad, but

1450
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:47,120
Black Wolf says there may be some justification for the bedwetting and he says the short version,

1451
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:52,640
the devs stopped supporting the PC version, said they weren't making any more updates.

1452
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:56,440
Then they announced a console version with new features. That stank. Okay. That is a

1453
02:02:56,440 --> 02:03:05,200
little stank. So that's, that's them pooping the bed, not you peeing it. Who pooped the

1454
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:21,000
bed. Terraria developers did. All right, let's move on with the Fugal question of the week.

1455
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,360
Every week we ask you guys a question on our fan communities on Facebook as well as Google

1456
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:30,040
plus. If you want to find us on Google plus, well, there's no short links on Google plus.

1457
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:34,080
So just search for orange lounge radio. We'll come right up. If you want to find us on Facebook,

1458
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:42,200
Facebook, excuse me, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. This week's Fugal question of

1459
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,960
the week. It's all about the Wii U because we haven't talked enough about it during the

1460
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:49,000
show. Did the Nintendo Wii U conference this week change your mind on if you wanted a Wii

1461
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
U or not at this point, are you planning on buying a Wii U between November 18th and the

1462
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,800
end of the year? Retertainment says on Google plus, I want to buy a Wii U, but it probably

1463
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:04,160
won't happen until after the end of the year. He has other priorities. Act Def says one

1464
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:08,800
still not sold completely on the system. So I'll wait at least a year to get one and see

1465
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:13,160
what games will be released and see if the system is definitely worth a purchase or not.

1466
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:18,880
That's what I'm currently doing with the 3DS. Flaco Jones replied on Google plus and says

1467
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,800
it convinced me that they're going to have more games on the system than just the Nintendo

1468
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:28,320
staples. I could see myself buying one a year from now. If they start getting the multi-platform

1469
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:33,520
games at the same time and if the price goes down or built-in memory goes way up, they

1470
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,680
also need to bundle in a remote plus. There are just too many hidden costs for me to afford

1471
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:42,260
one at launch. That was an interesting response because he says it convinced me that they're

1472
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:48,080
going to have this new stuff, but I'll consider it a year from now, which to be fair, there's

1473
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:51,660
a lot of people that are in that boat. I don't exactly blame him with that one. Let's go

1474
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:54,880
over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there. There were a lot of answers

1475
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:59,320
on Facebook. I'm not going to be able to get through all these, so I apologize in advance.

1476
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:03,240
If you want to see all the answers, go to facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and

1477
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:08,480
I'm going to have to shorten a lot of these to even get through some of them. Don't hear

1478
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,560
me wrong though. We love the fact that so many people are responding. Llama Juice says

1479
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,580
I went to a Nintendo event about a week ago where they let a small group of people in

1480
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:20,320
and play the Wii U stuff. Oh yeah, we had somebody call in on that a little while ago.

1481
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:23,440
After an hour and a half with the system, I came to the conclusion it's not a system

1482
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:30,000
I want, but a system I'd want to play at a friend's house. Critical Myth from our Monday,

1483
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,480
Wednesday, Friday show at Voicy Geeks Network replied and said the Wii was fun for a couple

1484
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:38,680
weeks until it became apparent that the controls were too much trouble compared to the PS3

1485
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:43,760
or 360. The Wii U takes that to the next level and doesn't have compelling excuses. We're

1486
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:49,120
going to pass. Dark Charger says as an owner of all current consoles and handhelds, I will

1487
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:54,480
eventually pick up a Wii U, but I see no reason to pick one up at launch. Few games in the

1488
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:58,960
launch window interest me, and history tells us that some of those will invariably get

1489
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:03,340
delayed. I have no doubt there will be an exclusive that will compel a purchase sometime

1490
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:10,640
next year. Probably Bayonetta 2. Kevin S. replied and said I'd rather purchase an Ouya.

1491
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:15,520
Nintendo ruined it for me. $100 is feasible. Kind of wish the answer was longer there.

1492
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:20,880
I want to know more about the reasoning behind that answer because, you know, $100 is feasible

1493
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,840
for a new system. I don't, like, you know, I'm not dismissing the answer. I'm just saying

1494
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,320
I'm like, oh, I wish he'd written more because I want to know more about like, why does the

1495
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:36,560
Ouya stand out? Is it just the price? Anyhow, Stan replied and said, I'm sold. First Pikmin

1496
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,560
3 was announced and I'm sure a new Mario Kart and Smash Brothers will come out and Bayonetta

1497
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:47,720
2 on top of that. As Fry would say, shut up and take my money. Uh, Tiara said, I'm still

1498
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:51,720
not interested, especially for the price point. If there's a drastic price cut like there

1499
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:56,320
was with the 3DS, I may invest at a later point, but right now it's not worth the money.

1500
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:00,760
Uh, Joe Vidaia says, with what I spent on the Wii and all the games that I own and don't

1501
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:05,400
play on that system, my answer is no. While I love to Bayonetta, I can't see the second

1502
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:10,600
one doing so well on Wii U that it stays an exclusive past the launch date. I do want

1503
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:14,040
to clarify though, even though a lot of people are theorizing that Nintendo is publishing

1504
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:19,300
it, it will not be on any other system. Not gonna happen. Uh, so far that's the only game

1505
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:26,480
mention that I care about. Um, Kareem J. replied and said, short answer, no. Storage is so

1506
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:31,000
cheap now, I don't know why Nintendo didn't opt for a 16 gig version instead of a 32 gig

1507
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,040
version. No one starts at 8 anymore. Even Apple moved away from that storage capacity.

1508
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:42,640
250 pounds for an 8 gig device, excuse me, 250 euros for an 8 gig device. Give me a break.

1509
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:48,880
Uh, Acidic Vampire says, no, not enough Imagine Babies games. Just wait. Imagine Babies will

1510
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:53,760
happen. Give it time, man. Give it time. Give it time. Um, Gamer Girl says, I'm not sure

1511
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:58,920
if I want one just yet. Might wait a while before deciding. Uh, besides if I get one

1512
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:02,780
now, I'll just regret it later. I kind of want to wait for the price to drop and more

1513
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:07,840
games added to the library. Kind of learned my lesson to the Wii. Don't get me wrong,

1514
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:12,560
but it's lacking in titles. James S. replied and said, hi guys, I'm new to OLR. Thanks

1515
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:16,680
to Stitcher. Well, thank you. And thank you Stitcher where you can hear us by the way

1516
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:21,760
on Stitcher Radio, which is in some ways kind of like where podcasting is going right now

1517
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,840
is apps like Stitcher and TuneIn and all that, especially with podcasting becoming its own

1518
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:30,480
app. But that's a discussion for another day. Welcome to the show. And here's the answer.

1519
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:34,860
The inclusion of Platinum Games announcement that Bayonetta 2 will be a Wii U exclusive

1520
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:39,520
intrigues me. And I have no doubt that there will be many more surprises from Nintendo

1521
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:44,640
to come, but I just don't believe quite yet that these justify a purchase. We just need

1522
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:50,160
that extra oomph from Nintendo, a AAA in-house exclusive for launch day. Sigh. That rumored

1523
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:53,800
Zelda A Link to the Past remake and or sequel would have been enough to warrant a purchase

1524
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:58,360
for me. But as of right now, I'll hold off just for a little while longer. Love the show.

1525
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:05,040
Keep it up. He wants to throw in a plug. Why not? Plug plug search James Anthony on Amazon

1526
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:11,720
Kindle for my 99 cent highly rated horror comedy books. Fine. I will give a listener

1527
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:17,840
a shout out. Back to the answer though. It's it's actually a real similar answer to where

1528
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:23,480
I'm at. To be honest, it's almost exactly what I said earlier, right? Bayonetta 2 fucking

1529
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:28,960
great. Not enough. So there you go. Those are the answers on Facebook.com slash orange

1530
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,160
launch radio. I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them all. There was just like 20 of

1531
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:37,160
them and that's a lot. So go read them. Facebook.com slash orange launch radio and then answer

1532
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:43,560
next week's when it comes up. Tiger Claws says he made a quick link for the orange launch

1533
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:48,440
radio Google plus page. I didn't even know that was a thing you could do. G plus dot

1534
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:53,520
two slash orange launch radio. Well, thank you. It's much, much easier for me to give

1535
02:09:53,520 --> 02:10:00,280
out than say, go to Google and search for it. Fantastic. All right. That's it for the

1536
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:06,000
frugal question of the week. And just to clarify, if there was any question here in studio,

1537
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,040
are you buying a Wii U? Did the conference change your mind? Loki, not buying a Wii U

1538
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:16,600
did not change anything. Uh, Alan, sorry. I know you're mid bite there on that delicious

1539
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:22,240
quesadilla, but your thoughts, man, like I said earlier, I don't care enough. Me. I am

1540
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:26,480
still on the fence. I really am. It is going to come down to how much extra money do I

1541
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:31,000
have burning a hole in my pocket around that time. I'm thinking probably not right away.

1542
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,820
I just think I'm trying to save for other life priorities right now. I just don't know,

1543
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:44,080
but I could still be convinced Nintendo tell me that it has zero games coming in 2013 and

1544
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:51,720
I'll be like, be mania two DX volumes one through 15. Yeah. Right. Don't get my hopes

1545
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:57,360
up. All right. Be mania two DX was a great game. It's too bad that it's kind of a shadow

1546
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,880
of what it used to be. But anyway, that's for another day. Hey, Loki, why don't we get

1547
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:06,840
it back into some news? All right. So let's talk a little bit about, um, some wonderful

1548
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:15,680
new hopefully soon tech from Microsoft. They patented a new immersive display experience.

1549
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:23,280
Basically, the way it works is it in conjunction with like connect, it would project a display

1550
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:29,440
on your walls, kind of like a projector would. Um, I've actually saw some, um, they have

1551
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:35,020
a video, um, that they showed off. I think it was a couple of years ago or whatever similar

1552
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:40,240
type of thing. It was during one of their campus tours, um, kind of talking a little

1553
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:45,640
bit about home automation stuff. And the way it works is they in conjunction with the camera,

1554
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:50,760
it will detect, you know, different movements you're doing, but it also kind of adjust for

1555
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:55,880
your room. Like, for example, they were talking about game applications that it would correct

1556
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:59,780
the perspective of the scene based on the objects you have in your room. So if there's

1557
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:02,960
like a chair or something like that, it'll know that the chair is there and it'll adjust

1558
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:08,720
the perspective of whatever objects being, uh, mapped onto it so that it looks like one

1559
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:13,680
seamless thing, which is pretty awesome. And, um, you know, some other applications they

1560
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:22,560
showed in that, uh, kind of the campus tour that they did, uh, in May 2011, it was kind

1561
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:29,280
of like a more windows based, more just kind of like computing. One example was a kid's

1562
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:35,160
room or something. They had, you know, a completely interactive display on their walls based.

1563
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:40,880
It was all projector and it had like, you know, tweets and social networking stuff was

1564
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:45,380
popping up on the wall and, you know, they could, you know, make a gesture or whatever

1565
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:51,920
and pull up music and, you know, just the interface was really huge and kind of cool.

1566
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,240
Very immersive, I guess. You know, there's a part of me that wants to say this is full

1567
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:01,280
of shit. This is the same thing we heard about the revolution in 2006. Remember when the

1568
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:06,360
Wii was going to be called the revolution, LOL? And, um, we talked about it was going

1569
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:11,120
to be fucking holograms in your room. That was one. Go back and listen to the shows from

1570
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:15,520
2006. That was one of the rumors about the Nintendo Wii was that it was going to do holograms

1571
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,400
and all this shit. So here we kind of go again, I feel like in a way, but the way you describe

1572
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:28,640
it, it doesn't sound far off from where Microsoft's going. There's a lot with it that I can dig.

1573
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:34,320
And if you think about it, we've kind of had that technology before where you can have

1574
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:39,080
like a thing that projects images on kids' walls and stuff. Like that's how you have

1575
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:44,160
like the dancing circus animals and stuff. Like it's a very, very basic, well, even,

1576
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:47,200
even if you're cutouts, right? And a little bit more practical than that, you know, they

1577
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:53,000
have the projectable keyboards and stuff that you can get for PDAs and stuff like that where,

1578
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,480
you know, it projects an image down on the ground and, you know, you type on it like

1579
02:13:57,480 --> 02:14:02,200
you would a keyboard and it will interact with, you know, what you're doing. And that's

1580
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:06,360
what they kind of show too with like different surfaces and stuff. And definitely worth checking

1581
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:11,840
out the video for it. I mean, it's seriously, uh, it's seriously cool looking. They had

1582
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:18,800
it on MS, uh, was it, uh, I think it was an MSN or something, but it's like a seven minute

1583
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:23,400
long video. If you skip like five minutes into it and it shows, I hadn't seen this before.

1584
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:27,880
Oh, dammit. It wants me to put on Silverlight. Can I do this other one? This is only like

1585
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:32,400
a minute. Uh, that will still work. It's showing some of the stuff, but it's not the, not the

1586
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:35,960
interactive one I was telling you about, but see, it gives you the idea. See how the room

1587
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:41,680
is whole integrated into it. Uh, that looks like the interventions building at Disney

1588
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:45,480
land, the type of stuff that's in there. That makes sense. I mean, it's one of those things

1589
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,840
where it's like, okay, it's not going to be like the holodeck from Star Trek. It doesn't

1590
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:55,140
look that good. It looks like projections on a wall, but it's kind of, kind of rad in

1591
02:14:55,140 --> 02:15:00,400
a real sci-fi kind of way. You know? Yeah. I mean, I mean, if imagine if you will, like,

1592
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:04,300
you know, your apartment here, you just have this thing that's in the middle of the room

1593
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:11,040
and you're interacting with, you know, the entire room as like, as you're basically your

1594
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:15,000
display. I mean, you could pop in, you know, okay, I want to play Minecraft on this wall

1595
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,740
and I want my tweets on this wall and I want, I'm going to put, you know, windows media

1596
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:23,440
player on this wall or this little section right here. Or I want, I want this, I'm gonna

1597
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:27,680
make a fake poster that's going to be right here and this is going to update with my friend's

1598
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:32,000
pictures on Facebook or something like that. You could do all that. So that'd be kind of

1599
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:40,000
cool. Xbox fill my walls with boobies. Yes, I can. That is one of the things that I am.

1600
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,040
Loki could walk into a spare bedroom that could be his wall of boobies, his booby palace

1601
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:51,000
and just projections of boobies all over the wall or bouncing in slow motion. That'd be

1602
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,140
awesome. No, but even Nellie would be kind of like that or, or you could do like the

1603
02:15:55,140 --> 02:16:03,440
whole matrix thing, girl, Xbox guns. I'm going to need more guns, but that could be in a

1604
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:08,000
game. It would be awesome. That would be awesome. It would be very sweet. Mm two K in our chat

1605
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,760
room at live.vognetwork.com. Bringing up a good point though, before we get too carried

1606
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:17,560
away. Cool looking, but is it cool playing? I think it'd be cool. I mean, cause you can

1607
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:23,240
use it with pretty much anything. You would, it, it's just a display. To be fair, the connect

1608
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:27,840
looked really cool at first, but there's like two types of games for it. Well, yes, the

1609
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:32,120
tech right now for the connect is terrible. I'm gonna say right now it's terrible, but

1610
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:37,680
and even the PC version slightly better, but it right now it's terrible. But next iteration

1611
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:44,320
of it may be better. It's just like, you know, the place, the itoy camera, the itoy was crap

1612
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:50,280
and the PlayStation eye is less crappy, but it's still not quite there. But the technology

1613
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:55,120
is growing so fast that this is going to be possible probably. Well, how they're already,

1614
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,160
it's possible now cause they're showing. What I want to know is how the fuck is everything

1615
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:03,480
projecting on things. Cause projectors aren't cheap. So I want to know what kind of hardware

1616
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:07,120
I got to have. I got to mount a fucking thing to my roof or something. I mean, how's this

1617
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,440
going to work? Don't get me wrong. I'm going to mount a fucking thing on my roof if I can

1618
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:15,040
do that shit. You know, the technology will always be glitchy. Like if you tried to do

1619
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:20,460
that thing where you're like Xbox guns, well, it'll probably think you said Xbox nuns and

1620
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:24,280
there'll be people praying all over your walls for your soul. It wasn't even that it was

1621
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:30,080
still motion censored and stuff, but I don't think the voice commands are going to be necessary.

1622
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:33,520
You know, if they've got a, you better connect because I think a lot of the voice commands

1623
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:38,860
now are because connect doesn't really read you very well. It doesn't really listen to

1624
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:44,240
you very well either, but yeah, I don't know. It'll work. All right, well meanwhile, while

1625
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:49,860
Microsoft is working on, you know, projecting boobies on your wall, uh, we have the 3DS

1626
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:53,960
that is working on getting Game Boy advanced games possibly in the eShop. This is all a

1627
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:59,680
rumor right now. However, I mean Game Boy advanced games on the 3DS are nothing new.

1628
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:03,360
There was the ambassador program and we did have some games that came out on that. If

1629
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:08,640
you were a 3DS early adopter, you got some pretty fucking good Game Boy advanced games,

1630
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:12,640
all things considered. Like there was the Metroid, um, not zero mission, but the other

1631
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:19,560
one, Metroid fusion. There was, uh, the super Mario brothers, uh, super Mario world to Yoshi's

1632
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:26,480
adventure remake, which I think was advanced for, I can't, I've lost count. Um, but yeah,

1633
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:29,480
you had a lot of those games, fire emblem. There was a lot of good stuff that was a part

1634
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:36,040
of the ambassador program. Well, um, apparently Nintendo Australia's eShop software page was

1635
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:41,960
recently updated and it added a Game Boy advanced category to the virtual console spread. The

1636
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:47,720
only title that was listed there was Dr. Mario. Yes. In the classic NES version. That's kind

1637
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:51,840
of weird though, because like, why would they put that there instead of just a regular NES

1638
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:56,180
game? Could it have been the Game Boy advanced version of the Nintendo game, which seems

1639
02:18:56,180 --> 02:19:01,520
really redundant? I don't know, but there it is. Um, it's possible that, uh, Nintendo

1640
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:06,440
Australia may have, uh, spilled the beans on that. I mean, it makes sense. Although

1641
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:11,520
didn't they say at one point, these games will never come out for sale. And I think

1642
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:16,840
we all sat here going, yeah, sure. Yeah, right. They will come out for sale at some point,

1643
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:21,080
but it's not like there aren't a lot of advanced games that are worth coming out on virtual

1644
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:25,160
console again. I mean, the Game Boy advances is aging pretty quick here. We're at 10 years

1645
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:29,720
ago at this point. So I remember when I bought my advance, I was, I was still back in the

1646
02:19:29,720 --> 02:19:33,800
days when I was first getting into DDR. So, uh, systems kind of old, there's still a lot

1647
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:42,280
of great games that I think would sell for 3DS. So that's that. Just a few more news

1648
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:46,620
stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag and soon the Skype line at 1 877 game

1649
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:52,040
O L R or our username on Skype. If you want to add us orange lounge radio, all one word,

1650
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:59,240
but first Alan, he's given me all the valve stories today. I know you're a fan. Yes. Black

1651
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:04,880
Mesa, McPixel and others, uh, are the first to pass through their green light as steam's

1652
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:10,520
green light program. It's basically a indie developers pay a one time fee to kind of keep

1653
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:13,860
the amount of crap submissions down. That was a story we covered last week to have their

1654
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:18,920
game be say, Hey, we want to distribute this on steam please. Cause it's pretty much the

1655
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:24,640
best digital platform for buying games in existence right now. So vote for our game

1656
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:30,080
and the 10 titles that have passed the gauntlet and gotten the amount of votes that they needed

1657
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:37,920
was Black Mesa Source, Cry of Fear, Dream, Heroes and Generals, Kenshi, McPixel, No More

1658
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:45,000
Room in Hell, Project Zomboid, Routine, and finally a game called Towns. These games will

1659
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,240
be released independently in the months ahead as they are in varying stages of completion.

1660
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:56,320
A valid spokesman has said, um, I actually checked for Ospher in chat. Black Mesa Source

1661
02:20:56,320 --> 02:21:01,240
is not yet on steam green light because a big reason for that could be because the last

1662
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:07,760
stage of it, like the last 10% of the game Zen isn't in it yet. And this is pure speculation

1663
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:13,040
on my part, but it could be that because the game, obviously the game is being downloaded

1664
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,880
everywhere on their actual website. Um, it could be that valve could be like, you've

1665
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:21,400
already said that this game isn't completely done. So however long that takes. But, um,

1666
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:26,600
yeah, some of these games should start appearing and be, be searchable through the steam store.

1667
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:31,920
These are the first 10 to make it. Fantastic. Well, congrats to those games. Now we need

1668
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:37,360
to convince Aaron to put bungee ferret tossing as a part of this project green light thing

1669
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:42,000
so we can get bungee ferret tossing on steam. It's too bad that the Xbox indie games don't

1670
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:47,360
support connect. It is too bad, isn't it? Cause we could actually toss, could have been

1671
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:50,360
an Easter egg in the game, except I don't think, I don't think Aaron wants to put porn

1672
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:57,920
in his game. So sadly, uh, but we'll take what we can get. Uh, also I wanted to say,

1673
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:01,200
I just wanted to put a shout out out there. Um, we already talked about how bungee ferret

1674
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:05,560
tossing is coming out on Monday. Apparently you can get the soundtrack is out now for

1675
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:10,320
six bucks on Amazon. Just search for it. Bungee ferret tossing. I can't believe that some

1676
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:14,600
silly idea here on orange lounge radio is now turning into a media empire, but there

1677
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:20,520
is an official soundtrack for six bucks. It looks like Dan period is the guy that wrote

1678
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:24,000
do do we want to play like a little snippet of some of the music from a bungee ferret

1679
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:35,760
tossing here? Here's a song called jungle war. That sounds like a good title. That sounds

1680
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:40,440
like a bungee tail or excuse me, a ferret tail whipping really quick. Say who's dogs

1681
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:53,920
barking. That's good though. That's very, very professional. Love it. Like the eighties

1682
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:57,800
power guitar in there. So you can check that out on amazon.com right now. Thank you for

1683
02:22:57,800 --> 02:23:02,480
giving me an excuse to somehow inadvertently plug bungee ferret tossing again. But yes,

1684
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:11,360
project green light. Congrats to those developers. Yes. Oh, um, weird. Excuse me. Um, steams.

1685
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:16,880
What's it called? The thing that you can picture big picture. Yeah. I clicked on that and it

1686
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:22,320
made my monitor like not spaz out or anything, but it made my system run really slow. And

1687
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:26,040
then it's like, oh, you're supposed to hook this up to your TV. That's for people that

1688
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:29,920
like Dan and Jamie have their computer on their TVs. They can watch youtubes and stuff.

1689
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:35,600
Yeah. But my TV already has an HDMI on it. So why wouldn't I just run an HDMI from my

1690
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:39,720
PC to the TV? That's what they want you to do. That's what they want you to do. But it's,

1691
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:43,000
it makes it so that you're not like windows cause it looks different on a TV. It's like

1692
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,120
all full screen basically. Like it looks more like a console, I guess is the trick. Got

1693
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,880
it. Whatever. It's optional, right? Yeah. So steams just releasing either. They're just

1694
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:59,000
going crazy cause they've got the workshop for mods. That was the first thing that was

1695
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,040
a couple months ago for Skyrim. Green light and now big picture. It's only a play. I still

1696
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:10,000
need to play Skyrim on PC. Have yes, you do have portal two on PC. They still need to

1697
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:15,560
play with. Yes, you do. I got Dawn guard like two weeks ago or basically yeah, about two

1698
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:18,880
weeks ago and I haven't really played any of the new content yet. It just got me to

1699
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:22,920
load up Skyrim after taking a couple months. I love my Xbox three 60 copy to my sister

1700
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:26,940
because she wanted to play it and she's, she's a fan of glitchy games. I mean she played

1701
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:35,480
driver three forever. So yeah, Skyrim's really glitchy. All right, let's move on. Um, so

1702
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:40,600
yet another streaming service for video games and yet another streaming service for video

1703
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:45,480
games with a really fucking weird name. I mean seriously, what is it with these? I mean,

1704
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:52,920
okay, on life, not so bad, but like guy, Kai and shit like that. Uh, a golly. I mean, what

1705
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:57,120
the fuck is a golly? All the good donate. Domain names are talking at this point. I'm

1706
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:02,640
going to give you, this is free right here. Free for whoever, you know, here's it. First

1707
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:08,040
of the size of name their company. This you want to get in the people's faces. You name

1708
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:15,800
your company or my good.

1709
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:26,920
That's name recognition streaming. Exactly. Um, so I golly, uh, apparently they've announced

1710
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,160
a partnership with Microsoft and they're going to bring a cloud streaming games to windows

1711
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:38,560
eight. And of course it's gonna tie in with Microsoft's windows as your cloud platform.

1712
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:51,640
Um, they promised popular AAA games will be playable within the coming months and they

1713
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:57,160
didn't really say how it's going to work with a tablet, but I guess virtual D pads or some

1714
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:08,520
garbage. Yay. Ermahgerd, VIRG, VIRG network. All right. It doesn't have the same ring to

1715
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:12,280
it. Uh, let's do one more story here before we get to the mailbag and see what people

1716
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:18,440
are emailing us and Ermahgerding about tonight. Um, Ikaruga creator is making a new game.

1717
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:22,720
Yay. Cause who doesn't love Ikaruga unless you like hate shooters. I don't know what

1718
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:30,240
to tell you in that case. Um, Hiroshi Yuichi is going to release a new shooter called Kokuga.

1719
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:37,120
It's for the three D S and the trailer is now out. So if you are an Ikaruga fan might

1720
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:41,600
be time to get a three D S cause this is what awaits you there. It looks, um, a lot more

1721
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:46,040
of the, um, polygon as kind of three D graphics going into this kind of getting some Raiden

1722
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:52,560
vibes. Yeah. A little bit, a little bit there. Bullet hell. Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

1723
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:58,480
I bet that will make you barf in three D should be fun. Little, uh, it looks like little chips

1724
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:02,960
at the bottom there. Remaining cards. Oh yeah. Like little, it looks like little play cards

1725
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:06,600
on the bottom screen that you can throw into the game and then you have a remaining card

1726
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:12,160
counter. That's kind of a neat little mechanic. It's like making, mixing poker and Ikaruga.

1727
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:20,440
Very cool. Ikaruga. Ikaruga. All right, let's go to the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge

1728
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:31,200
radio.com. Sorry, I have to say this. Uh, mm two K says in chat or McGird is patent

1729
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:37,260
to just like gamer. Oh my God. Somebody needs to trademark or McGird and then Sue the entirety

1730
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:43,200
of the internet for infringing on that trademark. Amazing idea. Mm two K should do that right

1731
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:48,320
now. All right, moving on. Uh, mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com dark soccer will

1732
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:51,680
dive into the mailbag every week and find some emails to read for you all. But since

1733
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:56,860
she's not here, Alan has stolen her hazmat suit so that he can walk in the mailbag and

1734
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:00,620
find some email for you. I'm reading this first email and it, it looks, it sounds like

1735
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:05,320
it's talking about a cheat in mass effect three multiplayer. Should I read this? It

1736
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:10,680
tells you how to cheat. Um, you can leave that part out if you want. Okay. First off,

1737
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:16,240
I want to, okay, this email, sorry, is from mm two K. First off, I want to apologize if

1738
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:20,360
this is the second email you got for me. I originally went to the OLR site to send, but

1739
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:23,640
the character limitations made it seem like a line of, uh, like a bunch of babble. Here's

1740
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:30,200
my question for Rob and dark Sakura. Uh, multiplayer is a rather tough on the game and I had problems

1741
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:36,280
surviving past bronze difficulty. And, um, this is me now, uh, inserting this, this is

1742
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:41,760
talking about mass effect. Then some cool people showed me the, uh, striker assault

1743
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,600
rifle cheat. This allows you to convert this weapons, ammo to Cobra missiles resulting

1744
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:51,280
in one hit kills with each shot. That's cheating. Not to piss off fellow gamers. I make sure

1745
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:55,040
that I only use this cheat when it's past way for when other players are in trouble

1746
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:58,800
and I'm the only one left in a wave or all players are at the character level cap of

1747
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:02,880
20 therefore meaning I'm not robbing any one of experience points. However, in about half

1748
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:06,480
of the games I played recently, people are getting pissed, kicking me off, kicking me

1749
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:11,680
off the team after the game and getting rabies and getting all rabies like over the mic.

1750
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:16,080
Most of the complaints are, fuck you jerk. How, how did you do that? Oh my God, why did

1751
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:21,780
you do that? I see their shrieks as mindless chest pounding over game ranking, which again

1752
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:25,360
means jack shed. If you're all at the level cap, if we win, we all get the same amount

1753
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:29,760
of cash. To me, we should be happy. I'm assisting them to win. To me, they should be happy.

1754
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:33,060
I'm assisting them to win. I also play the harder levels as a Turian soldier without

1755
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:39,000
the cheat. And I tell you 80 85% of the people who play these levels have no idea what WTF

1756
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,560
they're doing anyway. Winning isn't everything, but if it's the difference between us wasting

1757
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:46,560
power ups to die at wave three and only get 20,000 credits or completing the playthrough

1758
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:51,360
and getting 75 to 240,000 credits, God, that must be how much you get for a platinum. That's

1759
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:55,520
crazy. I would be glad that someone was a board that could help when we were all about

1760
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:00,800
to die as I was when I met the perfect person who showed me the glitch. Thoughts? Am I thinking

1761
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:08,520
like the gaming jackass that many are claiming or do I have a fair point? PS, you and Bobby

1762
02:30:08,520 --> 02:30:14,080
show is the freaking best. I think you should take over G four, turn it into a 24 hour radio

1763
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:22,280
show network and make Blair herder, AKA Ross from friends. That's David Schwimmer. So I

1764
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:25,600
don't get that reference. I think that was a character. Oh, I don't know. And bring you

1765
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:31,280
smoothies and cheese. It's all day. That reference is lost on me, but thank you. Nonetheless,

1766
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:34,440
let's get back to the question at hand about the whole Mass Effect three cheat. Here's

1767
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:38,600
the problem. You may think you're trying to do a good thing by helping these people out

1768
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,200
of trouble, but the problem with what you're doing and, you know, you're in your mind,

1769
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,920
you think you're doing a good thing and it's like, oh, hey, I'm saving you from, you know,

1770
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:50,300
death and losing all these credits. You have to remember you're making a big assumption

1771
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:55,080
here that all these people that you're playing with are only in it for the credits. Some

1772
02:30:55,080 --> 02:31:00,700
people are in it for the challenge. Some people are very anti cheating. And I tend to notice

1773
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:04,880
that type of mentality usually comes when you're very passionate about a series like

1774
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:10,200
Mass Effect fans tend to be. Some people feel like, I don't want you to cheat because I

1775
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:15,200
don't want to be associated with you so that if BioWare catches you and you get banned,

1776
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,440
I get banned too. I don't want to be around that shit. So that's, that's the problem with

1777
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:23,700
what you're doing is that you're bringing other people into it who didn't consent to

1778
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:29,160
do that. Yeah. And that, and also there is a money element to this because if you have

1779
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:32,760
it, because I have my two or three favorite classes that I try to keep at level 20 when

1780
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:36,400
I want to try and do silvers and golds. The reason why I play silvers and golds at level

1781
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:40,480
20 is because I want credits so I can buy the upgrade packs to unlock the new characters

1782
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:45,200
and the weapon upgrades and blah, blah, blah. I could also spend five bucks on BioWare's

1783
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:52,760
website and get a pack of like 300 BioWare points and then manually buy those with cash.

1784
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:55,120
Don't know why you do that, but I'm sure there are tons of people that have spent hundreds

1785
02:31:55,120 --> 02:32:02,180
of dollars when you're helping people farm credits in that way. Like if you were to do

1786
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:07,400
that in Firebase, why with the Geth and I'm getting way too technical in the game, you're

1787
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:12,680
kind of screen over the people that are paying money. Does that make sense for those packs?

1788
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:17,720
So you may be well intentioned, but not everybody really understands that. So here's my advice

1789
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:22,000
to you. If that's the way you want to play and keep in mind, you're taking a risk. If

1790
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,960
BioWare catches you exploiting too many credits that way, you don't know what's going to happen.

1791
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:31,160
So use caution. That's all I'm going to say. Do it with a consenting audience. Only do

1792
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:36,080
that stuff with your friends, with the people that you know online. You mentioned in your

1793
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:40,240
email that somebody showed you how to do that. Well, that would have been a great person

1794
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:44,000
that you may, you know, this is probably one of those things in retrospect, but maybe that

1795
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,680
would have been a great person to add to your friends list so you can play the game with

1796
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:51,920
them that way later on. I mean, that's what meeting strangers online is all about. Finding

1797
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:55,320
the ones that you want to play with again. In a way, I can't believe I'm going to say

1798
02:32:55,320 --> 02:33:00,280
take inspiration in your gaming from Loki, but Loki's on the right track when he talks

1799
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:05,440
about his Grand Theft Auto 4 matches that they cheat like hell in those matches, but

1800
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:10,240
it's all internal. It's all people that know each other. It's all, you know, when Loki,

1801
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:13,520
correct me if I'm wrong, when you go on Xbox live and play against strangers, you don't

1802
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:18,580
cheat. You play it straight up. No, we don't. Well, we don't play those mods anymore anyways,

1803
02:33:18,580 --> 02:33:21,260
but yeah, when we were playing those mods, we only played against each other cause we

1804
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:25,520
all have the same mods and it was all modding new weapons that were all balanced. It wasn't

1805
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:30,960
so that we could, you know, cheat other people. It was just, look at all these crazy fucking

1806
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:33,800
weapons that we have and we're going to shoot each other with them.

1807
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:38,480
All right. And so, so I guess the moral of the story, and I'll end with this long story

1808
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:44,840
short too late, make it like monopoly. Set the house rules in advance. Is there going

1809
02:33:44,840 --> 02:33:50,480
to be a jackpot when you land on free parking, you know, to set all those house rules. Do

1810
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:55,840
people really go to jail if they roll three doubles in a row, set the house rules in advance.

1811
02:33:55,840 --> 02:34:00,120
And if you're going to play with strangers, then the house rules have already been set.

1812
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:02,080
There are no house rules. You have to play by Bioware.

1813
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:06,960
You just say, Hey, Hey, uh, can I, can I rocket glitch this bros? Hey, can I rock a glitch?

1814
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:11,800
And if they're like, no fuck off, then maybe that's not the round for you.

1815
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:16,800
MM2K is actually in our chat tonight and wanted to give a follow up to the email. By the way,

1816
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:22,560
the person that showed me got banned. So I stopped the day after I sent that email. Sorry

1817
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:28,160
for the babble. So like we meant before I knew that we kind of warned you, if you get

1818
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:31,200
caught, you'll be the one that gets banned. And the people don't want to be associated

1819
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:34,800
with you. You know what, despite the fact that that's already resolved situation, I

1820
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:38,000
thought it was a good thing to talk about. So no worries. I'm sure there's plenty of

1821
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:42,800
other games and communities where something like this goes on. All right.

1822
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:50,720
All right. And next email is from Catastrophic Moggy. Not sure I've heard this reader before

1823
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:55,920
or listener. Uh, O R no doubt. You've already got the classic game of the week covered,

1824
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:59,360
but if you don't mind, I'd like to add my own given that this game will likely be unheard

1825
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:04,320
of. And then he's got a, they've got a gameplay link. I will bring that up here while you

1826
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:11,320
start to read it on YouTube school days for the ZX spectrum or ZX spectrum. If you're

1827
02:35:11,320 --> 02:35:16,240
in the UK, uh, you play as a school boy named Eric though you could change the name if you

1828
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:21,380
wanted to. And your goal is to get the combination to the safe that holds your permanent record.

1829
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:24,940
To get the combination, you have to grab or shoot these little shields scattered around

1830
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:29,780
the school with your catapult. It's not as easy as it sounds. Some you can't reach without

1831
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:34,600
knocking over your classmates to get a, to get a boost so you can jump higher or deflect

1832
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:39,440
shots off of a teacher's head. I'm wondering if catapult is a British is British for us

1833
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:43,960
slingshot. That guy just shot a teacher in the back of the head with a slingshot. Okay.

1834
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:48,160
Oh my God. That's so would. Okay. Think about this bite. And I don't know if that's where

1835
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:52,880
the email is about to going, but like think about trying to put out a game like that in

1836
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:57,200
today's world. Not going to happen. You had to do this without being caught too often

1837
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:02,980
or missing too many lessons or you'd be given lines, uh, get too many and you may be excluded.

1838
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:08,120
I imagine that's expelled. You're also, uh, you've also got the other kids to deal with,

1839
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:13,400
particularly the bully who is trying to get you into trouble and the SWAT S W O T who

1840
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:18,400
runs to the teachers whenever he sees you do anything wrong, like a narc or a snitch,

1841
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:23,140
I guess for anyone interested in the game. There was a fan made remake release called

1842
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:28,800
class of 99 class K with improved graphics and sound. I have no idea if it works on Vista

1843
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:34,920
or wind seven though, and then only to that P S I'm pissed at the moment because predictably

1844
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:40,280
persona for arena has been delayed in Europe to God knows when so much for it coming out

1845
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:45,480
in all territories and quick succession. My F you of the week is region locking. Oh God.

1846
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:49,560
And that's the PSI cause I was just about to say, Oh, we'll just get the import. The

1847
02:36:49,560 --> 02:36:53,920
U S one, the PS three is regional region free. Oops. That was the game that they region locked

1848
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,680
and there was all the controversy around that. Sorry for the background noise. I'm still,

1849
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:03,580
I've got this school days movie still running there in the background. Interesting. Yeah.

1850
02:37:03,580 --> 02:37:08,640
You wouldn't see that today. That's for sure. I'm sorry to hear about the persona for delay

1851
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,680
though. Sucks.

1852
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:23,440
Hold on. I think that was it. Did you get it? No, there's, there's one more email. It's

1853
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:27,800
last week's episode was weird because a lot of the content that was discussed, I don't

1854
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:32,740
want to get into it. This email kind of addresses that. Let me look at it real quick. I mean,

1855
02:37:32,740 --> 02:37:45,240
I think we need to read. What's wrong with this. This is funny. Okay. And are we looking

1856
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:50,880
at the same one? The one from Ospher? Yeah. Okay. This is fine. Okay. Dear Dr. Kerr, I

1857
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:55,600
think it's in your best interest to not take Rob's advice. Diving headfirst into the mailbag

1858
02:37:55,600 --> 02:38:00,620
is a horrible idea as you never know how deep or shallow in, uh, in emails it will be. I

1859
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:04,360
would recommend stepping in slowly to test the depth. Bring Daris along with you for

1860
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:11,380
sure as he can calibrate the mailbag afterwards. You read way too much. What was the controversy

1861
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:19,440
you saw in that email? I didn't see your name. I saw Dan's. I said, Oh, you shouldn't take

1862
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:25,120
advice. That's, that's a cute little pun on the, when I always say dark soccer dives into

1863
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:30,200
the mailbag head first way to make a funny joke. Awkward. I know. Womp, womp. This is

1864
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:37,560
why you don't get invited to parties, Alan. Yeah. And he asked for, was like, Ooh, who's

1865
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:39,920
going to read my email? And I'm like, it's going to be me. And then I just pissed all

1866
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:48,280
over it. So Austin, I'm very sorry. This is, this is for Alan reading emails. That's fine.

1867
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:52,040
Why would I read your name as dance? Why? Yeah. Why? That's what I want to know. Why

1868
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:57,920
did you mean Rob and Dan don't even have same letters in common. You know what you saw?

1869
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:02,080
You saw Garris is Dan cause Jamie always talks about how Garris kind of reminds her of Dan,

1870
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:08,320
which is like kind of cute in a really weird way. We need to get her that moe, that moe

1871
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:13,040
cuddle pillow for her of Garris. And then Dan will be like that. I don't want that in

1872
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:21,320
my house. That's it for mailbag. Good job reading the mailbag tonight. Well, if you

1873
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:28,360
do a really bad job at something, then people will ask you to not do it anymore. So is that

1874
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:35,020
a hint? Is that a hint? All right. That's it for the mailbag mailbag at orange launch

1875
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:39,560
radio.com. Just a couple more news stories for you guys. Before we get to the Skype line

1876
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:44,000
at one eight seven seven game OLR, we'll get some Twitter topics in there as well. But

1877
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:49,000
first, a couple quick stories. Loki. I thought first we had the FUs of the week. Oh shit.

1878
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:54,280
You're right. FU to me for getting the FUs of the week. Well, you know what? Alan threw

1879
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:55,920
off my wrist.

1880
02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:18,920
Uh, so I guess FU to FedEx for not just losing one pallet of games, but two different pallets

1881
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:26,120
of the same game. I'm sure we'll get a lot of disappointed Borderlands 2 fans and also

1882
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:29,840
old people driving on the freeway. They're driving like 30 miles an hour. What the fuck?

1883
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:36,320
I mean, seriously, 30 miles an hour on the freeway. Thanks. Two missing pallets of a

1884
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:41,480
top tier game. That shuts on eBay. Someone lifted that off a truck. No, it was just mis-routed.

1885
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:46,120
Oh, OK. How convenient. Oh, so that they're there somewhere. They're just not where they

1886
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:50,640
apparently sold to people. They apparently flunked geography and thought that Oklahoma

1887
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:56,480
City was Memphis. Oh, I make that mistake all the time. Yeah. So, so they, they shipped

1888
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:01,600
it to Memphis and oh, hey, shit, there's, this is an Oklahoma City. Elvis's mansion's

1889
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:08,800
in Oklahoma City, right? Or Indianapolis instead of, you know, Perrysburg, Ohio. Alan, do you

1890
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:15,120
have any FUs of the week you want to share? Very minor in first world, but we bought Juice

1891
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,280
at Target and orange juice is like really good. And we got two cartons of it. And apparently

1892
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:23,000
we just left it on the counter in the bag and fucking walked away and left and got into

1893
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,320
the car and drove away. Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life. Everybody's

1894
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:30,000
done that shit. But now because it happened, but now we don't have, but yeah, now it happened

1895
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:34,760
and like, I really are no reason I want orange juice at nine o'clock at night because we

1896
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:39,200
forgot it. Do you need me to go to Safemart and get you some orange juice? So FU to just,

1897
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:43,520
I guess, walking away from a counter and leaving behind things that you paid for, even if it's

1898
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:48,360
just a dollar fifty orange juice. But then it's like, what else did we forget? What else

1899
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:55,360
did we forget? Anyhow, one other FU of the week would be for me, although I don't have

1900
02:41:55,360 --> 02:42:03,560
a whole lot, FU to a lack of motivation. I've not been very good at going to the gym like

1901
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:09,440
I need to be. So FU to me needing to get into shape. But FU to just the fact I've been so

1902
02:42:09,440 --> 02:42:14,440
busy too. I mean, it's not like I'm having a gun held to my head. I don't have to be

1903
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:21,160
doing the things I'm doing, but still it's keeping me very busy. But I'm able to work

1904
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:26,760
in some good stuff and I know there'll be a good payoff. All right, before we get into

1905
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:32,960
the next story, I want to say FU to one other thing as well. And that is the fact that we

1906
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:39,540
got so tied up in that WU conversation earlier in the show, I didn't get to embarrass Loki

1907
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:45,160
with the fact that his birthday was this past week. Oh yeah. On September 11th. It's not

1908
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:49,960
a hard day to, or it's an easy day to remember. I guess I'll put it that way. Uh, would you

1909
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:55,440
end up doing for your birthday? Uh, went to work and then I went and saw The Expendables

1910
02:42:55,440 --> 02:43:00,280
2 afterwards. Well, what a manly way to spend a birthday. And to be honest, The Expendables

1911
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:04,840
2 was better than the first movie. It was actually entertaining. Yeah, but Chuck Norris

1912
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,840
is in it. Chuck Norris is awesome. My brother saw and said it was awesome, but my brother's

1913
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:13,680
also like 18. Chuck Norris was awesome though. Cause like his character is like this lone

1914
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:18,720
wolf or whatever. He just comes in. It's like, yeah, I just murdered everybody cause I'm

1915
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:24,520
Chuck Norris and that's what the fuck I do. Now FU to the fact that I'm having to have

1916
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:29,520
listeners remind me about my life. Uh, Tiger Claw says, don't you mean FU to that table

1917
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:34,160
that hit you in the face? Yes. FU to the table that hit me in the face. But anyhow, let's

1918
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:38,220
go back to Loki. So it was your birthday this past week. So Alan and I wanted to say happy

1919
02:43:38,220 --> 02:43:42,840
birthday. Give you something to open there. Open on air there. So a little bit of, oops,

1920
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:48,060
hold on, let me put this down. It's just a card. It's probably one of the worst wrapping

1921
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:57,480
jobs I've ever done, but we're boys. We don't wrap gifts and we recycled. Look on the other

1922
02:43:57,480 --> 02:44:05,400
side. Look on the, it is a Skylanders portal keeper where he can keep all his little Skylanders

1923
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:10,440
dolls and all your Skylanders toys. You can open it and you might find something a little

1924
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:16,480
more useful inside. Skylanders. I hope it's more Skylanders. Oh sweet. 600 point guard.

1925
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:21,120
There you go. Something a little more useful. I figured that, you know, it's cute that Josh

1926
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:25,120
can put stuff in it when he's old enough to. Well he does need a toolbox cause he's got

1927
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:31,360
like some frou frou, um, like flowery boxes, keeping his tools in there. There you go.

1928
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:35,040
So we figured even though you might not actually put portals in there, it's actually the perfect

1929
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:39,240
size for like a little lunch or something. So figured out another lunchbox. Now you have

1930
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:44,360
to carry around a Skylanders purse. I originally joked that we should just get you one of the

1931
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:50,240
figures, but I'm like, I had some of the figures actually for awhile cause I was selling them

1932
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:57,760
this way. There used to be a gray market for Skylanders and they did really fast. All right,

1933
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:00,920
I'll get it. The chatters are demanding a picture, so I'll get one of those really quick

1934
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:06,520
and get it up on orange.com. I'll grab the iPad. Um, Misty also says, quit being sexist

1935
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:11,280
in our chat room. I can't wrap presents for shit either. Thank fuck for gift bags. I normally

1936
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:17,680
don't wrap presents. I apologize. You're absolutely right. But uh, thank thank fuck for gift bags

1937
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:23,360
is absolutely right as well. So did not mean to stereotype. I apologize. I appreciate it.

1938
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:29,040
Thank you. Cards. Funny too. You're welcome. Yeah, the cards funny too. All right. Oh yeah.

1939
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:32,120
We're going to have to wait for him to do the car cause he has the next story. Birthday

1940
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:38,720
bad cake. Good. And it has a fat cat on it. Yeah, my fat cat. Well, she's not fat, but

1941
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:43,520
she threw up last night again. Oh, she's a hairball. That was, Oh my God. That was the

1942
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:46,560
first card I was looking at was a cat on it saying, I'm getting all choked up because

1943
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:49,640
it's your birthday. And then he opened it up and it says, Oh, just kidding. It's a hairball.

1944
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:55,760
Oh, if I'd known your story. Oh well. Yeah. All right. So, um, you know, of course Australia's

1945
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:03,640
got the brand new R 18 plus, um, rating for their, uh, game ratings. Of course. Um, they

1946
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:08,400
have guidelines for the classification and it should be no surprise like anything that's

1947
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:15,480
rated out there. They're being stricter on games than any other form of media. And of

1948
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:21,320
course, you know, it says given the opposition to the introduction of the R 18 plus category

1949
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:25,360
from a vocal yet unrepresentative section of the community, along with largely conservative

1950
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:30,880
group of attorneys, uh, dash generals, it is no surprise that the new guidelines hold

1951
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:34,680
video games to a higher standard across a number of categories compared to film and

1952
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:40,000
what originally existed for video games. As we have previously stated, we are concerned

1953
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:47,800
and with the acknowledgement of the are in the guidelines that the interactive, uh, interactivity

1954
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:53,240
has a greater impact on the players. Despite the federal attorney general's pub office

1955
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:58,240
publishing and a literature review in September, 2010 that found no evidence to support these

1956
02:46:58,240 --> 02:47:04,060
claims. There will be continued debate about whether the interactivity of video games has

1957
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:09,280
a greater impact than other forms of media. And we will continue to refer to the lack

1958
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:13,460
of evidence to support these claims. And I agree. I mean, it's stupid that, you know,

1959
02:47:13,460 --> 02:47:16,760
just because you can interact with stuff, I mean, watching videos and stuff, people

1960
02:47:16,760 --> 02:47:23,040
still get, you know, very worked up, I guess about stuff just because I can push a button

1961
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:29,520
to like punch somebody in the face or something doesn't mean that's gonna make me more violent.

1962
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:33,520
I think it'd make me less violent because, you know, if, if like there's an annoying

1963
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:37,120
character in a movie and I want to punch him in the face, you know, that makes me want

1964
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,560
to punch somebody in the face. Whereas if I have the ability to punch him in the face

1965
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:44,560
in the game, then I may not have that urge to punch him in the, or somebody in the face

1966
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:53,560
because, well, I've taken out my aggression. Well, at least they can have the, uh, games

1967
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:59,280
out there in Australia that were banned previously. I mean, at least there's that. So whatever.

1968
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:06,080
All right. I'm trying to remember, we have a secret email you use to upload these pictures

1969
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:10,040
to, and I can't remember what it is because remember our site got hella spammed once,

1970
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:15,200
so we changed it and I don't remember the address. Jamie has it saved on her phone.

1971
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:22,240
Crap. I have a sent items folder. Can it be piped to the O L R tumbler? Can I, cause I

1972
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:26,320
think Ramna Ramna is on. He does that. Can I search for email? How would I search for

1973
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:32,400
emails that I sent to an orange launch video.com address? He sent you go and get your sent

1974
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:37,240
items. Yeah. Go into your sent folder and then do the search from, I know it's live

1975
02:48:37,240 --> 02:48:41,120
radio, but I need tips on how to use my mail back. Oh no, it's not orange launch radio

1976
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:47,280
because they go to flicker. That's the problem. Is that it? I bet it's this. Don't say that

1977
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:55,440
on air, but I think this is it. Yes. Yes. That's it. Okay. I found it. Yay. Just host

1978
02:48:55,440 --> 02:49:00,520
fail. Cause I forgot the correct that they went to flicker and not to orange launch radio.com.

1979
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:08,360
Great live radio, huh? One more story before we open up the Skype line. And that is about

1980
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:13,040
a new way to sell indie games. It's called the indie game stand. It's going to start

1981
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:18,040
on September 26th and it's, um, getting its inspiration from the humble bundle as well

1982
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:22,120
as woot. That's a site I like, I like woot. You can get some good deals there. Although

1983
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:26,840
I have yet to ever get a bag of crap on woot, but I know some people that live for bags

1984
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:32,580
of crap on woot. Um, indie game stand will be a place that will sell a new indie game

1985
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:39,860
every four days for a pay what you want fee. That's a pretty bold way to do it. It's going

1986
02:49:39,860 --> 02:49:46,560
to launch September 26th. Um, a lot of steam and desura keys will be available on the game.

1987
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:51,600
10% of whatever you do will benefit a charity of the developer's choice. More than 50 indie

1988
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:56,880
developers are signed on to this right now. Spider web software, cypher prime, digital

1989
02:49:56,880 --> 02:50:02,040
eel, magical time beam and so on and so on. If you create an account before September

1990
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:08,320
26th, you will get the platformer Chester for free. Indie game stand.com. That's pretty

1991
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:13,520
cool. Uh, I like the whole charity aspect to that as well. It's a pretty bold to do

1992
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:21,560
pay what you want. I'm surprised there's no minimum whatsoever. That's a wow. One penny,

1993
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:27,800
one penny. I hope, but I mean the indie game bundles do very well, but it's multiple. They

1994
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:33,500
also offer incentive to have a minimum amount, which is good. And you know, if you're going

1995
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:37,500
to rip off all those charities, you just kind of, you know, you, you do have the whole bad

1996
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:43,240
karma thing going on there. All right, well I will be signing up for that site. Why not?

1997
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:47,400
There's a free game involved. All right. Uh, one eight seven seven game O L R or our username

1998
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:54,040
on Skype, orange lounge radio. The Skype line is open right now for you to send in your

1999
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:59,040
phone calls. Meanwhile, it's going to take me a minute to get that picture up because

2000
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:06,840
I need to bring up Twitters on my iPad here so we can talk about tweets to twitter.com

2001
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:12,360
slash O L R. Uh, while I bring that up, Oh, nevermind. We're getting a call. I will do

2002
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:15,580
last minute stories in a minute though, but first we have a call on the line higher on

2003
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:21,560
orange lounge radio. Who's this? Who else but Rama. Hey Rama, what's on your mind, buddy?

2004
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:30,280
Oh God. Yeah. Um, we, you know, all right. Yeah, let's do it. We, you know, what's up

2005
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:36,640
the money for that. We, you is staying in my bank account because I'm not buying into

2006
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:43,080
that bullshit. It's a pretty strong word. Bullshit. Cause first things first, the price

2007
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:47,920
that they're asking for, I think is a little bit higher that people are willing to pay

2008
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:53,880
for it. Another thing is they haven't even said the specs behind a Wii U. I haven't been

2009
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:59,000
able to find anything in regards to it. There's only three games that they announced that

2010
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:03,800
I want and truth be told, the console can stay on the shelf until those three games

2011
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:11,200
come out, but they're not staying on the shelves. They're selling out the preorders. I can wait.

2012
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:17,240
I'm a very patient person. What do you think it would take? What, what, what's missing

2013
02:52:17,240 --> 02:52:22,480
here? What would it take for you to say, you know what, I'm plunking the money down. Let's

2014
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:28,960
do this. Pack a Mario game. Don't forget that whole Nintendo land stuff. Take it back to

2015
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:34,680
the old school when the NES came with a Super Mario brothers, when super Nintendo came with

2016
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:38,640
the Super Mario brothers game. Then they changed things around. Take it back to the old school.

2017
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:44,440
What an awesome Mario title. That's what I'm looking at. Well, there is a Mario title.

2018
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:48,840
Nintendo land doesn't count in my book. What about new Super Mario brothers Wii U or whatever

2019
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:52,960
it's called? That's extra $60 and I don't know if you've noticed the price that they're

2020
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:58,280
asking for the Wii U games brings me back to the days of Super Nintendo when games were

2021
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:06,720
$69.99 to $79.99 a pop. Black Wolf in our chat room, you know he's, he's one ready to, uh,

2022
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:11,080
challenge you on things once in a while. Black Wolf says, you're right. It's a little bit

2023
02:53:11,080 --> 02:53:14,280
higher than people are willing to pay for it. Hence why it's currently sold out of the

2024
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:20,720
pre-orders. The price of the Wii U games brings me back to the days of the Xbox 360 and the

2025
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:26,720
PlayStation three. Okay. You have to admit that's funny. I mean, the way I look at it,

2026
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:31,280
the price, it kind of reminds me of the PS3 when it was so expensive because they're trying

2027
02:53:31,280 --> 02:53:37,160
to put the Blu-ray players in everybody's living room. There's a big difference between $2.99

2028
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:43,400
and $5.99 as in half. I know, but I'm just saying that they're trying to get everyone

2029
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:49,200
on the whole tablet thing, which is why the console is so expensive. And truth be told,

2030
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:53,680
as much as I enjoy the features that the tablet's going to offer, I don't need it. Just give

2031
02:53:53,680 --> 02:54:01,760
me a Wii U, a pro controller, and that's it. That's all I really want. Well, I guess you

2032
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:10,800
can't get that. Yeah, I know. And I see that. And the sad yet interesting yet funny part

2033
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:18,280
is even on Nintendo's playing catch up with all of this, even if the Wii U falls flat

2034
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:24,560
on their face, they will still come out on top because remember, except for the 3DS,

2035
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:29,540
when they did a price cut on, except until recently, every console Nintendo put out has

2036
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:35,920
made a profit off of. Except for, yeah, except for that whole 3DS price cut. That's a very

2037
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:42,640
true point. I believe Microsoft and PlayStation took losses on theirs, so it is interesting.

2038
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:50,560
Alright, well, what will you be playing this holiday season with no Wii U in your house?

2039
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:56,080
I will be probably playing more games on my PS3, my 360, and the tablet that I just bought.

2040
02:54:56,080 --> 02:55:00,360
And if you're also wondering, my younger brother begged me, so I will be going with him to

2041
02:55:00,360 --> 02:55:05,140
Nintendo World, just as Luigi, during that weekend release of the Wii U, because evidently

2042
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:08,280
I have nothing else better to do that weekend. So even though you're not going to buy the

2043
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:14,600
Wii U, you're going to pull out Black Luigi just cause. Yeah, I have to shamelessly plug

2044
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:21,120
out a couple of awesome sites that I helped work for. There you go, take some VOG flyers.

2045
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:25,800
My business cards have VOG on them. Good, good, good. Alright, well, the chatters are

2046
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:29,800
complaining because somehow you broke the stream, but here's my question, if the internet

2047
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:34,800
just went down, why are we still connected on Skype? Because you're supported by my awesome

2048
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:40,080
files connection. 66 megabits down and 33 megabits going up, can't beat that. Whatever,

2049
02:55:40,080 --> 02:55:46,320
it's not the size, it's how you use it. Alright, bye Rama, take care everybody. Peace, stay

2050
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:51,800
fabulous. Yeah, always. Alright, 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio

2051
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:57,280
if you want to give us a call. I did get that picture up. Loki, did you have any last minute

2052
02:55:57,280 --> 02:56:01,920
stories you wanted to do? Yeah, I was going to mention there was a few things, there was

2053
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:08,320
an article I saw about the whole multiplayer, or the Just Cause 2 multiplayer project. They've

2054
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:14,200
got up to 1800 people playing on one server. This is all fan done, you know, kind of talking

2055
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:18,560
a little bit about Black Mesa stuff. I mean, multiplayer in a game that doesn't have multiplayer.

2056
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:26,120
They have 1800 people on that god damn server. That's pretty impressive. And then also Black

2057
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:32,560
Ops 2 is supposed to have a zombie campaign, like as in a single player campaign. That's

2058
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:38,160
kind of neat. What else? Oh, I wanted to mention, I had actually, because I'm on Kickstarter

2059
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:44,600
a lot, I tweeted about this. There's a game called Rhythm Destruction. It is a game that's

2060
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:52,200
a cross between a shmup and a rhythm game, and features music by Kyle Ward. So if you

2061
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:58,320
want to check that out, check out Rhythm Destruction on Kickstarter. They've got 18 days left.

2062
02:56:58,320 --> 02:57:03,960
Five bucks net to the game. So that's not bad. And that's including, I think, a Steam

2063
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:08,480
key, and they're supposed to be bringing that out, I think, on Xbox Indie games as well.

2064
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:13,640
It does support an Xbox 360 controller. It's also on Steam Greenlight. Again, 1877 Game

2065
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:17,640
OLR, or a username on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio. If you want to give us a call, the

2066
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:25,160
Skype line is open. That's all. Otherwise, I was responding to folks in the chat room,

2067
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:31,280
apparently about the breaking of our stream, or what have you. Also, the Indie games, or

2068
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:35,880
Indie Royale, they have a back to school bundle that's out with seven games. Pay what you

2069
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:45,200
want. It includes Lunar Flight, Bunny Must Die, Chelsea, and the Seven Devils. Looks

2070
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:56,440
like a Kleon, Flying Red Barrel, and Sequence. Also, Cute Things Dying Violently. And I guess

2071
02:57:56,440 --> 02:58:02,880
if you spend over $8 on the bundle, you'll also receive an 18-track Chiptune album, Bias.

2072
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:08,800
All right, going to some tweet topics real quick. First, I want to say Bobby Blackwolf,

2073
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:14,920
who sent us a tweet to a story about how LittleBigPlanetVita's street date was lifted. You're a jerk.

2074
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:21,120
But yes, we already addressed this. The street date was lifted. Sony says retailers can begin

2075
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:24,920
selling the game once they receive copies. Well, apparently my local Target didn't receive

2076
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:31,040
copies. So this news is still false, as far as I'm concerned. Tigerclaw says in some tweets,

2077
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:35,760
oh, this was really sad, and it does have a tie-in to the gaming world. I don't know

2078
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:38,560
if, well, hopefully you heard about this. Hopefully you're not that shut off to the

2079
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:42,920
world around you, but there was a U.S. Embassy attack that happened in Libya, and it took

2080
02:58:42,920 --> 02:58:47,240
the lives of a few people, and one of them was this huge Eve Online player. Like, apparently

2081
02:58:47,240 --> 02:58:52,460
he was really big in the Eve Online community. His nickname in the community was Vile Rat,

2082
02:58:52,460 --> 02:58:57,960
but he was known to his friends and family also as Sean Smith, and unfortunately he died

2083
02:58:57,960 --> 02:59:06,560
in that senseless attack this week that was very unfortunate. The Eve community is grieving

2084
02:59:06,560 --> 02:59:12,040
his loss. They're saying that over the years, Vile Rat rose to become one of the most well-known

2085
02:59:12,040 --> 02:59:16,880
and respected diplomats for one of the most powerful alliances in Eve. He was instrumental

2086
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:24,240
in shaping the universe we all play in today. That was Chairman Mark Hurd on the CSM behalf.

2087
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:31,720
That would be the Council of Stellar Management for Eve Online. There you go. Very sad. Very

2088
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:37,560
sad. Moving on, another link from Tigerclaw. Consoles lacking in an important functionality

2089
02:59:37,560 --> 02:59:41,720
for MMOs. I want to see what this is about, because I don't know this one. So he sent

2090
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:48,600
us a story from GameSpot that talks about... I don't want to see this. Give me this one

2091
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:55,440
here. Sorry, my iPad's acting up and not showing me the right story there. Again, 1877 GameOLR

2092
02:59:55,440 --> 03:00:00,600
or a username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to call in. The VP of Publishing

2093
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:06,000
at Wargaming.net says long approval times on consoles are restricting development of

2094
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:13,280
MMOs. Otherwise, they would be there if manufacturers made it easier for developers. This is according

2095
03:00:13,280 --> 03:00:25,860
to Andre Jarnaso, who is at the World of Tanks World Championship Final. Oh, have you heard

2096
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:30,500
about that MMO, World of Tanks? I've heard of that before, too. It's supposed to be like

2097
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:36,120
massive. They were pimping it out over at the air show it went to, World of Tanks, and

2098
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:42,000
there's also some other one, World of War, or World of Planes or something. Well, here's

2099
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,840
a quote. Again, I'm reading this article. I'm sight-reading this article for the first

2100
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:49,600
time because of the tweet we got from Tigerclaw. Consoles are a nice, attractive part of the

2101
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:54,000
market because there are no really well-known MMOs there, and the install base is huge.

2102
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:58,340
But as you know, the consoles are still lacking in important functionality. In MMOs, it is

2103
03:00:58,340 --> 03:01:02,560
very important for developers to have a fast reaction time for the service. If you're a

2104
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:06,820
big company like Sony or Microsoft, then the approval time for release candidates is so,

2105
03:01:06,820 --> 03:01:12,720
so long, you can't change the game immediately. So, interesting. Kind of blaming the console

2106
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:19,000
development cycle for the reason that MMOs aren't coming out. Hmm. Well, Square Enix

2107
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:23,060
might have something to say about that when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV or Realm Reborn

2108
03:01:23,060 --> 03:01:28,480
or whatever you're calling it, which is still coming out later this year, as far as I know,

2109
03:01:28,480 --> 03:01:33,360
or at least it's going into testing. And Zaku in our chat room reminds us about Final Fantasy

2110
03:01:33,360 --> 03:01:38,640
XI. sg100matt, lastly on Twitter, wanted to remind us about the Bungee Ferret tossing

2111
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:44,800
soundtrack, but I already plugged that earlier. So that's it for tweets. Any other last-minute

2112
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:53,880
stories, Logie? I think that was it. All right. Well, Skyfline's not looking too popular tonight,

2113
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:58,960
so unfortunately I'm going to go ahead and shut it down. If you think of something later

2114
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:02,680
on, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com would be a great place to send an email to. Again,

2115
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:07,680
that's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. But the show's running a little long anyway because

2116
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:11,360
we had a very long first half, so I think it's about time to wrap things up anyway.

2117
03:02:11,360 --> 03:02:15,240
Alan, thank you for being here tonight, as always. I appreciate you filling in, even

2118
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:19,680
though you feel like you have to do it, apparently. I won't ask you next time then and see how

2119
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:24,320
you feel. All right. Enjoy Black Mesa and all that. And do you have any final thoughts

2120
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:32,800
for listeners tonight? Chicken. I would like to remind everybody that this show is free

2121
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:36,860
and we don't ask for much, but please tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread

2122
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:39,780
the word, word of mouth. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell

2123
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:45,880
a friend or two about the show and support independent podcasting, especially those shows

2124
03:02:45,880 --> 03:02:51,360
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. We love being a part of this indie network

2125
03:02:51,360 --> 03:02:57,040
that helps to bring the voices of gamers everywhere to you, even when they're being shy like they

2126
03:02:57,040 --> 03:03:02,840
are tonight. Rama's not shy though, at least we know that. Loki, thank you as always for

2127
03:03:02,840 --> 03:03:09,040
being here and enjoy the Skylanders purse. Thank you. And the points more importantly

2128
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:12,800
that maybe can buy you something you'll actually be using. But any final thoughts for listeners

2129
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:19,520
tonight? Play on our Minecraft server if you haven't done that yet, because it's awesome

2130
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:26,280
and you should check it out. And then of course on Tuesday, play Borderlands 2 with me, because

2131
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:31,340
I need someone to play with. And my final thought tonight is yes, play those games,

2132
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:35,280
play World of Warcraft and listen to Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth,

2133
03:03:35,280 --> 03:03:40,080
or if you're extra for play Guild Wars 2 and still be on a Warcraft podcast. Listen to

2134
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:48,200
that and also play Bungie Ferret Tossing tomorrow on Xbox Live Indie Games. Very exciting. That's

2135
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:51,520
it guys, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you

2136
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:57,080
as always for tuning in. Remember we will not be live Sunday next week, however a new

2137
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:01,800
episode will still be playing on the feed. Podcast listeners, nothing will change for

2138
03:04:01,800 --> 03:04:04,440
you, you'll still have a new show next week because I'm out of town. So I just want to

2139
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:09,760
remind everybody of that. We'll be back live in two weeks with another episode of Orange

2140
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:15,840
Lounge Radio and that would be in two weeks, episode number 475. We're climbing on up,

2141
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:20,440
moving on up. 500's almost here. Have a wonderful night everybody, take care.

2142
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:28,440
