Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight, September 30th, 2012. EA cancels a major sports title. DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros. 2.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 475 of our program for this September the 30th of 2012.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and all that good stuff.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi. How you doing, Jamie?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm caffeinated, thank you.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You had two cups of coffee.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes. I've made a new rule, by the way. The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's your thing against sports ball? Some people like sports ball.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Boring!

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Boring!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I like rugby. And I like real football.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There was a comment that actdeft made this week. I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG network post.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But he said, yes I am a hater and I am hating.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And that's you right now.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I agree with that. I agree with that.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hi.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Doing good.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Awesome. What's new with you?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Um, Minecraft.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, and I played no Minecraft. I played Borderlands 2.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which is sadly the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My wife's been occupying TV so I've been occupying Minecraft.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, not a problem. It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah. There's actually people on now. I see people when I go on there.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nice, nice. And I hear they've been defacing my house.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My little, or my shack.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We haven't been defacing it. We've been, um, applying temporary tenants.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Interesting. Would you fill my house with creepers?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No. That would be destructive.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright. Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, um, yeah. What else do I want to say? Oh, this poster came, right?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This was from that guy who called in last week, right?

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think it was. Can I see it? Can I open this?

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, go ahead.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, Rob, you're physically incapable.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's stuck in there. Hold on.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Open the other side.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's still awesome. I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's called, I call it Disco Panda.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mr. Pandaria. So it was Disco Pandas.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That poster's rad, by the way.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I guess.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can do that in a minute when we get into gaming weeks.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So just give me a little bit of time.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's see. Before we get into gaming weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic as we usually do.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And it wasn't really intentional for that to happen.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But apparently a lot of media companies, for whatever reason, aren't really covering this.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because it has to do with the indie community.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now remember when XNA Games first came out?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And there's been some good and there's been some not good.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Obviously we're a little partial to YYR in some of his efforts, like Bungie ferret tossing and so forth.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I made a game with zombies in it.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The Breath of Death and all that started on XNA, right?

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was on there, that was pretty good.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right, and then there's the bad.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, so all these things fill niches.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's the fart app that you'll find on the iPhone, I mean it's that whole thing.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And then you get the really weird stuff, like the launch a baby from your vag game.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's funny.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hilarious for like three seconds, but it's a little bit strange.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What is it, Techno Kitten Adventure?

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, oh yeah, Techno Kitten Adventure started there.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That was that interview and everything, which I think he sold it to somebody, but anyway.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My point is, there's been some good, there's been some not so good, but overall we've seen some things born from there.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So why did Microsoft just suddenly stop paying attention to it?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Here's the deal, here's what's going on.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com, very well done from Bobby.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So we spent some time shedding a little light on it for people, and it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They used to be able to generate 50 review codes, and it's broken.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No press release saying they took it away, maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly,

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't believe it's a super major bug that can't be fixed with a day's worth of work if they would allocate somebody to it.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But that hasn't happened, and it's been going on a couple weeks now.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
YYR, who did Bungee Ferret Tossing, the OLR game, can't get review codes generated for it.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And that sucks, because that's one way that your game gets out there on the internet, is the reviews on websites.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And people would see it go, Bungee Ferret Tossing, what's this?

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then they check it out, and that's how YYR can make sales on his game.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But now, a lot of that is stifled, because Microsoft has this bug on the site.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not just affecting him.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
These big indie games, or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing,

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
which is the indie answer to Microsoft Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree, or whatever the hell they call those things,

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Remember when Microsoft said, oh yeah, we're gonna promote XNA games?

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice?

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Actually, there have been a few that were going to be indie games, and then didn't.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like, Dust and Elysian Tail, or whatever, that was gonna be an indie game.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And there was also a few that have been in these contests that they do.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't remember what it's called, but they've been promoted from there, too.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chat room, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He says, not just for review, but for giveaways. Ever wonder why VoG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferretossing?

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Perfect example. We can't give it to you for free. Although, seriously, guys, it's one fucking dollar.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it is a really fun game, so, just, you know, you probably have the points left over in your wallet.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But, yeah, and SSJ100Matt says you would think they want to get this fixed.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They're promoting games that they profit off of, and that's the weird thing.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this, but, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money?

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games or selling it?

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, then, do something about it. Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, is there too much crap indie games that's bogging down the system so people don't want to go find the stellar indie games?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fix it!

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console. I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It'd be a little sad if that was the case. Or maybe it's-

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and, of course, they don't want people developing apps for it.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow, so, you know, wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know, indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam and, oh, a lot more sales there!

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just a bummer that it had such potential to be so awesome to let people kind of control what was going on on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side and it's just kind of gone.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, um, Brakeman in our chat says there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games. There are. It's-

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What went wrong with this? Why is this not doing better? Loki, any thoughts?

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because they haven't done anything with it. They haven't really- they haven't promoted it. They hid it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out, they did.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sj100Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, but like YYR, he's been doing Bungie Ferretossing for two years, you know, and two years ago, XNA looked, you know, a lot better than maybe it does now, so it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I've always thought, though, and I could be wrong, I am not a developer, I've not made games, I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff from XNA on Xbox to PC. Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think so.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So, I don't know, maybe-

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that, yeah, it's probably pretty easy to, you know, port it over.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC, like for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the gib tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's cool.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So, the programming there is pretty much the same.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I used to love editing files, like I remember Civilization 1 on the PC, like a bunch of the scripting ran off text files, so as long as- like there were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were kind of within the boundaries, you could like get the Queen of England to like, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm gonna declare war on your ass. You could like, change things and do a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious. Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Anyhow, going to more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, because of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's articles there too, there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life, but there will be more very soon.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Meanwhile, Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's see, WhatUpG says, by that I mean the big budget games, the ones that seem to get more press, etc.

159
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Microsoft is more about the AAA games, is the comment that preceded that.

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games, I don't know.

161
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Not that a lot of those end up being very good all the time, but whatever.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Anyhow, let's talk about our gaming weeks, and the video games that we have been playing this week, and whether they be indie, or AAA, or whatever the case may be.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We'll start with Dark Soccer, I bet you all can predict her week, I bet you all can think about it. What is it?

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I played Mass Effect 3, and played Pandas, I've made Rob over 10,000 gold, selling gems, in less than a week.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion, it's been slow, slow, slow, and I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level.

166
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Which is fine, I mean, I do have other things going on. But yeah, it was a lot of Pandas. It was Pandemonium. Yeah, that's it.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How do you feel about the new expansion? I know this isn't Horde House, but it is a major PC game release.

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Slow. I really like the areas, and I really like the music when it's not, oh my god, Disco Pandas going on over it. Because, like I said earlier, Dan's been playing Borderlands 2.

169
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which makes me want to throw up. It's pretty, it looks like fun, I would be so sick.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit.

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly. But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City, and just hands out Justice stuff.

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's stupid!

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So it's going to take a little time, but this, well, I can see why they did that, because they said there's not enough to do at 90.

175
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do. There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90, I've had too much going on in my personal life, I can't sit there and just grind to 90.

177
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm just 88.

178
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I know, I know, I know.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And Shane's already got a 90.

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, most of my guild, raiding guild, already has 90s.

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Some of us have lives.

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't like to say it that way, because I know Shane has a life and what have you.

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But we have other stuff going on that isn't OMG Pandas.

184
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Some of us have Mass Effect to play.

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.

186
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog. I want a corgi bull.

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're silly. Alright, let's move on. I'll talk about-

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my gaming week, but Loki, go ahead.

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I played Borderlands 2 last week. Well, kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I've been playing that and leveling up my assassin.

192
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And the game's pretty fun. I'm digging it.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I wish I could play it a little bit more. I want to play it a bit more this week, take a little break from Minecraft.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week.

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And of course we switched the server over to creative, so it's been fun.

196
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things.

197
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I haven't really finished my castle, but I'm taking a break from it. I think it's pretty much done.

198
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've got all the grounds done. I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens.

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I built an underground blacksmithing thing.

200
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Farmer Loki had a farm. E-I-E-I-O.

201
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm just trying to think of things to put on the ground so that I'd have something there.

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's a big open space. So I have that all pretty much done.

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I just have to fill the rooms with stuff. I haven't done that yet.

204
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've been taking a break from it to do other things. Explore and build other things.

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So yeah, I think that's pretty much it this week. That's all I played. Those two things.

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Alright, my gaming week. I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year,

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that's at least the goal is to do Disney detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.

209
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But anyway, as far as video games that I have been playing, I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time.

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I love the music. I love the scenery. I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world,

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast. There's so much to do.

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.

214
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit,

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
is I don't like that they made it not possible really. I mean, you can.

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it.

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore,

218
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it.

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But I guess to match the style of the fact that you have to get reputation with all these factions

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
to get the end game rewards, you have to do a little bit of questing, so whatever.

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But anyway, I will elaborate more on my thoughts on this week's Hoard House, www.hoardhouse.com.

222
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Another game that I checked out this week though for a little bit, I only played this in between the time

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.

224
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And that is Torchlight 2. Torchlight 2 is released and it is available on Steam.

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and probably other places too that I'm not thinking of. I just own it on both places.

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's basically Diablo. It's a lot of the same people that made Diablo 1 and 2 made this game.

228
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's kind of like a reimagining of that whole thing, although obviously it's a little more DungeonCrawler

229
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and a little less Satan. It's not Diablo.

230
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Torchlight 2 is out and it has kind of a different feel right off the bat because you're not dipping right into a dungeon.

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like you do in Diablo or like you did in the first Torchlight. A lot of it is taking place in the outworld

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
or the outside, outdoors, very grassy areas. It's not to say that there aren't dungeons at all,

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but I noticed right off the bat that a lot of the scenery is very varied.

234
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I love some of the class design in Torchlight 2 is great as well.

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like I play this dual-wielding gun chick and she's a lot of fun.

236
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I've had a real joy playing it and dare I say, I kind of had more fun with it and I've been more interested in that than Diablo 3.

237
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So I don't know really what that says, but yeah, Torchlight 2, big fan. Thumbs up.

238
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet

239
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and you can also be in the same room and do internet that way. There's the LAN is in there.

240
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That is a great word. Fuckery.

242
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word too. That was total fuckery.

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And this had very little fuckery. Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day,

244
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but it didn't really ruin the experience. It was a good time.

245
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
ActDeft says, internet multiplayer? Wow. Well, the first game didn't have it.

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So there you go. Let's see, and Ray Deer in our chat room says,

247
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now. Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.

248
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So if you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.

250
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's going up and down a little bit. So I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off

251
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so that way we don't hiccup. But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.

252
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.

253
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I closed Dropbox, right? Sometimes big files come in through there. Yeah, that's closed.

254
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on. Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.

255
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Torchlight 2 and Pandaria. And Disney games. Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, Dark Soccer?

256
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Because in chat, Brakeman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland, in my country we have a word for you.

257
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Liar. And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.

258
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You know what, Rob? I have faith in you. And if you don't, if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.

259
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.

260
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

261
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Oh boohoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here.

262
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No, stop. Alright. Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping.

263
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio.

265
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We'll get to the FUGL question of the week a little later. But before we get to that, some news!

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Loki's starting us off with the gaming news this week.

267
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Alright. So, this is a little shocking. Not entirely shocking, I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA.

268
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, on the 27th.

269
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Seriously, kind of out of nowhere. I mean, it was being delayed for a while.

270
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You may remember they tried relaunching the whole franchise with NBA Elite 11 back in 2010.

271
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And that got pulled right before it shipped the stores. Actually, some of them did ship the stores.

272
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.

273
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And they were going to kind of, they took a break last year and then this year they were going to try launching it again with NBA Live 13.

274
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And once again, they just cancelled it before you even got a chance to get sent out.

275
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And this was literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website.

276
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Their executive vice president, Andrew Wilson, just wrote,

277
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Hey, it's cancelled and here's why. Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, I don't know. It's interesting, but I think at this point, you know, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game.

279
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying,

280
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.

281
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Maybe if it was that terrible, I mean, this far into the development cycle, then,

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
God, I don't know if next year's going to be any different. I mean, we may run into the exact same situation again with NBA Live 14.

283
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And at that point, I mean, NBA 2K is going to be so far ahead.

284
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't even know if they'll be able to catch up with their market share.

285
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally new NBA game.

286
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.

287
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I did like it, though, because I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.

288
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
One of the first comments I read on the Asports.com site was like,

289
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm going to kill your family. I'm going to kill all the employees.

290
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA Live.

291
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Call the Popo on that. Why do people feel like they could just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?

292
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm about to go down a much bigger path on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get hurt.

293
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Well, there's Facebook, too, but I hate the anonymity that the Internet gives us sometimes.

294
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like, really? You're going to kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game? Really? Really? Really?

295
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Geez.

296
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Why don't we just set them all on fire?

297
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
How are you being any better by saying that?

298
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Calm down, woman.

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Hey, I said it very calmly.

300
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Anyhow.

301
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't know. I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.

302
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
They're just like, meh. Not surprised.

303
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And honestly, I'm not surprised either.

304
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet and the game was scheduled for October.

305
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I kind of thought that you would have a little something. So, yeah. Not a big shocker.

306
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?

307
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision because if the game was going to suck

308
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
or was just going to be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then good on them for making the right decision.

309
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Because there's a story later about maybe a not-so-great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.

310
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I found that comment finally. It was funny.

311
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You've got to be fucking kidding me. We stuck our neck out for you.

312
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We've been fans of you guys for years getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.

313
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I swear, if there's no game that...

314
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.

315
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There's no game that released this year. I'm killing every employee in EA slash NBA Live building, dude.

316
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm so heartbroken, literally. I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.

317
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I can't believe we're stuck playing with only one game after you guys have three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.

318
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.

319
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid writes that comment.

320
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Of course. But I just think it's funny that people think that you don't have to play a new NBA game.

321
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's not like, oh shit. It's not like choosing a president or something like that. A choice needs to be made.

322
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's just, you know, you can play that same NBA game that you have.

323
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, well, I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.

324
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?

325
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's supposed to be fun. Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.

326
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.

327
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So...

328
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We actually got a copy of that.

329
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Did you? Why did you get a copy of it?

330
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Why not?

331
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Because my boss had one in his office.

332
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Baller Beats!

333
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I laughed at it. I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.

334
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'll play it.

335
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No, it's... No. No, we're not.

336
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Alright. Alright, I guess... Oh, I want to ask about the 2K game. Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?

337
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?

338
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Jay-Z.

339
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, I was just talking...

340
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm looking forward to that.

341
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, hold on. I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.

342
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.

343
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.

344
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And, you know, say what you will about her music and so forth, but...

345
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean, that woman is a well-oiled pop machine.

346
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
She's putting out so many albums. She puts out an album a year.

347
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And all these music videos, wins all these Grammys, has all these catchy songs written for her.

348
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You know, whether it might be your cup of tea or not, you can't ignore that she writes some really...

349
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Or, she doesn't write, probably, but she has some really good pop music that she puts out.

350
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And, yet again, she's got like another new album coming out this year. It's crazy.

351
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like, Jay-Z is working her and she's an extraordinarily famous woman.

352
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Just like a pimp.

353
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Hey, if Jay-Z...

354
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Work your best hoe.

355
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If... Shut up.

356
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If Jay-Z can make 2K basketball, like, if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music,

357
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I actually think it could be a really good thing.

358
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He's not doing shit. All he's doing is picking up the soundtrack.

359
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Ooh. Fucking awesome.

360
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I mean, whatever. You know, that's cool.

361
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care,

362
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.

363
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I mean, that's it.

364
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.

365
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out, and then it was like, ehhh. Not so exciting.

366
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Why does the chat room think I said pot music? I said pop music.

367
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Pot music would be like...

368
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Fog Hat.

369
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews Band. That's pot music.

370
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Fog Hat.

371
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And maybe a little bit Journey, too.

372
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once, and damn, I think I got a contact high.

373
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Anyway, back to games.

374
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way, because you know, Motorola, although it is really Google,

375
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
they got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s,

376
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
among some other Microsoft devices.

377
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.

378
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's actually owned by Motorola. It's licensed for use in MS devices.

379
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Now, here's the interesting thing.

380
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's been ruled in the US that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.

381
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Well, now why would the US talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?

382
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the US.

383
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the US law.

384
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And the court's ruling says, quote,

385
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
At bottom, this case is a private dispute under Washington state contract law between two US corporations.

386
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here, you're okay.

387
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So, like, if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three-year warranty, you're okay.

388
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You can still get one.

389
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Phew.

390
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Well, technically, they wouldn't be selling it. They would just be shipping a replacement.

391
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.

392
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because, you know, that's what happens to people now.

393
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It used to be that they'd red ring after a week and that's just part of like growing up.

394
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, they don't red ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of...

395
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Did you say that was just part of growing up?

396
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

397
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because every Xbox...

398
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You take the good, you take the bad.

399
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes, you take the good, you take the bad and you take them both and there you have a 360.

400
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
360?

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Stop.

402
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the robot chicken thing where they did...

403
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Never mind.

404
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, no, okay.

405
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
One chick's on Survivor.

406
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Which one, Tootie?

407
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Blair, on Survivor.

408
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
They are really, really stretching for celebrities.

409
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You and your reality shows, Rob.

410
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I know, what can I say, I'm a whore for trash reality shows.

411
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You have a problem.

412
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We have a commercial for the next Xbox.

413
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You take the good, you take the bad.

414
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You take them both and there you have...

415
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The 720.

416
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The 720.

417
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
There's a time you gotta go and show your...

418
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
There's a time you get to play...

419
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.

420
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What?

421
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.

422
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What was her name?

423
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I just remembered she was Tootie.

424
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm probably gonna horribly mispronounce this name, but it's Entitlitis.

425
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Inflammation of the entitlement.

426
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Entitlitis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.

427
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You never forget.

428
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Did the red ring come after the blowjob?

429
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
That would be a whole other problem.

430
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That means you need to go see a doctor.

431
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes, Kim Fields, that was her. Thank you, Rama.

432
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I knew Rama would remember.

433
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Alright. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

434
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So there was a big, horkin' interview about the PlayStation 3

435
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.

436
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying

437
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.

438
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.

439
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Not visual, the casual... casual visual.

440
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It rhymes. Don't give me that look.

441
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do, you know,

442
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
with games, things that are a little bit more reflective of that.

443
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.

444
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
As far as how well the Vita's doing,

445
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
they say they're not gonna reduce the price this year.

446
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That is probably gonna be sometime next year,

447
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
so it's not a matter of if it's when.

448
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But definitely not this year.

449
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And this... so really it's just more of what we knew.

450
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I think it's just... I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses.

451
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
They don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fuckin' TV

452
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to, you know,

453
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
have their friends see it.

454
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter

455
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week

456
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
for like $199 or something.

457
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Really?

458
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I know, I was like...

459
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Cool, were they teeny?

460
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We, sir, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.

461
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I guess that didn't do too well, did it?

462
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah, who's gonna buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price? Sure.

463
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Which it may have. I should check that out.

464
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They were also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK,

465
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now

466
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and then a 12 gigabyte version that's gonna be out on October 12th,

467
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.

468
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's the shops that are setting the price.

469
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't really get that since it's their system, but...

470
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, they gotta charge them a cost, so, I mean,

471
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
obviously the price is gonna be as low as they can get while making a profit.

472
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And they're also trying not to be worried about the Wii U.

473
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So, I'm not worried about the Wii U.

474
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, of course, they're not gonna ever say openly,

475
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
why, yes, we're shitting our pants over the Wii U, actually.

476
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
They have nothing to worry about with the Wii U.

477
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I know, no one has anything to worry about with the Wii U.

478
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The Wii U doesn't have Ridge Racer!

479
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer.

480
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know,

481
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?

482
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Same damn tracks.

483
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh, does that not fit into your plan of, you know,

484
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
releasing one track with, you know, half a car and you have to buy the rest later?

485
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So, just throwing this out there, it's still on sale on Best Buy site,

486
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
$179.99 for the TV, MotorStorm Apocalypse, and glasses, and a little cable.

487
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Eh, give it more time.

488
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You think it could get even lower.

489
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Black Friday's right around the corner.

490
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Don't remind me, I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.

491
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Since I'm not working retail.

492
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yay.

493
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Alright, let's move on, Loki.

494
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Alright, well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV, no actually I'm not.

495
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They were kind of cool though, I've got to plan those a few times.

496
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So, they have this new Xbox Live reward thing,

497
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
where they're allowing people with high gamer scores

498
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.

499
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And it's a whopping, I know you're going to get excited here,

500
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points,

501
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.

502
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's right, 2%.

503
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Woo!

504
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm getting excited already.

505
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And of course, also, apparently if you have a gamer score of over 3,000,

506
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you get a special gift during your birthday month,

507
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
which in the fine print says is only worth 25 cents.

508
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Here's a quarter, call somebody who cares.

509
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What about, it's probably going to be some stinkin' avatar item like a birthday cake.

510
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's stupid, I mean seriously, 1% back?

511
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Okay, so you buy $100 worth of fuckin' Microsoft Point stuff

512
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you get a dollar.

513
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That is fucking stupid.

514
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom.

515
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's a fuckin' birthday hat.

516
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I guarantee you it's a birthday hat.

517
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That is it, for your avatar.

518
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So that everyone can go, hey look, he has a birthday hat on.

519
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Cool.

520
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I want them to send me a quarter.

521
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I want them to mail it to me.

522
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If it has like a value, you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.

523
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So how is it that they can assign a value to that,

524
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter?

525
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Well, I always thought it was akin to like,

526
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?

527
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.

528
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
One one-hundredth of a cent or one tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.

529
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like, maybe that's the actual cash value of a, you know,

530
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
40 point item in the marketplace or something.

531
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It would be 25 cents.

532
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's just stupid.

533
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Cool, thank you for, you know, the money back, I guess.

534
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.

535
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't know who this Entitelitis is,

536
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
but I like the comments from this individual tonight.

537
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So I have 7,000 points.

538
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
What do I get, a coupon from Arby's?

539
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No, no, the idea is to like, get you to be loyal,

540
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
not to like, scare you off.

541
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like, you know, a lifetime supply of horsey sauce.

542
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Who's gonna spend a hundred dollars on DLC in a month?

543
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game

544
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that comes out in a whole bunch of DLC.

545
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I mean, those people are gonna have to be really sipping the, you know,

546
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.

547
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.

548
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Cause, you know, that's the new thing now, is free to play mechanisms.

549
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers, you get some money back.

550
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah.

551
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's not so bad. Hey!

552
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I got all this money stolen from me,

553
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back. Sweet!

554
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's not so bad anymore.

555
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And a birthday hat! Yeah!

556
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Maybe the hat's a fuckin' sign that says,

557
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Sucker, you spent all this money.

558
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You're an idiot.

559
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh, boy. Alright, let's move on, talk about something in the PlayStation camp.

560
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The PlayStation 3, you might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3

561
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
is gonna be a PlayStation brick, and it won't really be useful for anything anymore,

562
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
cause of course the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.

563
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.

564
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.

565
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Nope.

566
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, when did it first, when did the system first come out, 2006?

567
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
This is about a nine year window.

568
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So I guess that's not terrible.

569
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's not your fuckin' ten year life cycle that you promised me, I want my money back.

570
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Uh-oh.

571
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Dark Sucker, did you have a problem?

572
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Your soap spat on my shirt. It left white foam on my shirt.

573
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It likes you a lot.

574
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I guess so.

575
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Alright, anyhow, PlayStation 3, good for until 2015.

576
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.

577
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
2016.

578
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That's what's targeted.

579
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to, you know, re-emphasize,

580
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
you're not just buying something that's gonna suck in a couple years.

581
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So, there you go.

582
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We're gonna continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely,

583
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long,

584
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.

585
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Same thing with PlayStation 2.

586
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's kinda stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch.

587
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But there's still games launching for it.

588
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That was a comment from John Kohler to GameSpot.

589
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So, your PlayStation 3 will still be good through 2015.

590
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I hope so. We've already had it for years and years.

591
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What about the PlayStation 2, DarkSakura?

592
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Well, there's actually some stuff going on for the PlayStation 2.

593
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Did you realize that there's still a game coming out?

594
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
One whole game?

595
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
One whole game.

596
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
One game?

597
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
One whole game. One game that's going to be out in Japan.

598
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Ooh, there will be one more game.

599
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.

600
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.

601
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Adullino Macchio?

602
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, the English version is something like Something of Anderlin

603
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
or something is the English title.

604
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name

605
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
so I can't actually read it properly.

606
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Scroll.

607
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Well, no, it's not working.

608
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Macchio.

609
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Adullino Macchio.

610
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.

611
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's the one that has geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.

612
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.

613
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I know.

614
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I can see why people are still playing it.

615
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
But we have pandas.

616
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But it's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going

617
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.

618
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I am so surprised it hasn't gotten free to play yet.

619
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Me too.

620
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If it went free to play, I'd play it again.

621
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Who wouldn't?

622
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I know a few people who wouldn't.

623
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You know what? I told you what made me quit that game, right?

624
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Being a white mage.

625
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, dammit.

626
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.

627
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Fuck this, I'm teleporting Holla.

628
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah.

629
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So I was just like, I'm done.

630
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
After all these years, you still can make jokes like that.

631
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That game had quite an impression.

632
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This is like, oh, you made a bad pull.

633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Eh, fuck you guys.

634
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
No heal and I'm out.

635
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.

636
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That was pretty funny.

637
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, Sublegar. Always a good time.

638
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They had Sublegar in XIV too,

639
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
which was probably the only interesting thing about Final Fantasy XIV.

640
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Leather underwear.

641
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
SSJ-100 Matt in our chat room says,

642
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Jamie, heal please. Protect please.

643
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Bite my ass please.

644
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Ah, good times.

645
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online.

646
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Port, port please.

647
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.

648
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Port, port please.

649
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Hey, pretty impressive though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?

650
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013.

651
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Although, let's be real.

652
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's like, there's been one game this year and one game next year.

653
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's on life support at this moment.

654
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.

655
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.

656
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And I'm never gonna.

657
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Hey, it's not that bad.

658
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know, I have it. And I should sit down and play it.

659
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You should. It's a good time.

660
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But I also have pandas.

661
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Balthier and Fran.

662
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Pandas.

663
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.

664
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Pandas.

665
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Fran's a bunny.

666
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So?

667
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Alright, let's move on.

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.

669
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Alright, this week actually there's a few things coming out.

670
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I know that there's Resident Evil 6.

671
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Some people might be looking forward to that.

672
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

673
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Also NBA 2K13 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

674
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Wii.

675
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Vita? No. No Vita.

676
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
But PSP for some goddamn reason.

677
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Go2K for supporting PSP still.

678
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Because no one else is.

679
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And PC.

680
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.

681
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.

682
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.

683
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I think that's what it's called.

684
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Including a penis.

685
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It said everything.

686
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think it's lessons for everyone.

687
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But yes, it's You Can Draw Everything.

688
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's basically how I'm calling it.

689
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Including a penis.

690
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Including a penis.

691
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.

692
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Carry Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.

693
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And what else do we have here?

694
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's see here.

695
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.

696
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
17 Command & Conquer games in there.

697
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Holy fuck.

698
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's a lot of Command & Conquer.

699
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's too much Command & Conquer.

700
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Or is it over 17 years where the Command & Conquer.

701
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I can't read the cover there.

702
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Nope, 17 games.

703
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.

704
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
50 bucks and you get all of the Command & Conquer games.

705
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
All the Red Alert games.

706
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Generals.

707
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Wow.

708
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's pretty sweet.

709
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Ron Munnar says 17 Command & Conquer games.

710
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Shut up and take my money.

711
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You'll never get through it all.

712
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.

713
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I think I played one game for two seconds.

714
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I did that with the Doom pack.

715
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
XCOM is fucking great though.

716
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty Edition of Resident Evil.

717
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
No, NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil.

718
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They have the archives and anthologies.

719
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3.

720
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1, 3, 4.

721
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's like all these random ones in there.

722
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
MXC1 to clarify in our chat room.

723
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
17 games but they're all digital.

724
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Even if you buy the VOX you just get codes.

725
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That's stupid.

726
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I hate it when they do that now.

727
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Thank you Origin! Thank you!

728
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Thank you for sucking.

729
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Fucking awesome.

730
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That comment and more in our chat room.

731
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Live.vognetwork.com

732
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Oh and of course I should mention a week from today.

733
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
There's...

734
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.

735
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Someone might be interested in that.

736
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
No one I know likes that game.

737
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Okay I have to digress for a moment.

738
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Have you done any pet battles?

739
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah they're pretty fun actually.

740
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I went and did that for like an hour.

741
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But they will not let you according to our guildie Gwen.

742
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They will not let you name your Phoenix hatchling Fox.

743
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Well you know what's funny?

744
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I have been naming all of my little pets after Mass Effect characters.

745
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Shut up.

746
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Because my priest is Dr. Chacwas right?

747
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And so my kitty is Jack.

748
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And I tried to name my little mechanical.

749
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Like if you have a mechanical creature what are you going to name it?

750
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Legion.

751
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I was going to try and name it Legion.

752
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It wouldn't let me name it Legion.

753
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because it's biblical.

754
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh my god.

755
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah.

756
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So I named it Geth Legion.

757
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Still.

758
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
For the record Rob.

759
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I did actually prove you wrong from something on Hoard House.

760
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
What?

761
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I got Jane Shepherd.

762
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
On Proudmoore.

763
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Oh.

764
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Good for you.

765
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Just saying.

766
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Have a cookie.

767
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Alright.

768
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Going back to Jamie.

769
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.

770
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well they do.

771
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy 12.

772
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
SG100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.

773
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
No, Garrus isn't in it.

774
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
ActDef says, tell her it has Panda Corgi Garrus.

775
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Ew.

776
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That just is wrong.

777
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
No.

778
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Although did you see the ferret effect?

779
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Uh uh.

780
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh yes I did.

781
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
No yes I did.

782
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That was awesome.

783
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That was pretty rad.

784
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
The listener of OLR.

785
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I guess we can't take all the credit for it.

786
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
No it was in our Mass Effect secret community.

787
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,160
Fifth dream about the World of Warcraft expansion in our chat room says Mists of Pandiaria is

788
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
what my wife and I have been calling it.

789
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
That's pretty good.

790
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
I'm going to use that on Hoard House.

791
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm going to call it Mists of Pandemic.

792
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,820
Mists of Pandiaria.

793
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,000
By the way, do you know what name I got for my Tauren Monk?

794
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,800
I'm really excited.

795
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
You told me.

796
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Calvin.

797
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
That's awesome.

798
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,200
I told Dan and he just rolled his eyes.

799
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,200
You know what I got?

800
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,200
What?

801
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
I have Sunny Gummy.

802
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Uh huh.

803
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
I love that name.

804
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
From Gummy Bears.

805
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
And then I have Shampoo.

806
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Spelled X-I-A-N-P-U.

807
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,760
Oh hey, let's travel to Japan and check out release dates over there.

808
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,420
Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012 both

809
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,660
on the Xbox 360.

810
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,320
There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know to try and like sell

811
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,760
some Microsoft Xbox 360s I guess.

812
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,000
I believe there are full consoles coming out too.

813
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,840
There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition.

814
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,120
Oh no.

815
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,880
This is the one with the jacket, isn't it?

816
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,240
Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?

817
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,360
$1700 if you want to get this.

818
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,260
This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.

819
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,320
Remember that?

820
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,480
That's happening in Japan this week.

821
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,800
But not a full metal jacket.

822
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,800
No.

823
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,440
I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.

824
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,440
They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.

825
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,940
The jacket's pretty freaking rad.

826
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,760
Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.

827
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
It's cute.

828
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,400
I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.

829
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,240
Yes, we know.

830
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,120
Alright, going to the Playstation 3, I imagine it's mostly the same shit.

831
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,360
Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.

832
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,760
You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your Playstation 3 with Biohazard

833
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,760
symbols.

834
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,480
So your Playstation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.

835
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,800
Wouldn't that be awesome?

836
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,000
F1 2012.

837
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,560
And you got right over there?

838
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,080
No, they just made me laugh.

839
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,000
Because I had mental imagery then.

840
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,600
World Soccer winning 11, 2013.

841
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,880
Well they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes and so

842
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,800
because of that they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.

843
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,440
I know.

844
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
Now you can't unsee that.

845
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,060
Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick

846
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,120
blowing a giraffe.

847
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,080
You can't unsee that now that that's been said.

848
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,520
So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go, you're welcome.

849
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,120
How about on the Nintendo 3DS?

850
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,680
Coming out this week, nothing.

851
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,160
But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.

852
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,240
I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.

853
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
There you go.

854
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
That's the Japanese release dates.

855
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,800
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

856
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
Oh, a few things.

857
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,600
On the first, which it already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.

858
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,160
And then on the second, Resident Evil 6, oh my god, you are so correct.

859
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Right?

860
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,200
Well, I've tried, I've kind of been ignoring it.

861
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,920
Tried the R&C but you can't.

862
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,800
Because did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?

863
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
What?

864
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
For the release of that?

865
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,040
They did like a fake human meat market for Resident Evil 6 in East London.

866
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,080
It was all raccoon.

867
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,080
Ew!

868
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
No.

869
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,600
Have you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?

870
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
No.

871
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,040
Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid

872
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,400
I didn't watch it again for like two years.

873
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
It's really gross.

874
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,920
I almost put it in show roll, but it's really, really gross.

875
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
I'll just link pictures.

876
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,720
They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and pork.

877
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,200
The best, ew, that's gross.

878
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
The best episode ever.

879
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,360
You can also buy fake penises.

880
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,360
The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kittenman's, was the

881
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,560
episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.

882
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,160
That was my favorite.

883
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,800
I haven't seen that one yet.

884
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,160
Oh, it's fantastic.

885
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:34,400
But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically

886
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
for helping amputees.

887
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,880
Well, I guess that's cool that it had a, you know, a good cause at the end of the day.

888
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,800
So back to the releases.

889
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
What were you gonna say?

890
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,840
I was gonna say, actually I do think I did see the episode where they were all in the

891
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,720
U-Haul trailer or something like that.

892
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,600
Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?

893
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Yes.

894
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Okay, okay.

895
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,600
Oh yeah.

896
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
That was hilarious.

897
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,240
Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah, Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.

898
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,600
And the 4th is Anno2070 Deep Ocean.

899
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,080
And the 5th NBA 2K13.

900
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,640
So something every day this week.

901
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,720
Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week

902
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,640
where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.

903
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,480
But first, Loki.

904
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,000
And it's of the week, so.

905
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:31,280
So Notch, the, you know, wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to, you

906
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,800
know, perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in

907
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:43,040
Windows 8, you know, so that it would be on their closed platform.

908
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,800
And they even asked, hey, you can help certify, you know, Minecraft for Windows 8.

909
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,120
And you know, he said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all

910
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,320
rather than to, you know, play along with what Microsoft wanted.

911
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,560
And basically, you know, said, no, I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms

912
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
around.

913
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,200
And if it was locked down Windows 8, it would be very, very bad for indie games and competition

914
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
in general.

915
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,520
If we can keep open platforms around, there's going to be a lot of very interesting games

916
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,440
in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.

917
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,400
I think it would have been, what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can

918
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,880
show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.

919
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,560
They're certified for it in Minecraft.

920
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,440
Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but, you know, he doesn't want to do that.

921
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,440
Why would you?

922
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,000
I mean, you have a, basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm

923
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,840
assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because, you know, it's

924
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:52,080
their closed app store versus he sells the game off his website, he gets all the profits

925
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,080
for it.

926
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
So why?

927
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:59,400
Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason,

928
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
you know.

929
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,800
Of course, he's going to say no.

930
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,640
This is a little different when you're putting your game on, you know, the Xbox 360 where

931
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,400
no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.

932
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,920
You just can't do that.

933
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,760
Rama in chat says, oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.

934
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,680
I'd like to explore this a little bit as well.

935
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,400
I mean, if I want to just write a silly little Windows program, I can do that.

936
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,920
Like, Windows 8 isn't going to, like, stop me from doing that, right?

937
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,200
I'm pretty sure you can.

938
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,360
I think it's just mainly it's the marketplace, the marketplace.

939
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,360
Yeah.

940
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,760
That's where it's more locked down because it's trying to combat piracy and all that,

941
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,760
right?

942
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,760
Yeah.

943
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,920
I'm just saying that's why they do it.

944
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,740
Windows, the operating system that is pirate proof.

945
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,320
No one pirates windows.

946
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
Please.

947
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,400
If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.

948
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,760
I don't buy operating systems.

949
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,320
I actually don't think I've paid for one in, like, 20 years.

950
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,280
Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.

951
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,280
Same here.

952
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,880
Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Frugal Question of the Week a little

953
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,960
later when it comes to Windows 8.

954
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,080
I'm still really torn on it, like, I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like

955
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,200
if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.

956
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,240
There's a lot of mystery around it.

957
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,320
If there's anything that people, like, find about Windows 8 that they really must have,

958
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,920
someone's gonna fuckin' develop a program that runs in Windows 7 that does the same

959
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,560
damn shit.

960
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,160
I mean, probably does it better, so... no.

961
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,760
No thanks.

962
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,880
Not into it.

963
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,280
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

964
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,400
use the passphrase, danger.

965
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:01,800
Alright, well, if, you know, you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason

966
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,440
you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe

967
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,840
you're on Linux.

968
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,460
And of course, Linux is gonna be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form

969
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,400
of Steam.

970
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,360
Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.

971
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,480
1,000 users will be testing the client, they also get one Valve game with that.

972
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,680
It's probably gonna be Left 4 Dead 2, because that, of course, is the game that they already

973
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,720
said would be on Linux.

974
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,520
The beta will support... and please forgive me if I mispronounce this, because I'm not

975
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,520
a Linux user...

976
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,520
Ubuntu?

977
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,520
Is that how you say it?

978
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,520
Yep.

979
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,640
Ubuntu 12.04 and above.

980
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,920
It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.

981
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,960
So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.

982
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,800
Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to

983
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,280
the user install experience.

984
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,440
Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?

985
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,320
Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?

986
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:06,640
Yeah, I think so, but I'm not an in-depth programmer or anything like that, so I might

987
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
see if I can't get into it.

988
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,880
And what was your logic for using Linux Mint again?

989
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,480
First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.

990
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,680
You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more

991
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,920
sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.

992
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,240
On top of that, you have basic, immediate root access to anything in your system.

993
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:38,340
On top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.

994
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:44,920
It's respected, it's versatile, and the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's

995
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,920
a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for

996
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,360
anything, and it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.

997
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,480
And what's specific about Mint?

998
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,160
It's just a really easy interface.

999
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,860
Do you just like the name Mint because it's minty fresh?

1000
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,620
It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.

1001
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,680
It's a really good introductory into Linux.

1002
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,720
Minty fresh scattles.

1003
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,720
You remember that?

1004
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,840
A 10-year-old joke from understation live.

1005
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,840
Look at that.

1006
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Look at that.

1007
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,280
Hey, you know, on my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.

1008
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,280
I'm going to find it now.

1009
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,440
Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?

1010
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,760
I probably did.

1011
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,160
Actually, I think I made it before I had a live journal.

1012
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Or your Zonga.

1013
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
I never had a Zonga.

1014
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
Never had a Zonga.

1015
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,560
Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week, and I was like, oh yeah.

1016
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,480
I'm going to go find the mint scattles.

1017
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
Hold on.

1018
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,760
You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.

1019
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,800
Have you seen the new MySpace?

1020
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,800
They're trying.

1021
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
You mean Pinterest?

1022
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,520
It's basically Pinterest.

1023
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,520
But like, no, here's the thing.

1024
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,940
Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.

1025
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,440
But I was looking at the new MySpace, I'm like, oh, okay.

1026
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,320
So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.

1027
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,860
That's what it is.

1028
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,860
Still won't use it.

1029
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,860
I kind of use Pinterest.

1030
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:02,860
Do you?

1031
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,040
What do you pin on Pinterest?

1032
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,400
Usually like recipes and supernatural and mass effect.

1033
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
You're such a girl.

1034
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
All right.

1035
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,400
You know what?

1036
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,640
I love the car.

1037
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,560
The car really makes me happy.

1038
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,320
All right.

1039
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,080
Going a step further here with Steam.

1040
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,640
Did I get the, oh yeah, sorry.

1041
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,240
There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game McPixel.

1042
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,880
It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.

1043
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,480
It is now, excuse me, Steam Greenlight.

1044
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,160
I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.

1045
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,820
Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.

1046
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,400
It is now available for $4.99.

1047
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,160
It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by

1048
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,020
using available tools.

1049
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,020
It's awesome.

1050
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,460
It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.

1051
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,460
It's really awesome.

1052
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,460
Is it?

1053
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,460
It's ridiculous.

1054
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
Yeah.

1055
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Did you play it?

1056
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
Yeah.

1057
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,460
I beat the whole game.

1058
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,460
I have it on my phone.

1059
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,460
Nice.

1060
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,460
Yeah.

1061
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,460
I paid for it and it was ridiculous.

1062
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,640
It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.

1063
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:18,280
It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games, MacGyver, and something really

1064
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,280
retarded.

1065
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,280
I don't know.

1066
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,400
It's just like, the guy, the guy's just, a lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people

1067
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,880
in the nuts.

1068
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,880
It's so noted.

1069
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,880
OMG, spoiler.

1070
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,880
Spoiler.

1071
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,880
Well, if you, which puzzles though?

1072
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,880
I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in

1073
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,880
the nuts.

1074
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
Oh, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.

1075
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,120
Yeah, seriously.

1076
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
See if it works.

1077
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:49,800
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time, a time when kicking

1078
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,760
people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.

1079
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,160
It's the classic game of the week, a chance for Dark Soccer to take a trip down memory

1080
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,880
lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this and shut

1081
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880
up.

1082
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,880
Seriously.

1083
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,880
I'm going to post the Mint Scabbles picture in chat.

1084
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,880
You found it that quick.

1085
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
I did it ages.

1086
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
It was on my deviantart, duh.

1087
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,880
I did it a long time ago, though.

1088
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,880
Along with your, uh, Garris Shep picks.

1089
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
You know what?

1090
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,880
I haven't done any Garris Shep picks.

1091
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,880
I'm actually getting, when did I do this?

1092
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Like, years ago.

1093
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Anyway.

1094
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
Here we go.

1095
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
Classic of the week.

1096
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
What'd you pick, Dark Soccer?

1097
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
I picked Donkey Kong Country.

1098
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
Good pick.

1099
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,880
So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.

1100
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,880
How many of us cheered when we heard that?

1101
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Yay.

1102
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
Fuckin' love this game.

1103
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,880
Oh, Rare.

1104
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,880
Oh, Rare.

1105
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,880
So, um, I also have to say it's funny because, yeah, I do actually use Wikipedia for some

1106
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,880
of my references.

1107
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,880
And I'm like, DKC redirects here.

1108
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,880
For the genetic disease, see, dyskeratosis congenita.

1109
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
It just made me laugh for some reason.

1110
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,880
I was like, what is that?

1111
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Sounds like something to its skin.

1112
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,880
Anyway, um, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare.

1113
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,880
It came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.

1114
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:38,880
It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.

1115
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,880
It was done by Tim Stapler.

1116
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,880
By some dude.

1117
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Um, this game was really cool.

1118
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,880
There was so much going on with this one.

1119
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,880
It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.

1120
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,880
The Game Boy Color version had 41.

1121
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,880
And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by krumlings.

1122
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,880
So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines,

1123
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,880
you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls.

1124
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,880
You can do all kinds of stuff.

1125
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,880
And you can spell out K-O-N-G.

1126
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,880
And get extra life balloons.

1127
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
You can do all kinds of stuff.

1128
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,880
I love the rhino.

1129
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,880
And I like that you can ride a barrel and just not shit over while you're riding the barrel.

1130
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,880
So you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew Diddy.

1131
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
And you can switch between them.

1132
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,880
Diddy is more agile but not as powerful.

1133
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,880
And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the rhino,

1134
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,880
Espresso the ostrich,

1135
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Enguarde the swordfish,

1136
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,880
Winky the frog,

1137
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,880
and Squawks the parrot.

1138
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,880
I want to know who thought of those names because those are some dumb names.

1139
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,880
You have two player mode.

1140
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,880
So you can do contest or team.

1141
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,880
So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.

1142
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,880
And team, you play together.

1143
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,880
You work together. One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.

1144
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,880
And you can track your progress during the map.

1145
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,880
You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.

1146
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,880
And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.

1147
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,880
I want to know where he got that name.

1148
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,880
Now Bobby Black Wolf and Chad is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music.

1149
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,880
So here you go, some underwater music.

1150
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Oh, I love this music.

1151
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Here you go.

1152
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:48,880
So, anyway, it was really, it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed.

1153
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,880
So it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it.

1154
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,880
And it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong.

1155
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
And that's pretty much become the standard now.

1156
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,880
So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.

1157
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,880
So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.

1158
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,880
It was lots of fun. There were different ways to play through each level.

1159
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,880
You had secret rooms that you could get. You had all kinds of different things that were going on.

1160
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
You had all the balloons you could...

1161
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.

1162
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
I'm actually just going to hang up on them.

1163
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
I'm hanging up on you.

1164
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Who was it?

1165
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
I don't know. 800 number.

1166
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:44,880
But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.

1167
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
It had really fun music.

1168
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,880
In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like popping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.

1169
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
So that was pretty funny.

1170
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:02,880
So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was...

1171
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:10,880
It was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.

1172
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,880
And Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.

1173
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:22,880
So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006, and in Europe on December 8th.

1174
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,880
And North America on the 19th of February, 2007.

1175
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
There were sequels. There were other ones.

1176
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,880
There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.

1177
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,880
There was three, Dixie Kong's Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64, and Donkey Kong Country Returns.

1178
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
So, that was it.

1179
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,880
This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.

1180
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
Nice.

1181
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,880
Not bad.

1182
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
So that's it.

1183
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
There you go.

1184
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
Classic game of the week.

1185
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,880
Donkey Kong Country.

1186
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,880
That happens when you try to say all those words too fast.

1187
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,880
Oh, good times.

1188
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,880
Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.

1189
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
Please.

1190
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,880
I found an NPC called Chef Yan or something.

1191
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,880
Or Cookmaster Yan.

1192
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,880
So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yan.

1193
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
And Yan can cook.

1194
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,880
But it was Walk with Yan that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.

1195
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
So I've actually been...

1196
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.

1197
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,880
Got me cooking.

1198
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,880
There you go.

1199
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,880
Alright.

1200
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,880
I think it's time for a break.

1201
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
But don't go anywhere, guys.

1202
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,880
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1203
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.

1204
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
The recent shows have been very long.

1205
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
But hey, it happens sometimes.

1206
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:00,880
But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including rapid fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1207
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,880
You know what? The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.

1208
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,880
That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.

1209
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
That's all fixed tonight.

1210
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
So I'm sure people will be getting in.

1211
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line.

1212
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,880
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

1213
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,880
We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1214
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:37,880
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.

1215
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,880
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.

1216
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,880
If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night, of course, at vognetwork.com.

1217
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,880
Be sure to join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com.

1218
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,880
And Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.

1219
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:01,880
Alright, so let's see. Let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about.

1220
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:08,880
And I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is.

1221
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,880
But Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.

1222
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:22,880
And, of course, one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play, so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go.

1223
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:28,880
And that is coming. They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.

1224
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
That's pretty awesome.

1225
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,880
I haven't had a chance to play Tokyo Jungle yet, and I'm really upset because it's one of those games I really wanted to check out.

1226
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,880
But I've been hearing it's not bad.

1227
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,880
I want to play it.

1228
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,880
Yeah, me too.

1229
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,880
They have a picture of an elephant with roller skates on, so I mean...

1230
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,880
How could that be bad?

1231
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,880
How could that possibly be bad?

1232
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,880
Yeah.

1233
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,880
And, of course, there's a new indie bundle that you can check out. It's the Indie Royale.

1234
01:12:52,880 --> 01:13:01,880
They're doing their Oktoberfest bundle, and it features a bunch of different things in there, including Zoe Mode's Chime,

1235
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,880
all three episodes of Hector, Badge of Carnage by Telltale Games,

1236
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:14,880
the Smudged Cat Games' Adventures of Shuggy, and also Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble.

1237
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,880
Yep.

1238
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,880
That sounds like a winner.

1239
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:25,880
And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two Chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.

1240
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,880
So, it's pretty sweet.

1241
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:36,880
And I guess you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.

1242
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?

1243
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,880
Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too. I think they added some more games to that.

1244
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,880
They did. You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.

1245
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,880
Wizorb. Oh my god, I already bought all these games.

1246
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:59,880
I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.

1247
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,880
Oh, well, I can't be too upset. I mean, I paid money for really good games.

1248
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.

1249
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,880
No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use...

1250
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,880
Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.

1251
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,880
Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah, you should give one away. It's a good deal.

1252
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,880
Good deal. One day left, by the way.

1253
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,880
And last but not least, a game I'm very excited about.

1254
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week.

1255
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,880
And not to be outdone by that, D3 of America decided,

1256
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,880
Hey, guess what? Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US.

1257
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,880
Fuck yeah!

1258
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
John, Loki was very happy.

1259
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,880
So that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.

1260
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,880
Oh, that's a... Oh, okay. I was like, winter 2013?

1261
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,880
Yeah, yeah. Remember, it's considered fall.

1262
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,880
Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.

1263
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
No, no, not at all.

1264
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
That's good.

1265
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,880
And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.

1266
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,880
A reason for you to own a CD.

1267
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,880
And apparently the people that played it at the Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.

1268
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,880
Like, they actually added physics this time around, and, you know, the details a little bit better, and...

1269
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:20,880
Wait, they're trying to legitimize?

1270
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,880
No, seriously, I don't care. It doesn't matter. It's sandbox making the game. It's gonna be awesome.

1271
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,880
I have no doubt it's gonna be awesome.

1272
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,880
But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.

1273
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,880
That's something that doesn't happen very often.

1274
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,880
I still need to get LittleBigPlanet Vita.

1275
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,880
Yeah, me too.

1276
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,880
Alright, moving on. With some rapid-fire news over here.

1277
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,880
I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.

1278
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,880
It's dated Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams.

1279
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,880
The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64,

1280
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,880
when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers.

1281
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,880
Like, really, really similar. They kind of had a point.

1282
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,880
But since then, it always had a bit of a cult following, because the music was very different,

1283
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
and the music was very, very good.

1284
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,880
And now, the series has had a cult following ever since then.

1285
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,880
They had the DS game not that long ago.

1286
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,880
Well, now there was a Kickstarter, and the success of that, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams,

1287
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,880
will come out on PC October 23rd.

1288
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,880
I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.

1289
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,880
Yes.

1290
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,880
They show it a little bit in the trailer about the shifting between different worlds.

1291
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,880
Yeah, yeah.

1292
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
And the music changes when you switch, too.

1293
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,880
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1294
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,880
So, they're saying it's like a platformer Igaruga, almost.

1295
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:48,880
Okay. That's kind of a neat concept, and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.

1296
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,880
They have a demo out there you can check out for free.

1297
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,880
I actually backed it, so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.

1298
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,880
Nice. Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013,

1299
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,880
which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there, so...

1300
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Yeah.

1301
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,880
Very cool.

1302
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,880
Congrats to the team there for getting that out.

1303
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,880
The final title was voted upon by the community.

1304
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,880
Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.

1305
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,880
Yeah, I totally missed that.

1306
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,880
Broken Sword Kickstarter.

1307
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,880
It did not hit beneath a Steel Sky 2 goal, but a sequel is going to happen anyway.

1308
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,880
Here's what happened.

1309
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:31,880
Revolution Software, they asked for $400,000 to kickstart the fifth installment of Broken Sword,

1310
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,880
called Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.

1311
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,880
The Kickstarter closed with $771,000, so that's good.

1312
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,880
They way out did that.

1313
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,880
Now, there were stretch goals after getting the initial amount.

1314
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,880
The $1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky.

1315
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,880
However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal,

1316
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
because, quote,

1317
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,880
We are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky,

1318
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,880
and are currently discussing ideas for this project,

1319
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,880
which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.

1320
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:07,880
So, there you go.

1321
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,880
The original game dates all the way back to 1994.

1322
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
Well, that's pretty cool.

1323
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,880
If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project,

1324
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,880
Final Fantasy VI, its overclocked remixed Final Fantasy VI album,

1325
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,880
there was a Kickstarter for it, it was shut down,

1326
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,880
and it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.

1327
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,880
It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.

1328
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,880
But apparently, all those issues have been worked out.

1329
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,880
The fundraiser is back.

1330
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,880
Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI celebration,

1331
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,880
but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.

1332
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,880
It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.

1333
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,880
The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes, or at events, or what have you.

1334
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:06,880
It's apparently trying to raise $30,000, but with 29 days left to go, they are looking pretty good.

1335
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,880
So, there you go.

1336
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,880
You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.

1337
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,880
Let's hope, for act-def's sake, there's another Chocobo wrap on it.

1338
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,880
That would be phenomenal.

1339
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,880
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

1340
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,880
Chocobop.

1341
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,880
There's a whole little, I love this song he wrote about...

1342
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
Or, I love this song? Question mark.

1343
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,880
This song's okay.

1344
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,880
Alright, Final Fantasy Star Online 2 is free-to-play on the Vita.

1345
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,880
Yay!

1346
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,880
It needs to be free-to-play on PC!

1347
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Well, free-to-play on the Vita...

1348
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,880
That's in Japan.

1349
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,880
Hopefully that's here, too.

1350
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Yeah, but it was on the Phantasy Star Fan Blog that Vita players will be able to play with PC players.

1351
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,880
There's going to be certain lobbies open to both.

1352
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,880
And then, Arcade Heroes.

1353
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,880
Had a thing about the Family Fun Arcade closing January 2013.

1354
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,880
Why must arcades close?

1355
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,880
They don't make money.

1356
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,880
Oh, shut up. That's no excuse.

1357
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,880
I think this particular one, that wasn't the case, though.

1358
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:21,880
The guy had been running it for 30-plus years, and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.

1359
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,880
So I actually don't think, in this case, it was a money thing.

1360
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,880
Yeah.

1361
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,880
But it was a landmark arcade. I mean, it was a big deal.

1362
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,880
Yeah, one of the big ones.

1363
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,880
But, it was a big home for fighting games, too.

1364
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,880
Because, I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.

1365
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,880
And then, Prison Architect.

1366
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:52,880
Basically, they had a paid alpha version, and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.

1367
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,880
The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.

1368
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one, because apparently everybody's making money on there.

1369
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,880
Just kidding.

1370
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Maybe you are.

1371
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,880
Ha ha ha ha.

1372
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,880
Okay. That's up.

1373
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,880
Alright, let's go to the Fugu question of the week.

1374
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,880
Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities.

1375
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,880
And we answer them. Read the answers for you here.

1376
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,880
Right on the show.

1377
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,880
This week it's all about Windows 8.

1378
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,880
The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.

1379
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,880
With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?

1380
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,880
Is it something you're picking up?

1381
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,880
Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?

1382
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:44,880
Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows, because I knew if I did that, somebody would say,

1383
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,880
Fuck Windows. I'm on Linux. Fuck Windows. I'm on Mac.

1384
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,880
So there was kind of a two-part question.

1385
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Well Mac, you don't have a choice. You just have to upgrade when they come out with a new one.

1386
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,880
Otherwise your computer will stop working.

1387
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,880
Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too,

1388
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,880
what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?

1389
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?

1390
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,880
So let's go to Google Plus first.

1391
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,880
I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E.

1392
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
I used to know him when he lived out here.

1393
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,880
He answered the question saying,

1394
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,880
I use Linux for many reasons, but games are not one of them.

1395
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,880
I'd say, however, that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene.

1396
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,880
I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OSes,

1397
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now.

1398
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,880
I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped,

1399
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,880
but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux.

1400
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,880
And, of course, all Android devices run Linux, but that's a different world of gaming.

1401
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,880
Now if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.

1402
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,880
I do want to add something, actually, Rob.

1403
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,880
You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.

1404
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,880
Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.

1405
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,880
That's cool.

1406
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,880
Flaco Jones responded on Google Plus saying,

1407
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.

1408
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,880
I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs

1409
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,880
and I can't stand it.

1410
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,880
Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.

1411
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,880
I love all the Mac OSes I've used.

1412
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,880
There isn't a lot of variation between them.

1413
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,880
They are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.

1414
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,880
Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.

1415
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,880
I do wish there were more games for Mac,

1416
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,880
because whenever I do play on a Mac it feels a lot smoother than the PC version,

1417
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,880
even though my PC has slightly better specs.

1418
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,880
ActDeft replied on Google Plus saying,

1419
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,880
The Win 8 Metro UI, look at all these people on Google Plus this week,

1420
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,880
is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.

1421
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,880
That interface is made for a tablet and it would totally work for that really well,

1422
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,880
but not for a keyboard and mouse.

1423
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,880
Also considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them,

1424
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,880
Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture

1425
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,880
if your internet connection goes down or something.

1426
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,880
I'm currently using Win XP.

1427
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,880
I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.

1428
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,880
Facebook.

1429
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,880
I love this nickname.

1430
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,880
I Am Super Lazy replied and said,

1431
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,880
It's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.

1432
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,880
My thought is that it works best as a media center PC,

1433
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,880
but as a traditional PC it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.

1434
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,880
There might be better options.

1435
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,880
Code Man said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs,

1436
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,880
but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.

1437
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,880
You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.

1438
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,880
What happened to the Windows XP days?

1439
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,880
The good old days.

1440
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,880
The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it

1441
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,880
and if you use Steam you're really shit out of luck.

1442
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now

1443
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,880
because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.

1444
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,880
Of course.

1445
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,880
I'm not looking forward to it.

1446
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:48,880
VX Jason XV.

1447
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,880
Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.

1448
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,880
Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe N and Notch have talked about

1449
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,880
will eventually set it up and if they don't already,

1450
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,880
quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface

1451
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,880
on Windows 7 again.

1452
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,880
Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the Surface.

1453
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,880
Any gamer that owns or runs a non-Windows platform

1454
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,880
has complained about the lack of games at one time or another.

1455
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Even boot campers moan when they have to switch OS just to play.

1456
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,880
I'm always disheartened when I only see the Windows icon on a title on Steam

1457
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
and I'm always so delighted when they both are there.

1458
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,880
No Mac exclusives as far as I know of.

1459
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,880
That's surprising to me.

1460
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,880
I'll be awfully surprised if Steam does in fact appear on Linux in the next 365 days,

1461
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,880
even two years.

1462
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,880
I don't expect it to happen.

1463
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,880
Hmm.

1464
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,880
Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet but from what I've seen it looks messy.

1465
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,880
I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.

1466
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,880
I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.

1467
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,880
We only just migrated to Windows 7.

1468
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,880
Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.

1469
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,880
And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.

1470
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,880
I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on

1471
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,880
even back when I had a PC.

1472
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,880
Macs have World of Warcraft.

1473
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,880
That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.

1474
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,880
I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows

1475
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,880
to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.

1476
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,880
Tigerclaw says personally I don't think you would notice any performance increase

1477
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,880
going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

1478
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:17,880
Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.

1479
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,880
Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI

1480
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,880
and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro style UI

1481
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,880
that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard and Windows Phone.

1482
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,880
I hate though actually about the UI real quick.

1483
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,880
It's the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.

1484
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,880
Really?

1485
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,880
Yeah, because remember it's made for tablets

1486
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,880
so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.

1487
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,880
Fuck that.

1488
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,880
Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.

1489
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,880
Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.

1490
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,880
With all due respect for the creator of Minecraft,

1491
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,880
I think he needs to get off his high horse.

1492
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,880
Apparently from the way I understand the story

1493
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,880
is that he fears that with Windows 8

1494
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,880
it will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.

1495
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,880
He states that he would not have his game run on Windows 8 at all

1496
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,880
than work with Microsoft which I think is a very bad decision.

1497
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,880
It seems like he thinks that the Microsoft App Store

1498
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,880
is going to be the be-all end-all for applications

1499
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,880
and that he is getting his game certified for it

1500
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,880
but is basically contributing to the so-called walled garden.

1501
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,880
It's funny because last time I checked

1502
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,880
his game is freely downloadable off his website

1503
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.

1504
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,880
But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores

1505
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,880
that you have to go through a certification process

1506
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,880
to get your app on there in the first place?

1507
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,880
It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.

1508
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,880
I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game

1509
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,880
for the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear

1510
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,880
on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go

1511
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,880
and it's right there when I start the PC up?

1512
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,880
Hell, last time I checked you are not being held up at gunpoint

1513
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,880
to buy Windows 8. Interesting point.

1514
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,880
But I think the thing is though is for all those three platforms that you mentioned

1515
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,880
there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.

1516
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,880
Like he cannot sell you a copy from his website.

1517
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,880
Maybe you can for Android because I know you can do third party apps and stuff like that.

1518
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,880
But for everything else you cannot buy straight from his website.

1519
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:09,880
Isn't some of that contracted out too?

1520
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,880
Because technically he didn't develop the Xbox Live version.

1521
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,880
Yeah, that was 4J. 4J Studios did.

1522
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,880
But here's the thing, it's like why, once again,

1523
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
why would he give Microsoft a portion of his profits

1524
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,880
to have the game on their App Store?

1525
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Which, let's be honest, they had the whole Windows Live App Store thing

1526
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,880
and did anyone give a shit about that? Nope.

1527
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits

1528
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,880
and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?

1529
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,880
And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.

1530
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,880
Microsoft charges for updates on your games.

1531
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,880
And how often is Minecraft updated? About once a week.

1532
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,880
You know, granted those are beta updates and stuff like that,

1533
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,880
and you don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.

1534
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,880
So why would he want to pay money to do that?

1535
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,880
That's the same reason why his game's not on Steam,

1536
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,880
because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.

1537
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,880
Fair question. Okay.

1538
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
Just a few more answers here from Zether.

1539
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,880
It says Windows 8 is like Vista.

1540
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,880
Every other release of Windows has been bad for the past few years.

1541
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,880
I'd rather wait for Windows 9. So they're like Star Trek movies.

1542
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,880
Seriously, it is. Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.

1543
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
That's a bummer, because that means the next Star Trek movie is going to be bad.

1544
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,880
And I don't want it to be bad.

1545
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,880
But maybe.

1546
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
We might, we might.

1547
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,880
After seeing a few things going on, and it's got Sherlock Holmes in it. I mean, just saying.

1548
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,880
Wait a minute. I thought Sherlock Holmes was on CBS now.

1549
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,880
No. No.

1550
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,880
Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?

1551
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:51,880


1552
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.

1553
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,880
Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it,

1554
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,880
so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.

1555
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,880
But after the little bit I watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.

1556
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,880
They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson.

1557
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,880
Nice. Alright, Hitstun says, Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2, and PC users will certainly skip it,

1558
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,880
and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting.

1559
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,880
What the hell? UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting? Really?

1560
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,880
Yeah. Lame.

1561
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,880
Windows 8 looks pretty bad for a typical PC application that you use with a keyboard and mouse,

1562
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,880
and if it's like the current Xbox 360 dashboard, it's awful for games, too.

1563
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,880
It does look like a fine interface for touch screens,

1564
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,880
and if they decide to make a phone that runs the full PC version of Windows 8, I'd probably go for it.

1565
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:44,880
People treat their phones like computers nowadays,

1566
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,880
so a phone running a full computer OS specialized for touch screens sounds really cool.

1567
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
It's just not going to replace Windows 7 on my desktop.

1568
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,880
And lastly, Sean L. replies, saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.

1569
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,880
I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down,

1570
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,880
and I write software for a living.

1571
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,880
If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?

1572
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,880
I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two, maybe.

1573
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,880
Wow. Very interesting.

1574
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,880
Alright, that's it for the football question of the week.

1575
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,880
How about you guys? Windows 8? Yes? No? Maybe so?

1576
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:22,880
Never. Never? Why?

1577
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,880
Unless they make it like Windows 7.

1578
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:31,880
Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000

1579
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,880
into whatever the hell one came after that.

1580
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,880
XP or Vista?

1581
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,880
XP. Because I actually had to get a new computer.

1582
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,880
Because something happened and it fucked up my hard drive.

1583
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,880
I think my hard drive was already going out because I know that an OS just won't screw it up automatically, but still.

1584
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
I hated Vista.

1585
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,880
I really like Windows 7, because it took the stuff that was good in Vista,

1586
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:03,880
took actually a few bits and pieces from memory management from Linux, and it's pretty solid.

1587
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,880
On top of that, I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users,

1588
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:18,880
and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable,

1589
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:24,880
and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.

1590
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:30,880
The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5, because I used 6 at school.

1591
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,880
That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.

1592
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,880
I mean, it's a really good OS. A lot of people use it.

1593
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:47,880
It's got great graphical management, clearly, because that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.

1594
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:57,880
However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually is a lot more versatile.

1595
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,880
You really can do a lot more with Linux. I think that Linux should really replace both of them, but that's just me.

1596
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,880
That's just me. Don't shoot me or anything.

1597
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,880
Windows 8, it's basically, Microsoft has this whole micromanagement thing,

1598
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,880
and Windows 8 is really going to limit, it's basically going to be the PC for idiots.

1599
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:22,880
Except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and trying to figure out how to do things, and it's just not working.

1600
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,880
It's, I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.

1601
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:34,880
Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off. That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.

1602
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:41,880
Yeah, I just, I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.

1603
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,880
It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.

1604
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,880
Loki?

1605
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:53,880
Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs, like back in, you know, the 90s and 80s?

1606
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,880
I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.

1607
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:05,880
I mean, seriously, it's like, come on, the people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.

1608
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,880
You know, kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs,

1609
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:22,880
but yet, why are we like, you know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use?

1610
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,880
I know, it's because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit. I guess that's it.

1611
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,880
Got that, you know, retirement money burning a hole in the through their pocket, I guess.

1612
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:38,880
And Raman, no, a PC for idiots is not a Mac. A PC for idiots is Windows 8. End of story.

1613
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,880
You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use Mac OS.

1614
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,880
And no, I would not buy it. I'm not getting a Windows 8.

1615
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:54,880
I'm going to take the wait and see approach that somebody else said. I'm going to be honest, this is going to make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.

1616
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:06,880
The fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.

1617
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,880
Shut up.

1618
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,880
For once, I'm not judging you.

1619
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:18,880
If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go about replacing it?

1620
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:25,880
Just wait. Wait for Windows 9 or something else.

1621
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,880
Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.

1622
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,880
Good job.

1623
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:43,880
So there you go. If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1624
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:45,880
Let's get back into some news. Loki.

1625
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:57,880
One thing. Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.

1626
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:13,880
Alright. So, there's a word out there, a phrase out there, that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community. It's called fan service.

1627
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:20,880
And what do fans want? Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.

1628
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,880
Amen to that.

1629
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:32,880
Team Ninja, they were saying that, you know, earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.

1630
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,880
Where's the fun in that?

1631
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:42,880
However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.

1632
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:52,880
But, the fans who had played the early demos, we got a lot of feedback from them saying, we want bigger breasts. Make the characters more like that.

1633
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:57,880
That was kind of surprising, giving, you know, the suggestions to tone down the sexuality.

1634
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,880
And, so, Team Ninja being Team Ninja.

1635
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:08,880
Look, Team Ninja, props for, like, trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.

1636
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,880
Gold star, you tried.

1637
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,880
Let's be real, Dead or Alive is all about excess, and, like, if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.

1638
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:18,880
Then you have Virtua Fighter.

1639
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,880
And a really shitty volleyball game.

1640
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,880
No, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit. I hate Virtua Fighter. I love Dead or Alive.

1641
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:26,880
Now, how do you feel about bigger boobs?

1642
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:28,880
I'm all for it.

1643
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:30,880
Can you imagine?

1644
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,880
Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio. Even the women want bigger boobs.

1645
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:39,880
Can you imagine, like, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts? Fuck that. Nope, not buying it.

1646
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:46,880
Well, you know what? But, hey, you know what? I don't want small-chested women to feel, you know, there's fan clubs for that, too.

1647
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,880
The itty-bitty titty committee. There's fan clubs for that, too.

1648
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,880
But, in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.

1649
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,880
It really is.

1650
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:07,880
I really think we should, like, you know, ramp up Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 with, like, hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.

1651
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress-up for dudes.

1652
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,880
That's why I'm saying we throw the orgy and sex and nudity and all the X-rated content in there.

1653
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,880
It's girly dress-up for dudes.

1654
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,880
Because then it's girly dress-up to then have them take it off and have sex with each other.

1655
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,880
You've already got the butt-floss string.

1656
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:31,880
Yes, but, you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.

1657
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,880
I really want there to be a part three with pillow-fight mode. I think that would be a lot of fun.

1658
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1659
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,880
And, like, as you're doing pillow-fight mode, like, pieces of clothing, just, oh.

1660
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,880
Pillow-fight mode? Using Connect.

1661
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,880
No, we don't have panda boobs. Shut up.

1662
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Why are they talking about pandaren in chat?

1663
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,880
I don't know.

1664
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,880
Furry boobies.

1665
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,880
That might take you out of the experience a little bit.

1666
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,880
Alright.

1667
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,880
Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5.

1668
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,880
Moving on.

1669
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,880
This is the story that just won't go away. Remember 38 Studios and how they closed?

1670
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,880
And how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?

1671
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,880
Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits.

1672
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Because, you know, that's what happens.

1673
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:29,880
Those things never leak out.

1674
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,880
When they liquidate you, they auction all that shit off.

1675
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:38,880
So, they were going to sell those on October 23rd when the auction was slated to happen.

1676
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,880
However, Microsoft is requesting that Rhode Island return those developer kits.

1677
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:45,880
Or what?

1678
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,880
And they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.

1679
01:39:48,880 --> 01:40:00,880
Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.

1680
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:12,880
We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 Studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.

1681
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:14,880
Here's something kind of scary though.

1682
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,880
If you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.

1683
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,880
You know, you license a game from...

1684
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:28,880
So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying,

1685
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,880
Hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us? Yeah, we need those back.

1686
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,880
You licensed it, so you need to send them back.

1687
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,880
Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have? Yeah, well, the license is up. Yank.

1688
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,880
Fun. But yeah, seriously, those XDKs do get out there.

1689
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,880
I would know from personal experience.

1690
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,880
And how much approximately would one set you back?

1691
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:04,880
Not very much anymore because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and J tags are pretty out there, there's not much use for XDKs anymore.

1692
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,880
Like 300, 400. Oh, that's not too bad.

1693
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,880
I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.

1694
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,880
Interesting.

1695
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer.

1696
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,880
Well, I was actually playing with my iPad. Yeah, I can tell.

1697
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,880
Pay attention! Hey!

1698
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,880
I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class. You can't. How about a really trippy ass game?

1699
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:32,880
Called Middens.

1700
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,880
Kitten Middens.

1701
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,880
I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.

1702
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:53,880
It basically is an indie RPG, so it's got, it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy ass backgrounds.

1703
01:41:53,880 --> 01:42:04,880
So it looks like you're running, you know, head first through a combination of a Dali or even, you know, going back to Hieronymus Bosch.

1704
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,880
Yeah, I know. I'm going all art history on you guys.

1705
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,880
It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.

1706
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,880
Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.

1707
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this, because it's really fucking weird.

1708
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:28,880
Well, at least you get a gun.

1709
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,880
And you can try it out for free.

1710
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,880
I like free.

1711
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,880
Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.

1712
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,880
Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.

1713
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:44,880
You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.

1714
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:46,880
Oh, that's right. You're not here next week.

1715
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,880
That's right. I'm going to be at Disneyland.

1716
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:51,880
It's all right. She won't play it anyways by next week.

1717
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:57,880
She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.

1718
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,880
No, I'm just playing for Becky.

1719
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
There you go. We should start a foundation.

1720
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,880
We should. We should start a foundation.

1721
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,880
Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.

1722
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
We'll play Mass Effect for money.

1723
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:20,880
It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation. I shouldn't. I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.

1724
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,880
I don't play 24-7. I basically play Mass Effect once a week.

1725
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is...

1726
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,880
Pandas! Shut up.

1727
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:30,880
My bad.

1728
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,880
Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.

1729
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,880
Actually, Bobby Black Wolf is volunteering. He needs that foundation, so he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.

1730
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,880
That means that he has to come over to my house.

1731
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:48,880
Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.

1732
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:49,880


1733
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,880
And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.

1734
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:58,880
The Church of Garish Foundation. Thank you, ass-deft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos. Now they're little asses.

1735
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,880
Also, AlphaKananagram asked about me having an iPad. Yeah, I didn't actually bring it up on the show.

1736
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:17,880
Dan traded his Transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card, power supply, and got Borderlands 2, and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad.

1737
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:19,880
So he made it up to me.

1738
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,880
He traded a Transformer? Like a doll?

1739
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,880
No, he traded his shitty android shit.

1740
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:28,880
He didn't like it anyway.

1741
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,880
I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.

1742
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:34,880
We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.

1743
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:36,880
Alright, I get it now, sorry.

1744
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,880
But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway. He was going to sell it.

1745
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,880
Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.

1746
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:48,880
But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it, and he was going to sell it anyway, so he got me an iPad instead.

1747
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,880
What do you think this is, RobG4?

1748
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,880
I'm just a pretty face.

1749
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:00,880
Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day. I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Rep.

1750
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,880
The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.

1751
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:10,880
I mean, seriously, he just sits there and is like, okay, what retarded thing can I say next?

1752
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,880
Funny joke, hahaha, I'm funny.

1753
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,880
And they're just like, what the fuck did that have to do with anything?

1754
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:25,880
You know, it's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.

1755
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,880
Alright.

1756
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:38,880
And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android. I've used it. I've given it a chance.

1757
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,880
I hate Windows tablets even more.

1758
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,880
iOS has what I want to do, and Wacom loves it. The end.

1759
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:53,880
DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see. What is the old saying? She's a hater, and guess what she's gonna do?

1760
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:55,880
I'm gonna hate!

1761
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,880
Exactly.

1762
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,880
Y'all can bite my tuchus.

1763
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,880
Uh, BlackWolf in our chatroom says S3 greater than iPhone. You know it's hilarious.

1764
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:06,880


1765
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:10,880
You know it's hilarious. No, this is what's hilarious. iPhone 5 comes out, right?

1766
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:18,880
My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old ass Blackberry. He has like one of the first Blackberries.

1767
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,880
Only a long time ago. It was an old ass phone, right? He finally decides he's gonna join the current generation of phones.

1768
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,880
So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches? Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.

1769
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:34,880
Bravo. Bravo. Wise choice. Keeper. He's a keeper.

1770
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,880
Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.

1771
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:47,880
But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile.

1772
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:54,880
Which apparently is treated him very well over the years, so he didn't want to, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.

1773
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,880
I love my iPhone 4S. I really do.

1774
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,880
There's several people in chat going, Alan is awesome.

1775
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:08,880
He could technically get a phone and then unlock it and have it, I think, work on that service, an iPhone.

1776
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:19,880
I heard T-Mobile was actually doing, sorry, I'm eating crackers live on air. I heard T-Mobile was actually doing some type of advertising campaign targeting jailbroken iPhone users.

1777
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:30,880
Because I have a, well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's, actually it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.

1778
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:45,880
You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is 30 bucks for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use, and even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data.

1779
01:47:46,880 --> 01:48:01,880
I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3. I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever. The only thing, the reason why I like it is in a whole what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that, let me play with that.

1780
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,880
And he can do the same thing with my iPhone, right? He probably uses my iPad more than I do.

1781
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:18,880
But the reason, the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T, we don't get the free text messages, and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that, so that's the one thing I don't like.

1782
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:21,880
I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?

1783
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:23,880
I do.

1784
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:25,880
Well, way to go. Great provider.

1785
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,880
Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.

1786
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:31,880
I have a cheap plan, 30 bucks a month.

1787
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:33,880
Alright.

1788
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,880
T-Mobile.

1789
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,880
Moving on. Loki, you got a story.

1790
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:51,880
Alright. Borderlands 2. There's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.

1791
01:48:52,880 --> 01:49:04,880
They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on, I forget what fucking service it is.

1792
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,880
It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.

1793
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:21,880
And when you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff, you know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.

1794
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:33,880
So your badass rank goes away, all your, not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.

1795
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:43,880
Because the way the badass points work is all of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters.

1796
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:50,880
Or all of your characters. And then you get perks like, you know, plus 1% to your damage or something like that.

1797
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:52,880
And it's spread across all your characters.

1798
01:49:52,880 --> 01:50:08,880
So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people if it has happened to you that you submit your save and stuff so they can take a look at it.

1799
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,880
And they're investigating.

1800
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,880
Mm2k in our chat room wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?

1801
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:17,880
Yes, it's all platforms.

1802
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,880
Uh oh.

1803
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:26,880
It's because it's tied to, it's not Premium Club, it's, fuck I forget what it's called.

1804
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,880
They have it on the front page there. You can sign up for it.

1805
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:39,880
And it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get and once you've signed up they give you one additional key.

1806
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,880
So they have that.

1807
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,880
Honestly, if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up, I mean, I think there's save it or not.

1808
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
Throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families.

1809
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:54,880
Does that work so well for other people?

1810
01:50:55,880 --> 01:51:03,880
Exactly. I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to.

1811
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,880
Not that anyone would do that, but you can.

1812
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:14,880
And not only does it erase your badass points, it's basically everything that's tied to your account.

1813
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:20,880
So all your skins and faces that you've unlocked, and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions, are gone.

1814
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,880
And some of those, there may be no way to get those back. So that kinda sucks.

1815
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:31,880
Alright. Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.

1816
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,880
There was another one?

1817
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,880
There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.

1818
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,880
And it was about New Super Mario Bros. 2 and the DLC.

1819
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:50,880
The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros. 2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.

1820
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,880
Wow, they're not late to the party?

1821
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,880
No. Well, you know what?

1822
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is a-okay arriving late to this party.

1823
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:08,880
But, you know, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra, and some of the levels that will be available.

1824
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:15,880
GoGo as Gold Mario Pack. Three gold Mario themed courses up to 30,000 coins.

1825
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,880
Challenge the Record A Pack. It will post the top scores on the game's website.

1826
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:27,880
And Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels. Those will all be in the Coin Rush mode.

1827
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:31,880
So, are they, like, legitimizing Asshole Mario? Because that's kind of awesome, if true.

1828
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:44,880
October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan. 200 yen each. I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind. And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.

1829
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:56,880
Once again, like, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have. You know, kind of crossing Nintendo, like, Mario with LittleBigPlanet. Can you imagine if they did that?

1830
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:07,880
Like, first party Nintendo games, but like, you know, like a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, in like a LittleBigPlanet setting where you design your own levels and games and shit.

1831
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:23,880
Nintendo would never let that happen, because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters. Because people, like, if Mario, like, Mario Mario was in LittleBigPlanet, people would be building levels that's like, Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that. And Nintendo would never let that happen.

1832
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:33,880
Well, no, it wouldn't necessarily be like that. It would be just like, um, you know, you design your own levels. Not necessarily like you design a giant penis. Although, you could probably build a penis at the time.

1833
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,880
Mario sucks a penis. That would be a level that would get uploaded instantly.

1834
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:53,880
Well, that's why there's peer review. They can label that stuff. I mean, come on. You can't just let a few people ruin a great idea. Because there's always gonna be some dude out there. I'm sure there are people that have dedicated their lives to, I'm gonna create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.

1835
01:53:54,880 --> 01:54:03,880
I think I have a rule about design. Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm gonna have to run this by Dark Sakura. So, you ready? Tell me if this is a true statement or not.

1836
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:12,880
This is a very zen statement. I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria. Where there is design, there is penis.

1837
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,880
No.

1838
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,880
What do you mean no?

1839
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,880
When there...

1840
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,880
Where there are immature minds, there is penis.

1841
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,880
And where isn't there immature minds?

1842
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,880
Clearly not in the internet. The internet is quite mature. Thank you very much.

1843
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,880
Think about it. I want you to go ask your teacher.

1844
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,880
I heard this on an internet radio show. Where there is design, there is penis. What do you think?

1845
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,880
He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.

1846
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,880
That is so true, is what he'll say.

1847
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:51,880
No, he'll roll his eyes. I know he would do it. And he'd just go, what?

1848
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,880
Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.

1849
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:58,880
I've seen his art. It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.

1850
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,880
Yet.

1851
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:02,880
No.

1852
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,880
Where there is design, there is penis.

1853
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
No, I sense an art book possibility.

1854
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:13,880
Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.

1855
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:14,880
Thank you!

1856
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,880
It will be rated M.

1857
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:22,880
There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was, guess who drew the penis.

1858
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:28,880
And somebody would take her on a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.

1859
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,880
And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.

1860
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,880
And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.

1861
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,880
We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire. Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama. Shut up.

1862
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,880
We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.

1863
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:44,880
Oh, that game.

1864
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,880
Yeah, we would do that.

1865
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:49,880
But I have to tell you, it wasn't Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.

1866
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,880
And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.

1867
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:56,880
I took a picture of it.

1868
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:58,880
There you go.

1869
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:00,880
Do you have any other fanboy wank ideas, Loki?

1870
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,880
No, that's it.

1871
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,880
I would really dig a game with a level editor.

1872
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,880
Anything from Nintendo. I mean, maybe not Ice Climber or something like that.

1873
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:20,880
Mario Kart, Mario, Zelda. Not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.

1874
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,880
That'd be awesome.

1875
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:29,880
Alright. Black Wolf says excite bike. Can you do a penis and excite bike? It would probably be very difficult.

1876
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:31,880
No, because they have, you know, it's...

1877
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,880
I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.

1878
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:42,880
Well, I remember that you could draw things in excite bike based on letter.

1879
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,880
Like, you would choose a letter and that would be the...

1880
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,880
So you could technically make a corset with penis.

1881
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,880
Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.

1882
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:55,880
So, think about it. Think about it. Or don't think about it.

1883
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,880
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, alright, true story here.

1884
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,880
When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.

1885
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:11,880
So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.

1886
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,880
Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.

1887
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,880
The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.

1888
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,880
We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.

1889
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,880
I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the fries penis on the Orange Elder Radio website.

1890
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,880
Nobody cares. Alright.

1891
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:33,880
It's got hairy balls.

1892
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:35,880
Oh, hooray. Hooray.

1893
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:44,880
I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.

1894
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:52,880
I've had a really crazy week. I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.

1895
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:59,880
Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.

1896
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:03,880
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first and pull out an email that she thinks, hey.

1897
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:04,880


1898
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:05,880


1899
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:06,880


1900
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:07,880


1901
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,880
It's kind of sticky.

1902
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,880
Good evening. I have to object to something Dark Soccer said on last week's OLR.

1903
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,880
Well, too fucking bad, Skip. No, I'm kidding.

1904
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:22,880
Last week, Dark Soccer called Dan's reference to the fake game, Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition, reprehensible.

1905
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,880
I find this to be abhorrent.

1906
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:30,880
How is Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference, Beaten Groovy, the Ike Turner Experience?

1907
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:31,880


1908
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,880
In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.

1909
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:46,880
Britney's Dance, Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent.

1910
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:48,880
Ew!

1911
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,880
Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.

1912
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,880
That is a list list in development there.

1913
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,880
Yeah, we're going to need to do that when you come back.

1914
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,880
Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game.

1915
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,880
Next email.

1916
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:08,880
Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game I hope to see launched on the Xbox 720 or Xbox Lube or whatever.

1917
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:10,880
Next email.

1918
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,880
First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.

1919
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:24,880
I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey collection when I tried to redeem the 30 day voucher.

1920
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:30,880
The system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it. Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?

1921
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,880
That's a great question for Sony. I don't know.

1922
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,880
I don't think so because it's auto renewing.

1923
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,880
You could turn that off though. You could turn off the auto renewing.

1924
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,880
You could turn off the auto renewing. They want you to, you know, the catch is they want you to do that.

1925
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,880
The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.

1926
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:58,880
Hold on though. Tip, get one of those pre-paid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.

1927
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,880
Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.

1928
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,880
Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the MacFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?

1929
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,880
Fuck if I know.

1930
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:18,880
The answer is I don't. I wanted the Sylvanas figure. That was it because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.

1931
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:24,880
Believe it or not, I don't have any of that stuff. The last like game figure I bought is that Balthier from Final Fantasy 12 because...

1932
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:28,880
You did have the Final Fantasy 12 clock. No, the 11 o'clock.

1933
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,880
You had the 11 o'clock.

1934
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:32,880
That was a gift. I don't think I bought that.

1935
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:40,880
Well, to finish reading, I don't really play the game myself, but I did get the Worgen Death Knight with Swift Griffin set because, hey, Worgen with a Griffin.

1936
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:42,880
Keep having a good show, Robert M.

1937
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:54,880
Now, here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards. I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.

1938
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:00,880
Tigerclaw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.

1939
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:06,880
SGA 100 Matt says, the thing is that by law, they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto charge thing, of course.

1940
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:12,880
So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.

1941
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,880
So, yeah.

1942
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:22,880
Next email. And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.

1943
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:24,880
So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping.

1944
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:30,880
Sylvanas figure. Oh, Garris. Garris. I really want the Garris. Garris greater than Sylvanas. Just saying.

1945
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:32,880
Yes, ma'am.

1946
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:34,880
Or a plushie panda. Actually, I have a plushie panda.

1947
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:36,880
Why not all three?

1948
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:40,880
I have a plush panda. No, for real. Okay. I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid.

1949
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,880
I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant. And when I was in fourth grade, my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off.

1950
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:51,880
So that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck.

1951
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:57,880
And I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon.

1952
02:01:58,880 --> 02:01:59,880
True story.

1953
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:01,880
Okay.

1954
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,880
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1955
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,880
Here's my review of Borderlands 2. Awesome for the PC.

1956
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:15,880
My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.

1957
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:20,880
Then I played it on my gaming PC. Blood and ashes. It's incredible.

1958
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:26,880
It's beautiful to look at the art. It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.

1959
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:31,880
The huge levels. The game improves upon the first in every way there is.

1960
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,880
The voice acting is great. The dialogue is genius. The clap and claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.

1961
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:39,880
I highly recommend it.

1962
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:47,880
What system is Loki playing the game on and has he played it on a gaming PC? Your loyal turtle in Philly?

1963
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:51,880
Xbox 360. No I have not because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.

1964
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:53,880
You'll wait until Steam sale anyway, right?

1965
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:57,880
If my laptop doesn't run it then there's no reason for me to buy it.

1966
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,880
No reason but it doesn't mean I won't do it.

1967
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:09,880
Well I mean it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought. It was like 7 bucks for Portland State.

1968
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,880
And that would be something I'd have to buy the game of the year edition. I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.

1969
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,880
Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?

1970
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:21,880
Let's shall.

1971
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:23,880
That was the last email right?

1972
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:24,880
Yes.

1973
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:32,880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week. And you should, dammit. I want to get more emails, dammit.

1974
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:34,880
And you can read them.

1975
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,880
Dammit.

1976
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:38,880
Dammit.

1977
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:40,880
Oh god please don't.

1978
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:42,880
All this is bad.

1979
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:44,880
Here is justice.

1980
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:46,880
Here is punishment.

1981
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:49,880
This is fucked up.

1982
02:03:50,880 --> 02:04:13,880
Um, my FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raichan. Which I actually still need some kind of money for.

1983
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,880
You weren't able to get that. You weren't able to get that and find that.

1984
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:20,880
Gone.

1985
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:28,880
I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key. But I've lost my 18 year old Bats Maru keychain.

1986
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:35,880
The one that I've had. It's metal. Actual metal. I've had it for years. I moved out here with it. It's gone.

1987
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:37,880
Very sad about that.

1988
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,880
But I do have a Hello Kitty house key.

1989
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:41,880
That's black.

1990
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,880
Um.

1991
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:45,880
Yeah, just not please.

1992
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:48,880
FU.

1993
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,880
FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.

1994
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,880
Done.

1995
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,880
Fucking the people that drift into other lanes.

1996
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:05,880
Because it seems like all the time. Like driving here today there's like four or five of them. Like seriously, people pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.

1997
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:09,880
Like texting or just plain stupid.

1998
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,880
Urgh, I'm in another lane now.

1999
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:12,880
I hate it.

2000
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:22,880
My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night but today. And headaches can be very disabling. Especially when you're really busy.

2001
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:27,880
And I wonder if it's not a stress caused headache. FU to the fact that I've had a lot of stress.

2002
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:34,880
I'm just very very very very very very very busy right now. Now granted, don't cry for me Argentina. I'm the one that signed up for all this stuff.

2003
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:42,880
So you know I have no one to blame quote on quote about myself and I know they'll be great rewards but it's just. Oh my god.

2004
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:51,880
So, um, FU to the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland. It had nothing to do with Disneyland or work. It was all here back at home.

2005
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:59,880
Um, nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip.

2006
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:06,880
However, everything happens for a reason. What is the kill that makes us stronger? La la la la la la la la. So whatever.

2007
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:13,880
Why can't everything be perfect 24-7? Damn it. And easy. I like easy. Because I'm lazy.

2008
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:20,880
Yes, also I had nothing to do with VOG. That's important. Thank you Bobby. If it had something to do with VOG you'd know.

2009
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:34,880
Alright, moving on. A few more news stories for you guys and then twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and the skype line. Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Laundry Deal on skype. Loki.

2010
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:43,880
So in part A we talked about how NBA Live 13 got cancelled because the game wasn't very good and they just needed more time.

2011
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:55,880
Well, here's a game the EA released that, and you know we always talk about roster updates and make that kind of joke and stuff, but it literally was a roster update.

2012
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:11,880
FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii. They actually, there was an article that was run on Nintendo Gamer and apparently looking at the game.

2013
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:23,880
And I guess Wayne Rooney, they've replaced him or I guess with one of Lionel Messi as one of the examples of just the simple changes in the game.

2014
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:30,880
Basically the games are identical except for the cover star has been changed. The title is FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.

2015
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:41,880
They've done the roster updates and changed the uniforms and added I guess the clubs that they've updated and stuff in there.

2016
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:50,880
Aside from that, the game is exactly the same. So that's kind of disappointing. I guess they figured that no one would notice.

2017
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,880
I mean, put minimal effort into it.

2018
02:07:55,880 --> 02:08:09,880
Yes, so very interesting. And there was I guess a review on the official Nintendo Magazine UK that they were kind of talking about those as well.

2019
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,880
And it's just funny.

2020
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:20,880
Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual? 60 bucks?

2021
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:32,880
I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think. 50 or 40. But yeah, it's still pretty full. It's not like a $20 game or something like that.

2022
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:44,880
Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year. So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.

2023
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:53,880
It's just decent. It's bad. I mean, it's pretty blatant that they would do that.

2024
02:08:54,880 --> 02:09:01,880
Alright, let's go to this last story here which is about, and this is one of those things where I'm like please stop, don't, no.

2025
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:06,880
This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody. It's going to just kill the industry. Watch.

2026
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:16,880
It's about Ubisoft. Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free to play games for the marketplace. Now that in itself is not a bad thing.

2027
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:26,880
But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions. And yes I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction.

2028
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:29,880
I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron.

2029
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:45,880
On this particular article, yeah. Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free to play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free to play model.

2030
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:52,880
The next generation will offer more and more item based content. This will benefit our game's profitability.

2031
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:02,880
No it won't. When we start rejecting that bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, no.

2032
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:04,880
Do not want.

2033
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:14,880
Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible. It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character, level up a little faster.

2034
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:20,880
And then some of them disguise, hey, here's a mission. We're gonna get some more money for free.

2035
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:25,880
You know, if you find these 10 things, you get all these money, all these different monies.

2036
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:35,880
And so yeah, that's not a good example of DLC. Also EA, very notable for charging for cheats.

2037
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:47,880
One of the, one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer. Like, you know, to basically cheat.

2038
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,880
And I'm sure those things sell like crazy. FIFA and FIFA's got, you know, the whole ultimate thing.

2039
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,880
I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off.

2040
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:08,880
Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the, um, the DLC for, uh, the other stuff.

2041
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:10,880
Don't encourage them.

2042
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:12,880
So I bought like two packs, but anyway.

2043
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:20,880
Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs. So yeah, I don't see a downside for them.

2044
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:26,880
People are going to go, oh, those are terrible. Why are you doing? It's going to ruin the industry. And then people buy them.

2045
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,880
So that's why there's DLC in those games. The free to play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.

2046
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:41,880
I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House. I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount. People pay $25 for a mount.

2047
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:43,880
Never have done that.

2048
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:47,880
That's too much. I know lots of people that have done it. Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.

2049
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:54,880
And hey, you know what? It's your money. Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose. But I just don't, like the price of the expansion was $40.

2050
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:00,880
Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion. I don't get that logic at all.

2051
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:09,880
The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet. No, there were two charity pets and that's it. That's all I bought.

2052
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:19,880
I like that. There's a comment on the story here. Basically they coined the phrase pay to pay. So that's what we're going to call these games. Pay to pay games.

2053
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:29,880
Pay to pay games. I like that. And I think these should be called out. And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.

2054
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:48,880
You know? Saints Row the Third, perfect example of DLC gone wrong. If it's locked in the game, if it's like locked costumes in the game, not additional stuff that they, hey we made this new character class or something like that, that's just, it's bullshit.

2055
02:12:48,880 --> 02:13:01,880
You shouldn't have to pay for that stuff. And yes I understand you don't have to pay for it, but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought, but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want.

2056
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:12,880
And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing. Like all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing. Like really? Really?

2057
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:29,880
I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight. We are going to go to the Skype line. The Skype line is open right now. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We will start taking calls here. Go ahead and give us a call.

2058
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:36,880
You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about. That is just fine as well.

2059
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:50,880
Meanwhile we'll also go to our Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those. And also, Loki you'll probably have some last minute news right?

2060
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,880
Noooo.

2061
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:54,880
You don't have last minute news tonight.

2062
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:57,880
No I don't have any last minute news.

2063
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:04,880
Oh my gosh. Alright well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones. Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2064
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:05,880
Legend of Zaku here.

2065
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:07,880
Hey, what's up?

2066
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,880
Nothing much. Just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed. Trying to get in one call.

2067
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:27,880
But yeah, I just wanted to bring up a little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.

2068
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,880
We did talk about this in part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?

2069
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:50,880
So I don't know, I'm kind of puzzling the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms, and yet he's having a fit with Microsoft again.

2070
02:14:50,880 --> 02:15:02,880
So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back. I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others. They're just the same.

2071
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,880
Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?

2072
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:20,880
Yeah, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different platform.

2073
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:27,880
Hey kettle, this is pot. Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, I'd be great.

2074
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,880
Stop being rude, Rob.

2075
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:32,880
Again, this is pot. That's P-O-T.

2076
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:34,880
It's Zaku.

2077
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:37,880
Did you say black or back?

2078
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,880
Back. The pot calling the kettle back.

2079
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,880
It's the pot calling the kettle black. The phrase.

2080
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,880
The saying is usually the pot calling the kettle black, but that's okay.

2081
02:15:49,880 --> 02:16:13,880
Alright, yeah, it's one L, but you get the idea. It's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.

2082
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:22,880
So, in other words, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of asteroid block complaining about another. That's pretty much what it is.

2083
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:28,880
Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.

2084
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:30,880
What was that?

2085
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:34,880
I said the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that.

2086
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:36,880
Unless you're Google.

2087
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:39,880
You have a different set of rules than Google.

2088
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:47,880
Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps.

2089
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:57,880
Here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either. He contracted or somebody bought the rights to it.

2090
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:04,880
He didn't really do it for the 360. Somebody else did. So is he really supporting the closed platform?

2091
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:09,880
I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand. He's representing the game itself.

2092
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:19,880
The fact that I don't think it's not as relevant, the fact that he contracted, he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform.

2093
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:30,880
But in the end of the day, it's still his game that it just went beyond PC. It went beyond like a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.

2094
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:42,880
Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.

2095
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:57,880
And that's where I see the hypocrisy. You basically greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.

2096
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:02,880
And I don't see where it adds up. I don't.

2097
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:07,880
Alright. Well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2098
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:19,880
Let me see. This just came in to Kotaku today. 38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG, won't be facing federal charges.

2099
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:36,880
So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds, even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.

2100
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:52,880
And it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself.

2101
02:18:53,880 --> 02:19:00,880
From what I'm hearing, Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game.

2102
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:06,880
Don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you, or really to do any professional project for you.

2103
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:26,880
Exactly. That's it. At the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who work their asses off at the studios trying on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.

2104
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:35,880
And none of them have been held accountable in that sense. They walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.

2105
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:40,880
Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?

2106
02:19:41,880 --> 02:20:00,880
People's Court would have been better, but I'm not surprised that there will be lawsuits over this. Curt Schilling, he's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.

2107
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:11,880
One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just going to gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't making payroll.

2108
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:25,880
So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities. So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.

2109
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:32,880
Alright, Zach, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much. Take care. Have a good night. Bye.

2110
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:45,880
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to call. Just missed one. Sometimes people will call and wait and hope to get through. I just missed it. Sorry about that.

2111
02:20:46,880 --> 02:21:00,880
Alright. Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing. You might have pinged out for like, oh man, that pisses me off. I didn't get to see the comments and chat to the call me back comment.

2112
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:05,880
I do see one from Act Deaf that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.

2113
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2114
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,880
What up, guys? It's Zeno from the OKC. How you guys doing?

2115
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:15,880
Geez, Zenocor. Haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?

2116
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:18,880
Well, you know, staying employed. Same old, same old.

2117
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:20,880
That's a good thing. What's on your mind, buddy?

2118
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:23,880
I've been playing a bit of PlanetSide 2, actually.

2119
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:25,880
Ooh, alright. How's that going for you?

2120
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:38,880
Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this. Now, every single base is different, tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game is going to be free on release. So why not?

2121
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:41,880
Wait, this is a totally free game?

2122
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:45,880
Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.

2123
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,880
Oh, of course, of course. That's how things are going.

2124
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:56,880
Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?

2125
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:02,880
Well, you know, Ubisoft's got Ubisoft. I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.

2126
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:11,880
Mm-hmm. I did not realize that PlanetSide was originally 2003, the first one. That's really old.

2127
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:14,880
Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making, the E3 2001 when I went.

2128
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:15,880


2129
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:22,880
And it looked damn good then. You know, just the playability and everything else. And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?

2130
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:23,880


2131
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:29,880
And then here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up. They got at least three years with the development of this one based off what it looks like.

2132
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:33,880
Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?

2133
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:35,880
It's closed beta right now.

2134
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:37,880
Ah, okay, I gotcha.

2135
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:44,880
But you can buy your way in. You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.

2136
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,880
And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.

2137
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:55,880
So what is it that draws you to PlanetSide? Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day. What is it that draws you to this game versus...

2138
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:58,880
Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?

2139
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:04,880
Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly. I played the first PlanetSide, I played Earth and Beyond, I played a whole bunch of them myself.

2140
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:09,880
You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi planet-y space games. Is that a thing?

2141
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:11,880
Well, it's one of my things, yeah.

2142
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:19,880
Okay. Well, no, I think that's cool. I just noticed that little trend going on there. Well, what is it about PlanetSide specifically that draws you to that series?

2143
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:31,880
It's more like a full military exercise than it is just a first-person shooter. It encompasses not just vehicles, armored vehicles, but logistics.

2144
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:39,880
Some strategy, you know, actual rewarding of leadership. If people are actually doing a decent job leading a unit, they get rewarded for it.

2145
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:48,880
Then, you know, I somewhat flash back a bit to my days in the Air Force. I can actually use some of the stuff I learned doing air support.

2146
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:54,880
Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.

2147
02:23:55,880 --> 02:24:03,880
I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide 2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this. I had no idea.

2148
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:17,880
Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal that the sequel's title was PlanetSide Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.

2149
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:21,880
Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?

2150
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:24,880
I think he's depressed.

2151
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:27,880
Hey, wait a minute. I have a live journal. You shut up.

2152
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:35,880
He just recently posted to it, too. August 11th, 2012. That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.

2153
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:38,880
PlanetSide 2, what is it, and why do I want to play it?

2154
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:48,880
PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE. The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.

2155
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:53,880
When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.

2156
02:24:54,880 --> 02:25:01,880
All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles that aren't forced into tiny little arenas like other FPS games.

2157
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:08,880
Each player chooses to play on one of three empires. It takes place in the distant future, and each empire has a unique play style.

2158
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:17,880
Probably the closest comparison would be a game like Starcraft 2, where each of the different races has a very unique play style and feel to it. Interesting.

2159
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:23,880
I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry. It's a very interesting way to put up your press releases.

2160
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,880
Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.

2161
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:29,880
Good to know. Good to know.

2162
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:32,880
Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?

2163
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:45,880
Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC. I'm really loving FTL. That game is freaking amazing.

2164
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:48,880
And Dark Souls, oh my gosh, that game is ruthless.

2165
02:25:48,880 --> 02:26:02,880
I know, as all games should be. This namby-pamby, you know, you leveled twice, so you win. Bullcrap. Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.

2166
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,880
You press the button in time with the music. You win an internet.

2167
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:07,880
Yeah, exactly. Screw that.

2168
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:11,880
Alright, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2169
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:13,880
Nah, that's pretty much it. Y'all have a good show.

2170
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:15,880
You too, buddy. Take care. Don't be a stranger.

2171
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:17,880
Alright, later.

2172
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:22,880
Well, let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

2173
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:23,880


2174
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,880
Hey, Shane. How you doing?

2175
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:26,880


2176
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,880
Did you have fun on the live Hoard House this week?

2177
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:31,880
No, I was too distracted playing WoW.

2178
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,880
Aww. How's WoW going for you?

2179
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:45,880
I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90, so I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else, ever.

2180
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:47,880
What level is your main pet?

2181
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:55,880
I keep rotating all of them out. I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now and I've got like almost 100 pets.

2182
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:59,880
What is the name? Oh my. You've leveled all of your pets to 5?

2183
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,880
I'm starting to. I've got maybe about 10 of them done.

2184
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:05,880
What do you name your pets? Do you custom name all your pets?

2185
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,880
No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.

2186
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:13,880
I've named mine after Mass Effect characters. Mine are better.

2187
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:17,880
No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?

2188
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:19,880
It doesn't make sense.

2189
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,880
I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.

2190
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,880
You named your dog Helo?

2191
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:27,880
Yes, but that's adorable.

2192
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:34,880
Rob, did I tell you? I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character.

2193
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:36,880
Which one? I had a few.

2194
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:38,880
Cuddles.

2195
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:40,880
I named my hyjal cub Cuddles.

2196
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:44,880
What was Shane's? Shane had a cute character name too. It was like...

2197
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:46,880
Fluffles.

2198
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:47,880
Fluffles. That was it.

2199
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:49,880
Well, maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.

2200
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:52,880
Alright, there you go. Shane, would that be happy for you?

2201
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:54,880
That'd be okay.

2202
02:27:55,880 --> 02:27:57,880
Shane, what did you call in to talk about tonight?

2203
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:02,880
I picked up, because it was free, DJ Max Ray on iOS and it's amazing.

2204
02:28:03,880 --> 02:28:04,880
Apps are freaking lutely amazing.

2205
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:09,880
Dark Sakura immediately picked up her iPad and started going into the app store.

2206
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,880
You should have seen that. The minute those words left your mouth, she's like,

2207
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,880
shit, picked up her iPad.

2208
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:16,880
Stop judging me.

2209
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:18,880
What was that?

2210
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:20,880
I told Rob to stop judging me.

2211
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:24,880
I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.

2212
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:26,880
I had a headache.

2213
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:29,880
That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.

2214
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:31,880
I've been leveling my character.

2215
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:34,880
It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.

2216
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:36,880
I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?

2217
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,880
Is it D Space? Whatever.

2218
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:45,880
I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not, but it was like number six on the list of things that found.

2219
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:47,880
It didn't make any sense to me.

2220
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:51,880
Like it picked up Rerave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.

2221
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:53,880
Rerave's not bad.

2222
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:57,880
No, it's not. I'm not saying it is, but DJ Max is better.

2223
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:01,880
Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.

2224
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:08,880
Yeah, I think it just stretches, but it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad, but it's just so freaking good.

2225
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:15,880
Like I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it, and I can't quit playing that as well.

2226
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,880
So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now too.

2227
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,880
I don't want to get yelled at again.

2228
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:22,880
I am not buying this game.

2229
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:26,880
Good job. Don't buy it. Don't give in to him. He's a jerk.

2230
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:37,880
It's free unless you want the song packs, and you can get a pretty good deal, like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out, and then you get some extra note skin.

2231
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:40,880
What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?

2232
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:43,880
I don't know. It sounds stupid. Get DJ Max.

2233
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:46,880
With the little anime chick, she commands me.

2234
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:49,880
The anime chick wants a dollar. Don't buy it, Rob. Don't give in to the...

2235
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:53,880
I don't see DJ Max. I seriously don't. Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps. Hello.

2236
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:58,880
I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?

2237
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:00,880
Yeah.

2238
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:03,880
I don't listen to her. How many years has it been?

2239
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:05,880
Rob?

2240
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,880
Okay, I got it. DJ Max Ray, right?

2241
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:09,880
Yeah.

2242
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:11,880
Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?

2243
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,880
Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?

2244
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:16,880
Yes, and I agree three times.

2245
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:18,880
The rules have changed.

2246
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:20,880
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.

2247
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:33,880
Make sure to create an account too. It takes like two seconds. You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise, and that really sucks if you do that.

2248
02:30:33,880 --> 02:30:35,880
I'll have to download it later.

2249
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,880
I don't understand. I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says...

2250
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:39,880
It's doing the same thing to me.

2251
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:41,880
...the terms and conditions have changed. I haven't heard that that's happened.

2252
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:43,880
The conditions have changed!

2253
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:49,880
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.

2254
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:53,880
There is some kind of dumb over there right now.

2255
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:55,880
Shut up, Rob.

2256
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:57,880
Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.

2257
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:00,880
You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.

2258
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:05,880
By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.

2259
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:07,880
Oh yeah, the Jane Shepherd.

2260
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:10,880
Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.

2261
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:12,880
I was actually a little surprised too.

2262
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:18,880
I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.

2263
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:23,880
Call it Shepherd Commander.

2264
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:27,880
Oh, Alan is yelling from the other room. That is actually a thing.

2265
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:31,880
It won't let me download it because I can't get past that stupid pop-up box.

2266
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:33,880
That's what it did to me. I'm going to try it on my phone.

2267
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:35,880
Do you have fingers? Because usually that's all it takes.

2268
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:40,880
You have sold me on the Wonders of the Eye awesome platform.

2269
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,880
I am a believer now.

2270
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,880
Wow, I can't find the title that I'm looking for.

2271
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:51,880
Oh, and I have to agree to these change conditions.

2272
02:31:51,880 --> 02:31:53,880
And I can't shut down my iPad.

2273
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:58,880
Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.

2274
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:02,880
Shut up. No one asked you.

2275
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:05,880
I'm actually trying it on my phone.

2276
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:10,880
Ray Deer in our chat room says it's Tap Sonic but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.

2277
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:19,880
That's exactly right. And it's got, well I mean it's all real DJ Maxx music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.

2278
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,880
Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?

2279
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,880
No, it's freaking DJ Maxx.

2280
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:29,880
Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.

2281
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:33,880
So I think it's that app.

2282
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:35,880
Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.

2283
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:39,880
It's fine. Alright, what else did you want to talk about tonight?

2284
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:45,880
I was mostly going to talk about DJ Maxx and then some stupidity happened and so...

2285
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:48,880
Well, was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Maxx?

2286
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:50,880
That you didn't get out there?

2287
02:32:51,880 --> 02:33:01,880
Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts.

2288
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:09,880
And then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability.

2289
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:16,880
And then there are, I want to say, five more packs of songs that you can get.

2290
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:21,880
So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.

2291
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:24,880
So it's really, really good and everybody should get it that can.

2292
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:30,880
Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.

2293
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:38,880
Alright, sounds good and I'm still pet battling and Pokemon is this week and I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.

2294
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:42,880
Well, you're just going to be the happiest person ever. It's like Christmas for you.

2295
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:44,880
I know, this week is great.

2296
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:46,880
Well, congratulations.

2297
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:49,880
Now all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.

2298
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,880
I wish I was having a good week. Alright, well Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.

2299
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:55,880
Alright, go end it. Bye.

2300
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:59,880
Alright, let me, oh, I've got to go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.

2301
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:04,880
Thanks to all those that called in tonight. If you didn't get through, tough. Try again next week.

2302
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:08,880
Or send us an email with your thoughts. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2303
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:14,880
Orange Riot wanted to point out in the chat room about DJ Max, it's key sounded and that is pretty important as well.

2304
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:19,880
It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music like some other apps that are out there.

2305
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:24,880
It actually does have the key sounds in it. That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.

2306
02:34:25,880 --> 02:34:28,880
It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.

2307
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:34,880
Tigerclaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight and he sent us some tweets about this one.

2308
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:39,880
First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.

2309
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:46,880
I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out? I don't know.

2310
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:52,880
There are quite a few, two this year. I think two, is there two last year?

2311
02:34:53,880 --> 02:34:59,880
Lego Harry Potter 2 last year and Lego Star Wars last year. Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.

2312
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:04,880
Lego Lord of the Rings is this year. Actually three if you include that Lego City Stories.

2313
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:10,880
Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.

2314
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:12,880
And they already have Lego Batman 2.

2315
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:17,880
Let's see, Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.

2316
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:24,880
Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute strategic and competitive point of view.

2317
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:27,880
And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.

2318
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:32,880
There's always something new, there's always something different, we're always looking to add different layers.

2319
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:38,880
Whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which will have the luxury of having over the next few years.

2320
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:42,880
So it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance.

2321
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:45,880
Of fruits and vegetables.

2322
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:50,880
Alright, let me see, I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here.

2323
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:56,880
And it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games.

2324
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:02,880
And the quote he pulled there is, you run the company like you're in danger of starving.

2325
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:07,880
I guess this has to do with kind of the high stress nature of running a game company.

2326
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:17,880
Let's see, this was a quote in Edge Online in the magazine E246.

2327
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:25,880
Quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.

2328
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:30,880
I mean you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.

2329
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:37,880
They're saying when Platinum Games started in 2006 it had 50 staff, six years it had 200 if you counted the contractors.

2330
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:39,880
Wow.

2331
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:44,880
The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer Capcom.

2332
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:51,880
The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.

2333
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:55,880
But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.

2334
02:36:55,880 --> 02:37:00,880
Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4, just an enormous amount of people.

2335
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:02,880
Didn't help them, did it?

2336
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:04,880
Oh snap.

2337
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:12,880
Again that comment from an article on EdgeOnline.com sent to us via Twitter by TigerClaw.

2338
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:15,880
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2339
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:21,880
Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?

2340
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,880
Uh, no I didn't see anything that stood out.

2341
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:28,880
Not much has been going on this week.

2342
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:31,880
Left 4 Dead sells 12 million. Cool.

2343
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:34,880
Alright, well that tangs us to the end of the show.

2344
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:38,880
A little bit shorter of a show tonight, but hey sometimes you have busy news weeks, sometimes you don't.

2345
02:37:39,880 --> 02:37:42,880
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we close out Shop for Tonight.

2346
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:45,880
Dark Sakura, thank you for being here as always.

2347
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,880
I have a choice and I choose O-L-R.

2348
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:49,880
I choose O-L-R.

2349
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,880
But not next week. Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over O-L-R.

2350
02:37:53,880 --> 02:37:54,880
Yes, I choose the gay.

2351
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,880
And I'm not going this year. It's kind of sad.

2352
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:58,880
I choose a lot of gay.

2353
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:00,880
Send me pictures.

2354
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:02,880
The Sea of Red.

2355
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:04,880
Have fun. Your final thought tonight?

2356
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:06,880
I'm actually going to wear my O-L-R shirt.

2357
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:08,880
Oh wait, that's right you didn't get the vog one this time.

2358
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:13,880
I have my red and black O-L-R shirt that Kristen and I had way back when.

2359
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:14,880
Very cool.

2360
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:19,880
Because I have hit my first goal. I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.

2361
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:21,880
Congrats.

2362
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:23,880
So my message is actually very important.

2363
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:25,880
Span, neuter your cats.

2364
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:27,880
Thank you Bob Barker.

2365
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,880
Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?

2366
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:34,880
I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.

2367
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:36,880
Poor soul. It's a great show.

2368
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,880
I did back in the 80s.

2369
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:40,880
I didn't remember because I didn't care.

2370
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:46,880
But seriously, rescue a cat. Everyone go out and rescue a cat.

2371
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:48,880
Unless you're allergic to cats.

2372
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:50,880
Then take some Benadryl.

2373
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:52,880
Rescue a dog.

2374
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:54,880
Alright, Loki your final thought?

2375
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:56,880
I never rescued enough cats.

2376
02:38:57,880 --> 02:38:58,880
I had 11 at one time.

2377
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:00,880
That's a lot of cats.

2378
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:02,880
Then I didn't feed them and then they went away. At least I think they did.

2379
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:04,880
I think they're waiting in the shadows.

2380
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:06,880
Waiting to hunt me down.

2381
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:11,880
My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December.

2382
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,880
Because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.

2383
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:16,880
I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.

2384
02:39:17,880 --> 02:39:18,880
We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.

2385
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:20,880
It's really good. I just had Pinkberry last night.

2386
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:22,880
I don't care. Let's go get some.

2387
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:25,880
Alright, that's it. That does it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio tonight.

2388
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:27,880
Thank you guys as always for supporting independent radio.

2389
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:30,880
Hey, if you liked Orange Lawns Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show.

2390
02:39:31,880 --> 02:39:33,880
Word of mouth is all we have to promote ourselves.

2391
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:35,880
We'll be back next week with more of Orange Lawns Radio.

2392
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:38,880
Ooh, I believe podcast award nominations open up this week.

2393
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:41,880
So, for your consideration.

2394
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,880
Alright, there you go.

2395
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:45,880
That's it. Have a great week everybody.

2396
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:47,880
We'll see you next week. Same bat time, same bat channel.

2397
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:49,880
Without Dark Sakura.

2398
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:51,880
But another super villain will be taking her place.

2399
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:53,880
We'll see you next week.

2400
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,880
