1
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:21,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, September 30th, 2012, EA cancels a major sports title, DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros.

2
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,892
[SPEAKER_01]: 2, and can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?

3
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:32,305
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

4
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:58,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

5
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,386
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Jamie?

6
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm caffeinated, thank you.

7
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:02,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You had two cups of coffee.

9
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:05,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

10
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Coffee!

11
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made a new rule, by the way.

12
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,081
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your thing against sports ball?

14
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people like sports ball.

15
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring!

16
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:20,286
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.

17
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:20,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring!

18
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I like rugby and I like real football.

19
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,668
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a comment that Actdeft made this week.

20
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:34,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG Network post, but he said, yes, I am a hater and I am hating.

21
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:36,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's you right now.

22
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:37,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

23
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.

24
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:41,977
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

25
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

26
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:44,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

27
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,019
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, Loki?

28
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:45,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing good.

29
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:46,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

30
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: What's new with you?

31
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:49,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft.

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?

33
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I played no Minecraft.

34
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Borderlands 2.

35
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:57,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

36
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:00,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is, sadly, the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

37
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:02,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

38
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:06,307
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife's been occupying TV, so I've been occupying Minecraft.

39
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not a problem.

40
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.

41
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:09,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

42
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,809
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually people on now.

43
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I see people when I go on there.

44
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:14,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice, nice.

45
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear they've been defacing my house.

46
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,811
[SPEAKER_08]: My little... Or my shack, should I say.

47
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,331
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't been defacing it.

48
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:20,492
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been...

49
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Applying temporary tenants.

50
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

51
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:31,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you fill my house with creepers?

52
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:32,360
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be destructive.

54
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

55
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:40,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.

56
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

57
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:43,568
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do I want to say?

58
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:46,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this poster came, right?

59
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:46,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

60
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:48,952
[SPEAKER_08]: This was from that guy who called in last week, right?

61
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:49,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

62
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:50,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was.

63
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:50,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I see it?

64
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:51,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I open this?

65
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:51,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.

66
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,176
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob, you're physically incapable.

67
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:57,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.

68
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.

69
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:04,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stuck in there.

70
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Open the other side.

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,660
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still awesome.

73
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.

74
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

75
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:11,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

76
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I call it Disco Panda.

77
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:22,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.

78
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mists of Pandaria.

79
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was Disco Pandas.

80
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:33,459
[SPEAKER_08]: That poster's rad, by the way.

81
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?

82
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:36,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

83
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Our little picture feed.

84
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,863
[SPEAKER_08]: What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

85
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:45,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that in a minute when we get into Gaming Weeks, so just give me a little bit of time.

86
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:46,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

87
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get into Gaming Weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic, as we usually do.

88
00:03:50,909 --> 00:04:12,257
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral and it wasn't really intentional for that to happen but apparently a lot of media companies for whatever reason aren't really covering this because it has to do with the indie community and I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community but this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.

89
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:19,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Now remember when XNA Games first came out I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA and

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,641
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's been some good and there's been some not good.

91
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:28,524
[SPEAKER_08]: In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.

92
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:34,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we're a little partial to YYR and some of his efforts like bungee ferret tossing and so forth.

93
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:42,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a game with zombies in it.

95
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.

96
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,672
[SPEAKER_08]: The Breath of Death and all that started on XMA, right?

97
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was pretty good.

98
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:56,914
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.

99
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and then there's the bad.

100
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:04,816
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.

101
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:06,277
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

102
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:29,464
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

103
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the deal.

104
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what's going on.

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,801
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com.

106
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Very well done from Bobby.

107
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,222
[SPEAKER_08]: He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.

108
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So he spent some time shedding a little light on it for people.

109
00:05:57,163 --> 00:06:01,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.

110
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:07,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.

111
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:11,789
[SPEAKER_08]: They used to be able to generate 50 review codes and it's broken.

112
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,492
[SPEAKER_08]: No press release saying they took it away.

113
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:21,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.

114
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.

115
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:24,902
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Bungie, Ferret tossing, what's this?

117
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and then they check it out and that's how YYR can make sales on his game but now a lot of that is stifled because Microsoft has this bug on the site.

118
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,765
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just affecting him.

119
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,906
[SPEAKER_08]: These big indie games

120
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:20,082
[SPEAKER_08]: or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing, which is the indie answer to Microsoft's Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree or whatever the hell they call those things, which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.

121
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:23,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when Microsoft said, oh, yeah, we're going to promote XNA games?

122
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice.

123
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:26,688
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:55,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chatroom, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be Says, not just for review, but for giveaways Ever wonder why VOG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferret Tossing?

125
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:07,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect example, we can't give it to you for free Although, seriously guys, it's one fucking dollar And it is a really fun game, so You probably have the points left over in your wallet

126
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:34,570
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, and SH100Matt says You would think they want to get this fixed It's promoting games that they profit off of And that's the weird thing It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this But, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games Or selling it Well then do something about it Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games Oh, is there too much crap indie games That's bogging down the system So people don't want to go find the stellar indie games Fix it!

127
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:39,106
[SPEAKER_08]: This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console.

128
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.

129
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a little sad if that was the case.

130
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe it's... I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and of course they don't want people developing apps for it.

131
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow.

132
00:08:54,116 --> 00:09:00,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?

133
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:05,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam.

134
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,365
[SPEAKER_07]: One more sales there.

135
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:14,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a bummer that it had such potential.

136
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:25,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It had such potential to be so awesome, to let people kind of control what was going on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side, and it's just kind of gone.

137
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:30,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Breakman in our chat says, there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games.

138
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:31,599
[SPEAKER_08]: There are.

139
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:31,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

140
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,736
[SPEAKER_08]: What's what went wrong with this?

141
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this not doing better?

142
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:38,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any thoughts?

143
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they haven't done anything with it.

144
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,760
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't really they haven't promoted it.

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,042
[SPEAKER_07]: They hit it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.

146
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:54,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out.

147
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: They did.

148
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:01,627
[SPEAKER_08]: SJ100 Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.

149
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:05,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but like YYR, he's been doing bungee ferret tossing for two years.

150
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:11,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And two years ago, XNA looked a lot better than maybe it does now.

151
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.

152
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always thought though, and I could be wrong.

153
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:17,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not a developer.

154
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:18,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not made games.

155
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:22,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff online.

156
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:26,420
[SPEAKER_08]: from XNA on Xbox to PC.

157
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?

158
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

159
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:37,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that it's probably pretty easy to port it over.

160
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:41,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC.

161
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:57,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the Gibb tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.

162
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So the programming there is pretty much the same.

163
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to love editing files.

164
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Civilization 1 on the PC.

165
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,113
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of the scripting ran off text files.

166
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:18,880
[SPEAKER_08]: There were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were within the boundaries, you could get the Queen of England to, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.

167
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:21,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to declare war on your ass.

168
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,963
[SPEAKER_08]: You could change things.

169
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:26,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And to a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious.

170
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.

171
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

172
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:49,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to more comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com because, of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.

173
00:11:50,266 --> 00:12:16,856
[SPEAKER_08]: there's articles there too there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life but there will be more very soon meanwhile Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort let's see WhatUpG says by that I mean the big budget games the ones that seem to get more press etc Microsoft is more about the AAA games is the comment that preceded that so maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games I don't know

174
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,296
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

175
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: and PlayPandas.

176
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:52,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made Rob over 10,000 gold selling gems in less than a week.

177
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:56,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion.

178
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:00,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been slow, slow, slow.

179
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:06,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level, which is fine.

180
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:07,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

181
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have other things going on.

182
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:16,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it was a lot of pandas.

183
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,193
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pandemonium.

184
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:22,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.

185
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,002
[SPEAKER_08]: and Garrus.

186
00:13:48,121 --> 00:14:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit, which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly.

187
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:09,193
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City and just hands out Justice stuff?

188
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.

189
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:16,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

190
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:17,817
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid.

191
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,798
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to take a little time.

192
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:26,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I can see why they did that because they said there's not enough to do at 90.

193
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do.

194
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:39,965
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.

195
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90.

196
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had too much going on in my personal life.

197
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't sit there and just grind to 90.

198
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:47,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just 88.

199
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

200
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shane's already got a 90.

201
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, most of my rating guild already has 90s.

202
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us have lives.

203
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:02,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like to say it that way because I know Shane has a life.

204
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:03,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what I mean?

205
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have other stuff going on that isn't Oh My God Pandas.

206
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us have Mass Effect to play.

207
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.

208
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:16,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog.

209
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a corgi bull.

210
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,040
[SPEAKER_08]: You're silly.

211
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,401
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

212
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:26,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk about... And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.

213
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my evening week.

214
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But Loki, go ahead.

215
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:55,123
[SPEAKER_07]: so I played Borderlands 2 last week well kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show so I've been playing that and leveling up you know my assassin and games pretty fun I'm digging it wish I could play it a little bit more I want to play a bit more this week take a little break from Minecraft since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week

216
00:15:56,224 --> 00:16:21,645
[SPEAKER_07]: of course we switched the server over to creative so it's been fun everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things I finished I haven't really finished my castle but I'm taking a break from it I think it's pretty much done I've got like all the grounds done I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens and I built a underground blacksmithing thing and

217
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Farmer Loki had a farm E-I-E-I-O

218
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:53,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, My Gaming Week.

219
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.

220
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:02,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, when I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year.

221
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:10,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's at least the goal, is to do Disney Detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.

222
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:15,064
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.

223
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:16,164
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway...

224
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:38,127
[SPEAKER_08]: as far as video games I have been playing I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time I love the music I love the scenery I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast there's so much to do

225
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:42,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.

226
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:51,409
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit is I don't like that they made it not possible, really.

227
00:17:51,509 --> 00:18:05,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can, but they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it, but they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that, so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore, which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it, but...

228
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Horde House www.hordehouse.com

229
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:26,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Another game that I checked out this week, though, for a little bit.

230
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:33,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I only played this in between the time that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.

231
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is Torchlight 2.

232
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Torchlight 2 is released, and it is available on Steam.

233
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:50,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam and probably other places, too, that I'm not thinking of.

234
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I just own it on both places.

235
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically Diablo 2.

236
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Torchlight 2 is out Torchlight 2 is out

237
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:12,611
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

238
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:33,189
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:57,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up.

240
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:01,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet.

241
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:05,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can also be in the same room and do internet that way.

242
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,090
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the LAN is in there.

243
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,633
[SPEAKER_08]: None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.

244
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a great word.

245
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:13,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuckery.

246
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word, too.

247
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,040
[SPEAKER_08]: That was total fuckery.

248
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And this had very little fuckery.

249
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:28,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day, but it didn't really ruin the experience.

250
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,530
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good time.

251
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says, Internet multiplayer?

252
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:35,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

253
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:36,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the first game didn't have it.

254
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,456
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

255
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:44,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's see, and Ray Deer in our chatroom says, I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now.

256
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.

257
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:52,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.

258
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:53,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

259
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:59,256
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.

260
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:04,740
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going up and down a little bit, so I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off so that way we don't hiccup.

261
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.

262
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:10,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.

263
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:11,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I closed Dropbox, right?

264
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes big files come in through there.

265
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:14,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's closed.

266
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:16,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on.

267
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.

268
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Torchlight 2 and Pandaria.

269
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:24,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And Disney games.

270
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, DarkSakura?

271
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:32,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Because in chat, Breakman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland.

272
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,399
[SPEAKER_08]: In my country, we have a word for you.

273
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Liar.

274
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.

275
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, Rob?

276
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:44,134
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

277
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:44,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I have faith in you.

278
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:51,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.

279
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.

280
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:56,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

281
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:27,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh boo hoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here Oh stop, alright Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio We'll get to the Fugle question of the week a little later But before we get to that, some news Loki starting us off with the gaming news this week

282
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:42,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so this is a little shocking, not entirely shocking I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA and this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday?

283
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so, yeah, on the 27th.

284
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:46,799
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

285
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.

286
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:16,250
[SPEAKER_07]: They took a break last year and then this year they're going to try launching again with NBA Live 13.

287
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:21,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, they just canceled it before it even got a chance to get sent out and this was...

288
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website, their Executive Vice President Andrew Wilson just wrote, Hey, it's canceled and here's why.

289
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:39,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.

290
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:41,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

291
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

292
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:57,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting, but I think at this point, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game, and from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying, hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.

293
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

294
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if they were able to catch up with their market share.

295
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:25,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally a new NBA game?

296
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,611
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.

297
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:31,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I did like it though because...

298
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.

299
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:45,353
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the first comments I read on the esports.com site was like, I'm going to kill your family.

300
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to kill all the employees.

301
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:50,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA life.

302
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Call the po-po on that.

303
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:56,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do people feel like they can just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?

304
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:58,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about to go down a much bigger path.

305
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:08,342
[SPEAKER_08]: on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get, or, well, there's Facebook too, but I hate the anonymity that the internet gives us sometimes.

306
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:08,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, really?

307
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:11,763
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game?

308
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:12,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

309
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:12,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

310
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:13,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

311
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:15,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.

312
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:17,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we just set them all on fire?

313
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,687
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you being any better by saying that?

314
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:25,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Calm down, woman.

315
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I said it very calmly.

316
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I don't know.

317
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:36,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.

318
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,900
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just like, eh, not surprised.

319
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I'm not surprised either.

320
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:44,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet.

321
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game was scheduled for October.

322
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of thought that you would have a little something.

323
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, not a big shocker.

324
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

325
00:25:57,213 --> 00:26:00,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?

326
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:12,894
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision, because if the game was gonna suck, or was just gonna be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then...

327
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Good on them for making the right decision.

328
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:22,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's a story later about maybe a not so great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.

329
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I found that comment finally.

330
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:24,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny.

331
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,225
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to be fucking kidding me.

332
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:27,746
[SPEAKER_07]: We stuck our neck out for you.

333
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been fans of you guys for years, getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.

334
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:38,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear, if there's no game that... Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.

335
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,998
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no game that released this year.

336
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:45,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm killing every employee and EA slash NBA live building dude.

337
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so heartbroken, literally.

338
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.

339
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe we're stuck playing...

340
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:59,958
[SPEAKER_07]: with only one game after you guys had three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.

341
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,724
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.

342
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:13,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid wrote that comment.

343
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:16,534
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just think it's funny that people think that...

344
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:20,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to play a new NBA game.

345
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, oh shit, it's not like choosing a president or something like that.

346
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,239
[SPEAKER_07]: A choice needs to be made.

347
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:32,041
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know you can play that same NBA game that you have.

348
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:36,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.

349
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:41,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?

350
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:44,877
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be fun.

351
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.

352
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.

353
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,367
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually got a copy of that.

354
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,048
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't get a copy of it.

355
00:27:59,068 --> 00:27:59,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

356
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:02,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my boss had one in his office.

357
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Baller Beats!

358
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:03,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And I laughed at it.

359
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.

360
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:05,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll play it.

361
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,674
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're not.

362
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:12,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I guess this one.

363
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I wanted to ask about the 2K game.

364
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?

365
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:19,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?

366
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Jay-Z.

367
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was just talking... I'm looking forward to that.

368
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:25,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hold on.

369
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.

370
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,951
[SPEAKER_08]: About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.

371
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:34,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.

372
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:58,307
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know say what you will about her music and so forth but I mean that woman is a well-oiled pop machine she's putting out so many albums she puts out an album a year and all these music videos wins all these Grammys has all these catchy songs written for her you know whether it might be your cup of tea or not you can't ignore that she writes some really or she doesn't write probably but she has some really good pop music that she puts out and

373
00:28:58,827 --> 00:29:24,737
[SPEAKER_08]: and yet again she's got like another new album coming out this year it's crazy like jay-z is working her and she's a extraordinarily famous woman hey if jay-z work your best hoe if shut up if jay-z can make 2k basketball like if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music i actually think it could be a really good he's not doing shit all he's doing is picking up the soundtrack

374
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:28,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, fucking awesome.

375
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, whatever.

376
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's cool.

377
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:40,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.

378
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's it.

379
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:47,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.

380
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:53,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out and it was like, eh, not so exciting.

381
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:57,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does the chat room think I said pot music?

382
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I said pop music.

383
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Pot music would be like... Foghat.

384
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,493
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews band.

385
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,435
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pot music.

386
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:07,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Foghat.

387
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,128
[SPEAKER_08]: and maybe a little bit Journey too.

388
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:16,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once and damn, I think I got a contact high.

389
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:17,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, back to games.

390
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:25,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way because you know Motorola, although it is really Google, they...

391
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:33,611
[SPEAKER_08]: They got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s among some other Microsoft devices.

392
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:37,434
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.

393
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,355
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually owned by Motorola.

394
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:42,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It's licensed for use in MS devices.

395
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:45,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's the interesting thing.

396
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:47,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been ruled in the U.S.

397
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.

398
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, why would the U.S.

399
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,265
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?

400
00:30:55,665 --> 00:31:01,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the U.S.

401
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:05,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the U.S.

402
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:05,792
[SPEAKER_08]: law.

403
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And the court's ruling says, quote,

404
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:32,369
[SPEAKER_08]: so if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here you're okay so like if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three year warranty you're okay, you can still get one phew well technically they wouldn't be selling it they would just be shipping a replacement

405
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.

406
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:39,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know that's what happens to people now.

407
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to be that they'd Red Ring after a week, and that's just part of growing up.

408
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they don't Red Ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of it.

409
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:49,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say that was just part of growing up?

410
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:50,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

411
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:55,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Because every Xbox... You take the good, you take the bad.

412
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:59,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you take the good, you take the bad, and you take them both, and there you have a 360... A 360...

413
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:11,445
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the Robot Chicken thing where they did... Never mind.

414
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:12,365
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

415
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:13,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

416
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:15,646
[SPEAKER_07]: One chick's on Survivor.

417
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:17,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

418
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:17,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Tootie?

419
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:17,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Blair.

420
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:18,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

421
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:19,167
[SPEAKER_07]: On Survivor.

422
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:23,988
[SPEAKER_07]: They are really, really stretching for celebrities.

423
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,748
[SPEAKER_05]: You and your reality shows, Rob.

424
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:26,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

425
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,068
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

426
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a whore for trash reality shows.

427
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a problem.

428
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:31,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a commercial for the next Xbox.

429
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:34,627
[SPEAKER_06]: The 720?

430
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:34,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The 720?

431
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.

432
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:52,022
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

433
00:32:52,383 --> 00:32:54,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.

434
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:56,586
[SPEAKER_05]: What was her name?

435
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remember she was Tootie.

436
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this name in the chat room that I'm probably going to horribly mispronounce, but it's Entitle-itis.

437
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:06,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Inflammation of the entitlement.

438
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:10,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Entitle-itis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.

439
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:11,218
[SPEAKER_08]: You never forget.

440
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the red ring come after the blowjob?

441
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,380
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

442
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:17,310
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a whole other problem.

443
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,672
[SPEAKER_05]: That means you need to go see a doctor.

444
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:20,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Kim Fields.

445
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:21,535
[SPEAKER_05]: That was her.

446
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:22,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ranma.

447
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew Ranma would remember.

448
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:24,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

449
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:25,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

450
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,200
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

451
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:37,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a big Horkin interview about the PlayStation 3 and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.

452
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:43,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.

453
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:50,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.

454
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Not visual, the casual... Casual visual...

455
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:55,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It rhymes.

456
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give me that look.

457
00:33:58,674 --> 00:34:08,901
[SPEAKER_05]: More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do with games things that are a little bit more reflective of that, and that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.

458
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:14,625
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as how well the Vita's doing, they said they're not going to reduce the price this year.

459
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:23,030
[SPEAKER_05]: That is probably going to be sometime next year, so it's not a matter of if it's when, but definitely not this year.

460
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:45,381
[SPEAKER_07]: and this so really it's just more of what we knew I think it's just I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses that you don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fucking TV and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to you know

461
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:47,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Have their friends see it.

462
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:58,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week for like $199 or something.

463
00:34:58,647 --> 00:34:58,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

464
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I was like, kind of want.

465
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:01,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they teeny?

466
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:07,610
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.

467
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that didn't do too well, did it?

468
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:14,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, who's going to buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price?

469
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:15,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

470
00:35:16,112 --> 00:35:16,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Which it may have.

471
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:17,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I should check back.

472
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's been down that.

473
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK, there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now and then a 12 gigabyte version that's going to be out on October 12th.

474
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:32,396
[SPEAKER_05]: But that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.

475
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the shops that are setting the price.

476
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:36,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Rage Racer

477
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:17,323
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know, re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?

478
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:36,778
[SPEAKER_07]: same damn tracks oh does that not fit into your plan of you know releasing one track with you know half a car and you have to buy the rest later so just throwing this out there it's still on sale on Best Buy site $179.99 for the TV, Motorstorm, Apocalypse and glasses and a little cable give it more time

479
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,780
[SPEAKER_07]: You think you can get even lower.

480
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Friday's right around the corner.

481
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:42,203
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

482
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:43,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't remind me.

483
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:46,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.

484
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I'm not working retail.

485
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:49,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

486
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:51,952
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on, Loki.

487
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,761
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

488
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:57,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV... No, actually, I'm not.

489
00:36:58,805 --> 00:36:59,686
[SPEAKER_07]: They were kind of cool, though.

490
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to play on those a few times.

491
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:16,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have this new Xbox Live reward thing where they're allowing people with high gamer scores to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.

492
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:25,733
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a whopping, I know you're getting excited here, it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.

493
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:26,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, 2%.

494
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:26,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

495
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:26,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

496
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:34,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting excited already.

497
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:48,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, also, apparently, if you have a gamer score of over 3,000, you get a special gift during your birthday month, which, in the fine print, says is only worth 25 cents.

498
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a quarter.

499
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Call somebody who cares.

500
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:59,825
[SPEAKER_08]: What about... It's probably going to be some stinking avatar item like a birthday cake.

501
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

502
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:01,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously.

503
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:03,247
[SPEAKER_07]: 1% back?

504
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:03,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

505
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:13,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So you buy $100 worth of fucking Microsoft Point stuff on the Xbox Live Marketplace and you get a dollar.

506
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,256
[SPEAKER_07]: That is fucking stupid.

507
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:39,979
[SPEAKER_07]: the 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom it's a fucking birthday hat I guarantee you it's a birthday hat that is it for your avatar so that everyone can go hey look he has a birthday hat on cool I want them to send me a quarter I want them to mail it to me

508
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,620
[SPEAKER_08]: If it has a value you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.

509
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So how is it that they can assign a value to that?

510
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter.

511
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:57,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I always thought it was akin to like... Have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?

512
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.

513
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:03,585
[SPEAKER_08]: They're always like one one-hundredth of a cent or one-tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.

514
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:09,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's the actual cash value of a 40-point item in the marketplace or something.

515
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:10,607
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be 25 cents.

516
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just stupid.

517
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:14,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

518
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the money back, I guess.

519
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:22,237
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.

520
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:27,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who this Entitle-itis is, but I like the comments from this individual tonight.

521
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have 7,000 points.

522
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:30,405
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I get?

523
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:32,067
[SPEAKER_08]: A coupon from Arby's?

524
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:37,979
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

525
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:42,421
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea is to get you to be loyal, not to scare you off.

526
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:46,682
[SPEAKER_08]: A lifetime supply of horsey sauce.

527
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:50,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to spend $100 on DLC in a month?

528
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:57,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game that comes out and a whole bunch of DLC.

529
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:03,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those people are going to have to be really sipping the Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.

530
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:06,649
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.

531
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:12,273
[SPEAKER_08]: because, you know, that's the new thing now is free-to-play mechanisms.

532
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers.

533
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,334
[SPEAKER_07]: You get some money back.

534
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:18,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so bad.

535
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:24,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I got all this money stolen from me, but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back.

536
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:25,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet!

537
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,740
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so bad anymore.

538
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And a birthday hat.

539
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:33,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah!

540
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:40,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the hat's a fucking sign that says, Sucker, you spent all this money.

541
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:43,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You're an idiot.

542
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

543
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:49,598
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on and talk about something in the PlayStation camp.

544
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,200
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation 3.

545
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:02,450
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3 is going to be a PlayStation brick and it won't really be useful for anything anymore because, of course, the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.

546
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:09,243
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.

547
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:12,523
[SPEAKER_08]: All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.

548
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:15,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when did the system first come out?

549
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:15,824
2006?

550
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:18,485
[SPEAKER_08]: This is about a nine year window.

551
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:21,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that's not terrible.

552
00:41:21,366 --> 00:41:24,007
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not your fucking ten year life cycle that you promised me.

553
00:41:24,027 --> 00:41:24,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my money back.

554
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:28,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

555
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,102
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, did you have a problem?

556
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:31,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Your soap spat on my shirt.

557
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It left white foam on my shirt.

558
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:34,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It likes you a lot.

559
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:35,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

560
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,045
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

561
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:39,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, PlayStation 3, good until 2015.

562
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:44,669
[SPEAKER_08]: That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.

563
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:44,669
2016.

564
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,711
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's targeted.

565
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:54,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to reemphasize you're not just buying something that's going to suck in a couple years.

566
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:56,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

567
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:05,779
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely, and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long, but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.

568
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with PlayStation 2.

569
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:13,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch, but there are still games launching for it.

570
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Jon Kohler, GameSpot

571
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:41,368
[SPEAKER_05]: One whole game.

572
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: One whole game.

573
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,751
[SPEAKER_05]: One game that's going to be out in Japan.

574
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, there will be one more game.

575
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:56,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.

576
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.

577
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:02,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Adelino Macchio.

578
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:10,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the English version is something like something of Andolin or something is the English title.

579
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name so I can't actually read it properly.

580
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Scroll.

581
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, it's not working.

582
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Makyo.

583
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:22,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Adolin no Makyo.

584
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:26,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.

585
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:30,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one that has like Geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.

586
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:30,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh!

587
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:34,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.

588
00:43:35,016 --> 00:43:35,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

589
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see why people are still playing it.

590
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:38,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have pandas.

591
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:41,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's funny that... Pandas in the mist.

592
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:45,622
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.

593
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:47,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I am so surprised it hasn't gone free-to-play yet.

594
00:43:48,104 --> 00:43:48,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

595
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,465
[SPEAKER_05]: If it went free-to-play, I'd play it again.

596
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wouldn't?

597
00:43:52,946 --> 00:43:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a few people who wouldn't.

598
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:56,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

599
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you what made me quit that game, right?

600
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a white mage.

601
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:05,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, damn it.

602
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:09,628
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.

603
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:11,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck this, I'm teleporting hola.

604
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

605
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:14,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just like, I'm done.

606
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,470
[SPEAKER_08]: See, after all these years, you still can make jokes like that.

607
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,431
[SPEAKER_08]: That game had quite an impression.

608
00:44:20,771 --> 00:44:22,531
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, oh, you made a bad pull.

609
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:23,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, fuck you guys.

610
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:25,332
[SPEAKER_07]: No heel, and I'm out.

611
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:29,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.

612
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:33,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Subligar Leather underwear Bite my ass please At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online

613
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:04,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Port, port please, port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.

614
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:06,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Port prompt please.

615
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, pretty impressive, though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?

616
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:19,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013?

617
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:24,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, let's be real, it's like there's been one game this year and one game next year.

618
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on life support at this moment.

619
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,703
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.

620
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:35,565
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.

621
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:38,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm never gonna.

622
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:39,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's not that bad.

623
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:40,348
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I have it.

624
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:41,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I should sit down and play it.

625
00:45:41,788 --> 00:45:42,248
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

626
00:45:42,628 --> 00:45:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good time.

627
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:44,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also have Pandas.

628
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:45,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Balthier and Fran?

629
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Pandas.

630
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,331
[SPEAKER_08]: You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.

631
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:49,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Pandas.

632
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:52,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Fran's a bunny.

633
00:45:53,232 --> 00:45:53,572
[SPEAKER_08]: So?

634
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:55,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

635
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.

636
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:00,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

637
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:02,776
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, actually, there's a few things coming out.

638
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:05,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's

639
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:08,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Resident Evil 6

640
00:46:26,314 --> 00:46:27,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Vita... No.

641
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:27,855
[SPEAKER_07]: No Vita.

642
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:30,836
[SPEAKER_07]: But PSP for some goddamn reason.

643
00:46:32,176 --> 00:46:35,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Go2k for supporting PSP still.

644
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:37,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one else is.

645
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:38,938
[SPEAKER_07]: And PC.

646
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.

647
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.

648
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:48,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.

649
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:50,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what it's called.

650
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:52,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Including a penis!

651
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:54,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It said everything.

652
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:54,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice!

653
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:58,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's lessons for everyone.

654
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,703
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, you can draw everything.

655
00:46:59,723 --> 00:47:00,863
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically how I'm calling it.

656
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:02,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Including a penis.

657
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:03,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Including a penis.

658
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:06,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.

659
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:11,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Courier Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.

660
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And what else we had here?

661
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:18,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

662
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:21,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.

663
00:47:21,907 --> 00:47:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 Command & Conquer games in there.

664
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:25,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy fuck.

665
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of Command & Conquer.

666
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:28,933
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too much Command & Conquer.

667
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Ours is over 17 years worth of Command & Conquer.

668
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read the cover there.

669
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:35,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, 17 games.

670
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.

671
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:44,099
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 bucks and you get like all of the Command & Conquer games, all the Red Alert games, Generals.

672
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's pretty sweet.

673
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:50,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma says, 17 Command & Conquer games?

674
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:51,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up and take my money.

675
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,323
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll never get through it all.

676
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.

677
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:00,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I played one game for two seconds.

678
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:02,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that with the Doom pack.

679
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:30,416
[SPEAKER_07]: XCOM is fucking great though also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty editions of Resident Evil NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil they have the archives and anthologies which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3 including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1 3, 4, it's like all these random ones in there

680
00:48:31,836 --> 00:48:54,222
[SPEAKER_08]: MXC1 to clarify in our chatroom 17 games but they're all digital even if you buy the box you just get codes that's stupid I hate it when they do that now thank you Origin thank you thank you for sucking fucking awesome that comment and more in our chatroom live.vognetwork.com oh and of course you know I should mention a week from today there's uh

681
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:58,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.

682
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:00,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone might be interested in that.

683
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,667
[SPEAKER_07]: No one I know likes that game.

684
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:05,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to digress for a moment.

685
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:07,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done any pet battles?

686
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're pretty fun, actually.

687
00:49:10,071 --> 00:49:11,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and did that for like an hour.

688
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:20,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But they will not let you, according to our guildie, Gwen, they will not let you name your Phoenix Hatchling, Fox.

689
00:49:21,482 --> 00:49:21,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Legion Legion

690
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

691
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:47,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

692
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:49,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So I named it Geth Legion.

693
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:50,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Still.

694
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,921
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, Rob, I did actually prove you wrong from something on Horde House.

695
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:54,562
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

696
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:57,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Jane Shepard on Proudmoore.

697
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you.

698
00:49:58,104 --> 00:49:58,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

699
00:49:58,664 --> 00:50:00,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a cookie.

700
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:03,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to Jamie, I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.

701
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:04,587
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd they do?

702
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:07,489
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy XII.

703
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:11,071
[SPEAKER_08]: SJ100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.

704
00:50:11,571 --> 00:50:12,652
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Garrus isn't in it.

705
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:15,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says Tellard has Panda Corgi Garrus.

706
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:17,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew!

707
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just wrong, no.

708
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:20,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, did you see the ferret effect?

709
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-uh.

710
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes I did!

711
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:24,903
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

712
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, was that a listener of OLR?

713
00:50:26,905 --> 00:50:28,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we can't take all the credit for it.

714
00:50:28,146 --> 00:50:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was in our Mass Effect secret community.

[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I got?

717
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:56,637
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

718
00:50:56,877 --> 00:51:04,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Sunny Gummy I love that name From Gummy Bears And I have Shampoo But spelled X-I-A-N-P-U Ah

719
00:51:06,064 --> 00:51:08,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh hey, let's travel Japan and check out release dates over there.

720
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012, both on the Xbox 360.

721
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:26,539
[SPEAKER_08]: There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know, to try and like sell some Microsoft Xbox 360s, I guess.

722
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there are full consoles coming out too.

723
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:33,765
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition, which

724
00:51:34,205 --> 00:51:36,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, this is the one with the jacket, isn't it?

725
00:51:37,147 --> 00:51:41,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?

726
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: $1,700 if you want to get this.

727
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,632
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.

728
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:47,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that?

729
00:51:48,193 --> 00:51:49,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That's happening in Japan this week.

730
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:50,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But not a full metal jacket.

731
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:50,994
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

732
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:54,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.

733
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:57,318
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.

734
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:58,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the jacket's pretty freaking rad.

735
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:02,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.

736
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cute.

737
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:03,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

738
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:06,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.

739
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:08,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we know.

740
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:11,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, going to the PlayStation 3.

741
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:14,091
[SPEAKER_08]: It matches most of the same shit.

742
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.

743
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:22,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your PlayStation 3 with Biohazard symbols.

744
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:25,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So your PlayStation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.

745
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:27,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Won't that be awesome?

746
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:30,360
[SPEAKER_08]: F1 2012 and... You alright over there?

747
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:31,769
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they just made me laugh.

748
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:33,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I had mental imagery then.

749
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:35,012
[SPEAKER_08]: World Soccer Winning 11 2013.

750
00:52:35,512 --> 00:52:41,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes.

751
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And so because of that, they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.

752
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

753
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:47,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can't unsee that.

754
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:51,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick blowing a giraffe.

755
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,527
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't unsee that now that that's been said.

756
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go.

757
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:56,569
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

758
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,991
[SPEAKER_08]: How about on the Nintendo 3DS?

759
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming out this week, nothing.

760
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:06,136
[SPEAKER_08]: But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.

761
00:53:06,176 --> 00:53:09,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.

762
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:11,740
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

763
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,121
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Japanese release dates.

764
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

765
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:15,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a few things.

766
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:21,847
[SPEAKER_05]: On the first, which already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.

767
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the second, Resident Evil 6.

768
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, you are so correct.

769
00:53:28,189 --> 00:53:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

770
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've tried.

771
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kind of been ignoring it.

772
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Try the unseen, but you can't.

773
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:37,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?

774
00:53:37,932 --> 00:53:38,092
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

775
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:38,773
[SPEAKER_05]: For the release of that?

776
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:39,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

777
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: They did like a fake human meat market.

778
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:41,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

779
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:42,754
[SPEAKER_05]: For Resident Evil 6.

780
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:43,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

781
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:44,114
[SPEAKER_05]: In East London.

782
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:44,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all raccoon.

783
00:53:46,275 --> 00:53:46,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew!

784
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:47,095
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

785
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:50,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Haven't you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?

786
00:53:50,597 --> 00:53:51,397
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

787
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:51,637
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

788
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:58,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid I didn't watch it again for like two years.

789
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really gross.

790
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost put it in show role, but it's really, really gross.

791
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:03,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just link pictures.

792
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:09,075
[SPEAKER_07]: They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and... Here.

793
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:22,424
[SPEAKER_08]: The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kitten Mittens, was the episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.

794
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:23,425
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite.

795
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:26,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen that one yet.

796
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:27,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's fantastic.

797
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:35,315
[SPEAKER_05]: But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically for helping amputees.

798
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:40,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess that's cool that it had a good cause at the end of the day.

799
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:42,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So, back to the releases.

800
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:44,630
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you going to say?

801
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, actually, I do think I did see that episode where they were all in the U-Haul trailer or something like that.

802
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?

803
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:52,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

804
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

805
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:55,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That was hilarious.

806
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah!

807
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:58,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.

808
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:02,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 4th is Anno 2070 Deep Ocean.

809
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:04,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 5th, NBA 2K13.

810
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So something every day this week.

811
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:10,304
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

812
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:11,666
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple more news stories for you guys.

813
00:55:11,686 --> 00:55:17,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the classic game of the week where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.

814
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,751
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

815
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:20,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's of the week.

816
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:29,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So Notch, the wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to...

817
00:55:31,221 --> 00:55:43,088
[SPEAKER_07]: and perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in Windows 8 so that it would be on their closed platform.

818
00:55:43,929 --> 00:55:48,711
[SPEAKER_07]: They even asked, hey, you can help certify Minecraft for Windows 8.

819
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:59,598
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all rather than to play along with what Microsoft wanted.

820
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:05,822
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically said I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms around.

821
00:56:05,882 --> 00:56:12,686
[SPEAKER_07]: If Microsoft decides to lock down Windows 8 it would be very very bad for indie games and competition in general.

822
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:19,530
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can keep open platforms around there's going to be a lot of very interesting games in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.

823
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:28,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would have been what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.

824
00:56:28,754 --> 00:56:31,036
[SPEAKER_07]: They're certified for it in Minecraft.

825
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:35,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but he doesn't want to do that.

826
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:36,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you?

827
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:49,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because it's their closed App Store versus...

828
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:51,074
[SPEAKER_07]: He sells the game off his website.

829
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:52,436
[SPEAKER_07]: He gets all the profits for it.

830
00:56:52,536 --> 00:56:59,047
[SPEAKER_07]: So why... Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason.

831
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course he's going to say no.

832
00:57:03,662 --> 00:57:12,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little different when you're putting your game on the Xbox 360 where no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.

833
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,205
[SPEAKER_07]: You just can't do that.

834
00:57:16,006 --> 00:57:19,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma in chat says, Oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.

835
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows, the operating system that is pirate-proof.

836
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:51,092
[SPEAKER_07]: No one pirates Windows.

837
00:57:52,494 --> 00:57:53,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

838
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:56,958
[SPEAKER_07]: If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.

839
00:57:58,879 --> 00:57:59,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't buy operating systems.

840
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't think I've paid for one in like 20 years.

841
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:08,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.

842
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:09,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Same here.

843
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Fugo Question of the Week a little later when it comes to Windows 8.

844
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:17,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still really torn on it.

845
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:24,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.

846
00:58:24,145 --> 00:58:25,706
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of mystery around it, too.

847
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:26,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

848
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:35,609
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's anything that people find about Windows 8 that they really must have, someone's going to fucking develop a program that runs on Windows 7 that does the same damn shit.

849
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it probably does it better, so...

850
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:42,647
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no thanks.

851
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:45,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Not into it.

852
00:58:47,852 --> 00:58:55,039
[SPEAKER_08]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, danger.

853
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:06,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, if you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe you're on Linux.

854
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, Linux is going to be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form of Steam.

855
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:18,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.

856
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,561
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,000 users will be testing the client.

857
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:23,363
[SPEAKER_08]: They also get one Valve game with that.

858
00:59:23,423 --> 00:59:27,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to be Left 4 Dead 2 because that, of course, is the game that they already said would be on Linux.

859
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: The beta will support, and please forgive me if I mispronounce this because I'm not a Linux user, Ubuntu.

860
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:34,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that how you say it?

861
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:35,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

862
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubuntu 12.04 and above.

863
00:59:38,614 --> 00:59:41,656
[SPEAKER_08]: It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.

864
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.

865
00:59:45,818 --> 00:59:50,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to the user install experience.

866
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:54,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?

867
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:57,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?

868
00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:58,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think so.

869
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not like an in-depth programmer or anything like that.

870
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

871
01:00:02,488 --> 01:00:02,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

872
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I might see if I can't get into it.

873
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:09,900
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your logic for using Linux Mint again?

874
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:14,103
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.

875
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.

876
01:00:26,912 --> 01:00:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, you have basic immediate root access to anything in your system.

877
01:00:33,156 --> 01:00:35,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.

878
01:00:37,419 --> 01:00:40,061
[SPEAKER_05]: It's respected, it's versatile.

879
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:49,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for anything.

880
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.

881
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:54,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's specific about Mint?

882
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:56,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a really easy interface.

883
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you just like the name Mint?

884
01:00:58,493 --> 01:00:59,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's minty fresh.

885
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:03,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.

886
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:07,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really good introductory into Linux.

887
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Minty fresh scattles.

888
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that.

889
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,702
[SPEAKER_08]: A 10-year-old joke from Understation Live.

890
01:01:12,762 --> 01:01:13,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

891
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:14,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

892
01:01:14,263 --> 01:01:14,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Bringing it back.

893
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:15,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, no.

894
01:01:16,444 --> 01:01:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: On my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.

895
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:22,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to find it now.

896
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?

897
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:25,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably did.

898
01:01:25,876 --> 01:01:27,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think I made it before I had LiveJournal.

899
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:28,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Or your Zonga.

900
01:01:28,379 --> 01:01:29,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I never had a Zonga.

901
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:30,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Never had a Zonga.

902
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:34,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week and I was like, oh yeah.

903
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:36,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go find the Mitzcattles.

904
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:36,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

905
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:40,092
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.

906
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:41,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen the new MySpace?

907
01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:43,195
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying.

908
01:01:43,215 --> 01:01:43,896
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean Pinterest?

909
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:46,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's basically Pinterest.

910
01:01:46,457 --> 01:01:47,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, no, here's the thing.

911
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.

912
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:51,179
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was looking at the new MySpace.

913
01:01:51,219 --> 01:01:52,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, okay.

914
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:55,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.

915
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:56,981
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

916
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:00,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Still won't use it.

917
01:02:00,742 --> 01:02:01,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of use Pinterest.

918
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:02,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you?

919
01:02:02,543 --> 01:02:03,604
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you pin on Pinterest?

920
01:02:04,064 --> 01:02:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually like recipes and Supernatural and Mass Effect.

921
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:09,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You're such a girl.

922
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:09,906
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

923
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

924
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:15,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the car.

925
01:02:15,634 --> 01:02:17,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The car really makes me happy.

926
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, going a step further here with Steam.

927
01:02:25,543 --> 01:02:26,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I get the... Oh, yeah, sorry.

928
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:29,885
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game, McPixel.

929
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:33,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.

930
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:36,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It is now... Excuse me, Steam Greenlight.

931
01:02:36,508 --> 01:02:39,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.

932
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:42,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.

933
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,011
[SPEAKER_08]: It is now available for $4.99.

934
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:51,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by using available tools.

935
01:02:51,954 --> 01:02:52,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

936
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:55,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.

937
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:56,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really awesome.

938
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

939
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.

940
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:58,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, did you play it?

941
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:00,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I beat the whole game.

942
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:02,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it on my phone.

943
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:02,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

944
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I paid for it and it was ridiculous.

945
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:09,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.

946
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:13,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games.

947
01:03:14,466 --> 01:03:18,809
[SPEAKER_07]: MacGyver, and something really retarded.

948
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

949
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:25,794
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like the guy's just... A lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people in the nuts.

950
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:28,536
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so noted.

951
01:03:28,897 --> 01:03:29,997
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG, spoiler.

952
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:31,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler.

953
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:34,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you... Which puzzles, though?

954
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:38,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in the nuts.

955
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:40,265
[SPEAKER_08]: When in doubt, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.

956
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:40,905
[SPEAKER_08]: See if it works.

957
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:41,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, seriously.

958
01:03:43,092 --> 01:03:46,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time.

959
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:53,595
[SPEAKER_08]: A time when kicking people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.

960
01:03:54,715 --> 01:04:05,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the classic game of the week, a chance for DarkSakura to take a trip down memory lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this, shut up.

961
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:09,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, by the way, I did post the Mint Scattles picture in chat.

962
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:10,823
[SPEAKER_08]: You found it that quick.

963
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:11,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it.

964
01:04:11,863 --> 01:04:12,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on my DeviantArt.

965
01:04:12,784 --> 01:04:13,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh.

966
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:14,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it a long time ago, though.

967
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:17,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with your Garris Shep pics.

968
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

969
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:18,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done any Garris Shep pics.

970
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually getting... When did I do this?

971
01:04:21,972 --> 01:04:25,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Like... Years ago.

972
01:04:25,835 --> 01:04:26,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

973
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:27,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

974
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:27,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic of the week.

975
01:04:27,817 --> 01:04:28,658
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you pick, DarkSakura?

976
01:04:29,058 --> 01:04:30,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked Donkey Kong Country.

977
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:31,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick.

978
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:35,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.

979
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of us cheered when we heard that?

980
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:43,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

981
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:05,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, rare.

982
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:06,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, rare.

983
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:14,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I have to say it's funny because I do actually use Wikipedia for some of my references.

984
01:05:14,651 --> 01:05:17,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, DKC redirects here for the genetic disease.

985
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Diskeratosis Congenita.

986
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:22,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It just made me laugh for some reason.

987
01:05:22,374 --> 01:05:23,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what is that?

988
01:05:23,174 --> 01:05:24,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like something to do with skin.

989
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:31,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare and it came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.

990
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:38,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.

991
01:05:38,879 --> 01:05:41,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It was done by Tim Stapler, by some dude.

992
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,391
[SPEAKER_05]: This game was really cool.

993
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:46,432
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so much going on with this one.

994
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:50,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.

995
01:05:50,254 --> 01:05:51,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boy Color version had 41.

996
01:05:52,935 --> 01:05:57,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by Kremlings.

997
01:05:57,897 --> 01:06:14,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines, you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls, you can do all kinds of stuff, and you can spell out K-O-N-G, and get extra life balloons, you can do all kinds of stuff.

998
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:20,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the rhino, and I like that you can ride a barrel and just notch it over while you're riding the barrel.

999
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:26,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew, Diddy, and you can switch between them.

1000
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Diddy is more agile, but not as powerful.

1001
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the Rhino, Espresso the Ostrich, Engard the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot.

1002
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:42,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know who thought of those names, because those are some dumb names.

1003
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:43,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1004
01:06:44,532 --> 01:06:47,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You have two player mode, so you can do contest or team.

1005
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:51,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.

1006
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And team, you play together.

1007
01:06:53,758 --> 01:06:54,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You work together.

1008
01:06:54,759 --> 01:06:56,820
[SPEAKER_05]: One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.

1009
01:06:58,021 --> 01:07:00,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can track your progress through the map.

1010
01:07:00,903 --> 01:07:04,546
[SPEAKER_05]: You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.

1011
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.

1012
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know where he got that name.

1013
01:07:14,912 --> 01:07:22,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Bobby Blackwolf in chat is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music, so here you go, some underwater music.

1014
01:07:24,418 --> 01:07:26,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love this music.

1015
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:27,359
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1016
01:07:34,472 --> 01:08:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: so anyway it was really it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed so it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it and it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong and that's pretty much become a standard now um

1017
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:11,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.

1018
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:15,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.

1019
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It was lots of fun.

1020
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:19,502
[SPEAKER_05]: There were different ways to play through each level.

1021
01:08:19,982 --> 01:08:22,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You had secret rooms that you could get.

1022
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:25,223
[SPEAKER_05]: You had all kinds of different things that were going on.

1023
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:29,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You had all the balloons you could... Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.

1024
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:30,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually just going to hang up on him.

1025
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:33,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hanging up on you.

1026
01:08:34,373 --> 01:08:34,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was it?

1027
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1028
01:08:35,514 --> 01:08:38,596
[SPEAKER_05]: 800 number.

1029
01:08:39,897 --> 01:08:45,620
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.

1030
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It had really fun music.

1031
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:53,826
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like bopping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.

1032
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:55,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty funny.

1033
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:55,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1034
01:08:57,888 --> 01:09:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was, it was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.

1035
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,522
[SPEAKER_05]: and Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.

1036
01:09:17,743 --> 01:09:27,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006 and in Europe on December 8th and North America on the 19th of February, 2007.

1037
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:30,334
[SPEAKER_05]: There were sequels.

1038
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:31,474
[SPEAKER_05]: There were other ones.

1039
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:35,238
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.

1040
01:09:35,858 --> 01:09:40,562
[SPEAKER_05]: There was three Dixie Kongs, Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64 and Donkey Kong Country Returns.

1041
01:09:42,668 --> 01:09:43,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that was it.

1042
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,853
[SPEAKER_08]: This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.

1043
01:09:51,175 --> 01:09:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1044
01:09:54,898 --> 01:09:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1045
01:09:55,519 --> 01:09:55,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1046
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:57,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it.

1047
01:09:58,781 --> 01:09:59,342
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1048
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:04,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Country.

1049
01:10:04,386 --> 01:10:06,848
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what happens when you try to say all those words too fast.

1050
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:09,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good times.

1051
01:10:09,327 --> 01:10:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.

1052
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:12,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

1053
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I found an NPC called, like, Chef Yon or something.

1054
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Cookmaster Yon.

1055
01:10:18,509 --> 01:10:21,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yon.

1056
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And Yon can cook.

1057
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:30,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was Walk with Yon that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.

1058
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:35,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've actually been... Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.

1059
01:10:36,652 --> 01:10:37,052
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1060
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:43,243
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I think it's time for a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1061
01:10:43,263 --> 01:10:45,964
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1062
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:48,065
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.

1063
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:51,226
[SPEAKER_08]: The recent shows have been very long, but hey, it happens sometimes.

1064
01:10:51,306 --> 01:11:01,010
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1065
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:01,391
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1066
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:03,071
[SPEAKER_08]: The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.

1067
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:06,793
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.

1068
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:10,194
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all fixed tonight, so I'm sure people will be getting in.

1069
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:14,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1070
01:11:14,756 --> 01:11:19,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1071
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:36,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.

1072
01:11:36,796 --> 01:11:43,302
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.

1073
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:48,006
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night of course at vognetwork.com.

1074
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:53,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Be sure to join us and chat live.vognetwork.com and Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.

1075
01:11:54,191 --> 01:12:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about, and I don't, I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is, but Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.

1076
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:23,910
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go and that is coming.

1077
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:28,271
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.

1078
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:30,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty awesome.

1079
01:12:31,161 --> 01:12:31,481
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1080
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:48,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble

1081
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:17,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a winner.

1082
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:25,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.

1083
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:28,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's pretty sweet.

1084
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:35,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it's, you know, you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.

1085
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:38,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?

1086
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too.

1087
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they added some more games to that.

1088
01:13:43,747 --> 01:13:44,167
[SPEAKER_07]: They did.

1089
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:45,528
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.

1090
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:46,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Wizorb.

1091
01:13:47,274 --> 01:13:49,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I already bought all these games.

1092
01:13:49,034 --> 01:13:49,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Wizorb.

1093
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:59,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.

1094
01:14:00,316 --> 01:14:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, I can't be too upset.

1095
01:14:01,857 --> 01:14:04,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I paid money for really good games.

1096
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:06,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.

1097
01:14:07,678 --> 01:14:15,099
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use... Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.

1098
01:14:15,419 --> 01:14:43,353
[SPEAKER_07]: oh nice okay yeah you should give one away it's a good deal one day left by the way and last but not least a game I'm very excited about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week and not to be outdone by that D3 of America decided hey guess what Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US fuck yeah Loki was very happy

1099
01:14:43,573 --> 01:14:48,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.

1100
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a... Oh, okay, I was like, winter 2013?

1101
01:14:51,598 --> 01:14:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1102
01:14:52,678 --> 01:14:55,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, it's considered fall, you know.

1103
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1104
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:00,102
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.

1105
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:01,383
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, not at all.

1106
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:01,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

1107
01:15:02,063 --> 01:15:06,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.

1108
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:10,628
[SPEAKER_07]: A reason for you to own a Vita.

1109
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:14,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently the people that played it at Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.

1110
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:19,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they actually added physics this time around and the details a little bit better.

1111
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, they're trying to legitimize.

1112
01:15:21,676 --> 01:15:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously.

1113
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1114
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

1115
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:25,398
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Sandbox making the game.

1116
01:15:25,418 --> 01:15:26,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be awesome.

1117
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no doubt it's going to be awesome.

1118
01:15:28,981 --> 01:15:31,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.

1119
01:15:32,523 --> 01:15:35,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that doesn't happen very often.

1120
01:15:35,905 --> 01:15:37,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I still need to get a little Big Planet Vita.

1121
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:39,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, me too.

1122
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:43,269
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on with some rapid-fire news over here.

1123
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:47,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.

1124
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:50,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dated Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams.

1125
01:15:51,172 --> 01:16:00,896
[SPEAKER_08]: The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers, like really, really similar.

1126
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of had a point.

1127
01:16:02,617 --> 01:16:04,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.

1128
01:16:04,698 --> 01:16:04,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1129
01:16:28,314 --> 01:16:35,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if you've, they show it a little bit in the trailer about these shifting between different worlds.

1130
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:36,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1131
01:16:36,618 --> 01:16:38,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And the music changes when you switch too.

1132
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:40,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, that's pretty cool.

1133
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:43,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're saying it's like a platformer Garuga almost.

1134
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1135
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:48,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a neat concept and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.

1136
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:50,824
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a demo out there you can check out for free.

1137
01:16:51,044 --> 01:16:53,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually backed it so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.

1138
01:16:54,244 --> 01:16:54,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1139
01:16:54,925 --> 01:17:01,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013, which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there.

1140
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:04,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

1141
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:06,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats to the team there for getting that out.

1142
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: The final title was voted upon by the community.

1143
01:17:10,656 --> 01:17:14,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.

1144
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:15,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally missed that.

1145
01:17:43,602 --> 01:18:10,351
[SPEAKER_08]: After getting the initial amount The 1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal Because, quote, we are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky And are currently discussing ideas for this project Which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse So there you go, the original game dates all the way back to 1994

1146
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:13,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1147
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:21,143
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project, Final Fantasy VI.

1148
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:24,304
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Overclock's Remix Final Fantasy VI album.

1149
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a Kickstarter for it.

1150
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:26,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It was shut down.

1151
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.

1152
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.

1153
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:34,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1154
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:37,349
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently all those issues have been worked out.

1155
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:38,570
[SPEAKER_08]: The fundraiser is back.

1156
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:48,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI Celebration, but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.

1157
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:52,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.

1158
01:18:53,281 --> 01:18:58,585
[SPEAKER_08]: The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes or at events or what have you.

1159
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:06,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It's apparently trying to raise $30,000 but with 29 days left to go they are looking pretty good.

1160
01:19:07,273 --> 01:19:08,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1161
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:12,858
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.

1162
01:19:13,259 --> 01:19:16,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope for Actdeft's sake there's another Chocobo wrap on it.

1163
01:19:16,642 --> 01:19:17,523
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be phenomenal.

1164
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:21,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.

1165
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:22,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Chocobop.

1166
01:19:23,942 --> 01:19:28,546
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole little I love this song he wrote about or I love this song?

1167
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:33,149
[SPEAKER_08]: This song's okay.

1168
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:35,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantasy Star Online 2 is free to play on the Vita.

1169
01:19:37,192 --> 01:19:37,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1170
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be free to play on PC.

1171
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, free to play on the Vita.

1172
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:43,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that's here too.

1173
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:46,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Why must arcades close?

1174
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:47,613
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't make money.

1175
01:20:12,885 --> 01:20:13,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, that's no excuse.

1176
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:16,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this particular one, that wasn't the case though.

1177
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:21,751
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy had been running it for 30 plus years and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.

1178
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:24,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually don't think in this case it was a money thing.

1179
01:20:25,213 --> 01:20:25,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1180
01:20:25,573 --> 01:20:26,894
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was a landmark arcade.

1181
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:28,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was a big deal.

1182
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:29,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, one of the big ones.

1183
01:20:30,596 --> 01:20:34,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a big home for fighting games too.

1184
01:20:34,819 --> 01:20:37,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.

1185
01:20:37,841 --> 01:20:37,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1186
01:20:40,306 --> 01:20:41,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Prison Architect.

1187
01:20:42,987 --> 01:20:53,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they had a paid alpha version and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.

1188
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:56,072
[SPEAKER_05]: The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.

1189
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:02,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one because apparently everybody's making money on there.

1190
01:21:04,414 --> 01:21:04,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1191
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you are.

1192
01:21:07,215 --> 01:21:08,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha ha.

1193
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's it.

1194
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:14,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1195
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:23,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities and we answer them and read the answers for you here right on the show.

1196
01:21:23,942 --> 01:21:25,584
[SPEAKER_08]: This week it's all about Windows 8.

1197
01:21:27,776 --> 01:21:31,758
[SPEAKER_08]: The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.

1198
01:21:32,398 --> 01:21:35,999
[SPEAKER_08]: With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?

1199
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:37,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it something you're picking up?

1200
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?

1201
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:47,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows because I knew if I did that, somebody would say, fuck Windows, I'm on Linux.

1202
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:49,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Windows, I'm on Mac.

1203
01:21:49,044 --> 01:21:50,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was kind of a two-part question.

1204
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:51,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Mac, you don't have a choice.

1205
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:53,847
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to upgrade when they come out with new ones.

1206
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, your computer will stop working.

1207
01:21:55,388 --> 01:22:02,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too, what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?

1208
01:22:02,571 --> 01:22:06,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?

1209
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:08,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's go to Google Plus first.

1210
01:22:08,755 --> 01:22:12,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E. I used to know him when he lived out here.

1211
01:22:13,437 --> 01:22:42,046
[SPEAKER_08]: he answered the question saying I use Linux for many reasons but games are not one of them I'd say however that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OS's but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux and of course all Android devices run Linux but that's a different world of gaming

1212
01:22:42,606 --> 01:22:47,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.

1213
01:22:48,449 --> 01:22:50,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to add something, actually, Rob.

1214
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:53,272
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.

1215
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:57,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.

1216
01:22:57,794 --> 01:22:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1217
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Flaco Jones responded on Google+, saying, I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.

1218
01:23:04,658 --> 01:23:08,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs, and I can't stand it.

1219
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.

1220
01:23:11,662 --> 01:23:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I love all the Mac OSes I've used.

1221
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:18,146
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't a lot of variation between them, but they are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.

1222
01:23:18,466 --> 01:23:22,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.

1223
01:23:22,388 --> 01:23:29,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I do wish there were more games for Mac, because whenever I do play on a Mac, it feels a lot smoother than the PC version, even though my PC has slightly better specs.

1224
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:39,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft replied on Google+, saying the Win 8 Metro UI is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.

1225
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: That interface is made for a tablet, and it would totally work for that really well, but not for a keyboard and mouse.

1226
01:23:45,323 --> 01:23:54,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them, Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture if your internet connection goes down or something.

1227
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm currently using Win XP.

1228
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:59,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.

1229
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:08,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook, I love this nickname, I am super lazy, replied and said, it's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.

1230
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:15,607
[SPEAKER_08]: My thought is that it works best as a media center PC, but as a traditional PC, it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.

1231
01:24:15,627 --> 01:24:16,668
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be better options.

1232
01:24:17,429 --> 01:24:22,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Codeman said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs, but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.

1233
01:24:23,193 --> 01:24:27,176
[SPEAKER_08]: You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.

1234
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,157
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to the Windows XP days?

1235
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:29,937
[SPEAKER_08]: The good old days.

1236
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:35,741
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it and if you use Steam, you're really shit out of luck.

1237
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:43,787
[SPEAKER_07]: You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.

1238
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:44,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

1239
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:46,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not looking forward to it.

1240
01:24:47,809 --> 01:24:53,851
[SPEAKER_08]: VX, Jason, XV Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.

1241
01:24:54,272 --> 01:25:04,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe and Notch have talked about will eventually set it up and if they don't already, quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface and then it's Windows 7 again.

1242
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:08,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the surface.

1243
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:09,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1244
01:25:09,177 --> 01:25:09,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1245
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet, but from what I've seen, it looks messy.

1246
01:25:40,714 --> 01:25:43,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.

1247
01:25:43,978 --> 01:25:46,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.

1248
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,662
[SPEAKER_08]: We only just migrated to Windows 7.

1249
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.

1250
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:54,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.

1251
01:25:56,289 --> 01:26:00,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on even back when I had a PC.

1252
01:26:01,177 --> 01:26:02,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Macs have World of Warcraft.

1253
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:04,582
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.

1254
01:26:04,983 --> 01:26:10,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.

1255
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:16,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw says, personally, I don't think you would notice any performance increase going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

1256
01:26:16,817 --> 01:26:18,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.

1257
01:26:19,099 --> 01:26:27,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro-style UI that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard in Windows Phone.

1258
01:26:28,526 --> 01:26:34,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate though actually about the UI real quick is the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.

1259
01:26:34,351 --> 01:26:34,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1260
01:26:34,992 --> 01:26:35,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1261
01:26:35,472 --> 01:26:42,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember it's made for tablets so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.

1262
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:42,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

1263
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.

1264
01:26:49,485 --> 01:26:55,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.

1265
01:26:56,553 --> 01:27:02,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently from the way I understand the story is that he fears that with Windows 8 will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.

1266
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:03,720
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1267
01:27:18,627 --> 01:27:25,249
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny because last time I checked, his game is freely downloadable off his website and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.

1268
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:33,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores that you have to go through a certification process to get your app on there in the first place?

1269
01:27:33,652 --> 01:27:36,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.

1270
01:27:36,393 --> 01:27:45,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game from the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go and it's right there when I start the PC up?

1271
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:48,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, last time I checked, you are not being held up at gunpoint to buy Windows 8.

1272
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:49,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting point.

1273
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:58,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the thing is, though, is for all those three platforms that you mentioned, there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.

1274
01:27:58,202 --> 01:28:00,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, he cannot sell you a copy from his website.

1275
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:05,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you can for Android, because then you can do third-party apps and stuff like that.

1276
01:28:05,086 --> 01:28:08,688
[SPEAKER_07]: But for everything else, you cannot buy straight from his website.

1277
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:09,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1278
01:28:09,733 --> 01:28:10,653
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1279
01:28:32,862 --> 01:28:39,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?

1280
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:42,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.

1281
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft charges for...

1282
01:28:48,653 --> 01:28:51,054
[SPEAKER_07]: and updates on your games.

1283
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:53,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And how often is Minecraft updated?

1284
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: About once a week.

1285
01:28:56,016 --> 01:28:58,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, those are beta updates and stuff like that.

1286
01:28:58,097 --> 01:29:02,718
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.

1287
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:07,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would he want to pay money to do that?

1288
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the same reason why his game's on Steam because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.

1289
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:12,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair question.

1290
01:29:13,203 --> 01:29:14,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1291
01:29:14,064 --> 01:29:16,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few more answers here from Zethers.

1292
01:29:16,447 --> 01:29:17,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows 8 is like Vista.

1293
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:20,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Every other release of Windows have been bad for the past few years of show.

1294
01:29:21,373 --> 01:29:22,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather wait for Windows 9.

1295
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:24,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're like Star Trek movies.

1296
01:29:25,438 --> 01:29:26,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, it is.

1297
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.

1298
01:29:29,585 --> 01:29:30,005
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

1299
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

1300
01:29:49,574 --> 01:29:51,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?

1301
01:29:51,876 --> 01:29:52,116
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1302
01:29:52,396 --> 01:29:55,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.

1303
01:29:55,239 --> 01:30:00,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it, so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.

1304
01:30:01,584 --> 01:30:04,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But after the little bit I've watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.

1305
01:30:06,004 --> 01:30:22,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson Nice Alright, Hitstun says Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2 and PC users will certainly skip it and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting What the hell?

1306
01:30:23,754 --> 01:30:26,475
[SPEAKER_08]: UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting?

1307
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:26,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1308
01:30:27,116 --> 01:30:27,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah

1309
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:29,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, Sean L replies saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.

1310
01:30:58,317 --> 01:31:02,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down and I write software for a living.

1311
01:31:02,481 --> 01:31:05,884
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?

1312
01:31:06,845 --> 01:31:11,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two maybe.

1313
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:11,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1314
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:15,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

1315
01:31:15,568 --> 01:31:16,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it.

1316
01:31:16,168 --> 01:31:17,209
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fugle Question of the Week.

1317
01:31:17,569 --> 01:31:18,390
[SPEAKER_08]: How about you guys?

1318
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:19,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Windows 8?

1319
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:20,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

1320
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1321
01:31:20,992 --> 01:31:21,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe so?

1322
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:22,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

1323
01:31:22,453 --> 01:31:22,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Never?

1324
01:31:22,753 --> 01:31:23,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1325
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:24,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless they make it like Windows 7.

1326
01:31:25,775 --> 01:31:35,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000 into whatever the hell one came after that.

1327
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:38,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Xp or Vista?

1328
01:31:52,581 --> 01:32:11,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Windows 7 because it took the stuff that was good in Vista took actually a few bits and pieces for memory management from Linux and it's pretty solid on top of that I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users

1329
01:32:12,644 --> 01:32:25,248
[SPEAKER_05]: and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.

1330
01:32:27,048 --> 01:32:31,449
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5 because I used 6 at school.

1331
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:36,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.

1332
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a really good OS.

1333
01:32:40,192 --> 01:32:41,373
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people use it.

1334
01:32:41,813 --> 01:32:48,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got great graphical management, clearly, because I mean, that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.

1335
01:32:48,697 --> 01:32:55,341
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually...

1336
01:32:56,983 --> 01:32:58,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically going to be the PC for idiots.

1337
01:33:18,425 --> 01:33:23,348
[SPEAKER_05]: except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and try to figure out how to do things and it's just not working.

1338
01:33:24,509 --> 01:33:29,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.

1339
01:33:29,712 --> 01:33:33,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off.

1340
01:33:33,454 --> 01:33:35,375
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.

1341
01:33:35,655 --> 01:33:35,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1342
01:33:36,476 --> 01:33:42,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.

1343
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.

1344
01:33:47,683 --> 01:33:47,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1345
01:33:48,305 --> 01:33:54,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs like back in the 90s and the 80s?

1346
01:33:54,688 --> 01:33:57,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.

1347
01:33:58,230 --> 01:34:01,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, it's like, come on.

1348
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:07,315
[SPEAKER_07]: The people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.

1349
01:34:07,435 --> 01:34:11,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs.

1350
01:34:11,717 --> 01:34:12,798
[SPEAKER_07]: But yet, why are we like,

1351
01:34:14,133 --> 01:34:23,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use.

1352
01:34:24,004 --> 01:34:26,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit.

1353
01:34:27,088 --> 01:34:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's it.

1354
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:32,414
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got that retirement money burning a hole through their pocket, I guess.

1355
01:34:33,579 --> 01:34:34,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ranma, no.

1356
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,062
[SPEAKER_05]: A PC for idiots is not a Mac.

1357
01:34:36,943 --> 01:34:38,164
[SPEAKER_05]: A PC for idiots is Windows 8.

1358
01:34:38,224 --> 01:34:39,786
[SPEAKER_05]: End of story.

1359
01:34:40,787 --> 01:34:43,870
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use a Mac OS.

1360
01:34:45,912 --> 01:34:47,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and no, I would not buy it.

1361
01:34:47,613 --> 01:34:48,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting Windows 8.

1362
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:51,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna take the wait-and-see approach that somebody else said.

1363
01:34:52,315 --> 01:34:55,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm gonna be honest, this is gonna make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.

1364
01:34:56,396 --> 01:35:07,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.

1365
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:09,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1366
01:35:09,301 --> 01:35:10,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it this way.

1367
01:35:10,402 --> 01:35:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: If...

1368
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:12,003
[SPEAKER_05]: For once, I'm not judging you.

1369
01:35:12,743 --> 01:35:18,826
[SPEAKER_07]: If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go replacing it?

1370
01:35:20,327 --> 01:35:21,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait.

1371
01:35:23,449 --> 01:35:26,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for Windows 9 or something else.

1372
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:33,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.

1373
01:35:33,068 --> 01:35:33,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

1374
01:35:33,909 --> 01:35:34,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1375
01:35:35,551 --> 01:35:44,401
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1376
01:35:44,882 --> 01:35:45,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some news.

1377
01:35:45,843 --> 01:35:46,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1378
01:35:47,144 --> 01:35:47,445
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing.

1379
01:35:48,986 --> 01:35:57,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.

1380
01:36:01,013 --> 01:36:12,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so there's a word out there, a phrase out there that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community.

1381
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called fan service.

1382
01:36:15,101 --> 01:36:16,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do fans want?

1383
01:36:17,323 --> 01:36:20,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.

1384
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:24,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Amen to that.

1385
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:33,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Team Ninja, they were saying that earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.

1386
01:36:34,595 --> 01:36:35,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the fun in that?

1387
01:36:35,855 --> 01:36:43,418
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.

1388
01:36:44,558 --> 01:37:03,053
[SPEAKER_07]: but the fans who had played the early demos we got a lot of feedback from them that said we want bigger breasts make the characters more like that that was kind of surprising giving the suggestions to tone down the sexuality and so Team Ninja being Team Ninja

1389
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:09,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, Team Ninja, props for trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.

1390
01:37:09,096 --> 01:37:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Gold star, you tried.

1391
01:37:10,076 --> 01:37:10,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be real.

1392
01:37:11,096 --> 01:37:17,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead or Alive is all about excess, and if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.

1393
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you have Virtua Fighter.

1394
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And a really shitty volleyball game.

1395
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:23,242
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit.

1396
01:37:24,082 --> 01:37:25,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Virtua Fighter.

1397
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Dead or Alive.

1398
01:37:26,143 --> 01:37:27,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how do you feel about Bigger Boobs?

1399
01:37:28,427 --> 01:37:29,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for it.

1400
01:37:29,828 --> 01:37:30,828
There you go.

1401
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:33,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio.

1402
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:34,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the women want bigger boobs.

1403
01:37:34,951 --> 01:37:38,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts?

1404
01:37:39,013 --> 01:37:39,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

1405
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:41,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, not buying it.

1406
01:37:41,554 --> 01:37:43,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, you know what?

1407
01:37:43,175 --> 01:37:48,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want small-chested women to feel... There's fan clubs for that too.

1408
01:37:48,538 --> 01:37:49,638
[SPEAKER_08]: The Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

1409
01:37:49,919 --> 01:37:51,339
[SPEAKER_08]: There's fan clubs for that too.

1410
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:56,282
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.

1411
01:37:57,859 --> 01:37:58,280
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

1412
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:08,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think we should ramp up Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 3 with hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.

1413
01:38:08,869 --> 01:38:11,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress up for dudes.

1414
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:13,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already got the butt floss string.

1415
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:33,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.

1416
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:37,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want there to be a part three with pillow fight mode.

1417
01:38:37,356 --> 01:38:39,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be a lot of fun.

1418
01:38:39,696 --> 01:38:40,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

1419
01:38:40,797 --> 01:38:43,577
[SPEAKER_08]: As you're doing pillow fight mode, like pieces of clothing just, oh.

1420
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:44,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Pillow fight mode?

1421
01:38:44,438 --> 01:38:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

1422
01:38:45,838 --> 01:38:46,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Using the Kinect.

1423
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't have panda boobs.

1424
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1425
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are they talking about Pandaren in chat?

1426
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:10,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know Furry boobies That might take you out of the experience a little bit Alright Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5 Moving on

1427
01:39:12,842 --> 01:39:14,542
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the story that just won't go away.

1428
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:21,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember 38 Studios and how they closed and how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?

1429
01:39:22,225 --> 01:39:28,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits because, you know, that's what happens.

1430
01:39:28,806 --> 01:39:30,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things never leak out.

1431
01:39:31,067 --> 01:39:31,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what?

1432
01:39:31,227 --> 01:39:31,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1433
01:39:46,544 --> 01:39:49,346
[SPEAKER_08]: and they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.

1434
01:39:49,406 --> 01:40:01,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.

1435
01:40:01,772 --> 01:40:12,837
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.

1436
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's something kind of scary, though.

1437
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:19,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.

1438
01:40:19,322 --> 01:40:32,789
[SPEAKER_07]: You license a game from... So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying, hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us?

1439
01:40:33,169 --> 01:40:34,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need those back.

1440
01:40:35,751 --> 01:40:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You licensed it, so you need to send them back.

1441
01:40:39,517 --> 01:40:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have?

1442
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:43,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, with the license up.

1443
01:40:43,618 --> 01:40:43,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yank.

1444
01:40:46,618 --> 01:40:46,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

1445
01:40:47,618 --> 01:40:50,519
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, seriously, those XTKs do get out there.

1446
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:53,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I would know from personal experience.

1447
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And how much, approximately, would one set you back?

1448
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:05,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very much anymore, because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and JTAGs are pretty out there, there's not much use for XTKs anymore.

1449
01:41:05,481 --> 01:41:06,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, 300, 400...

1450
01:41:09,212 --> 01:41:09,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's not too bad.

1451
01:41:11,273 --> 01:41:14,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.

1452
01:41:15,994 --> 01:41:16,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1453
01:41:17,855 --> 01:41:19,356
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, moving on, DarkSakura.

1454
01:41:21,296 --> 01:41:23,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was actually playing with my iPad.

1455
01:41:23,337 --> 01:41:24,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can tell.

1456
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay attention.

1457
01:41:25,678 --> 01:41:25,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1458
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:29,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class.

1459
01:41:29,339 --> 01:41:29,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.

1460
01:41:29,899 --> 01:41:33,421
[SPEAKER_05]: How about a really trippy-ass game called Middens?

1461
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:35,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitten Middens.

1462
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1463
01:41:37,822 --> 01:41:42,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.

1464
01:41:44,588 --> 01:41:54,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically is an indie RPG, so it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy-ass backgrounds.

1465
01:41:55,216 --> 01:42:04,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you're running headfirst through a combination of Dali or even going back to Hieronymus Bosch.

1466
01:42:05,981 --> 01:42:08,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I'm going all art history on you guys.

1467
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:14,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.

1468
01:42:16,126 --> 01:42:20,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.

1469
01:42:22,941 --> 01:42:26,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this.

1470
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:28,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's really fucking weird.

1471
01:42:28,904 --> 01:42:30,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at least you get a gun.

1472
01:42:31,046 --> 01:42:32,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can try it out for free.

1473
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:35,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I like free.

1474
01:42:35,868 --> 01:42:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.

1475
01:42:40,251 --> 01:42:42,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.

1476
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:45,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.

1477
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:46,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

1478
01:42:46,979 --> 01:42:47,820
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not here next week.

1479
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1480
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be... I forgot.

1481
01:42:50,361 --> 01:42:50,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

1482
01:42:50,702 --> 01:42:53,883
[SPEAKER_07]: She won't play it anyways by next week.

1483
01:42:53,903 --> 01:42:58,686
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.

1484
01:42:58,786 --> 01:43:00,027
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just playing for Becky.

1485
01:43:01,548 --> 01:43:01,888
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1486
01:43:01,928 --> 01:43:04,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We should start a foundation where, you know... We should.

1487
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:06,070
[SPEAKER_08]: We should start a foundation.

1488
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:08,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.

1489
01:43:09,852 --> 01:43:11,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll play Mass Effect for money.

1490
01:43:13,607 --> 01:43:15,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation.

1491
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:21,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.

1492
01:43:21,736 --> 01:43:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play 24-7.

1493
01:43:23,358 --> 01:43:26,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I basically play Mass Effect once a week.

1494
01:43:26,181 --> 01:43:29,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is... Pandas!

1495
01:43:29,885 --> 01:43:30,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1496
01:43:30,446 --> 01:43:30,866
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1497
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:33,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.

1498
01:43:34,264 --> 01:43:36,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Bobby Blackwolf is volunteering.

1499
01:43:36,346 --> 01:43:37,587
[SPEAKER_08]: He needs that foundation.

1500
01:43:37,727 --> 01:43:39,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.

1501
01:43:39,889 --> 01:43:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that he has to come over to my house.

1502
01:43:43,452 --> 01:43:49,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.

1503
01:43:49,777 --> 01:43:50,218
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1504
01:43:50,478 --> 01:43:52,359
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.

1505
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,921
[SPEAKER_05]: The Church of Garrus Foundation.

1506
01:43:53,981 --> 01:43:58,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, AskDeft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos.

1507
01:43:58,565 --> 01:43:59,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're little asses.

1508
01:44:00,286 --> 01:44:18,768
[SPEAKER_05]: um also Alpha Cananogram asked about me having an iPad yeah I didn't actually bring it up on the show Dan traded his transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card power supply and got Borderlands 2 and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad

1509
01:44:20,538 --> 01:44:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So he made it up to me.

1510
01:44:21,419 --> 01:44:22,860
[SPEAKER_08]: He traded a Transformer?

1511
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:23,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a doll?

1512
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,963
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he traded his shitty Android shit.

1513
01:44:29,004 --> 01:44:29,905
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't like it anyway.

1514
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:33,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.

1515
01:44:35,008 --> 01:44:36,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.

1516
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:38,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I get it now, sorry.

1517
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:40,512
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway.

1518
01:44:40,532 --> 01:44:43,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.

1519
01:44:45,095 --> 01:44:50,079
[SPEAKER_05]: But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it and he was going to sell it anyway so he got me an iPad instead.

1520
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:52,196
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think this is, Rob G4?

1521
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just a pretty face.

1522
01:44:55,056 --> 01:44:57,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day.

1523
01:44:58,017 --> 01:45:02,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Reb.

1524
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:05,740
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.

1525
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously.

1526
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:12,682
[SPEAKER_07]: He just sits there and is like, okay, what retard thing can I say next?

1527
01:45:12,802 --> 01:45:13,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny joke.

1528
01:45:13,482 --> 01:45:14,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha, ha, ha.

1529
01:45:14,102 --> 01:45:14,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm funny.

1530
01:45:15,043 --> 01:45:15,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just like...

1531
01:45:16,523 --> 01:45:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck did that have to do with anything?

1532
01:45:18,644 --> 01:45:27,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.

1533
01:45:29,349 --> 01:45:37,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android.

1534
01:45:37,493 --> 01:45:38,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used it.

1535
01:45:38,473 --> 01:45:39,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I've given it a chance.

1536
01:45:39,814 --> 01:45:42,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Windows tablets even more.

1537
01:45:44,278 --> 01:45:47,040
[SPEAKER_05]: IOS has what I want to do and Wacom loves it.

1538
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:47,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

1539
01:45:48,921 --> 01:45:51,503
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see.

1540
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:52,784
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the old saying?

1541
01:45:52,984 --> 01:45:54,605
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a hater and guess what she's gonna do?

1542
01:45:55,046 --> 01:45:55,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna hate!

1543
01:45:58,388 --> 01:45:59,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1544
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:02,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all can bite my tuchus.

1545
01:46:03,255 --> 01:46:06,158
[SPEAKER_08]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, S3 greater than iPhone.

1546
01:46:06,178 --> 01:46:06,919
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it's hilarious.

1547
01:46:06,959 --> 01:46:07,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1548
01:46:07,599 --> 01:46:08,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You know it's hilarious.

1549
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,521
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is what's hilarious.

1550
01:46:09,941 --> 01:46:11,243
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone 5 comes out, right?

1551
01:46:12,604 --> 01:46:17,769
[SPEAKER_08]: My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old-ass BlackBerry.

1552
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:20,271
[SPEAKER_08]: He has one of the first BlackBerrys a long time ago.

1553
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:21,632
[SPEAKER_08]: He has an old-ass phone, right?

1554
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:24,455
[SPEAKER_08]: He finally decides he's going to join the current generation of phones.

1555
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:26,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches?

1556
01:46:26,897 --> 01:46:27,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.

1557
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:29,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Bravo.

1558
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Bravo.

1559
01:46:32,042 --> 01:46:32,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Wise choice.

1560
01:46:33,723 --> 01:46:34,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Keeper.

1561
01:46:34,224 --> 01:46:35,105
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a keeper.

1562
01:46:35,185 --> 01:46:39,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.

1563
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:54,523
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile, which apparently has treated him very well over the years, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.

1564
01:46:54,543 --> 01:46:54,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Galaxy.

1565
01:46:55,259 --> 01:46:56,520
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1566
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:31,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have a... Well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's... Actually, it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight-up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.

1567
01:47:31,789 --> 01:47:40,052
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is $30 for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use.

1568
01:47:40,092 --> 01:47:46,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data, so...

1569
01:47:47,716 --> 01:47:51,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3.

1570
01:47:51,864 --> 01:47:54,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever.

1571
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:55,392
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing

1572
01:47:56,296 --> 01:48:19,138
[SPEAKER_08]: the reason why I like it is in a whole like you know what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that let me play with that and you can do the same thing with my iPhone right he probably uses my iPad more than I do but the reason the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T we don't get the free text messages and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that so that's the one thing I don't like

1573
01:48:19,445 --> 01:48:22,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?

1574
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:23,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

1575
01:48:23,909 --> 01:48:24,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, way to go.

1576
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:26,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Great provider.

1577
01:48:26,331 --> 01:48:29,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.

1578
01:48:29,953 --> 01:48:31,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a cheap plan, $30 a month.

1579
01:48:33,857 --> 01:48:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1580
01:48:35,238 --> 01:48:35,658
[SPEAKER_08]: T-Mobile.

1581
01:48:36,379 --> 01:48:36,759
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1582
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:37,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1583
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:39,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you got a story.

1584
01:48:39,767 --> 01:48:51,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Borderlands 2, there's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.

1585
01:48:53,495 --> 01:49:01,939
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on...

1586
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what fucking service it is.

1587
01:49:05,182 --> 01:49:10,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.

1588
01:49:13,761 --> 01:49:18,967
[SPEAKER_07]: When you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff.

1589
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:22,931
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.

1590
01:49:23,011 --> 01:49:24,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So your badass rank goes away.

1591
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:34,783
[SPEAKER_07]: All your... Not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.

1592
01:49:34,803 --> 01:49:36,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the way the badass points work is...

1593
01:49:37,225 --> 01:49:53,619
[SPEAKER_07]: All of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters or all of your characters and then you get perks like plus 1% to your damage or something like that and it's spread across all your characters.

1594
01:49:55,640 --> 01:50:01,746
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people how

1595
01:50:02,551 --> 01:50:09,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It has happened to you that you submit your save so they can take a look at it.

1596
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:11,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're investigating.

1597
01:50:12,995 --> 01:50:16,417
[SPEAKER_08]: MM2K in our chatroom wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?

1598
01:50:16,937 --> 01:50:18,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's all platforms.

1599
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

1600
01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's tied to... It's not Premium Club, it's... Fuck, I forget what it's called.

1601
01:50:27,984 --> 01:50:40,732
[SPEAKER_07]: They have it on the front page there, you can sign up for it, and it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get, and... Once you've signed up, they give you one additional key...

1602
01:50:43,248 --> 01:51:07,785
[SPEAKER_07]: so they have that honestly if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up I mean I think there's save it throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families because that works so well for other people I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to not that anyone would do that but you can

1603
01:51:09,506 --> 01:51:25,924
[SPEAKER_07]: so and not only does it erase your badass points it's basically everything that's tied to your account so all your skins and faces that you've unlocked and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions are gone so and some of those there are maybe no way to get those back so that kind of sucks

1604
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:27,883
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1605
01:51:29,184 --> 01:51:32,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.

1606
01:51:32,967 --> 01:51:34,248
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another one?

1607
01:51:34,308 --> 01:51:36,629
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.

1608
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was about New Super Mario Bros.

1609
01:51:39,071 --> 01:51:39,912
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 and the DLC.

1610
01:51:40,252 --> 01:51:43,634
[SPEAKER_08]: The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros.

1611
01:51:43,654 --> 01:51:52,180
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's, first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.

1612
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:54,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, they're not late to the party.

1613
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:54,682
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1614
01:51:54,762 --> 01:51:55,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?

1615
01:51:56,403 --> 01:52:02,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is A-OK arriving late to this party.

1616
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:04,230
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, New Super Mario Bros.

1617
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:09,695
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra and some of the levels that will be available.

1618
01:52:10,115 --> 01:52:12,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Go Go as Gold Mario Pack.

1619
01:52:12,437 --> 01:52:16,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Three Gold Mario-themed courses up to 30,000 coins.

1620
01:52:16,881 --> 01:52:18,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Challenge the Record A-Pack.

1621
01:52:18,863 --> 01:52:21,405
[SPEAKER_08]: It will post the top scores on the game's website.

1622
01:52:21,946 --> 01:52:22,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh!

1623
01:52:22,546 --> 01:52:25,749
[SPEAKER_08]: and Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels.

1624
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:28,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Those will all be in the coin rush mode.

1625
01:52:28,432 --> 01:52:30,534
[SPEAKER_08]: So are they like legitimizing Asshole Mario?

1626
01:52:30,574 --> 01:52:31,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's kind of awesome if true.

1627
01:52:33,417 --> 01:52:36,160
[SPEAKER_08]: October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan.

1628
01:52:36,721 --> 01:52:37,942
[SPEAKER_08]: 200 yen each.

1629
01:52:38,162 --> 01:52:41,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind.

1630
01:52:41,946 --> 01:52:45,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.

1631
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:55,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have, crossing Nintendo Mario with LittleBigPlanet.

1632
01:52:55,919 --> 01:52:57,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine if they did that?

1633
01:52:57,361 --> 01:53:02,506
[SPEAKER_07]: First-party Nintendo games, but a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, and LittleBigPlanet

1634
01:53:06,549 --> 01:53:29,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo would never let that happen because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters because people like if Mario like Mario Mario was in Little Big Planet people would be building levels it's like Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that and like Nintendo would never well no it wouldn't necessarily be like that it would be just like um you know you design your own levels

1635
01:53:29,895 --> 01:53:30,255
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1636
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:49,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's always going to be some dude out there.

1637
01:53:49,788 --> 01:53:51,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there are people they have dedicated their lives to.

1638
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.

1639
01:53:54,893 --> 01:53:57,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have a rule about design.

1640
01:53:57,235 --> 01:54:01,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm going to have to run this by DarkSakura.

1641
01:54:01,038 --> 01:54:01,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

1642
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:03,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me if this is a true statement or not.

1643
01:54:05,262 --> 01:54:06,623
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very zen statement.

1644
01:54:06,663 --> 01:54:08,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria.

1645
01:54:10,126 --> 01:54:12,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Where there is design, there is penis.

1646
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,389
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1647
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:16,931
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean no?

1648
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:25,940
[SPEAKER_05]: When there are immature minds, there is penis.

1649
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And where isn't there immature minds?

1650
01:54:29,063 --> 01:54:30,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Clearly not in the internet.

1651
01:54:30,584 --> 01:54:31,986
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet is quite mature.

1652
01:54:32,326 --> 01:54:33,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1653
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:34,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it.

1654
01:54:34,808 --> 01:54:36,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to go ask your teacher.

1655
01:54:37,734 --> 01:54:39,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard this on an internet radio show.

1656
01:54:39,355 --> 01:54:41,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Where there is design, there is penis.

1657
01:54:41,136 --> 01:54:41,696
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

1658
01:54:41,756 --> 01:54:44,898
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.

1659
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:47,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so true, is what he'll say.

1660
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:48,960
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he'll roll his eyes.

1661
01:54:49,121 --> 01:54:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he would do it.

1662
01:54:51,002 --> 01:54:52,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd just go, what?

1663
01:54:52,202 --> 01:54:55,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.

1664
01:54:56,685 --> 01:54:57,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen his art.

1665
01:54:57,685 --> 01:54:59,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.

1666
01:55:00,907 --> 01:55:01,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet.

1667
01:55:01,848 --> 01:55:01,948
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1668
01:55:03,362 --> 01:55:04,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Where there is design, there is penis.

1669
01:55:05,163 --> 01:55:07,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I sense an art book possibility.

1670
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm making an art book.

1671
01:55:10,305 --> 01:55:14,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.

1672
01:55:14,167 --> 01:55:14,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you!

1673
01:55:14,808 --> 01:55:23,992
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be rated M. There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was guess who drew the penis.

1674
01:55:24,152 --> 01:55:29,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody would take around a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.

1675
01:55:29,555 --> 01:55:31,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.

1676
01:55:32,356 --> 01:55:33,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.

1677
01:55:34,037 --> 01:55:37,399
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire.

1678
01:55:37,519 --> 01:55:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama.

1679
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1680
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:39,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerd.

1681
01:55:40,021 --> 01:55:43,242
[SPEAKER_05]: We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.

1682
01:55:43,983 --> 01:55:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that game.

1683
01:55:44,943 --> 01:55:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1684
01:55:45,524 --> 01:55:46,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Who doesn't know that game?

1685
01:55:46,464 --> 01:55:50,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to tell you, I was at Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.

1686
01:55:51,387 --> 01:55:54,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.

1687
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:56,370
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1688
01:56:15,069 --> 01:56:21,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario, Zelda, not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.

1689
01:56:22,071 --> 01:56:22,631
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be awesome.

1690
01:56:25,132 --> 01:56:25,452
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1691
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:27,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Blackwolf says, Excitebike.

1692
01:56:28,753 --> 01:56:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you do a penis in Excitebike?

1693
01:56:30,273 --> 01:56:31,053
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably be very difficult.

1694
01:56:31,073 --> 01:56:35,015
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because they have, you know, it's... I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.

1695
01:56:35,115 --> 01:56:43,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I remember that you could... I remember that you could draw things in Excitebike based on letter.

1696
01:56:43,897 --> 01:56:46,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you would choose a letter and that would be with the obstacle over here.

1697
01:56:46,462 --> 01:56:48,185
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could technically make a corset with penis.

1698
01:56:48,265 --> 01:56:51,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.

1699
01:56:52,073 --> 01:56:53,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So think about it.

1700
01:56:54,036 --> 01:56:54,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it.

1701
01:56:55,519 --> 01:56:56,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Or don't think about it.

1702
01:56:57,646 --> 01:57:00,928
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Alright, true story here.

1703
01:57:01,468 --> 01:57:05,150
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.

1704
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:12,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.

1705
01:57:12,895 --> 01:57:16,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.

1706
01:57:17,317 --> 01:57:21,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.

1707
01:57:23,308 --> 01:57:26,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.

1708
01:57:27,393 --> 01:57:31,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the Fry's penis on the Orange Lodge Radio website.

1709
01:57:31,177 --> 01:57:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody cares.

1710
01:57:33,379 --> 01:57:34,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got hairy balls.

1711
01:57:35,262 --> 01:57:35,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hooray.

1712
01:57:36,143 --> 01:57:36,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

1713
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:45,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.

1714
01:57:46,552 --> 01:57:48,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had a really crazy week.

1715
01:57:49,013 --> 01:57:53,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.

1716
01:57:54,296 --> 01:57:56,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder.

1717
01:57:56,218 --> 01:58:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.

1718
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:04,343
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out an email that she thinks, Hey!

1719
01:58:04,803 --> 01:58:04,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew!

1720
01:58:05,643 --> 01:58:05,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1721
01:58:05,904 --> 01:58:06,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Ew!

1722
01:58:06,324 --> 01:58:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew!

1723
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:08,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read this.

1724
01:58:08,521 --> 01:58:09,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of sticky.

1725
01:58:11,703 --> 01:58:12,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1726
01:58:13,144 --> 01:58:15,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to object to something DarkSakura said on last week's OLR.

1727
01:58:15,946 --> 01:58:17,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, too fucking bad, Skip.

1728
01:58:17,387 --> 01:58:17,787
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

1729
01:58:18,588 --> 01:58:23,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, DarkSakura called Dan's reference to the fake game Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition reprehensible.

1730
01:58:24,071 --> 01:58:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I find this to be abhorrent.

1731
01:58:26,413 --> 01:58:31,896
[SPEAKER_05]: How is Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference Beat and Groovy The Ike Turner Experience?

1732
01:58:32,236 --> 01:58:32,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1733
01:58:33,377 --> 01:58:38,258
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.

1734
01:58:38,598 --> 01:58:48,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Britney's Dance Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent, Ew!

1735
01:58:49,161 --> 01:58:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1736
01:58:49,881 --> 01:58:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.

1737
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

1738
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:54,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

1739
01:59:10,067 --> 01:59:10,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

1740
01:59:11,107 --> 01:59:11,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

1741
01:59:12,108 --> 01:59:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.

1742
01:59:16,329 --> 01:59:28,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three-month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey Collection when I tried to redeem the 30-day voucher the system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it.

1743
01:59:28,653 --> 01:59:31,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?

1744
01:59:32,938 --> 01:59:34,721
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question for Sony.

1745
01:59:34,861 --> 01:59:35,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1746
01:59:35,562 --> 01:59:37,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so because it's auto-renewing.

1747
01:59:38,727 --> 01:59:39,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You could turn that off, though.

1748
01:59:39,789 --> 01:59:41,412
[SPEAKER_08]: You could turn off the auto-renewing.

1749
01:59:41,432 --> 01:59:42,774
[SPEAKER_08]: The catch is they want you to do that.

1750
01:59:46,028 --> 01:59:49,651
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.

1751
01:59:49,911 --> 01:59:59,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on though, because I just tip, get one of those prepaid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.

1752
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:03,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.

1753
02:00:04,183 --> 02:00:09,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the McFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?

1754
02:00:09,867 --> 02:00:10,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck if I know.

1755
02:00:12,463 --> 02:00:13,804
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is, I don't.

1756
02:00:15,986 --> 02:00:17,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted the Sylvanas figure.

1757
02:00:17,347 --> 02:00:17,807
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

1758
02:00:17,907 --> 02:00:19,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.

1759
02:00:19,642 --> 02:00:21,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Wargan Death Knight with Swift Griffin Keep having a good show Robert M

1760
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:47,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Now here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question.

1761
02:00:47,933 --> 02:00:51,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards.

1762
02:00:52,175 --> 02:00:55,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.

1763
02:00:56,077 --> 02:01:01,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.

1764
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:07,805
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says the thing is that by law they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto-charge thing, of course.

1765
02:01:08,485 --> 02:01:13,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.

1766
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:18,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

1767
02:01:18,874 --> 02:01:19,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

1768
02:01:19,955 --> 02:01:23,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.

1769
02:01:23,658 --> 02:01:25,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping...

1770
02:01:26,232 --> 02:01:26,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Sylvanas Faker.

1771
02:01:27,373 --> 02:01:27,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Garrus.

1772
02:01:27,993 --> 02:01:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Garrus.

1773
02:01:28,634 --> 02:01:29,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want Garrus.

1774
02:01:29,395 --> 02:01:30,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Garrus greater than Sylvanas.

1775
02:01:31,216 --> 02:01:31,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1776
02:01:32,157 --> 02:01:32,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, ma'am.

1777
02:01:32,877 --> 02:01:33,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a plushie panda.

1778
02:01:33,938 --> 02:01:34,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have a plushie panda.

1779
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:36,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not all three?

1780
02:01:37,697 --> 02:02:01,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a plush panda no for real okay I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant and when I was in fourth grade my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off so that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck and I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon true story okay

1781
02:02:03,143 --> 02:02:03,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings, OLR.

1782
02:02:04,043 --> 02:02:05,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1783
02:02:06,024 --> 02:02:07,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my review of Borderlands 2.

1784
02:02:08,065 --> 02:02:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome!

1785
02:02:08,605 --> 02:02:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: For the PC.

1786
02:02:10,266 --> 02:02:16,388
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.

1787
02:02:16,749 --> 02:02:18,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I played it on my gaming PC.

1788
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:20,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood and ashes.

1789
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.

1790
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.

1791
02:02:28,235 --> 02:02:32,638
[SPEAKER_05]: The huge levels, the game improves upon the first in every way there is.

1792
02:02:33,019 --> 02:02:38,142
[SPEAKER_05]: The voice acting is great, the dialogue is genius, and Claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.

1793
02:02:39,023 --> 02:02:41,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend it.

1794
02:02:42,365 --> 02:02:45,928
[SPEAKER_05]: What system is Loki playing the game on, and has he played it on a gaming PC?

1795
02:02:46,068 --> 02:02:48,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.

1796
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:51,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360, no I have not, because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.

1797
02:02:52,697 --> 02:02:55,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll wait until a Steam sale anyway, right?

1798
02:02:55,778 --> 02:02:58,119
[SPEAKER_07]: If my laptop doesn't run it, then there's no reason for me to buy it.

1799
02:02:58,279 --> 02:02:58,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope.

1800
02:02:59,339 --> 02:03:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: No reason, but it doesn't mean I won't do it.

1801
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:06,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought this.

1802
02:03:06,701 --> 02:03:10,782
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like $7 for Borderlands.

1803
02:03:10,822 --> 02:03:13,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be something I'd have to buy the Game of the Year edition.

1804
02:03:13,763 --> 02:03:16,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.

1805
02:03:18,064 --> 02:03:21,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?

1806
02:03:21,385 --> 02:03:21,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's shall.

1807
02:03:22,125 --> 02:03:23,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was the last email, right?

1808
02:03:23,926 --> 02:03:24,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1809
02:03:24,766 --> 02:03:28,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you want to send us an email for next week.

1810
02:03:28,507 --> 02:03:29,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And you should, dammit.

1811
02:03:30,747 --> 02:03:31,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get more emails.

1812
02:03:32,328 --> 02:03:32,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit.

1813
02:03:33,148 --> 02:03:33,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can read them.

1814
02:03:34,749 --> 02:03:35,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit.

1815
02:03:36,229 --> 02:03:36,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Dammit.

1816
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh God, please don't.

1817
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:42,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is bad.

1818
02:03:42,991 --> 02:03:43,311
Here.

1819
02:03:52,535 --> 02:04:13,713
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raijan, which I actually still need some kind of money for.

1820
02:04:14,814 --> 02:04:15,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Very...

1821
02:04:15,735 --> 02:04:16,937
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't able to get that.

1822
02:04:17,398 --> 02:04:18,881
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't able to get that, find that.

1823
02:04:19,882 --> 02:04:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1824
02:04:20,143 --> 02:04:20,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Gone.

1825
02:04:21,525 --> 02:04:24,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key.

1826
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've lost my 18-year-old Bats Maruki chain.

1827
02:04:30,327 --> 02:04:33,109
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.

1828
02:04:33,469 --> 02:04:33,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1829
02:04:33,649 --> 02:04:33,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki...

1830
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:57,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need the people that drift into other lanes.

1831
02:04:57,832 --> 02:05:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it seems like all the time, like driving here today, there's like four or five of them.

1832
02:05:03,596 --> 02:05:06,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Like seriously, people, pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.

1833
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:10,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Like texting or just plain stupid.

1834
02:05:10,642 --> 02:05:12,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgh, I'm in another lane now.

1835
02:05:16,807 --> 02:05:21,110
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night, but today.

1836
02:05:21,370 --> 02:05:24,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And headaches can be very disabling, especially when you're really busy.

1837
02:05:24,893 --> 02:05:26,174
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1838
02:05:44,372 --> 02:06:12,095
[SPEAKER_08]: so if you did the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland it had nothing to do with Disneyland or work it was all here back at home nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip however everything happens for a reason what does it kill us makes us stronger la la la la la la la la so whatever why can't everything be perfect 24-7 damn it and easy I like easy

1839
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:14,297
[SPEAKER_08]: and Lazy.

1840
02:06:15,878 --> 02:06:17,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, also had nothing to do with VOG.

1841
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:18,080
[SPEAKER_08]: That's important.

1842
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:19,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Bobby.

1843
02:06:20,001 --> 02:06:21,462
[SPEAKER_08]: If it had something to do with VOG, you'd know.

1844
02:06:23,243 --> 02:06:24,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

1845
02:06:25,324 --> 02:06:30,487
[SPEAKER_08]: A few more news stories for you guys and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line.

1846
02:06:30,887 --> 02:06:35,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1847
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:35,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1848
02:06:36,229 --> 02:06:36,829
[SPEAKER_07]: FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii

1849
02:07:01,827 --> 02:07:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they actually, there was an article that was run on, um, Nintendo Gamer, and, uh, apparently, looking at the game, and, uh, I guess Wayne Rooney, uh, they've replaced him, um, or I guess with, uh, one of, uh, Lionel Messi, is one of the examples of just the simple changes that they did in the game.

1850
02:07:24,242 --> 02:07:27,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the games are identical, except for, you know, the cover star's been changed.

1851
02:07:28,365 --> 02:07:30,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, the title's FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.

1852
02:07:31,627 --> 02:07:42,318
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done the roster updates and changed uniforms and added the clubs that they've updated.

1853
02:07:43,539 --> 02:07:45,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from that, the game is exactly the same.

1854
02:07:47,323 --> 02:07:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of disappointing.

1855
02:07:48,965 --> 02:07:50,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they figured that no one would notice?

1856
02:07:52,406 --> 02:07:53,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, put minimal effort into it.

1857
02:07:53,928 --> 02:07:55,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll trick them, wah-ha-ha.

1858
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:59,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so very interesting.

1859
02:08:01,916 --> 02:08:09,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was, I guess, a review on the official Nintendo magazine, UK, that they were kind of talking about those as well.

1860
02:08:10,184 --> 02:08:15,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just funny.

1861
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:21,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual?

1862
02:08:21,352 --> 02:08:21,592
[SPEAKER_08]: 60 bucks?

1863
02:08:22,413 --> 02:08:24,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think.

1864
02:08:25,774 --> 02:08:26,175
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 or 40.

1865
02:08:28,716 --> 02:08:30,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's still pretty full.

1866
02:08:30,277 --> 02:08:33,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a $20 game or something like that.

1867
02:08:35,419 --> 02:08:38,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year.

1868
02:08:40,142 --> 02:08:44,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.

1869
02:08:47,506 --> 02:08:48,287
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just decent.

1870
02:08:48,507 --> 02:08:48,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bad.

1871
02:08:49,148 --> 02:08:54,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's pretty blatant that they would do that.

1872
02:08:55,376 --> 02:08:55,696
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1873
02:08:56,137 --> 02:09:01,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to this last story here, which is about... And this is one of those things where I'm like, please stop.

1874
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't.

1875
02:09:02,301 --> 02:09:02,661
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1876
02:09:02,841 --> 02:09:04,803
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody.

1877
02:09:04,963 --> 02:09:06,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to just kill the industry.

1878
02:09:06,544 --> 02:09:06,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch.

1879
02:09:08,225 --> 02:09:09,606
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about Ubisoft.

1880
02:09:10,787 --> 02:09:15,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free-to-play games for the marketplace.

1881
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:17,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that in itself is not a bad thing.

1882
02:09:18,152 --> 02:09:30,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions And yes, I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron

1883
02:09:30,878 --> 02:09:32,940
[SPEAKER_08]: on this particular article, yeah.

1884
02:09:33,641 --> 02:09:46,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free-to-play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free-to-play model.

1885
02:09:47,092 --> 02:09:50,655
[SPEAKER_08]: The next generation will offer more and more item-based content.

1886
02:09:50,996 --> 02:09:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: This will benefit our game's profitability.

1887
02:09:54,979 --> 02:09:55,480
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it won't.

1888
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:58,082
[SPEAKER_08]: When we start rejecting that bullshit...

1889
02:10:01,127 --> 02:10:03,388
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1890
02:10:04,168 --> 02:10:05,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

1891
02:10:05,348 --> 02:10:06,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible.

1892
02:10:06,929 --> 02:10:13,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character.

1893
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:15,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Level up a little faster.

1894
02:10:15,731 --> 02:10:18,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of them, this guy's, hey, here's a mission.

1895
02:10:18,172 --> 02:10:20,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get some more money for free.

1896
02:10:20,872 --> 02:10:26,154
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you find these ten things, you get all these money, all these different monies.

1897
02:10:27,194 --> 02:10:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: and um so yeah that's not a good example of um DLC also EA very notable for charging for cheats one of the one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer like you know to basically cheat and I'm sure those things sell like crazy yeah FIFA

1898
02:10:52,762 --> 02:11:11,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the DLC for the other stuff Don't encourage them, bonk

1899
02:11:11,903 --> 02:11:12,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought like two packs.

1900
02:11:13,284 --> 02:11:13,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

1901
02:11:13,845 --> 02:11:17,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs.

1902
02:11:18,148 --> 02:11:20,970
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I don't see a downside for them.

1903
02:11:21,891 --> 02:11:24,093
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to go, oh, those are terrible.

1904
02:11:24,153 --> 02:11:24,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you doing it?

1905
02:11:24,954 --> 02:11:26,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to ruin the industry.

1906
02:11:26,475 --> 02:11:27,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And then people buy them.

1907
02:11:27,796 --> 02:11:30,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why there's DLC in those games.

1908
02:11:30,358 --> 02:11:33,100
[SPEAKER_07]: The free-to-play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.

1909
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House.

1910
02:11:35,442 --> 02:11:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount thing.

1911
02:11:40,686 --> 02:11:42,267
[SPEAKER_08]: People pay $25 per amount.

1912
02:11:42,287 --> 02:11:43,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Never have done that.

1913
02:11:44,449 --> 02:11:45,410
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too much.

1914
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:46,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I know lots of people that have done it.

1915
02:11:46,631 --> 02:11:48,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.

1916
02:11:49,153 --> 02:11:49,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, you know what?

1917
02:11:49,893 --> 02:11:50,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your money.

1918
02:11:50,474 --> 02:11:51,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose.

1919
02:11:51,935 --> 02:11:55,178
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just don't... Like the price of the expansion was $40.

1920
02:11:56,479 --> 02:11:59,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion.

1921
02:11:59,761 --> 02:12:01,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get that logic at all.

1922
02:12:01,703 --> 02:12:06,907
[SPEAKER_08]: The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet.

1923
02:12:07,768 --> 02:12:08,849
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there were two charity pets.

1924
02:12:09,069 --> 02:12:09,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

1925
02:12:09,609 --> 02:12:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I've bought.

1926
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1927
02:12:11,611 --> 02:12:13,472
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a comment on the story here.

1928
02:12:14,513 --> 02:12:17,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they coined the phrase pay-to-pay.

1929
02:12:18,496 --> 02:12:20,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we're going to call these games.

1930
02:12:20,157 --> 02:12:20,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay-to-pay games.

1931
02:12:20,977 --> 02:12:21,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay-to-pay games.

1932
02:12:22,058 --> 02:12:22,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1933
02:12:22,979 --> 02:12:24,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think these should be called out.

1934
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:30,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.

1935
02:12:32,645 --> 02:13:01,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Saints Row the Third perfect example of DLC gone wrong if it's locked in the game if it's like locked costumes in the game not additional stuff that they hey we made this new character class or something like that that's just it's bullshit you shouldn't have to pay for that stuff and yes I understand you don't have to pay for it but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want

1936
02:13:02,802 --> 02:13:06,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing.

1937
02:13:06,645 --> 02:13:09,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing.

1938
02:13:11,169 --> 02:13:11,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, really?

1939
02:13:12,791 --> 02:13:13,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1940
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:19,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight.

1941
02:13:19,531 --> 02:13:20,852
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to go to the Skype line.

1942
02:13:20,892 --> 02:13:22,373
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skype line is open right now.

1943
02:13:22,393 --> 02:13:27,676
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1944
02:13:27,736 --> 02:13:29,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We will start taking calls here.

1945
02:13:29,837 --> 02:13:30,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and give us a call.

1946
02:13:31,278 --> 02:13:35,701
[SPEAKER_08]: You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about.

1947
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:37,261
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just fine as well.

1948
02:13:37,842 --> 02:13:44,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, we'll also go to our Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those.

1949
02:13:46,833 --> 02:13:50,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Loki, you'll probably have some last minute news, right?

1950
02:13:52,937 --> 02:13:53,578
[SPEAKER_07]: News?

1951
02:13:53,658 --> 02:13:55,139
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have last minute news tonight.

1952
02:13:55,899 --> 02:13:57,941
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't have any last minute news.

1953
02:13:58,241 --> 02:13:59,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

1954
02:13:59,422 --> 02:14:02,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones.

1955
02:14:03,204 --> 02:14:04,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1956
02:14:05,126 --> 02:14:05,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku here.

1957
02:14:06,166 --> 02:14:08,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's up?

1958
02:14:08,088 --> 02:14:13,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed, trying to get in one call.

1959
02:14:14,132 --> 02:14:15,593
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just wanted to bring up the...

1960
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:28,400
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week, where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.

1961
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We did talk about this in Part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?

1962
02:14:33,844 --> 02:14:39,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know, I'm kind of puzzled in the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS...

1963
02:14:40,613 --> 02:14:45,097
[SPEAKER_00]: and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms.

1964
02:14:45,958 --> 02:14:51,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, he's having a fit with Microsoft again.

1965
02:14:51,963 --> 02:14:55,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back.

1966
02:14:56,187 --> 02:15:03,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others that are just the same.

1967
02:15:04,074 --> 02:15:06,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?

1968
02:15:06,416 --> 02:15:21,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different architecture, different platform.

1969
02:15:21,829 --> 02:15:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Kettle, this is Pot.

1970
02:15:23,651 --> 02:15:28,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, that'd be great.

1971
02:15:28,955 --> 02:15:30,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop being rude, Rob.

1972
02:15:31,097 --> 02:15:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is Pot.

1973
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:33,059
[SPEAKER_08]: That's P-O-T.

1974
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:35,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Zaku.

1975
02:15:36,882 --> 02:15:38,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say black or back?

1976
02:15:39,484 --> 02:15:39,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Back.

1977
02:15:40,985 --> 02:15:42,847
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pot calling the Kettle back.

1978
02:15:43,608 --> 02:15:45,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Pot calling the Kettle black.

1979
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:46,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The phrase.

1980
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:49,553
[SPEAKER_08]: The saying is usually the Pot calling the Kettle black, but that's okay.

1981
02:15:50,526 --> 02:15:51,387
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, yeah, I get it.

1982
02:15:51,907 --> 02:15:52,627
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, 1L.

1983
02:15:52,687 --> 02:15:53,708
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get the idea.

1984
02:15:53,728 --> 02:16:10,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much, it's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically, that's what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is like the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS.

1985
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:14,323
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.

1986
02:16:14,363 --> 02:16:20,949
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in other words, he kind of likes, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of ass rape while complaining about another.

1987
02:16:22,410 --> 02:16:23,391
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what it is.

1988
02:16:23,931 --> 02:16:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed.

1989
02:16:26,674 --> 02:16:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.

1990
02:16:29,937 --> 02:16:30,657
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?

1991
02:16:31,238 --> 02:16:33,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I said the iOS platform is not really closed.

1992
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:37,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that, but they're, unless you're Google.

1993
02:16:37,103 --> 02:16:37,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1994
02:16:39,305 --> 02:17:05,680
[SPEAKER_08]: you have a different set of rules in Google Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either he contracted or somebody bought the rights to it he didn't really do it for the 360 somebody else did so is he really supporting the closed platform?

1995
02:17:06,641 --> 02:17:09,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand.

1996
02:17:09,343 --> 02:17:12,905
[SPEAKER_00]: He's representing the game itself.

1997
02:17:13,346 --> 02:17:25,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's not as relevant the fact that he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform, but in the end of the day, it's still his game, that it just went beyond PC.

1998
02:17:25,775 --> 02:17:31,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It went beyond a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.

1999
02:17:33,176 --> 02:17:43,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.

2000
02:17:43,585 --> 02:17:45,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I see the hypocrisy.

2001
02:17:45,947 --> 02:17:58,517
[SPEAKER_00]: You greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.

2002
02:18:00,749 --> 02:18:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't see where it adds up.

2003
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:03,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.

2004
02:18:05,130 --> 02:18:05,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2005
02:18:06,471 --> 02:18:08,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2006
02:18:09,871 --> 02:18:10,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

2007
02:18:10,352 --> 02:18:12,472
[SPEAKER_00]: This just came in to Kotaku today.

2008
02:18:12,492 --> 02:18:20,334
[SPEAKER_00]: 38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG won't be facing federal charges.

2009
02:18:22,214 --> 02:18:25,215
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds.

2010
02:18:27,037 --> 02:18:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.

2011
02:18:39,285 --> 02:19:08,488
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself from what I'm hearing is that Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you or really to do any professional project for you exactly

2012
02:19:10,456 --> 02:19:10,836
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

2013
02:19:10,896 --> 02:19:28,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, at the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who worked their asses off at the studios trying, you know, on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.

2014
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:30,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them have been held accountable.

2015
02:19:31,142 --> 02:19:35,863
[SPEAKER_00]: In that sense, they just walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.

2016
02:19:36,314 --> 02:19:40,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?

2017
02:19:42,315 --> 02:19:50,080
[SPEAKER_00]: People's Court would have been better, but... I think, yeah, there's gonna be... I'm not surprised that there'll be, like, lawsuits over this.

2018
02:19:50,560 --> 02:20:01,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Curt Schilling, I don't... I mean, he's off the... He's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.

2019
02:20:02,087 --> 02:20:12,013
[SPEAKER_00]: One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just gonna, like, gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't, like, making payroll...

2020
02:20:14,765 --> 02:20:20,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities.

2021
02:20:22,149 --> 02:20:26,111
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.

2022
02:20:28,072 --> 02:20:31,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much.

2023
02:20:31,435 --> 02:20:31,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

2024
02:20:31,775 --> 02:20:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

2025
02:20:33,096 --> 02:20:35,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2026
02:20:35,338 --> 02:20:39,161
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to call.

2027
02:20:40,082 --> 02:20:40,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Just missed one.

2028
02:20:41,663 --> 02:20:44,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes people call and wait and hope to get through.

2029
02:20:44,205 --> 02:20:45,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I just missed it.

2030
02:20:45,666 --> 02:20:46,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

2031
02:20:47,327 --> 02:20:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2032
02:20:48,567 --> 02:20:51,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing.

2033
02:20:52,088 --> 02:20:52,829
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have pinged out too.

2034
02:20:52,849 --> 02:20:53,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did too.

2035
02:20:53,569 --> 02:20:56,890
[SPEAKER_08]: For like, oh man, it pisses me off.

2036
02:20:56,930 --> 02:21:01,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to see the comments in chat to the call me back comment.

2037
02:21:01,792 --> 02:21:05,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see one from Actdeft that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.

2038
02:21:08,994 --> 02:21:10,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2039
02:21:10,295 --> 02:21:10,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2040
02:21:11,496 --> 02:21:11,976
[SPEAKER_03]: What up, guys?

2041
02:21:12,056 --> 02:21:13,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Xeno from the OKC.

2042
02:21:13,197 --> 02:21:13,738
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys doing?

2043
02:21:13,778 --> 02:21:14,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Xenocore.

2044
02:21:14,519 --> 02:21:15,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Haven't heard from you in a while.

2045
02:21:15,379 --> 02:21:15,860
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

2046
02:21:16,801 --> 02:21:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, staying employed.

2047
02:21:18,362 --> 02:21:19,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Same old, same old.

2048
02:21:19,143 --> 02:21:19,903
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

2049
02:21:19,943 --> 02:21:20,704
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2050
02:21:21,405 --> 02:21:23,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a bit of Planetside 2, actually.

2051
02:21:24,347 --> 02:21:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, all right.

2052
02:21:25,168 --> 02:21:25,988
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that going for you?

2053
02:21:26,669 --> 02:21:31,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this.

2054
02:21:31,814 --> 02:21:33,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, every single base is different.

2055
02:21:33,855 --> 02:21:39,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game's going to be free on release, so why not?

2056
02:21:40,834 --> 02:21:42,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, this is a totally free game?

2057
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:46,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.

2058
02:21:46,878 --> 02:21:48,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, of course, of course.

2059
02:21:48,459 --> 02:21:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how things are going.

2060
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?

2061
02:21:58,886 --> 02:22:03,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ubisoft, I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.

2062
02:22:06,101 --> 02:22:11,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not realize that Planetside was originally 2003, the first one.

2063
02:22:11,263 --> 02:22:12,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really old.

2064
02:22:12,724 --> 02:22:15,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making at E3 2001 when I went.

2065
02:22:16,505 --> 02:22:17,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looked damn good then.

2066
02:22:18,626 --> 02:22:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just the playability and everything else.

2067
02:22:20,487 --> 02:22:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?

2068
02:22:24,388 --> 02:22:27,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up.

2069
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:30,731
[SPEAKER_03]: They got at least three years with the development of this one based on what it looks like.

2070
02:22:31,252 --> 02:22:34,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?

2071
02:22:35,093 --> 02:22:36,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's closed beta right now.

2072
02:22:36,433 --> 02:22:37,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, okay, I gotcha.

2073
02:22:37,574 --> 02:22:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can buy your way in.

2074
02:22:38,914 --> 02:22:45,436
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.

2075
02:22:45,696 --> 02:22:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2076
02:22:46,216 --> 02:22:49,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.

2077
02:22:50,017 --> 02:22:52,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is it that draws you to Planet Psy?

2078
02:22:52,378 --> 02:22:54,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day.

2079
02:22:54,779 --> 02:22:59,100
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it that draws you to this game versus... Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?

2080
02:23:00,496 --> 02:23:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly.

2081
02:23:01,897 --> 02:23:04,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the first Planetside, played Earth and Beyond.

2082
02:23:04,538 --> 02:23:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a whole bunch of that, my son.

2083
02:23:05,859 --> 02:23:09,721
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi, planet-y space games.

2084
02:23:09,801 --> 02:23:10,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a thing?

2085
02:23:11,262 --> 02:23:13,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's one of my things, yeah.

2086
02:23:13,483 --> 02:23:13,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2087
02:23:13,983 --> 02:23:14,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, I think that's cool.

2088
02:23:14,984 --> 02:23:16,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I just noticed that little trend going on there.

2089
02:23:16,944 --> 02:23:20,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what is it about Planetside specifically that draws you to that series?

2090
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:23,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like a full military...

2091
02:23:24,386 --> 02:23:28,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually use some of the stuff I learned piloting, doing air support, so.

2092
02:23:51,194 --> 02:23:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.

2093
02:23:57,218 --> 02:24:03,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this.

2094
02:24:03,722 --> 02:24:04,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea.

2095
02:24:05,162 --> 02:24:12,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal...

2096
02:24:12,987 --> 02:24:18,315
[SPEAKER_08]: that the sequel's title was Planetside Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.

2097
02:24:18,975 --> 02:24:22,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?

2098
02:24:24,102 --> 02:24:24,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's depressed.

2099
02:24:26,165 --> 02:24:26,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait a minute.

2100
02:24:26,706 --> 02:24:27,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a live journal.

2101
02:24:27,407 --> 02:24:27,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut up.

2102
02:24:29,389 --> 02:24:31,771
[SPEAKER_08]: He just recently posted to it too, August 11th, 2012.

2103
02:24:32,091 --> 02:24:36,434
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.

2104
02:24:36,974 --> 02:24:39,496
[SPEAKER_08]: PlanetSide 2, what is it and why do I want to play it?

2105
02:24:40,336 --> 02:24:44,319
[SPEAKER_08]: PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE.

2106
02:24:44,759 --> 02:24:49,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.

2107
02:24:49,963 --> 02:24:54,006
[SPEAKER_08]: When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.

2108
02:24:55,186 --> 02:24:59,129
[SPEAKER_08]: All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles with

2109
02:24:59,229 --> 02:24:59,589
[SPEAKER_08]: StarCraft 2

2110
02:25:19,887 --> 02:25:21,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry.

2111
02:25:21,967 --> 02:25:25,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very interesting way to put out your press releases.

2112
02:25:25,228 --> 02:25:27,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.

2113
02:25:28,649 --> 02:25:29,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to know.

2114
02:25:30,009 --> 02:25:32,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?

2115
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:42,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC.

2116
02:25:43,832 --> 02:25:44,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really loving FTL.

2117
02:25:44,832 --> 02:25:45,872
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's freaking amazing.

2118
02:25:46,292 --> 02:25:47,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dark Souls.

2119
02:25:47,212 --> 02:25:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

2120
02:25:48,113 --> 02:25:49,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is ruthless.

2121
02:25:50,194 --> 02:25:52,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, as all games should be.

2122
02:25:52,856 --> 02:25:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: This Namby Pamby, you know, you level twice so you win bull crap.

2123
02:25:59,002 --> 02:26:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.

2124
02:26:03,666 --> 02:26:06,568
[SPEAKER_08]: You press the button in time with the music, you win an internet.

2125
02:26:07,069 --> 02:26:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

2126
02:26:07,889 --> 02:26:08,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw that.

2127
02:26:09,891 --> 02:26:12,173
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2128
02:26:12,733 --> 02:26:13,654
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's pretty much it.

2129
02:26:13,674 --> 02:26:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all have a good show.

2130
02:26:14,795 --> 02:26:15,416
[SPEAKER_08]: You too, buddy.

2131
02:26:15,456 --> 02:26:15,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

2132
02:26:15,856 --> 02:26:16,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a stranger.

2133
02:26:17,017 --> 02:26:17,478
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, later.

2134
02:26:17,658 --> 02:26:17,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2135
02:26:19,449 --> 02:26:21,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight.

2136
02:26:21,851 --> 02:26:22,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2137
02:26:22,852 --> 02:26:23,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2138
02:26:24,133 --> 02:26:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shane.

2139
02:26:25,114 --> 02:26:25,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Shane.

2140
02:26:25,674 --> 02:26:26,154
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

2141
02:26:26,775 --> 02:26:27,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well.

2142
02:26:27,676 --> 02:26:29,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have fun on the live hoard house this week?

2143
02:26:30,418 --> 02:26:32,780
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was too distracted playing WoW.

2144
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:33,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

2145
02:26:34,221 --> 02:26:34,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2146
02:26:34,621 --> 02:26:35,582
[SPEAKER_08]: How's WoW going for you?

2147
02:26:36,402 --> 02:26:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90.

2148
02:26:41,166 --> 02:26:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else ever.

2149
02:26:47,211 --> 02:26:48,472
[SPEAKER_08]: What level is your main pet?

2150
02:26:49,584 --> 02:26:51,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep rotating all of them out.

2151
02:26:52,085 --> 02:26:54,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now.

2152
02:26:55,405 --> 02:26:57,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got like almost 100 pets.

2153
02:26:57,146 --> 02:26:57,786
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the name?

2154
02:26:58,006 --> 02:27:00,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my, you've leveled all of your pets to 5?

2155
02:27:01,006 --> 02:27:01,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to.

2156
02:27:02,026 --> 02:27:03,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got maybe about 10 of them done.

2157
02:27:04,787 --> 02:27:05,767
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you name your pets?

2158
02:27:05,807 --> 02:27:06,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you custom name all your pets?

2159
02:27:07,548 --> 02:27:09,928
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.

2160
02:27:10,708 --> 02:27:13,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been naming mine after Mass Effect characters.

2161
02:27:14,089 --> 02:27:14,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine are better.

2162
02:27:15,453 --> 02:27:18,574
[SPEAKER_02]: No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?

2163
02:27:18,694 --> 02:27:19,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make sense.

2164
02:27:19,974 --> 02:27:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I don't know.

2165
02:27:21,415 --> 02:27:23,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.

2166
02:27:23,895 --> 02:27:25,356
[SPEAKER_08]: You named your dog Helo?

2167
02:27:26,256 --> 02:27:28,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but that's adorable.

2168
02:27:30,737 --> 02:27:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Rob, did I tell you I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character?

2169
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:37,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?

2170
02:27:37,499 --> 02:27:37,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuddles.

2171
02:27:38,179 --> 02:27:39,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuddles, aw.

2172
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:41,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I named my high gel cub Cuddles.

2173
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:44,002
[SPEAKER_08]: and didn't, didn't, what was Shane's?

2174
02:27:44,022 --> 02:27:45,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane had a cute character name too.

2175
02:27:45,464 --> 02:27:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like Fluffles.

2176
02:27:46,465 --> 02:27:46,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Fluffles.

2177
02:27:47,106 --> 02:27:47,607
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it.

2178
02:27:48,167 --> 02:27:48,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2179
02:27:48,388 --> 02:27:50,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Well maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.

2180
02:27:50,991 --> 02:27:51,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there you go.

2181
02:27:51,852 --> 02:27:52,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane, would that be happy for you?

2182
02:27:53,493 --> 02:27:55,635
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2183
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:17,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop judging me.

2184
02:28:18,663 --> 02:28:19,324
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

2185
02:28:19,344 --> 02:28:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I told Rob to stop judging me.

2186
02:28:21,627 --> 02:28:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.

2187
02:28:25,232 --> 02:28:26,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a headache.

2188
02:28:27,952 --> 02:28:30,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.

2189
02:28:30,653 --> 02:28:32,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been leveling my character.

2190
02:28:32,454 --> 02:28:35,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.

2191
02:28:35,856 --> 02:28:37,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?

2192
02:28:38,757 --> 02:28:40,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it D Space?

2193
02:28:40,558 --> 02:28:40,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2194
02:28:41,138 --> 02:28:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not.

2195
02:28:44,279 --> 02:28:46,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was like number six on the list of things it found.

2196
02:28:46,781 --> 02:28:48,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't make any sense to me.

2197
02:28:48,601 --> 02:28:52,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it picked up ReRave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.

2198
02:28:52,783 --> 02:28:53,784
[SPEAKER_08]: ReRave's not bad.

2199
02:28:54,451 --> 02:28:54,911
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

2200
02:28:55,131 --> 02:28:55,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it is.

2201
02:28:56,351 --> 02:28:57,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But DJ Max is better.

2202
02:28:58,952 --> 02:29:02,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.

2203
02:29:03,273 --> 02:29:04,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it just stretches.

2204
02:29:04,533 --> 02:29:07,873
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad.

2205
02:29:07,933 --> 02:29:10,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just so freaking good.

2206
02:29:10,894 --> 02:29:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it.

2207
02:29:14,554 --> 02:29:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't quit playing that as well.

2208
02:29:17,175 --> 02:29:19,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now, too.

2209
02:29:20,435 --> 02:29:21,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get yelled at again.

2210
02:29:22,336 --> 02:29:23,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not buying this game.

2211
02:29:24,861 --> 02:29:25,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

2212
02:29:25,542 --> 02:29:26,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't buy it.

2213
02:29:26,522 --> 02:29:27,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give in to him.

2214
02:29:27,263 --> 02:29:27,823
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a jerk.

2215
02:29:28,164 --> 02:29:38,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free unless you want the song packs and you can get a pretty good deal like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out and then you get some extra note skin.

2216
02:29:38,832 --> 02:29:41,694
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?

2217
02:29:42,094 --> 02:29:42,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2218
02:29:42,554 --> 02:29:43,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds stupid.

2219
02:29:43,375 --> 02:29:44,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Get DJ Maxx.

2220
02:29:46,224 --> 02:29:48,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The little anime chick, she commands me.

2221
02:29:48,045 --> 02:29:49,205
[SPEAKER_05]: The anime chick wants a dollar.

2222
02:29:49,285 --> 02:29:50,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy it, Rob.

2223
02:29:50,466 --> 02:29:54,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give in to the... I don't see DJ... I seriously... Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps.

2224
02:29:55,028 --> 02:29:59,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?

2225
02:30:00,190 --> 02:30:00,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2226
02:30:01,131 --> 02:30:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to her.

2227
02:30:02,632 --> 02:30:04,412
[SPEAKER_08]: How many years has it been?

2228
02:30:04,893 --> 02:30:05,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

2229
02:30:06,874 --> 02:30:07,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I got it.

2230
02:30:07,554 --> 02:30:08,854
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Max Ray, right?

2231
02:30:09,255 --> 02:30:09,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2232
02:30:09,655 --> 02:30:12,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?

2233
02:30:13,459 --> 02:30:15,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?

2234
02:30:15,102 --> 02:30:17,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I agree three times.

2235
02:30:18,788 --> 02:30:20,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.

2236
02:30:21,468 --> 02:30:23,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure to create an account too.

2237
02:30:23,169 --> 02:30:24,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes like two seconds.

2238
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise.

2239
02:30:33,097 --> 02:30:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really sucks if you do that with the purchasing thing.

2240
02:30:36,739 --> 02:30:37,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand.

2241
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:41,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says the terms and conditions have changed.

2242
02:30:41,683 --> 02:30:42,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard that.

2243
02:30:42,284 --> 02:30:43,645
[SPEAKER_08]: The conditions have changed!

2244
02:30:48,608 --> 02:30:50,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.

2245
02:30:52,366 --> 02:30:54,587
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some kind of dumb over there right now.

2246
02:30:55,988 --> 02:30:56,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, Rob.

2247
02:30:56,408 --> 02:30:57,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.

2248
02:30:59,690 --> 02:31:02,331
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.

2249
02:31:02,351 --> 02:31:06,673
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.

2250
02:31:07,353 --> 02:31:08,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the Jane Shepard.

2251
02:31:08,334 --> 02:31:11,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.

2252
02:31:12,476 --> 02:31:13,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually a little surprised too.

2253
02:31:13,576 --> 02:31:19,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.

2254
02:31:21,747 --> 02:31:23,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find the title that I'm looking for.

2255
02:31:25,469 --> 02:31:25,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

2256
02:31:49,719 --> 02:31:52,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to agree to these change conditions.

2257
02:31:52,702 --> 02:31:55,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't shut down my iPad.

2258
02:31:55,085 --> 02:31:59,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.

2259
02:32:00,691 --> 02:32:01,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

2260
02:32:02,172 --> 02:32:02,873
[SPEAKER_04]: No one asked you.

2261
02:32:05,095 --> 02:32:06,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually trying it on my phone.

2262
02:32:06,577 --> 02:32:11,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Raydeer in our chatroom says, it's Tapsonic, but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.

2263
02:32:11,533 --> 02:32:12,794
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.

2264
02:32:12,934 --> 02:32:21,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got, well, I mean, it's all real DJ Max music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.

2265
02:32:21,118 --> 02:32:22,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?

2266
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:26,842
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's freaking DJ Max.

2267
02:32:27,302 --> 02:32:30,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.

2268
02:32:33,265 --> 02:32:34,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's that app.

2269
02:32:34,066 --> 02:32:36,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.

2270
02:32:37,548 --> 02:32:37,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

2271
02:32:38,288 --> 02:32:39,929
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, what else did you want to talk about tonight?

2272
02:32:42,247 --> 02:32:46,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mostly going to talk about DJ Max and then some stupidity happened.

2273
02:32:47,411 --> 02:32:48,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about DJ Max.

2274
02:32:48,391 --> 02:32:50,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Max that you didn't get out there?

2275
02:32:51,451 --> 02:33:15,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts and then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability and then there are, I want to say, five more packs

2276
02:33:16,141 --> 02:33:17,221
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of songs that you can get.

2277
02:33:17,301 --> 02:33:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.

2278
02:33:22,503 --> 02:33:23,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, really good.

2279
02:33:24,244 --> 02:33:25,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should get it that can.

2280
02:33:27,385 --> 02:33:30,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.

2281
02:33:32,067 --> 02:33:33,067
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, sounds good.

2282
02:33:33,687 --> 02:33:35,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still pet battling.

2283
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pokemon is this week.

2284
02:33:36,908 --> 02:33:39,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.

2285
02:33:39,789 --> 02:33:42,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're just going to be like the happiest person ever.

2286
02:33:42,310 --> 02:33:43,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Christmas for you.

2287
02:33:43,410 --> 02:33:44,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this week is great.

2288
02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:47,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, congratulations.

2289
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:48,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2290
02:33:48,060 --> 02:33:50,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.

2291
02:33:50,903 --> 02:33:52,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I was having a good week.

2292
02:33:52,244 --> 02:33:52,585
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2293
02:33:52,985 --> 02:33:54,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.

2294
02:33:55,187 --> 02:33:55,487
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2295
02:33:55,527 --> 02:33:55,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Go end it.

2296
02:33:55,908 --> 02:33:56,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2297
02:33:57,887 --> 02:34:00,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let me... Oh, I gotta go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.

2298
02:34:01,009 --> 02:34:02,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to all those that called in tonight.

2299
02:34:02,369 --> 02:34:04,330
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't get through, tough.

2300
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:05,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Try again next week.

2301
02:34:05,971 --> 02:34:08,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Or send us an email with your thoughts.

2302
02:34:08,732 --> 02:34:12,654
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR OrangeRite wanted to point out in the chatroom about DJ Max.

2303
02:34:12,774 --> 02:34:15,376
[SPEAKER_08]: It's key-sounded and that is pretty important as well.

2304
02:34:15,436 --> 02:34:18,357
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music.

2305
02:34:18,777 --> 02:34:21,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Like some other apps that are out there, it actually does have the key sounds in it.

2306
02:34:22,559 --> 02:34:25,481
[SPEAKER_08]: That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.

2307
02:34:26,261 --> 02:34:29,102
[SPEAKER_08]: It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.

2308
02:34:31,163 --> 02:34:35,945
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight, and he sent us some tweets about this one.

2309
02:34:36,006 --> 02:34:41,008
[SPEAKER_08]: First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.

2310
02:34:41,508 --> 02:34:47,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out?

2311
02:34:47,531 --> 02:34:47,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2312
02:34:48,453 --> 02:34:50,474
[SPEAKER_07]: There are quite a few, two this year.

2313
02:34:51,014 --> 02:34:53,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I think two, was there two last year?

2314
02:34:54,135 --> 02:34:54,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there's been a few.

2315
02:34:54,975 --> 02:34:58,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Lego Harry Potter 2 last year, and Lego Star Wars last year.

2316
02:34:58,516 --> 02:35:00,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.

2317
02:35:00,336 --> 02:35:02,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Lego Lord of the Rings is this year.

2318
02:35:02,137 --> 02:35:05,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, three if you include that Lego City stories.

2319
02:35:05,858 --> 02:35:10,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.

2320
02:35:10,820 --> 02:35:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've already had Lego Batman 2.

2321
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:13,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2322
02:35:13,701 --> 02:35:17,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.

2323
02:35:18,583 --> 02:35:25,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute, strategic, and competitive point of view.

2324
02:35:26,207 --> 02:35:29,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.

2325
02:35:29,449 --> 02:35:30,449
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always something new.

2326
02:35:30,489 --> 02:35:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always something different.

2327
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:39,294
[SPEAKER_08]: We're always looking to add different layers, whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which we'll have the luxury of having over the next few years.

2328
02:35:39,654 --> 02:36:07,959
[SPEAKER_08]: so it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance of fruits and vegetables alright let me see I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here and it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games and the quote he pulled there is you run the company like you're in danger of starving I guess this has to do with the high stress nature of running a game company

2329
02:36:09,039 --> 02:36:10,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see.

2330
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:17,484
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a quote in, uh, Edge Online in the magazine E246.

2331
02:36:18,724 --> 02:36:26,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.

2332
02:36:26,689 --> 02:36:31,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.

2333
02:36:32,451 --> 02:36:35,413
[SPEAKER_08]: When Platinum Games started in 2006, it had 50 staff.

2334
02:36:35,793 --> 02:36:38,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Six years, it had 200 if you counted the contractors.

2335
02:36:42,316 --> 02:36:45,637
[SPEAKER_08]: The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer, Capcom.

2336
02:36:45,917 --> 02:36:52,180
[SPEAKER_08]: The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.

2337
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:56,281
[SPEAKER_08]: But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.

2338
02:36:56,621 --> 02:36:59,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4.

2339
02:37:00,242 --> 02:37:01,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Just an enormous amount of people.

2340
02:37:02,243 --> 02:37:03,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't help them, did it?

2341
02:37:04,704 --> 02:37:05,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, snap.

2342
02:37:06,224 --> 02:37:13,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that comment from an article on edgeonline.com sent to us via Twitter by Tigerclaw.

2343
02:37:13,506 --> 02:37:15,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2344
02:37:18,318 --> 02:37:22,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?

2345
02:37:24,967 --> 02:37:26,629
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't see anything that stood out.

2346
02:37:27,677 --> 02:37:28,918
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2347
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:51,180
[SPEAKER_08]: But not next week.

2348
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over OLR.

2349
02:37:53,461 --> 02:37:54,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I choose the gay.

2350
02:37:54,842 --> 02:37:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going this year.

2351
02:37:56,063 --> 02:37:56,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of sad.

2352
02:37:56,963 --> 02:37:58,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I choose a lot of gay.

2353
02:37:58,725 --> 02:37:59,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Send me pictures.

2354
02:38:00,206 --> 02:38:00,926
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sea of Red.

2355
02:38:02,207 --> 02:38:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Have fun.

2356
02:38:03,208 --> 02:38:03,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Your final thought tonight.

2357
02:38:03,968 --> 02:38:05,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to wear my OLR shirt.

2358
02:38:05,769 --> 02:38:06,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.

2359
02:38:06,290 --> 02:38:07,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2360
02:38:07,210 --> 02:38:08,731
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't get the VOG one this time.

2361
02:38:09,031 --> 02:38:14,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my red and black OLR shirt that Kristen and I had done way back when.

2362
02:38:14,995 --> 02:38:17,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have hit my first goal.

2363
02:38:18,498 --> 02:38:20,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.

2364
02:38:20,379 --> 02:38:20,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

2365
02:38:21,099 --> 02:38:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2366
02:38:21,559 --> 02:38:21,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Good news.

2367
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:24,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So my message is actually very important.

2368
02:38:25,201 --> 02:38:26,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Spay and neuter your cats.

2369
02:38:27,902 --> 02:38:28,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Bob Barker.

2370
02:38:30,642 --> 02:38:33,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?

2371
02:38:33,183 --> 02:38:35,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.

2372
02:38:35,424 --> 02:38:36,264
[SPEAKER_08]: You poor soul.

2373
02:38:36,304 --> 02:38:36,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great show.

2374
02:38:36,924 --> 02:38:38,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I did back in the 80s.

2375
02:38:38,605 --> 02:38:39,385
[SPEAKER_08]: You said it back in the 80s.

2376
02:38:39,405 --> 02:38:40,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't remember because I didn't care.

2377
02:38:42,346 --> 02:38:45,827
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, rescue a cat.

2378
02:38:45,987 --> 02:38:47,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone go out and rescue a cat.

2379
02:38:49,085 --> 02:38:50,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're allergic to cats.

2380
02:38:50,466 --> 02:38:51,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Then take some Benadryl.

2381
02:38:51,427 --> 02:38:52,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Rescue dog.

2382
02:38:52,689 --> 02:38:54,250
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki, your final thought.

2383
02:38:54,470 --> 02:38:56,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never rescued enough cats.

2384
02:38:56,753 --> 02:38:57,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Had 11 at one time.

2385
02:38:59,420 --> 02:38:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of cats.

2386
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:01,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I didn't feed them and they went away.

2387
02:39:01,801 --> 02:39:02,642
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I think they did.

2388
02:39:02,882 --> 02:39:04,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're waiting in the shadows.

2389
02:39:05,323 --> 02:39:06,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Waiting to hunt me down.

2390
02:39:07,644 --> 02:39:15,088
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.

2391
02:39:15,408 --> 02:39:15,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2392
02:39:15,709 --> 02:39:17,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.

2393
02:39:17,249 --> 02:39:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.

2394
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:19,771
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really good.

2395
02:39:19,831 --> 02:39:21,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had Pinkberry last night.

2396
02:39:21,071 --> 02:39:21,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2397
02:39:21,431 --> 02:39:21,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go get some.

2398
02:39:22,592 --> 02:39:23,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it.

2399
02:39:23,872 --> 02:39:25,873
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2400
02:39:26,173 --> 02:39:28,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys as always for supporting Independent Radio.

2401
02:39:28,293 --> 02:39:31,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if you liked Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show.

2402
02:39:31,534 --> 02:39:34,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Word of mouth is all we have to promote ourselves.

2403
02:39:34,435 --> 02:39:36,895
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2404
02:39:36,935 --> 02:39:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I believe podcast award nominations open up this week, so for your consideration.

2405
02:39:43,897 --> 02:39:44,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there you go.

2406
02:39:44,937 --> 02:39:45,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2407
02:39:45,297 --> 02:39:46,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week, everybody.

2408
02:39:46,199 --> 02:39:46,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week.

2409
02:39:47,061 --> 02:39:52,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Same bat time, same bat channel without DarkSakura, but another supervillain will be taking her place.

2410
02:39:52,914 --> 02:39:53,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week.

2411
02:39:54,221 --> 02:39:57,243
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2412
02:39:57,884 --> 02:40:02,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2413
02:40:02,687 --> 02:40:11,553
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, tune in to VOGnetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

2414
02:40:12,193 --> 02:40:23,621
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
