14274	26179	Tonight, September 16, 2012, the Wii U launch details are official, Zynga files a counterclaim against EA, and is Microsoft planning an immersive display experience for their next console?
31348	36532	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36612	43237	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 473 for Sunday, September 16th, 2012.
44818	53084	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and gaming lols with my co-hosts,
53684	57046	Not with us tonight, sadly, the one, the only, DarkSakura.
57086	58066	She has the night off.
58146	59967	It is a holiday in her religion.
60188	63129	So a happy Rosh Hashanah to those of you that celebrate it.
63769	67051	We do have here tonight, though, in studio, Tech Master Loki joining us.
67231	67491	Hello.
67671	68252	How are you, Loki?
68472	69152	I'm doing all right.
69392	69713	Awesome.
70073	76716	And joining us in Jamie's absence, always a wonderful standby guest host we're happy to have here, as if he had a choice.
77156	78157	Say hello to Alan.
78517	78857	Hello.
79057	79718	How are you doing, Alan?
79798	80058	Good.
80378	81479	What's new with you lately?
82219	82559	Not much.
82699	83380	Working a lot.
83560	83820	Yeah?
84320	87002	Have you had time for any hobbies outside of video gaming and work?
87262	87443	No.
87763	87983	No?
88163	88363	No.
88523	89664	What else do you do on the interwebs?
89944	90385	Tumblrs.
91005	91445	Tumblrs?
91465	92346	You're a big Tumblr fan?
92386	92606	Yes.
94127	95028	Why do you like Tumblr?
95348	96729	I have a hard time getting into Tumblr.
97069	102513	Because for like funny reaction gifs and fandom stuff and screenshots, that's where everyone gets into that.
102973	109299	There was an amazing gif I saw on Tumblr last night that said starships are meant to fly.
109699	112502	And it was an old lady going up one of those moving chairs.
113182	114223	I guess you had to see it.
114263	114503	All right.
115404	115725	Anyhow.
115745	115925	All right.
115945	118407	We'll talk to Alan more as the show goes on.
118747	123710	We do, of course, tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOG Network.
123990	126051	VOGnetwork.com is the place to be.
126611	131113	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
131234	133155	Another quality show from Bobby tonight.
133215	137437	And we even got into a little bit of a debate at the end there on a topic we'll be talking about here shortly.
137857	142119	You can check that out at VOGnetwork.com when Bobby posts his show very soon.
142179	143540	But you should be participating live.
143900	151247	You can also participate with us and chat in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com where we have some good well wishes tonight.
151507	154550	Ranma saying L'chaim, SSJ100Mad, Happy New Year.
154650	158153	So some other well wishes there for those celebrating the holiday today.
158717	159798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
178588	179529	I want to start with this clip.
179549	180349	It's a two-minute clip.
180469	186153	This is a clip from our show, episode 463, from July 1st.
186353	187153	Let's go to the clip.
187653	190995	The Wii U, I think, is a reasonable price.
191176	193817	It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.
193897	196479	There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with.
197399	198320	What's in those SKUs?
198600	199120	No idea.
199701	202662	What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.
203063	205764	So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99.
208426	209307	So, there's that.
209627	215430	The next price up, $299.99, and then $349.99 are the three different price points.
215891	219173	Here's my thoughts on what they are, because this is completely speculative.
219253	221154	I don't know for a fact this is what it is.
221994	222074	Um...
223536	228922	249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.
229502	237051	So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now, you have all those Wii remotes and... Go on the online shop and enjoy.
237191	238272	Yeah, nunchucks...
239053	239313	Done.
239453	239893	There you go.
239973	240894	You've got a system.
240974	246176	You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.
246196	257341	$299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii Remote Plus and an Unchuck, kind of like the Wii had.
257441	266829	And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the GamePad controller, the Wii Remote Plus, the Nunchuck, and another pack-in game.
266929	269651	Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land.
270331	274695	It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.
274975	278237	Honestly, I do not think they're launching the system with two gamepads.
278418	279819	Because there's no games that support it.
279859	282120	And people will be like, it won't sell.
282580	285923	That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads.
285963	288264	But right now, it's absolutely useless to do that.
288445	289866	Which is why they're not going to do that.
290086	297311	Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September.
297391	298712	But there are the price points.
298852	301454	Release date is probably going to be the 18th of November.
302194	302995	So that's that.
303355	304476	I think it's somewhat reasonable.
305834	306695	That again, a clip.
306895	307255	It's done.
307275	310377	The clip was from episode 463 on July 1st, 2012.
311558	313240	Let me start by applauding you.
313500	315001	Honestly, clap, clap, clap.
315902	317703	Show me anyone else that was that close.
318123	318864	Was it perfect?
319004	319224	No.
319384	320625	You did make one major flaw.
320745	321726	Let's talk about the flaw.
322146	323067	Where was the difference?
323407	326089	Obviously, $299, $349 ended up being legit.
326129	327390	You called multiple SKUs.
327710	330152	The we did not, well, multiple bundles.
330412	331853	People don't like it when you say SKU.
332314	333835	Multiple bundles, you called that.
333955	334796	We didn't have that.
335799	337800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
355487	358188	It's just too confusing for the populace.
358488	363750	That's why they only launched with two SKUs for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
364431	367052	No one does more than two SKUs because it's too confusing.
368492	371113	I also think they can't get the cost that low.
371554	374235	They couldn't get the cost of the system to be $249.
374595	376636	So they just dropped that bottom SKU.
377816	379797	I think that's why they haven't announced the price yet.
381203	382424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
404822	406303	That's a lot higher than I would have thought.
406483	410545	Because to me, that thing isn't much more than the bottom half of a DS, except a little bigger.
410605	411686	Let's say a DS XL.
412066	413987	I guess maybe it's a little bigger than that, too.
414448	417009	I was kind of surprised it's got to go that high.
417470	422333	And that certainly would set off a chain of events that would cause the 249 bundle to get eliminated.
422533	427096	Well, even their reasoning behind not having remotes and nunchucks in there, they're like, well, there's 10...
427867	429990	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
447571	448432	WeMotionPlus enabled remote pluses.
471591	477976	But, I think, like I said, that they cut the bottom skew just because they couldn't get the price cheap enough.
479157	490646	Well, still, I mean, despite the fact that, you know, that part didn't end up being true, and you even said in that clip, you were kind of pulling what was in those bundles out of your ass, and you still kind of got the 349 one right.
490786	498892	You were pretty, I mean, there's a part in that clip I cut out where I went on this, I'm like, I think the 349 bundle will have two Wii tablets and da-da-da.
498912	499453	What was I wrong?
499473	501174	That's another reason why you're not, well,
501314	503775	We're not seeing two tablets because, one, no game support.
503815	513441	You're not seeing them sell the tablets separately because, once again, well, not here, because people will be confused and they'll think, oh, this is just an add-on for the Wii.
513541	514441	I'm going to buy the tablet.
514461	516703	And they go home and it doesn't fucking work in my Wii.
517223	518504	Why does this work?
518524	519924	This tablet's the Wii U, right?
521005	522246	No, it's not.
522366	529670	So you just have to think about the consumer and whether they're going to be confused by what you're trying to sell to them.
530419	535643	Giovedea agrees with you in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and puts it into slightly different words.
536023	538464	The second-hand market comes from people upgrading as well.
538765	542307	You need those parts even if you upgrade, so there isn't going to be a huge market.
542447	543188	I suppose that's true.
543268	548071	People are going to need those Wiimotes and things for the new system if they want to play all the games.
548391	556937	Nintendo Land, the pack-in game, that's the weird thing to me, that it isn't coming with another Wiimote, because doesn't Nintendo Land's minigames kind of require those Wiimotes?
556957	557637	I think they're all multiple.
559917	569059	We play Wii Sports, whatever.
569079	575680	It's basically tech demos to get you familiar with how you use the controllers and stuff like that.
576401	579421	But it's also a multiplayer game.
579841	583002	So if you buy it for your kid or something like that and you don't have a Wii...
584264	585245	Well, sucks to be you.
585265	589888	You're not going to be playing very much of it because you've got to go get those extra controllers and stuff.
591089	597834	And it gets confusing, I think, because you've got all these different control methods with this thing.
597854	606961	You've got the remotes, the nunchucks, the classic controllers, the pro controllers, this tablet thing.
607001	609883	You've got the balance board and...
611505	613565	Just figuring out what you need for each game.
613626	614146	It's ridiculous.
614166	615586	Oh, nunchucks with everything, too.
616526	618007	It's just going to get confusing.
619227	620007	It's interesting.
621427	622127	There is a lot.
622167	624328	There's a lot of peripherals over in Nintendo land.
624448	625068	That's for sure.
625668	636311	Chris109 in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, My sister was thinking that the Wii U pad was just an add-on and that you write a U next to the... And it got cut off, but I'm assuming next to the word Wii.
637711	666942	so maybe not everybody is Jimmy Fallon I was going to reference that clip too there was that big clip a couple months ago where even Jimmy Fallon didn't get it and Reggie had to kind of hold on it's a whole new system but you can sit there and be a skeptic I can sit there and be a skeptic I'm not sure where Alan's at but we'll ask him in a little bit the fact of the matter is pre-orders are going fast as we have a story coming up later as we have to take the word from Nintendo that they're going fast well if you try to go to GameStop yourself they're not going to give you one right now
667222	670024	Well, that's because Nintendo tells GameStop how many they can sell.
671004	672165	But we don't know what that number is.
673906	674406	Of course not.
674586	676587	Because they want to make it sound like it's in high demand.
676767	677608	Like they do with the Wii.
677628	682311	Remember all those artificial... I'm sorry, real-life shortages.
682811	685412	Totally not artificial shortages whatsoever.
685592	689695	Well, to be fair, Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox 360 launch.
689755	692396	I distinctly remember how long it took to find a stinking 360...
693797	696678	trying to go on and check Best Buy's inventory every day.
696758	698058	That crap was madness.
698078	700179	Okay, yeah, that may have lasted for a few months.
700259	705241	Nintendo's Wii launch lasted for a few years that they did that, okay?
705381	707321	It wasn't even, you know, a few months.
707381	716084	It was, okay, we got our supply line taken care of in a couple months, but the Wii, it was just like, oh, it's so hard to get, so hard to get.
716104	719365	It's the must-have toy for, you know, your kids.
719485	722226	I don't know, whatever, you know, I'm skeptical.
722586	726190	There's some talk about the things that the Wii U could be leaving out.
726730	733196	TigerClaw in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, The only thing you have to take into account is the Wii U is not GameCube compatible.
733556	736399	So if you still play your GameCube games, you'll need to keep that Wii.
736840	738581	Or find a GameCube, to be fair.
739002	740903	You could find a GameCube really cheap.
741124	743526	Nowadays, Wiis aren't compatible with GameCube either.
744026	757577	And that's right, SSJ100Matt followed up saying they dropped GameCube controller compatibility in new Wii models, so I wouldn't expect it on the Wii U. He left out the part about the games don't play in the new Wii models either, but certainly the controllers aren't there either.
758278	764763	I'm surprised that the system doesn't do... I guess I understand why they don't do it, so they can do their own HD remakes and stuff, but...
765183	765984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
780520	802725	to a little bit you know smaller extent they kind of smooth them out a little bit and even like uh you know the Xbox 360 did that with the Xbox games it kind of smoothed it out a little bit to make it look a little bit nicer but I'm surprised they don't do that with the Wii stuff it's just you would think that'd be kind of a cool selling point hey all your games look better now I mean because that might even be a way to get people to purchase one if they're not going to so
804145	831830	well we'll talk a little bit more when we get into the news segment of our show the official news segment of our show on some more of the details with the Wii there's some pretty big ones we're leaving out right now but we'll come back to it in the official news segment talk a little more about it see where everybody here in studio is on if they're going to get one or not and then later when we get into the Fugle question of the week and throughout the show with our chatters we'll see where the listeners are at with do they want a Wii U or not because obviously this is kind of a very polarizing thing in the game in the gaming world right now
832330	834831	very back and forth on Twitter.
834931	841073	Lots of fanboys, lots of anti-fanboys, a few people in the middle, but not a lot.
842814	850297	I did, though, want to take a second to say, though, you know, again, congrats, because you nailed the date back in July before any other rumor was out there.
850737	857159	A lot of people jumped on the November train the closer we got here to the September conference, but you nailed it, so props to you.
857199	858359	Yes, thank you, EpicMickey2.
858399	859880	Because
860160	861701	Because that was the giveaway.
862121	870026	Considering that they're launching Epic Mickey 2 on all SKUs on the 18th, Disney never launches a game on Sunday.
870127	870807	They never do that.
870907	872288	So it was pretty obvious.
872308	873209	That was your hint right there.
873409	880113	Well, whatever it was, props to you because I didn't hear anybody else get as close as you did, even some top industry analysts.
881021	882321	But that's right, because no one noticed.
885162	885482	All right.
886363	888223	Let's move on into our gaming weeks.
888343	893745	Obviously, there's no chance to play a Wii U just yet, so we've been playing some other stuff to pass the time.
894185	896765	Alan, I haven't heard from you a lot yet, so let's start with you tonight.
897206	898026	How was your gaming week?
898046	898686	What have you been up to?
898806	899206	Amazing.
899646	899906	Yeah?
900486	901387	Black Mesa Source.
903007	904348	It's so good, I lost my mind.
904748	905488	It is so good.
906178	907198	Alright, back up a little bit.
907239	909540	For those that may not know, what is Black Mesa Source?
909820	921685	It is an 8 years in the making fan project to completely remake Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 Source Engine with completely new HD assets, new voice acting, new face models.
922145	925507	It is indistinguishable from something that Valve could have made themselves.
926287	927008	It is that good.
927148	928488	That's a pretty good endorsement right there.
928528	928728	Yes.
928989	931930	Can I read an email you sent me earlier in the week, if I can dig it up?
932210	932571	Yeah.
933772	935374	Dear Rob, I love you.
935634	936235	XOXO.
936255	936675	No, I'm just kidding.
936695	937476	That's not true.
938477	940519	Hey, let's see.
940539	941000	Where is it?
943062	944784	Where is that one you sent me?
945365	946666	Oh, this is great radio, isn't it?
946706	948008	I think you just sent it to me.
951252	957456	I think this mod may be the greatest accomplishment a fandom has ever produced for a franchise.
957916	958637	I'm serious.
958997	963520	There are tons of little added ambient dialogue bits and everything is professional.
963860	967322	It is literally indistinguishable italicized
968483	970284	from something Valve could have made themselves.
970684	971705	This is not a mod.
971965	976248	This is a wholesale creation that had the added benefit of model to reference.
976648	987555	These developers deserve college scholarships or offer letters from Valve and I'll be angry if Gabe Newell doesn't make some kind of statement by the end of the month acknowledging how fucking good this is.
988116	996841	They perfectly mimic the lobby of Black Mesa that is referenced from the more recent Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that of course looks nothing like the same room in the 98 original.
998002	1001467	Anyone who still complains this took eight years to make is a fool.
1002588	1005452	I'm allowed to have some hyperbole in my emails to my boyfriend, thank you.
1007210	1008011	I was very heated.
1008551	1010432	Well, it certainly got the point across.
1010552	1016316	But, I mean, for something you didn't pay any money for, you felt... Well, I mean, it's a positive review, to be fair.
1016336	1025702	When the game loads up and you're on that monorail going through all of the extra rooms and shit they added, I had to pause it in, like, two places and be like, what the fuck am I looking at?
1025762	1027783	This is, like... This is incredible.
1028904	1031125	It's just like what the trailer was that came out in 2009, but...
1034052	1039435	Half-Life in itself is a fucking awesome game and this just complete for a fan project has blown my mind.
1040156	1049383	And despite what you said in your email about college scholarships and Gabe Newell should essentially give them big hugs and what have you, you have to admit it is pretty impressive.
1049843	1054226	Valve themselves said, cool, just don't call it Half-Life and we're good.
1055527	1056908	Don't infringe on the trademark and we're good.
1057228	1060090	In fact, we'll help you distribute it on Steam for free.
1060150	1061011	It's on Greenlight, yeah.
1061391	1062051	It is free.
1062752	1063292	That's huge.
1063612	1066793	You just have to own any Source game.
1066953	1068894	If you own a fucking Portal game, you can get this.
1068954	1070215	Which they've given away for free.
1070295	1070495	Yes.
1071335	1080119	So, Portal, I think, is the most accessible title that you would have, that you could play this with, or Left 4 Dead, because Left 4 Dead is also crazy popular.
1080579	1086163	What about, can't you download the client for Team Fortress 2 since that's Source 2, isn't it?
1086203	1087424	Yeah, that could also be it too.
1087464	1087925	And that is free.
1088065	1088865	Yeah.
1088885	1088945	Aha.
1089326	1090767	Loki, work in the system, like usual.
1091007	1096031	So yeah, you asked me, am I ever going to play Half-Life, either Half-Life the original or Half-Life Source?
1096291	1097332	No, there's no reason to.
1097892	1100654	Because Black Mesa Source is there.
1100794	1102636	That's a big endorsement from a Half-Life fan like you.
1102716	1102916	Yes.
1103296	1105217	So now the next question, where the fuck is Half-Life 3?
1108782	1109503	Another eight years.
1109523	1110043	Yeah, I know.
1110324	1122934	And there are people on the forums kind of being smartasses, but they're right saying, when I legitimately thought that this fan project was vaporware, I had a little voice in the back of my head that said, even if this is vaporware, we're still going to see this before Half-Life 3.
1123675	1125276	And those people are all right.
1126657	1127278	Amazing.
1127979	1132943	Going to our chat, Tigerclaw saying, I was hoping somebody would talk about Black Mesa.
1133363	1135285	I heard Black Mesa doesn't have Zen.
1136257	1136838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1151317	1152458	Gravity is weird.
1152518	1156780	It's got all these weird platforming bullshit puzzles in it for a first-person shooter.
1156820	1157740	You don't really want to do that.
1157800	1160542	It's probably the biggest misstep in the original game.
1161102	1165004	The Black Mesa Source developer said, we are putting out 90% of the game.
1165644	1168166	Once you enter the portal to go into Xen,
1169206	1173847	I haven't gotten there yet, but I imagine there's a screen that's like, we're saving your game, this is going to be patched in.
1174407	1176948	Of course, these people are terrified of giving deadlines.
1177668	1180228	But they're like, it is coming, we're working on Xen, it's mostly done.
1180908	1184069	Xen is coming later, and that's the end of the game.
1184409	1191490	Yeah, Dungeon Buster in chat says, it's not finished yet, everything's remade up to Lambda Core, but they figured they'd release what they have now and the rest later.
1192270	1195291	Breakman asks, Jesus, did he play the game or marry it?
1195451	1195531	Yeah.
1197296	1197816	No shame.
1198457	1198937	I don't care.
1213510	1214310	Think about that.
1215411	1216871	What has your fandom accomplished?
1218352	1226535	Well, they added women to... In the original game, all the security guards and scientists are just men just because it's only two or three different models, right?
1226855	1227635	They added women.
1228055	1230356	There's the guards and the scientists.
1230376	1236058	There's like 16 unique face models so that when you come across these NPCs, like, oh, this is like a new person.
1236739	1236859	It's...
1237779	1247686	All of the added voice acting of just the guards being killed by monsters running around that you encounter, it sounds like they found the original people from the first game.
1248287	1249768	And they just added all these lines of dialogue.
1249828	1252590	It's crazy what they did with this.
1253143	1255744	So props to the folks who put this together, certainly.
1256644	1260045	It's hard to make an argument not to go download this right now.
1260726	1263066	Yeah, it's a classic game, free.
1264567	1272790	They made some little changes to the maps, because obviously someone like me, I've beaten the original Half-Life maybe eight times from start to finish, so I could zerk my way through it.
1272830	1279532	But I'm like, oh, they added this area, or oh, they closed this door that I used to go into, and now I have to go over here, and this is all new.
1280272	1283855	They added their own little spice to it.
1284375	1288218	DungeonBuster at live.vognetwork.com says, Black Mesa's really great work.
1288378	1292881	Glad they kept the faith to continue with it for so long.
1293021	1293842	Very good point as well.
1293862	1301027	After what happened to them in 2009, where they came out, they said Q3 or Q4 of 2009, it's going to happen.
1301067	1305410	They realized the parts that they had left to program were the hardest parts.
1305710	1308232	They had at least a year's worth of work left to do.
1309052	1336985	and they made a design decision to basically cut out huge chunks of the game that they didn't know how to code and once 2010 hit they're like okay now that we've cut all of this shit out because it was too hard for us to do we're now embarrassed by this and we don't want to put it out like this so they're like fuck it media blackout they took down their twitter or they just they stopped updating their twitter and their youtube and they're like we're gonna put all this shit back in however long it takes us to do it and it took until September of this year
1337205	1337445	Wow.
1338426	1342629	That's amazing dedication because that sort of demotivation would have killed a lot of people.
1343269	1345070	It's very impressive what fan communities do.
1345130	1347151	You know, we've seen a lot of these stories throughout the years.
1347612	1352815	I can remember way back when there was the fan translation of Final Fantasy V for emulators.
1352895	1355217	Remember that back in the day before there was a PlayStation release?
1355237	1356337	And 3, I think, was the first one, right?
1356357	1356638	The NES one?
1356658	1357958	Because that's the first game we didn't get.
1358979	1361341	No, I think 5 got the translation first.
1361641	1362561	3 came soon afterwards.
1362621	1362902	Okay.
1362922	1365824	Because I think the NES was harder to patch or something.
1365844	1366144	I don't know.
1366244	1366344	Yeah.
1367465	1372108	I also remember Second Densetsu 3 was the other huge, huge one that they did the fan translation for.
1372908	1388298	And then, of course, I remember the, don't call it King's Quest, but the Silver Lining game that was heavily inspired by King's Quest and at one time was called King's Quest 9, but like Black Mesa, they had to take the King's Quest out of their name to avoid the legal situation they had found themselves in.
1388738	1407740	so it's really impressive what a lot of like fan communities have accomplished and I'm like would I be that motivated to do anything like that oh yeah I have had a podcast for 10 years I guess that's kind of cool but this shit's easy Black Mesa I don't think that was nearly as easy so that's that's you know major props so well what else in your gaming week anything else
1408520	1418587	I'm tinkered around with a little WoW, checking out the balance changes and the class changes to my druid, who's my main, and I haven't really played as much WoW as I should.
1418907	1422650	And then Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a little bit.
1422990	1424311	They had a multiplayer weekend.
1424731	1425472	A little bit?
1426472	1427033	A little bit?
1427053	1435438	The last weekend when they had their, every other week they do log in and do this squad challenge and you get like a free rare elite weapon on Wednesday or whatever.
1435718	1436699	I completely spaced it.
1438440	1440182	What level are you in Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer?
1440322	1441203	My N7 score?
1441283	1441424	Yeah.
1441564	1442044	It's like about 680.
1444687	1449492	And then I'll still log in in a match with someone with an N7 score of like 8,000.
1449633	1450694	I'm like, you know what?
1450774	1451455	I'm not that bad.
1452175	1452796	I'm not that bad.
1452876	1453477	I'm not that bad.
1454244	1455165	They're sharing their account.
1455185	1455946	That's what's going on there.
1456746	1459529	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
1459669	1460070	No, that's it.
1460190	1460910	Let's go to Loki.
1460970	1462192	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1462512	1463753	I played lots of Minecraft.
1463953	1474964	I've been just building this massive castle on the VOG Network server, which you should join, by the way, if you haven't already.
1475144	1475724	It's pretty fun.
1476805	1477766	Get a few people on there.
1478846	1479867	I see a few people on there.
1479927	1483168	That fucking castle you're building is astounding.
1484409	1488790	I could see that all the way from my little house that's like a ways away.
1488971	1490551	I can't believe we're talking about a fake world.
1490951	1492372	But my house is like all the way away.
1492452	1497314	The one that some smartass nutman put foreclosure signs all over.
1497354	1498355	Did I show you that, Alan?
1498375	1498755	Yeah, you did.
1499516	1501098	I don't know who did it.
1501118	1504103	Well, like, there's some people I can't... Like, there's some people I can't...
1514599	1516419	There's some people that are on there right now.
1516679	1518340	I don't see them on the map.
1518420	1523381	Nutman I haven't seen actually play, but there's a few spots because I need everybody to start posting.
1523741	1529062	If you haven't already, put a sign out front of your house so I know whose it is because there's a bunch of spots.
1529222	1530342	My coworker is the worst.
1530582	1532122	He keeps starting new places.
1532262	1533583	He's like, I'm going to build on this island.
1533843	1535883	I'm like, you already have four fucking houses.
1536023	1539344	I'm breaking all of them if you don't fucking pick a spot.
1539724	1540804	Pick a spot and stick to it.
1542609	1559532	and like the other day he's like I think I'm gonna build over here I'm like no you're not you're building where you fucking said before and I actually had to go in there and like I switched up the creative to go and destroy his like other houses that he built because they were I don't want all these like half built things well I will let Nutman know the banker
1560052	1577198	that I have started digging up clay from all the lakes I can find and started baking some bricks so I can make a house out of brick so go pick on the guys up on top of the hill who also have a stone house or go try to foreclose Loki's castle I know it's all in good fun I'm not really mad I laughed I really did laugh
1577478	1578338	Get on the VOG server right now.
1592905	1593045	Yeah.
1593085	1593225	Yeah.
1593265	1593385	Yeah.
1593406	1593506	Yeah.
1609677	1615559	Yeah, that's why I haven't, that's why I run a vanilla server because I'm like, I don't know how to fucking set this up with bucket and stuff.
1615579	1617780	I'm like, mods?
1619221	1621582	The mods that I use are mostly just quality of life stuff.
1621602	1625563	They're not like spawn diamonds everywhere.
1625683	1626624	No, no, no, no, no.
1628184	1631687	Loki would frown on that, even though he's probably doing it himself.
1632228	1633088	I know.
1634009	1638092	I do find myself in creative mode a little bit more than I probably should be, just to fly around.
1638112	1638753	You know what?
1638973	1645038	When I saw those Endermen outside my house, I was like, no thank you, I'm going to log out for about 30 minutes and come back when those guys are gone.
1645759	1650903	They honestly, because like I said, the other day we were fucking around with it and my friend took on like...
1653385	1654165	20 of them at once.
1654345	1658728	I mean, they're really not that... If you just don't look at their face, you can walk right past them.
1658748	1659789	But they're scary.
1659809	1660269	Minecraft's scary.
1660289	1661250	They are kind of creepy.
1661510	1662151	They are creepy.
1662171	1662891	Survival horror.
1662971	1664012	They're way scarier.
1664112	1668515	It is hilarious, though, watching them in the rain because I was building in the rain.
1668535	1671457	All of a sudden, I see this red flash go past my screen.
1671477	1672958	I'm like, what the fuck was that?
1673258	1674619	It's like a bug or something.
1674899	1680063	It's because they're flipping out because they keep teleporting and they hit the rain and then they take damage so they teleport again.
1680183	1681644	So they're teleporting all over the place.
1682724	1683325	It was kind of funny.
1683745	1685286	But anyways, so I played lots of Minecraft.
1686467	1689969	And then I played, well, a little bit of Call of Duty.
1690349	1695773	I've been playing some of that because we have some more people we're playing with now at work and stuff.
1696153	1698795	But we haven't played Minecraft during our breaks, so that's kind of fun.
1699535	1704198	I repurposed our arcade cabinet that we had running MAME and stuff to play Minecraft.
1705809	1710793	and then yesterday I started playing Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360.
1711053	1714696	Ooh, little early or broken release street dates and all that kind of, okay.
1715477	1715817	Whatever.
1717799	1718279	I like it.
1718539	1728267	It's, you know, right now I was kind of, I didn't know who I should play as so I played as Zero because it was kind of a little similar to Mordecai which is how I played the first game.
1728588	1730049	You know, sniper, pistol.
1730549	1733912	I don't know if he's proficient in the pistol but I know he's proficient in sniper rifle.
1734452	1735053	Sniper Pistol
1749269	1752770	There's that in there, but then they take it a little bit further, and it's kind of funny.
1753670	1759832	So they've got that, and then there's a clear-cut villain in it, which is a little bit unique versus the last game.
1759852	1766274	In the last game, there wasn't really a villain until kind of towards the end, and even then it was like, okay, well, the villain kept changing.
1766835	1771176	It was a little weird, but now there's a clear-cut villain in there, and he's awesome.
1771376	1772496	You know, handsome Jack, so...
1774517	1774937	It's pretty sweet.
1775037	1776318	And the game seems a little bit harder.
1777939	1778660	For me, at least.
1779300	1783763	The enemies are a lot more mobile and they're less dumb.
1784204	1787326	They will actually take cover a lot better than they did before.
1787406	1791148	But this one has an easier... Because they have the BFF mode, right?
1791588	1793210	It hasn't come out yet.
1793310	1797592	BFF mode's in the MechRomancer, which is not until October.
1797612	1799494	It doesn't matter.
1799534	1800234	You don't need that.
1801115	1801595	I do.
1801775	1802596	You don't need that.
1805417	1806578	It's just a skill tree.
1806698	1809839	You can get skills, I think, until way later in the game.
1810279	1811779	I haven't gotten the skill trees yet.
1812099	1813900	I thought you started getting those at level 5.
1813980	1818241	Then again, remember, I'm playing... Well, level 5, yeah, but I'm only level 4 right now.
1818261	1819402	I haven't even gotten there yet.
1819422	1819762	Wow, okay.
1820082	1821202	I mean, it takes a little bit.
1821703	1822963	But it's nice.
1823183	1823743	I like the game.
1823783	1824183	It's fun.
1824263	1825924	So I will definitely be playing that.
1826820	1829161	I have to balance my time between that and Minecraft.
1829181	1829881	You're only level 4.
1829921	1830962	It sounds like you're not playing it enough.
1830982	1833603	I only played it for a couple hours last week.
1833643	1836344	I was like, I want to go back in Minecraft.
1837744	1839045	No, I should play this.
1839385	1840666	It's like me in Warcraft.
1840766	1841166	Same thing.
1841966	1843026	All right, is that it for your gaming week?
1843366	1844146	That's it.
1844206	1844766	My gaming week.
1844907	1848767	I didn't talk about Rock Band Blitz last week, so I just want to quickly kind of give it a shout out.
1848827	1858189	And I really, I've been wanting, meaning to write a review for vognetwork.com, but I've just been very busy between my day job and the show I'm directing for early October.
1858229	1863110	I haven't had a lot of time to just, when I do have free time, it's like, I don't want to do more work.
1863490	1864150	So I apologize.
1864530	1867650	But Rock Band Blitz, I'll tell you some of my early thoughts on it now.
1868451	1871391	Obviously, how great is it to have an enhanced version
1871451	1872312	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1888410	1891351	The fact that those songs will import into Rock Band 3 is great.
1891651	1903674	And just if you have whored and downloaded as many songs for Rock Band the series as I have onto your 360, what an amazing value to have this new game that uses them in this whole new way.
1905335	1910216	Some of the things I didn't like, I don't think the game is as strong as frequency and amplitude.
1911096	1924826	I think it's, you know, the whole fact that it's like two buttons and has this kind of interesting mechanic where the way you increase your score is to try and get up all the multipliers by a certain point in the song.
1925106	1930970	But you might have to know the song a little bit to know that, oh, your only chance to up the vocal multipliers is in this one part.
1931671	1934213	That was a little weird to get used to, but I'm okay with it.
1934233	1939777	But the part that starts to bug me is then when you, if you really want to do well on a song, you got to use power-ups.
1940257	1956844	and some of the power-ups are pretty cool like I love the pinball and I love all that stuff but then we get all Facebook up in here the only way to get these power-ups is with coins and you get coins through either playing songs or completing challenges how do you sign up for challenges?
1957264	1968889	you gotta link the game to your Facebook now I gotta say Harmonix does get props for thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different and integrating a game so well
1969349	1970310	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1993989	1995690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2018337	2023178	It's just that, you know, I think it's just a little bit flawed.
2023238	2034760	I think you kind of took something that was meant to be for a free-to-play game and tried to put it in this game, and it's not working out so well, as you can tell, because you're already changing the weights of things in the first couple weeks.
2035340	2040681	But, again, $15, good songs, new game that uses your old DLC, not a bad deal.
2041661	2044682	If you like music games, you probably already have it.
2046122	2071198	um some other games I played this week Borderlands 1 because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now free with the quotes because PlayStation Plus isn't free but you know what I mean um ironic because I already own it on the PC but I don't know sometimes I just want to sit on the couch and play it that way with the controller even though I'm not as accurate with the controller I've already got farther on PlayStation 3 than I did on PC go figure but I'm having a good time uh the other new game I want to talk about
2072165	2077369	Double Dragon Neon Speaking of free things on PlayStation Plus Did you know Double Dragon Neon came out this last week?
2077829	2097784	Now, Alan, I distinctly remember this There was a previous show you were on You were filling in for Jamie And you and I had played through Double Dragon on Xbox Because I just randomly had the version that was on Xbox like five years ago Yeah, and then Dan came in and yelled at us That's right, yeah, yeah, yeah And we played through it and we were like God
2098524	2100224	What... This game is shitty.
2100644	2104085	Like, what were people... Why did we love this game growing up?
2104105	2105045	It did not age well.
2105405	2110906	The clipping and the falling off platforms and just the difficulty and it was kind of janky and slow and yeah.
2111166	2114487	Yeah, and so Dan came in and yelled at us going, shut up, Double Dragon's a great game.
2114907	2116407	But like, you know, we were like, ugh.
2116987	2119828	So now there's this remake, Double Dragon Neon, that came out.
2119848	2127529	And I gotta admit, I approached this remake going, Double Dragon's stupid, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it, so whatever, I'll get on there and check it out.
2128129	2131793	I gotta say, well done way forward.
2132393	2137218	They made Double Dragon kind of fun again.
2137778	2139440	It's not a straight up remake.
2139520	2141362	It's not a shot for shot remake type of thing.
2141802	2143504	They added some new things into it.
2143604	2145926	Like Billy and Jimmy can now throw fireballs.
2146607	2147528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2166201	2167862	Yeah, release the Kraken!
2167922	2169622	He'll start saying things like that.
2169642	2170343	It's really stupid.
2170963	2173284	And then there's this whole stupid thing you can do.
2174024	2175064	What the hell was it called?
2175124	2178126	It was, instead of co-op, it's called bro-op.
2179286	2184248	And you can use the right stick or something to just give a high five to your bro.
2184708	2186349	Yeah, high five, bro.
2187750	2188871	It's ridiculous.
2188931	2191153	It's so stupid, but I'm just eating it up.
2191714	2203002	I feel like the guys that way forward who developed it, and to give this company props, they've done a lot of the other good remakes too, of which I'm drawing a blank right now, but I know there were some other really good ones they did.
2203943	2204423	Son of a bitch.
2204443	2205123	Why can't I remember?
2205184	2206144	Somebody in chat will help me out.
2206544	2214207	But it's like they kind of knew that it was a bad game they were adapting, but made it fun.
2214647	2215327	So I love that.
2215827	2219249	TigerClaw says, I heard they changed how a Bobo looks in the new Double Dragon.
2219289	2220709	Yeah, they made him like twice the size.
2221830	2227432	There's definitely some Ninja Turtle arcade game elements too, like the bad guys flash when they're getting weaker in health and stuff.
2227812	2230273	I love that the game is self-aware.
2230553	2231033	It's great.
2232028	2232668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2249989	2254232	Is it gonna last past the first few LOLs and all that stuff?
2254432	2254832	I don't know.
2255012	2257834	It just depends how into these types of side-scrolling fighting games you are.
2257974	2262978	If you liked games like Final Fight and all that back in the day, and of course the original Double Dragon, there's something here for you.
2263118	2263758	You'll enjoy it.
2264098	2267480	Ninja Turtles arcade game, I'd say it's on par with that.
2267961	2271143	If you didn't enjoy those games, then it's probably a pass.
2271383	2273544	Probably won't be as funny to you, but I think it's worth checking out.
2274085	2275866	Thank you, Game Guru in the chat room.
2275906	2278708	Contra 4 was a great, great game that they did.
2279068	2281490	That was one of those, a lot of people missed that.
2281530	2283631	It was on the DS, but yeah.
2284592	2285292	Thank you, Game Guru.
2285973	2287594	I knew our chatters would help us out.
2288906	2310997	ah Degenerate Johnny in the chat says Double Dragon Neon the ultimate bromance in a way it is the way Double Dragon should be it's great all right uh I guess that's it for my gaming week so now let's get into some housekeeping actually there is a bit of housekeeping tonight um first off the show uh we will not be here live next week
2311497	2313318	Apologies guys, live listeners.
2314358	2318520	I'm going out of town so Studio OLR will be closed next Sunday.
2318861	2324763	There will be a new episode of OLR up so you can do that still next week.
2324823	2325624	So that will be up.
2325644	2330226	We're going to tape it earlier in the week and it will replay on Sunday night so you can hear that.
2330686	2333468	So that's just a special note for our live listeners.
2333888	2338891	I don't want to discourage you from tuning in, though, because Bobby has a really good interview next week.
2339552	2345756	And I want to get into that because this is a great media partnership for the network that we're on, the Voice of Geeks Network.
2346436	2348757	You know, we haven't been around that long, all things considered.
2348798	2349738	We just launched, what?
2350258	2351799	The official launch was June.
2352120	2353520	We did a soft launch in May.
2354041	2354601	Well, get this.
2354761	2359064	The VOG Network is an official media partner of the Siege Network.
2359344	2360405	GameDevelopersConference.com
2379218	2380059	You're in Florida.
2380079	2381259	I know we got some listeners in Florida.
2381299	2385702	If you're in that area and you're interested in developing games, this is a great opportunity for you.
2385842	2387503	October 5th through 7th in Atlanta.
2387784	2391666	Bobby Blackwolf will be there representing the Voice of Geeks Network and he's going to be there.
2392107	2395249	He'll be covering the show on our website, of course, as well as his own show.
2395849	2403134	He'll be helping out the Georgia Game Developers Association with doing audio and video from the panels and keynote speeches through the weekend.
2403394	2404214	So that's really cool.
2404254	2405715	This is the sixth year of the Expo.
2406376	2407337	Some people that are going to be there.
2408337	2416981	Dustin Klingman, who's the executive director of the International Game Developers Association, Rob Carroll, who's the director of publishing for Tapjoy, and so on.
2417061	2419462	Panels on programming, 3D modeling, game audio.
2419882	2420902	This is not E3.
2421463	2422763	No new game announcements here.
2423604	2425144	It's not going to be that type of expo.
2425424	2435969	But if you're curious about the industry, you want to know more about how to break into it, how are the games really made, what's going on in game development right now, and you're in that neck of the woods, I highly encourage you to go
2436349	2439912	October 5th through 7th, Atlanta Marriott, Northwest, in Atlanta, Georgia.
2440272	2448878	Passes are anywhere from $39.95 to $104.95 depending on your current membership with Georgia Game Developers Association or if you're a student or what have you.
2448898	2450960	You can check out more info at their website.
2451400	2454262	It is siegecon.net.
2454442	2457945	Excuse me, S-I-E-G-E-C-O-N.net.
2458525	2463389	And props to Bobby was obviously, because that's his backyard, a huge part of establishing that partnership.
2463809	2477928	props to you my friend pushing our network forward one other big announcement I got a lot of stuff tonight for housekeeping and not just plugging the Facebook at facebook.com slash orange launch radio or twitter at twitter.com slash olr though I just did
2478869	2486174	Last week, we had Aaron on the show, or YYR, and he was pimping his game, Bungie Ferret Tossing, and you might be asking yourself, where the hell is it?
2486994	2490236	Well, Aaron tweeted earlier, and he says, Monday.
2490376	2498342	The game will be out tomorrow, so by the time most of you hear the podcast version of this, Bungie Ferret Tossing will be out on Xbox Live Indie Games.
2498402	2498662	Guys,
2499262	2521013	let's make this a success this is OLR inspired this is one of our dream games becoming a reality and it's one stinking dollar you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your wallet already so go get this game on Monday Bungie Ferret Tossing we will have links on the Twitters and on the Facebooks and all that good stuff as soon as the game is out and we can link you to it check that out
2522835	2526298	Alright, now I'm done with housekeeping Yay, we got it, right?
2526378	2535925	No live next week, but pre-recorded We have Siege and we have BFT on Monday Facebook, Twitter, busy busy Back to the Wii U then, Loki?
2536806	2538047	Let's talk about some of the stuff we missed
2539047	2547291	Alright, so a few things about the Wii U. Well, there's a lot of things about the Wii U. But first off, Bayonetta.
2548071	2557116	Bayonetta 2 is actually going to be an exclusive title for the Wii U that's coming through with a partnership between Platinum and Nintendo.
2558196	2559016	So they've got that.
2559136	2562317	One of the things that they're talking about also, game pricing.
2562417	2564258	Everyone was kind of wondering when the pricing was.
2564378	2565838	I think I've mentioned this in the past.
2565898	2568279	It's going to be like the current gen consoles.
2569339	2575681	$59.99 is going to be the kind of going price for Wii U games, which is kind of a duh.
2575921	2579242	I mean, it makes sense that it would be that price.
2579582	2582083	Those pro controllers are going to be going for $49.99.
2583864	2586125	Also, the different launches.
2586145	2590167	Of course, we know we're getting it over here in North America on November 18th.
2590667	2596050	Europe's getting it on November 30th, followed by Japan getting it on December 8th.
2599691	2601092	This is kind of interesting, too.
2601953	2607095	Not only does Japan get it on the 8th, but they're also getting their systems without sensor bars.
2608973	2609794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2624787	2626648	Yeah, it's an interesting choice.
2630010	2632131	Of course, there is some other stuff.
2633671	2641235	One of the features that they were kind of pimping out was the Nintendo TV service, TVII.
2642255	2644096	Gotta stick with the whole naming scheme.
2645557	2646618	Hate on it all you want.
2646718	2647718	It's cute and it fits.
2648318	2648999	The name's fine.
2650857	2667191	Alright, I'm just saying, it's a little interesting, it's kind of like the same stuff that we're doing on the other consoles, where they've got a bunch of different streaming services bundled together, plus also you can watch live TV, because you can apparently hook it up to...
2667871	2674878	Well, they haven't shown it yet because no one's allowed to take pictures of the back panel, but the thought is that you're going to be able to hook it up to your cable line.
2676399	2682264	But it does tie in with TiVo, Netflix, and I believe Amazon streaming services.
2683645	2699302	and of course you can also set stuff to TiVo if you have your TiVo and apparently they're working with all the different subscribers, Comcast, all the cable and satellite providers
2699822	2709624	Does this mean that it has the technology where like in your house let's say Loki you want to watch American Idol because I know you're such a Nicki Minaj fan you'll be watching this year.
2710324	2716406	You're going to watch American Idol on the big TV and then if Nelly doesn't want to watch that she can watch the Oprah Network on the Wii U device.
2716666	2717646	I don't think it works like that.
2717746	2718546	Not quite like that?
2718666	2719627	I don't think it works like that.
2719707	2721267	Maybe one's got to be Netflix.
2723479	2727180	Yeah, but see, at this point, everything streams Netflix.
2727840	2728100	True.
2728400	2730201	You know, the 3DS streams Netflix.
2730721	2734202	And because if you're a Nintendo fan, you probably have a 3DS as well.
2734222	2737023	You know, hell, your Wii streams Netflix.
2737263	2738623	Your phone streams Netflix.
2738663	2740624	Your iPod streams Netflix.
2741004	2743585	Your PC streams... Everything fucking streams Netflix.
2743925	2745645	We don't need another device to stream Netflix.
2745665	2747406	Wait, wait, my pants do not yet stream Netflix.
2748346	2749286	You need better pants.
2753294	2756016	But it's just, I mean, cool, okay, whatever.
2756076	2758759	So that's a selling point, whatever, they want to make that.
2759599	2766565	Of course they announced also that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is going to be coming to the Wii U as well, also 3DS.
2767306	2773892	That's coming out next year though, March 31st is the tentative date right now, obviously it's placeholder, but...
2774833	2776033	Probably March next year.
2779116	2784140	We know that the Wii U controllers are pretty expensive because they're selling them separately in Japan for some reason.
2785281	2787282	Even though there's no games that support it, but cool.
2788183	2789885	If you want to spend extra money, why not?
2791526	2791686	And...
2794699	2804968	And yeah, that's nothing about online other than that there's supposed to be some sort of premium service that they're going to give you 10% back on any downloads that you pay for.
2806455	2808897	I'm really bothered by the lack of online information.
2810058	2810899	You know what else is weird?
2811480	2814923	Have they shown, like, this is what the Wii U looks like when you turn it on.
2815663	2816564	This is the interface.
2816624	2817405	No, they talked about it.
2817445	2817785	Did they?
2817805	2818746	Because I missed that.
2818766	2825252	It's going to just boot right into that Nintendo, the Mi Plaza Home thing or whatever the hell they're calling it.
2825272	2827033	Was that the thing with little messages that were showing up?
2827253	2827554	Yeah.
2827574	2828915	That looks like it could be interesting.
2828935	2829155	Interesting.
2830660	2846518	I don't know, but here's the other thing too that's kind of bothersome is the amount of storage that's on this thing I mean, 8 gigs for the cheap one and 32 for the more expensive one Well, they made the right decision though because Reggie confirmed in an interview that you can just plug in any old drive and it'll work
2847119	2849261	I understand that, but fuck that.
2850021	2852903	I get a 250 gigabyte drive or something.
2852923	2866292	But the thing is, if they're going to be offering games digitally, and they've already said that these games, the disks are going to be up to 25 gigabytes, I'm going to get a third of a download for...
2867409	2868169	Well, let's be real.
2868249	2870651	How many games are going to really take up all that space?
2870751	2879835	If it's like Blu-ray, then if it's a PlayStation 3 type game, a lot of them actually will take up over 20 gigs or at least up to 20 gigs.
2880415	2895343	If you have a Wii set up to load games to a hard drive that you can plug in the Wii, which is something we've talked about on the show before, so that you can load discs that you own onto the Wii for quick access, whatever, you'd be surprised how small some of those games are.
2895703	2897325	Well, that's the Wii, though.
2897345	2899707	Remember, the Wii is last-generation graphics.
2900007	2903891	Therefore, anything is probably going to fit onto a single-layer DVD.
2904331	2911858	I mean, they only had a couple dual-layer DVD games, whereas everything is a dual-layer DVD on the Xbox 360 and on the PlayStation 3.
2912218	2915962	It's, you know, Blu-ray, and obviously those are going to be a lot bigger.
2915982	2917223	Yeah.
2919224	2919945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2938106	2938446	and so on.
2957071	2961054	Think of how exciting it'll be to spend all that money to buy those controllers.
2961754	2966378	Whether you did it when you had the Wii or you did it now because you don't own a Wii.
2967399	2968699	So you have to spend all that money.
2968779	2979147	Then on top of that, if you want to digitally download stuff, like actually first party games or full console games, you're going to have to spend money to buy a hard drive.
2979187	2982449	Which hard drives have come down in price, but still it's an added expense.
2983050	2984131	You still have to do that.
2984711	2984871	And...
2986292	2991676	I don't know, it's kind of annoying that they have all these things that they cut out to make the console cheaper.
2991956	3001403	Stuff that we gave other console manufacturers crap for, like cutting out USB ports.
3001543	3002384	That's another thing, too.
3002404	3006867	If I'm going to plug in some sort of USB drive into this thing, or like a...
3007868	3008569	Hard drive or something.
3008589	3010230	How many fucking USB ports on this thing?
3010390	3010850	Like two?
3011471	3016514	So what happens when, you know, say I got to play another game that requires some other USB peripheral.
3016654	3017415	Would a hub work?
3017495	3018835	Well, yeah.
3019016	3019616	At an expense.
3019656	3020877	I got to buy a fucking hub now.
3022078	3022678	They're not that bad.
3022698	3023539	It doesn't matter, though.
3023559	3024439	I don't have to buy a fucking hub.
3024459	3029943	If you bought three USB devices, you can spare the money for a hub or whatever.
3032270	3041253	I'm just saying, you know, it's an extra expense that they're not talking to, you know, the consumers about or they're not even, they don't even know what their fucking online plan is yet.
3041313	3043554	Can we, yeah, that concerns me too.
3043874	3047635	I really, I need to hear from Nintendo that they understand online now.
3047975	3051417	Like they haven't even said, here is, you know, our online.
3051477	3055638	Here's what it looks like, you know, requesting, you know, friend requests.
3055698	3056558	Here's this and that.
3056818	3058119	All we've seen is just, you know,
3058419	3062342	Hey, look, you can post stupid messages on a message board about this game.
3062382	3063743	Ha ha, this level is hard!
3064043	3064864	Whoa, smiley face!
3065124	3075851	You know, I mean, that's all I really... Just so you know, Loki, the chatters are correcting you on something, starting with Blackwolf and JVMon following four USB ports, they said.
3076311	3077392	Two in front, two in back.
3077993	3078433	Well, cool.
3078713	3079934	That should do it, then.
3081755	3100249	but uh still though I don't want to have to buy all these extra things let's take a step back for a minute Alan I'm going to ask your opinion on all this too because you're being too quiet over there but hold on before I get to you uh I want to take a step back Bayonetta 2 because obviously that was the big thing that people walked away from this whole uh you know expo going
3100706	3102607	Whoa, Bayonetta 2, it's real.
3102707	3103327	Oh my gosh.
3103407	3105808	And okay, it's on the Wii U. All right.
3106268	3110770	In my opinion, that's exactly the type of bullet Nintendo needed in their gun.
3111290	3112130	You know, pun intended.
3112210	3115592	That was... But for me, though, it wasn't quite enough.
3116192	3116272	I'm...
3116972	3123238	Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Nintendo saved it from not existing at all, and I'm glad that's a step in the right direction.
3123298	3128083	It's just not enough in the right direction to really convince me, like, holy shit, I need one of these day one.
3128503	3138073	I needed to see F-Zero, Metroid, Zelda, one of those Nintendo properties that's not just another Mario game in the same vein as the three that have already come out recently.
3138713	3154624	well here's the thing too about Bayonetta too I mean Bayonetta didn't sell very well I mean it's a niche game I mean it didn't sell that great but now you're narrowing it down even more all those fans but it's fucking great I understand it but your devil may cry it's the same game and that game does well
3154804	3154984	Go ahead.
3179220	3186307	So for the Bayonetta thing, for the last two years I've been asking, even if it's just in Japan and we don't get it, where's Bayonetta 2?
3186487	3188929	Because, I mean, Japanese games, they love their sequels, right?
3188969	3189750	So I'm like, where is it?
3189810	3190630	Where's Bayonetta 2?
3191071	3192252	What's Platinum Games working on?
3192612	3196676	So when I finally said Bayonetta 2 is real, but it's Wii U exclusive...
3198177	3206623	I'm still kind of disappointed and mad about that, but I'm going to think realistically, will it be ported to at least a 360 or PS3 within two years?
3207384	3207584	No.
3207704	3209005	No, it's not?
3209045	3210126	It's published by Nintendo.
3210246	3210486	Yeah.
3210907	3211007	Oh.
3211467	3212968	Nintendo has it by the balls.
3213208	3213488	Okay.
3214549	3233611	Alright, well there's that, but one, I guess I just won't play it then, and two, like what Bobby Blackwolf was saying, if it means Nintendo dropping a big sack of money in Platinum Games Labs, saying give us Bayonetta 2, if that had to happen or else Bayonetta 2 wasn't going to happen at all, then fine, yes, I would rather there be a Bayonetta 2...
3234993	3238735	Don't swell his ego anymore after tonight's show.
3238935	3243679	You need to understand something about all these people going, oh my god, Bayonetta 2, the Wii U has it and all that stuff.
3243699	3245360	Did they announce a fucking release date for it?
3246661	3248122	Oh, wait, that wasn't there?
3248502	3249083	Gee, I wonder why.
3249143	3252906	Because maybe that Platinum Games right now is working on Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
3253166	3254507	That doesn't come out until February.
3254687	3257629	So that means they're still going to be fucking working on that game until at least January.
3258810	3260491	That trailer was literally nothing.
3260571	3262473	Was it in that 50 game launch window thing?
3262533	3262573	No.
3263133	3279689	it's not a launch title it's probably next year sometime you'd be lucky if it's next year holiday I bet you 2014 just like hey Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and everyone's like oh my god Smash Brothers I need to buy a Wii U it's not fucking coming out for years it's it's
3280524	3283086	It's a lot of the 3DS syndrome, I hate to say.
3283327	3286650	Pilotwings Resort, not the killer game to launch your system with.
3287871	3294717	They're teasing shit that's not going to be coming out forever because people are dumb enough to go, I'm buying the system for Bayonetta 2.
3294837	3300542	Cool, you're buying that system, it's going to be fucking collecting dust until the two years from now that Bayonetta is going to be coming out.
3300562	3307208	To be fair, Nintendo Land, for what it is, a weeaboo collection of minigames and so forth,
3307808	3308528	Looks pretty neat.
3309429	3311570	I'm kind of sold on Nintendo Land, I gotta say.
3312390	3312711	Cool.
3312911	3315972	I'll probably enjoy that more than I actually played Wii Sports.
3316873	3320435	Wii Sports is one of those things that's fun for five minutes, and then you're like, oh, I get it.
3320875	3327118	I mean, I wish they would have something that would be, you know, oh my god, I have to have this system for it, but they just don't.
3327398	3328499	And that's my thing.
3328699	3329680	That's why I'm not getting one.
3329700	3335903	I'm not saying that, oh, you're wrong for, you know, someone else is wrong for getting it because they have something that they're like, oh, my God, I want to play that.
3336284	3338825	You know, oh, God, I got to play, you know, Mario Brothers in HD.
3338945	3341067	Pikmin has a cult following.
3341347	3347431	That's not my game that I ever really got into, but I could understand where somebody's like, fuck, yeah, Pikmin, I got to get this.
3347731	3348531	Those games sell like crazy.
3348551	3349852	It's going to be a success.
3349972	3352853	Yeah, because people buy anything that says Mario on it, okay?
3352913	3355354	It could be Mario's Douche Factory and people eat that shit up, okay?
3355374	3355394	I...
3375021	3375662	It doesn't matter.
3375782	3378604	It's just, I'm sure it's going to be a fun game.
3378644	3382648	But the thing is, for me, it's not that, like, wow.
3383068	3393698	It's not that, it's the same experience I can get right now, you know, on 3DS or on Wii or something like that.
3393798	3394438	That's my problem.
3394719	3400363	You know, and the gimmicky thing of, hey, look, I can use this tablet and I can tap the screen and it makes platforms.
3401400	3407002	Fuck, you could probably do that if you made some sort of connectivity between the DS version and the Wii version.
3407282	3412704	You could do the same shit with your stylus on the touchscreen, but no, we're just not gonna do that.
3413445	3417346	Alan, you never got to finish your thought because Loki, you know, got on his tangent, but...
3418467	3423852	Yeah, so I'd rather there be a Bayonetta 2 that I'll never play than no Bayonetta 2 at all.
3424493	3434002	And when Bobby was reading those tweets about, this is the worst thing since the Mass Effect 3 ending, I was like, oh Jesus Christ, go pee your bed.
3435322	3435642	What?
3435843	3436203	Really?
3436303	3438546	This is a thing that people are talking about?
3439227	3439847	Yeah, whatever.
3440728	3443472	I really have no fucks to give for the Wii U. I don't care.
3444233	3446395	We don't play it here.
3446455	3450840	It's the one system that I don't bought that I didn't have my own copy of when I moved in with you.
3451281	3453103	I played Wii Fit for like a week.
3453824	3455486	Once in a while I get into Wii mode.
3455686	3456306	You have to admit.
3456366	3456566	Yeah.
3456927	3457227	Once in a while.
3457247	3462069	So you're going to pick up We Fit You because We Fit You's got the crappy pedometer with your little me on it.
3462489	3463369	Oh my God.
3463789	3464390	And guess what?
3464670	3471853	If someone's watching TV, you can look like a goddamn fool staring into a little tablet and exercising.
3474763	3481206	Well, okay, let's... Alan, let's say you had the money, money's not a concern, and so forth.
3481246	3488269	You still would not buy a Wii U on this principle of there's not really something you want to play on it right now, right?
3488409	3488750	Correct.
3488930	3491271	And also, I agree with what Loki was saying.
3491791	3492891	That 20, 25-second Bayonetta 2 reveal...
3494172	3496453	Reveal trailer is literally nothing.
3496673	3502177	So, like, there's... They have not probably even started to work on this game even a little tiny bit yet.
3502197	3503357	So it's two years off.
3504198	3508260	If you're interested in a Wii, and you haven't pre-ordered it yet, you're probably not going to fucking get it at launch anyways.
3508600	3510481	Just chill the fuck out.
3511062	3514424	Let the whole, like, you know, oh my god, I'm a crack addict.
3514524	3516465	I need my Nintendo crack, you know, right now.
3516705	3518726	Just let that, like, kind of calm down.
3518826	3519627	Get out of your system.
3520147	3521388	And just give it, like, a year.
3521608	3521888	And then...
3522268	3539580	you know a Zelda game will be fucking coming out the system will probably drop in price and there'll be stuff that you'll actually want to play I think the 3DS is going to be an awesome system that is going to have dozens of must-have games for it in another two years the Vita is going to be an awesome system with dozens of must-have games for it in another two years so Wii U is probably going to be the same way
3540640	3545843	GameGuru brings this comment to chat that has the facts I was looking for in arguing with Loki earlier.
3545903	3546724	Thank you, GameGuru.
3547304	3548464	New Super Mario Bros.
3548645	3552246	U sold 25... I think he meant to say New Super Mario Bros.
3552707	3553667	New Super Mario Bros.
3553727	3555848	sold 25 million copies.
3556108	3558750	It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.
3559650	3563353	25 million copies as a franchise or as a title?
3563413	3564674	Because I don't think that's as a title.
3566015	3566956	And it was a packing game.
3566976	3567637	Semantics.
3568477	3569298	It doesn't matter.
3569438	3570839	It's a huge game.
3570939	3572140	The point still stands.
3572240	3574302	It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U.
3576798	3578780	or they could have made a new Mario game.
3578820	3582764	Why settle for just the same franchise that you've already been pimping for a while?
3583044	3586908	Yeah, those numbers look nice if you're talking franchise because you've only... How many new Super Mario Bros.
3586928	3587728	games have you released?
3588389	3589310	Yeah, that's what I thought.
3589710	3591112	I can't wait to buy Legend of Zelda.
3591412	3591912	The new one?
3592153	3592933	No, all of them.
3593033	3593694	Again and again.
3595395	3600618	But now let's go back to the real world for a minute here, Alan, because you're not living by yourself anymore.
3600678	3605001	You're in a committed relationship with an individual who tends to be a bit of a consumer whore.
3605281	3609003	So there probably will be a Wii U in the house within the next year.
3609523	3610704	How does that make you feel?
3611484	3616447	I don't care about the Wii U. You won't even touch it?
3617388	3618548	You won't look at it?
3618588	3619349	Well, it's hooked up.
3619409	3623111	I'll play it, but I mean... Well, it's there.
3624741	3627727	I'll have my hour where I go, oh, okay, it's the controller.
3627987	3629289	All right, then boom, never again.
3631443	3632164	Alright, fair enough.
3634105	3638808	Technis in chat wondering, so I wonder what will come out first, Bayonetta 2 or The Wonderful 101?
3639969	3641090	Live.VogNetwork.com.
3641130	3641850	Clearly The Wonderful 101.
3642270	3649475	Yeah, Wonderful 101 because that's the launch window title and Bayonetta is not even fucking being worked on yet.
3651456	3651957	You know what though?
3652057	3654979	Again, I want to say props to Nintendo for the Bayonetta 2 thing.
3655139	3661223	Now give me like three more of those on that level and we're sitting really, really, really good.
3661563	3664325	Platinum tends to release about one game a year, I think.
3666186	3667467	They don't have to be Platinum games.
3667507	3670609	I'm talking about other exclusive things would be great.
3670829	3675492	No, I'm talking about Platinum games as the company being released.
3676013	3679335	One title they work on about once a year, I think.
3679755	3685839	I think Platinum games did Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns in the US.
3685919	3687220	Even though that's not out yet.
3688221	3692586	Then, of course, they've got, you know, next year, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
3692727	3693207	So, probably 2014.
3694710	3696250	Alright, let's move on with some more Nintendo news.
3696610	3698871	This is a story on the Nintendo Network.
3698891	3700791	We've kind of touched on this, so I'll make this quick.
3701231	3707752	If you shell out the money for the higher-end Wii U, you're going to get not just some more gigabytes, you will get access to Nintendo Network Premium.
3708352	3710573	Nintendo Network is the online service.
3711093	3717054	It's going to be free, but apparently Nintendo said at one point, well, maybe it won't always be free, we just don't know yet.
3717094	3718434	There's a lot we're still figuring out.
3718454	3720495	We haven't figured out the whole network thing.
3720535	3721995	So it looks like what we have now...
3723175	3724397	Nintendo Network Premium
3739676	3740036	Super Mario Bros.
3740056	3740817	2 Gold Mania 3DS
3761115	3770366	is this like a yearly subscription thing or is this just I buy the fancy system you buy the fancy system and you get it now the other thing from the Japanese conference only offered till December 2014
3772645	3773045	Okay.
3773946	3774766	Oh, my God.
3774806	3778269	Will I be able to get it in this, like, two-year window?
3778529	3779290	Yeah, I don't know.
3779750	3787835	Again, there's a lot of question mark here that I'm not, you know, and that's the problem is that after that press conference, there should not have been this many question marks.
3787855	3788816	That's life expectancy of the console.
3788856	3790137	It's a two-year console cycle.
3790877	3791358	Stop.
3791418	3792438	And they'll have the Wii U U.
3793579	3797064	Well, I get if it's only free until December 2014, but then what?
3797444	3798886	What do the non-deluxe people get?
3799206	3800047	Is that all it is?
3800107	3801229	Is it a discount program?
3802330	3803712	Are we still on friend codes?
3803752	3805414	Do we have Nintendo gamer tags now?
3805514	3806976	What's going on?
3807997	3808358	Hello?
3808378	3808478	Hello?
3810376	3811796	I guess I'm not supposed to ask those questions.
3811856	3813377	I'm supposed to say, ooh, Bayonetta, pretty.
3815017	3815478	Moving on.
3816678	3817878	Let's do more Nintendo news.
3818338	3818578	Yes.
3819439	3830922	So websites that are offering pre-orders for the Wii U system, either of the bundles, are marking themselves as being sold out.
3831042	3836764	So the assumption that could be made is that this thing is selling like crazy, at least in the pre-order cycle.
3839798	3844800	It looks like Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Target are sold out online of both versions.
3845021	3851664	Sears and Kmart are only listing the Deluxe as sold out with the cheaper SKU not there at all.
3852404	3855686	Again, GameStop online can't pre-order it.
3855886	3858987	Doesn't really mention Amazon in this article that I'm referencing.
3859007	3861949	Well, there's another issue going on there, but I'll come back to that.
3861969	3866311	So we already kind of talked about this a little bit where Matt was saying, well, we don't know how much...
3867351	3871292	Like Nintendo dictates to them what numbers there are before they have to consider themselves sold out.
3871992	3879334	But it looks like Walmart, grown, who's also making things more difficult because Walmart does their own bundle within the bundle.
3879814	3885376	Walmart Online is offering their Walmart Solution Bundle, which are even more expensive.
3885436	3891037	The basic one with the shit that they are bundling in is $400, and then $450 for the deluxe.
3891397	3893198	We use SKU plus whatever bullshit they're...
3893798	3899342	and so if you want to get in on the Wii U pre-order, Walmart, I guess, is a good place to start.
3899542	3908047	So I guess Nintendo's not looking to have these long lines and stuff this time because if Target and Walmart both did pre-orders and that's where all the lines were showing up before.
3908267	3911550	I'm telling you, if they sold out in one day, it's...
3912410	3913091	There's no way.
3913271	3916794	There's no stories about people lining up at the fucking store to make pre-orders.
3917134	3920617	There's no way that there's a large amount of systems being pre-ordered.
3920757	3926782	Even if everybody fucking rushed down and bum-rushed GameStop, there's no way that they have a lot.
3926962	3930125	But they're doing it, though, so that it makes a good headline.
3930806	3931626	The system's selling out.
3931686	3932807	Look how fast it sold out.
3933368	3937691	Yeah, if I offered one for sale, it would sell out instantly.
3937751	3940614	On a website where you can't see how many they have.
3940854	3942457	I mean, fuck, look at the iPhone 5.
3942979	3944141	Is that shit selling out?
3945103	3947167	And I'm sure they're going to sell millions of those.
3948630	3952318	I just have a hard time believing that there's going to be a lot being sold.
3952774	3953534	They used to carry the 3DS
3977506	3978767	Yeah, but exactly.
3978987	3981648	I bought a 3DS game from them not that long ago.
3981668	3983008	They used to carry the 3DS.
3983088	3986430	The 3DS, they had a problem with people reporting broken hinges.
3986550	3987710	And so they got returned to them.
3988170	3991412	And the thought is that they tried returning those to Nintendo.
3991432	3993373	Nintendo said, fuck you, you're stuck with them.
3993793	3996274	And so they're like, fuck you, we're not carrying your hardware.
3996894	3997514	Which is fine.
3997534	3999455	You know, to be honest, they don't need that shit.
3999475	4000155	Because you know why?
4000415	4002736	The hardware, there's no markup on the hardware.
4002756	4004277	They're making nothing off that.
4004417	4006498	So there's no reason for them to carry it.
4007178	4009900	But Amazon, that's not the type of company Amazon is.
4010060	4014023	Amazon will slit throats to get you to go to their site and buy this shit on their site.
4014043	4020147	I understand that, but if it's come down to where, you know, hey, we're losing hundreds of dollars on this thing.
4020607	4024710	Amazon lost their biggest competitive advantage yesterday.
4025250	4029093	Amazon is now in a whole new world as of yesterday.
4029213	4031535	Guess what changed at Amazon.com yesterday?
4031695	4032735	Started charging tax.
4032775	4033236	That's right.
4033276	4033816	Sales tax.
4033876	4035557	Sales tax in the state of California.
4036858	4038019	and I think a few others too.
4038039	4039240	I don't think it's just California.
4039440	4045504	Because when you file for your state taxes every April in California, it says, did you order something online from out of state?
4045584	4048246	Because please enter the amount here so that we can factor in sales tax.
4048266	4049146	Everyone goes next.
4049406	4050147	Fuck no.
4050387	4053989	I'm sure everybody has always been 100% honest and saved their receipts.
4054049	4057051	They've got a shoebox of receipts and Amazon invoices.
4057151	4058872	Yeah, but now it doesn't matter if you're in California.
4058892	4059153	I don't know.
4059193	4060533	You tell me if I've ordered something.
4060614	4061354	Oh, you don't know?
4061394	4062275	Well, then I didn't.
4062455	4062535	Yeah.
4062555	4062755	Yeah.
4064844	4065124	Outro Music
4075785	4077226	What's this that Bobby's linking me to?
4077306	4081929	He's linking to an actual, it looks like a 3DS Cosmo Black.
4082169	4083390	Ah, here's the trick though.
4083430	4088233	It says 17 left in stock sold by Emacs and fulfilled by Amazon.
4088253	4089454	So technically that's not Amazon.
4089474	4091956	That's one of their little mini sub stores that's doing it.
4092276	4101562	So yes, you can get, okay, if you want to get me on a technicality, you can get the 3DS on Amazon, but it's not going to come from Amazon.
4101902	4103703	No, it's going to come from a third party.
4103903	4104104	Yeah.
4105464	4107045	So, very interesting.
4107985	4115686	I still am surprised that Amazon, you know, despite all that madness, would, you know, it's nothing that the other companies aren't having to put up with.
4115746	4116987	Don't take the returns then.
4117167	4125929	Well, I think it became a problem where, you know, customers were complaining that, you know, it's a defective system and they were just returning them in mass or something.
4125989	4126409	I don't know.
4127329	4130190	But I would assume that would be the only reason why they wouldn't carry it.
4130850	4130990	Hmm.
4132751	4136254	So let's talk a little bit something different than Nintendo for a while.
4148505	4150447	is huge gaming news, like it or not.
4150808	4153591	They come out and say it's a huge gaming handheld.
4153951	4156154	I think even more so than the iPhone 5.
4156514	4162821	I think we all need to not forget, because if you don't even want it for the phone or whatever, there is still the iPod Touch.
4163502	4185485	is that what they call the the ones that are the phones without the phone they announced that too that is basically an iPhone 5 and all those games and all that stuff so despite however you feel about Apple that is a huge you know the Angry Birds of the world is all going to be over there and stuff so that's pretty big gaming news I just wanted to get that out there because those were two big big big gaming stories this week
4186718	4188259	Cool, real racing's on it.
4189019	4189840	Fantastic.
4189860	4195002	Well, the fact that it's a new resolution is a little bit strange, too.
4196323	4198084	Why are they still talking iPad Mini?
4198164	4200005	There's no reason for an iPad Mini.
4200345	4202326	An iPad Mini is an iPod Touch.
4203926	4206308	Why do we still have all these crazy rumors about the iPad Mini?
4206348	4206808	I don't get it.
4208342	4210445	because 7-inch tablets are popular.
4211747	4212688	Just get the iPad.
4212708	4213589	You won't be disappointed.
4214410	4214891	It's pretty.
4216794	4218416	And it has Netflix.
4219898	4221940	Everything fucking has Netflix, okay?
4222461	4223182	Everything.
4224704	4225085	Seriously.
4227213	4234262	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, guitar.
4242633	4247896	and of course, you know, they're saying, you know, today we respond to EA's claims which we believe have no merit.
4247996	4259521	We also filed a counterclaim which addresses actions by EA believed to be anti-competitive and unlawful business practices including legal threats, demands for no higher agreements.
4259641	4267265	We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts on delighting our players and then to which I add with our clone games.
4268025	4270047	Um, but seriously, that's the whole thing.
4270067	4275532	There's like basically saying, oh yeah, no, we're not copying the SimSocial, no.
4276113	4276954	I'm sorry, they are.
4277434	4279256	It's, I mean, come on.
4280377	4286863	Anybody that probably listens to this show that's seen the evidence of them copying many other games, we know better.
4287163	4288244	I mean, who are they trying to fool?
4288645	4289686	Obviously the court, but...
4290626	4292767	I mean, this is also one of those things where it's like a duh.
4292868	4294068	Zynga's not going to take this long.
4294088	4295089	Well, you caught us there.
4295149	4295709	Yeah, we did.
4295829	4296669	You're IDA.
4296770	4298831	Yeah, we were ripping off all your games.
4299271	4299891	Here you go.
4299991	4301752	Here's the billion dollars you were asking for.
4301952	4304133	So this is not a surprise, right?
4304934	4305114	Yeah.
4305194	4305614	Not at all.
4305694	4306034	Come on.
4306434	4306835	And so...
4308866	4319197	I don't know, I mean, of course, you know, they're... Breakman in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Zynga considers copying other people's games to be a completely legal process.
4319878	4322661	I didn't mean to cut you off, but you sounded like you were trailing off with that thought there.
4322701	4326425	No, no, no, they're basically saying, here's their whole reason.
4327366	4329808	It's okay to do what we're doing, basically.
4332071	4341201	Certain modes of expression are customary and necessary to express a genre, such as sitting on a couch, watching TV, taking a shower, and going to sleep in a bed.
4341322	4347469	Such modes of expression are known as scenes affair, are not protectable.
4349651	4372249	Allowing one company to own them would thwart competition, innovation, and creativity Employing scenes off air, functional elements is not a copyright infringement It is how a genre is expressed So what they're saying is, our game looks slightly different But just because a Sim or a Ville person sits down to take a crap Doesn't mean that it's the same thing
4378234	4387577	Except, once again, they're not just copying the fact that this person can take a nap or this person cooks on a stove or something like that.
4387617	4398860	They're copying the character editor or the art style or the menus or the palette for your skin tones.
4400120	4400920	You know, that kind of stuff.
4401841	4401961	Okay.
4403277	4404998	Alright, let's move on to other legal news.
4405518	4406919	This one's a tricky issue.
4407379	4409580	Oh boy, this is, wow.
4410060	4413702	Okay, so who owns the word gamer?
4414122	4418024	G-A-Y-M-E-R, a word that describes a gay gamer.
4418084	4421266	It's kind of a name that the community's taken up a little bit here.
4422006	4428570	You might have heard of GamerCon was a big thing that we were talking about before on the show because I talked about that that's the only Kickstarter I've ever backed.
4429250	4435054	Well, you may or may not have heard of a site, Gamer.org, G-A-Y-M-E-R.org.
4435094	4443040	And back in 2007, the owner, Chris Vizzini, I hope I'm saying that right, announced that he was going to trademark the term gamer.
4443541	4448164	I seem to remember reporting on this back then, because this show's been around a while.
4448204	4452387	And I seem to remember reporting on this back then, saying, I'm not a big fan of this.
4452728	4455890	You know, the fact that he's trying to trademark this word, and I don't think anybody did.
4456270	4458132	Well, I think the part we missed...
4458792	4459733	He got the trademark.
4460333	4466877	The United States gave him the trademark on the word gamer for his website, gamer.org.
4467317	4475803	So the trademark applies to online communities hosting and maintaining an online website for others to discuss, receive, and disseminate information concerning video games.
4476863	4480105	So he owns the trademark on that when it comes to online communities.
4481146	4487450	Well, this past week, a cease and desist letter from Chris Vizzini was sent to Reddit.
4487470	4487770	Reddit.
4489383	4491585	Talk about a David vs. Goliath scenario.
4491705	4495428	The gamers community on Reddit is something like 17,000 some odd people.
4495488	4495848	Gamer.org
4499207	4500588	Not really a big website.
4500808	4504589	It was a good concept, but GayGamer.net kind of came around and did it better.
4505030	4510672	I don't mean any disrespect to Gamer.org because, you know, look at Orange Lounge Radio.
4510752	4514334	Shit, we've been around 10 years and we still haven't made it big, quote unquote.
4514714	4517635	So, you know, I can kind of sympathize in that sort of regard.
4518115	4521056	But I'm not so sure I would have picked my battle with Reddit either.
4521577	4525318	You know, like... Redditors are crazy!
4527299	4530265	We mean that in the nicest possible way.
4530666	4536398	But like, to quote a famous gif of Whoopi Goldberg, you in danger, girl.
4541551	4548895	So and Gamer.org ended up being shut down just like not even a day later with after this whole stuff.
4549476	4550896	So here's the situation.
4550936	4552477	He responded and so forth.
4553098	4553938	Here's his response.
4554198	4563844	I informed the mod team of our gamers that we'd received a cease and desist for the infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed – I'm sorry.
4563884	4564824	Is this – I'm sorry.
4565005	4565425	I am reading –
4566065	4566586	Scratch that.
4566666	4567006	My bad.
4567146	4568868	I am reading what the admin on Reddit said.
4569549	4570830	As I'm reading it here, it doesn't make sense.
4570870	4571091	Okay.
4571211	4571411	Sorry.
4572552	4572993	How embarrassing.
4573693	4584865	I informed the mod team of our gamers that we received a cease and desist letter for infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed us that the letter presents a real threat that they would sue Reddit.
4585666	4592807	I let them know so that they could start planning how to respond, including seeing if there's any way for them to work things out with the owner of the trademark.
4593248	4596288	Now the response from gamer.org.
4597788	4604970	He sent the cease and desist because as a trademark holder, you have to defend your trademark or you will risk losing it.
4605830	4609731	He's emailed Reddit twice before and no response.
4611471	4637110	I started Gamer.org in 2003 and began to build Gamer as a brand That's why I trademarked and wordmarked the name At that time there was only one other site around dedicated to gay gamers I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars on Gamer.org I have done so gladly as it's brought happiness to many people He is not pursuing GamerCon because his trademark is only about online communities
4638010	4647098	I would think though, GamerCon, if they're going to be as big as Fanime or PAX or any other big convention, will probably have an online forum at some point.
4647618	4653664	So I would still be a little worried if I was on the planning board at GamerCon about the impact this could have.
4653804	4653944	Now,
4656724	4677761	you might be curious about my thoughts as a gay gamer and my thoughts is I don't necessarily fault Chris in this circumstance because he does have to defend his trademark he should have never been given that trademark in the first place that's the problem why did they give him that?
4678661	4685487	he should have every right to gamer.org but the word gamer that's a really broad thing to have
4686167	4694254	and especially this far, I mean, there was a dude on the tester whose name was Gamer, his little online thing.
4694855	4700319	That didn't ruffle any feathers, I guess, because again, Gamer doesn't have his own online community.
4700980	4710268	But as many of the folks on Reddit and all around the internet were quick to point out, that word Gamer has existed dating back to Yahoo groups and all this stuff before that.
4710348	4712450	I mean, it's just kind of a little...
4712950	4714855	Play on word that makes a lot of sense.
4714995	4717061	Why was he given the trademark in the first place?
4718649	4720389	Because the patent offices don't know better.
4720789	4721770	Because he filed first.
4722050	4724970	Probably no one thought about trademarking it, so he did.
4725670	4736032	What he could have done if he's just defending it because, oh, I need to and otherwise I will lose my trademark, whatever it is, he could license it to him for free.
4736532	4746134	Okay, yes, you may use this as your forum thing or whatever, but I have the rights to, it is a trademark of blah, blah, blah.
4748018	4751219	That'd be the nice thing to do, I guess.
4751439	4755419	Ranma in chat says, Sky, a treaty alliance between both organizations.
4755579	4755980	I wish.
4756100	4757440	That would be the nice thing to see here.
4757800	4763521	You know, in a minority of a minority community, is this what we really need to have happening right now?
4763721	4764401	This sucks.
4765141	4770122	Like, especially when things are kind of gaining steam with the convention and all this right now, this is a real shot in the foot.
4770142	4772083	This is a terrible time for something like this to happen.
4773983	4781869	I get that Gamer.org feels the need to defend their trademark, and the thousands of dollars they've invested.
4782329	4791636	Shit, we've invested thousands of dollars in this program and the community we've built and all that stuff, but I just kind of think at a certain point, you have to let it go.
4792296	4794078	And you kind of have to just admit...
4794858	4795819	DarkSakura.com
4811780	4813382	or the Reddit.
4814062	4824370	He looks like he was updating it back in August and July and then kind of took off because to get his site back, he had to do a rollback of a month.
4824450	4828053	So a lot of the stuff that was up there was disappeared because there was something up there on the OUYA.
4828673	4832696	I managed to see it before it went down and there was something on there about the OUYA and some of the other stuff.
4832716	4834317	That makes sense.
4834638	4835438	But there's the forums.
4835458	4838941	Again, I mean no disrespect to that community because we have a small community and
4839681	4868992	shit Loki named the Wii U release date in July and I bet you nobody knows that but I don't know but then of course you come around and say well if somebody tried to start a community called Orange Lounge Video would you have a problem with that and there's a part of me that's kind of like yes and no if you're just trying to piggyback on our success yes I'd have a problem with that but at the same time Orange Lounge Radio wasn't exactly our name 100% either and we've always admitted that
4869792	4878735	We were inspired to name ourselves after something we were all fans of, the way a Beatles tribute band might call them Yellow Submarine or something like that.
4879035	4880376	It's very kind of akin to that.
4881036	4893640	But if Orange Lounge had this common meeting, like if Orange Lounge was suddenly the term that everybody called their video game room or something, I think there'd have to be a point where you just kind of let it go.
4894821	4895241	I don't know.
4895561	4895581	I...
4897586	4899669	Loki, you're on the outside looking in.
4899729	4904336	You probably have no reason to go to a gamer Reddit or gamer.org.
4904717	4907241	What do you think of all this kind of back and forth debacle?
4907737	4911360	That's typical trademark copyright garbage.
4912561	4913822	Someone trademarks.
4915103	4924470	If we're going to totally make it non-sexually oriented at all, look at the guy that tried to trademark Mame a while back.
4925211	4933317	A great comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room about this is the USPTO, the same place that gave Langdell his trademark over Edge.
4933877	4934478	Remember that?
4935785	4940369	And then there's not just Edge, but then there is the... What is the other one?
4940389	4942531	The one that hit against Elder Scrolls.
4942791	4943651	Was it Scrolls?
4944152	4945573	Yeah, it's the Mojang game.
4945613	4946554	It's called Scrolls, right?
4946614	4946794	Yeah.
4946954	4949156	Yeah, so there's that whole debacle too.
4949616	4953119	Like, holy hell do we need this stuff re-examined.
4953259	4957663	I mean, we're in this technological age where the laws from the 1700s and 1800s don't work anymore.
4961812	4965754	Again, I really feel like he should have never been given the trademark in the first place.
4966374	4966695	Stop.
4966995	4973518	I mean, I can feel for the guy because it's like, oh, you were given this great thing and now the internet's trying to take it away.
4973598	4975619	But it's like, you shouldn't have had that.
4975759	4977500	You should have gotten gamer.org.
4977540	4978501	That's all yours, buddy.
4978521	4979321	You get that.
4979401	4980141	Let me put it this way.
4980222	4985904	Gamer probably to someone that's not familiar with anything on the internet, people that work at the patent office.
4987205	4991008	and probably, you know, hey, that's a unique thing.
4991048	4992770	You know, we'll go ahead and give it to that guy.
4992790	4998454	I mean, they don't do any research, but that's the problem, though, is they'll just give it to whomever.
4998514	5009463	And, you know, yeah, it kind of sucks for everybody else, but I don't really know where, you know, something becomes so commonly used that they can't trademark it anymore or something.
5009624	5010004	I don't know.
5010164	5011105	I don't really know how that works.
5012594	5024159	Well, as somebody who's supporting GamerCon and would think that logically that's going to have a community at some point, and just like a gamer myself, I kind of think this guy needs to let it go.
5024519	5034463	I understand he wants to defend what he's invested his hard earned money in, but there's a way for everybody to win in this scenario.
5034583	5038725	If he wanted more visibility for his site, why not work with Reddit?
5040185	5060298	it's a pretty powerful if you want to get yourself promoted you want to get the word around the internet reddit's a pretty fucking great place to go for that type of stuff you know there it seems like they could he could have got more for his site working with reddit than he's getting working against them and that goes for any large large large online community
5063055	5065557	And I hate seeing these factions fight.
5065697	5066137	It sucks.
5066757	5067678	Alright, moving on.
5068398	5069959	I need some happier news or something.
5070239	5071100	Can you deliver, Alan?
5071665	5074007	Not really happy news, but some sassy news.
5074407	5075228	Okay, I'll take sassy.
5075568	5080933	So this is probably one of the most ludicrous stories that I've reported on whenever I've guest-hosted on this show.
5082294	5094984	Electronic arts usually, I won't say butted heads, but they've had snippy things to say about Valve and Steam in the past, where I guess that one EA guy was saying that...
5096645	5126288	when Steam discounts games as much as it does and has those crazy 99 cent sales and stuff that it sort of devalues PC games and this that and the other even though indie developers have come out and said that putting their game on Steam versus Xbox Live was one of the best things they ever did blah blah blah the Origin client for which became a mandatory thing for Mass Effect 3 is fucking terrible and EA and Origin doesn't have the sales that Steam does and blah blah blah so EA is always trying to be up Valve's ass and
5126448	5131809	I guess EA on two different occasions have tried to enter talks with Valve to purchase the company.
5133210	5139991	Going upwards of some of the preliminary talks they did offered up to a billion dollars if Valve was going to take the offer seriously.
5140031	5144132	That's how much they were willing to front to start the conversation.
5144793	5150414	And Gabe Newell is like, no, that's not going to happen.
5151274	5151734	Quote,
5154295	5168939	Co-owner and company founder Gabe Newell, however, said that the likelihood of his fiercely independent company selling to an electronic arts or one of the other major multinational publishers like Activision or Ubisoft is about as likely as Nintendo selling off the Mario brand.
5169359	5173900	Newell said that Valve would sooner disintegrate than sell out to a major publisher.
5174680	5185426	It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say, let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to have our employment agreements terminate.
5186047	5188768	So, yeah, EA, I guess, has tried to buy Valve.
5189629	5190529	And it sounds ridiculous.
5190569	5191650	One of the dumbest things I've ever heard.
5192671	5200916	And we don't even know what Valve is doing with the fact that they're... The story that we covered last week where Valve's looking for industrial engineers for this maybe...
5201716	5205357	PC box that's going to run Steam maybe on television sets.
5205497	5206997	That's what people are speculating on.
5207057	5212999	So we don't know what Valve is up to, but obviously they're not in a position to be bought by anyone.
5213899	5218180	And they have more money than God because Steam is like... Steam has how many?
5219680	5223761	Steam already commands a membership of 54 billion active users and growing.
5223961	5226602	So they're not in want for money.
5227863	5228704	For EA to buy them.
5229124	5232628	I would say it's surprising that EA's tried to buy Valve.
5232908	5234289	I don't think that's surprising.
5235050	5240876	It gives me warm fuzzies to know that Gabe Newell basically laughed in their face.
5241416	5242538	That gives me warm fuzzies.
5243581	5245902	Especially after that PopCap story from last week.
5245962	5249944	Yeah, from a business standpoint, if you're a company as big as EA, hey, they make good shit.
5249984	5251445	Let's say, hey, hey, you guys for sale?
5251985	5252726	That's legit.
5252866	5254626	EA can ask that of whoever they want.
5254687	5257328	But Gabe Newell is like, no.
5257348	5259189	That's what's funny.
5259369	5261630	I love this comment from MM2K in our chat room.
5261950	5264411	Thank God the people at Valve own Valve.
5264852	5267013	EA buying it would be the coming of Satan.
5270512	5271793	That's not a dramatic statement.
5271933	5273893	Would EA bring Half-Life 3 out faster?
5273913	5274673	Because I don't know.
5275974	5277214	No, you didn't.
5277474	5278214	Oh, no, you didn't.
5278554	5280435	And Zynga buying it would be ultra Satan.
5283916	5286157	I want somebody to buy Valve and legitimize them.
5286897	5287657	Is that possible?
5289958	5292318	EA should buy Zynga.
5292859	5294479	What better way to settle this whole thing?
5296769	5297390	That would be funny.
5297510	5298632	It would be hilarious.
5299414	5300275	Anyhow, that would happen.
5300335	5304623	Activision buys Zynga and then rolls it in with Blizzard and the sky turns black.
5305124	5308470	Oh, can you imagine how terrible World of Warcraft would be?
5309512	5310012	Possibly.
5312042	5314043	It already got worse when Activision bought them.
5314063	5319185	But anyway, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, VOG, however, would not say F you to EA.
5319545	5321766	EA, bring your money trucks to my house, please.
5322186	5323146	Wait a minute, Bobby.
5323746	5325207	It's not a gaming station.
5326467	5329568	EA doesn't have interest in the... Gaming is one part of nerddom.
5331029	5331409	That's fine.
5331429	5332649	They can roll those money trucks up.
5333469	5335150	I'll be able to sell my gaming part of it.
5335990	5336351	That's true.
5336371	5338494	I think all of us are sitting here going, yeah, we'd sell out.
5339716	5339936	Money?
5340076	5340277	Sure.
5341378	5341679	All right.
5343261	5343882	Let's move on.
5343982	5349491	Travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you in a country near you.
5349992	5350813	Loki, start us off.
5351842	5353384	There's some decent stuff coming out this week.
5353464	5358748	Of course, we've got Borderlands 2 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.
5359769	5369158	The Kirby's Dream Collector's Special Edition, that's way too many adjectives for that, that's coming out on the Wii this week.
5370199	5371440	NCIS 3D on the 3DS.
5373021	5384855	Hotel Transylvania on the DS and 3DS Collectors Editions for Borderlands 2 Deluxe Vault Hunter Collectors Edition and the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition that's coming out as well
5386116	5387456	Ultimate Loot Chest Edition.
5387916	5388817	I almost got that.
5389377	5391157	The chest on that thing is huge.
5391517	5397479	Although the collector's edition for Black Ops 2 looks pretty sweet.
5398319	5399099	And it has a bigger chest.
5399979	5401900	It's all about the bigger chest.
5402100	5405400	Formula One 2012 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5405440	5409741	The Street Fighter 25th Anniversary Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3.
5415412	5417774	and Kinect Sports Ultimate Collection.
5417934	5420676	It's a re-release of Kinect Sports 1 and 2 on one disc.
5421557	5422598	It's coming out on 360.
5423419	5428623	Harley Pasternak's Hollywood Workout on Xbox 360 and the Wii.
5430405	5439293	And this week we get our Kinect TV games, Kinect Sesame Street TV and Kinect National Geo or Nat Geo TV on 360 as well.
5441567	5442427	When's Surface coming?
5442447	5442847	Do we know yet?
5442907	5443848	I'm sorry.
5445108	5446969	What the hell was that thing called they showed at E3?
5447189	5447689	The Surface?
5448229	5451430	No, the name of the... Is it called Surface?
5451830	5455691	The thing that'll let my iPad be a touch controller for me.
5455831	5456611	Oh, Smart Glass.
5456671	5457592	Thank you, Smart Glass.
5457672	5459132	That's in the fall update, I think.
5459252	5461173	Surface is the Microsoft touch.
5461193	5462593	We still don't know when that's coming either.
5462613	5463473	Surface is the tablet.
5463534	5467395	I thought it's in Vegas for slot machines or in Digital Blackjack and that's it.
5467855	5468555	That's all it is.
5468735	5476180	We had a great... I will say, when we went to PAX 08 or whatever, we had a great bonding time with Bobby sitting around one of those... Was somebody else with us too?
5477201	5478041	Maybe for a little bit.
5478161	5483425	I want to say one of the gals from the Bay Area that's also podcasting was there with us.
5483865	5486127	But we were having some bonding time around Microsoft Surface.
5486147	5486707	It was good times.
5487628	5488008	Good times.
5489198	5489858	All right, let's move on.
5490779	5494301	Let's take a look at release dates in Japan, starting with the Xbox 360.
5494381	5496442	Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, hey!
5498083	5500044	It's new for Japan coming out of there.
5500084	5501805	I'm assuming this is some type of localized version.
5502585	5511110	There is also Majiten, Majiditenshei Suksei Mita in limited and regular edition is coming out this week.
5511190	5515733	I'm not sure exactly what this is, but based on some of the screenshots...
5516853	5517493	Yeah!
5518414	5519894	It's naked anime chicks!
5520334	5521134	Look at that boobie!
5521935	5522555	Oh, excuse me, not boobie.
5522575	5523195	Look at that booty!
5523815	5527336	Yeah, naked anime girls, but their faces look like they're 12.
5527436	5529277	That is how the Xbox... Ew!
5529317	5531918	That's how the Xbox 360's gonna sell in Japan.
5531938	5533338	That's how you sell a Wii U. That's...
5534858	5536299	That's how you steal a Wii U right there.
5537921	5543966	The little LCD controller is x-ray, so the TV, she's got her top on it, but then you lift the controller and it's... That's how you do it.
5544266	5546448	Nelly's watching American Idol on the TV.
5546768	5548349	You're watching porn on the Wii U tablet.
5548369	5551131	They had, and I don't remember what the hell the game was called.
5551172	5552993	They had a game that came out in the UK.
5553033	5555095	It was on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
5555695	5576568	and it was like one of those not like a Leisure Suit Larry or like a Playboy the Mansion game but there was something like that where you're picking up women and you have to do weird things you know to get in their favor but one of the mini games had to do with manipulating their nipples and what were the nipples but the two analog sticks wow it was great awesome
5577128	5580391	All right, PlayStation 3, big releases this week.
5580431	5584374	We have Daikokai Jidai Online Second Age.
5584535	5588558	I don't know what game this translates to, but there's a regular and limited edition.
5588878	5590600	It looks like some type of online game.
5590740	5597166	I'm getting a vibe similar to like a Final Fantasy XI-esque or a White Knight Chronicles almost even, this kind of looks like to me.
5597546	5601308	Akatsuki no Gai Trinity Eureka 7 AO Jungfrau no Hanabana Tachi Video Game and Hybrid Anime Disc
5621401	5632888	F1 2011, Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning, Shin Sangoku Musou 6 Empires, that's Dynasty Warrior if I'm not mistaking, and a new wireless headset from Sony is all coming out this week.
5632948	5634789	Big week in Japan there on the PlayStation 3.
5634829	5636491	Yeah, they do have a new wireless headset.
5636511	5637851	I'm not really sure what it is though.
5638232	5640954	I just saw it the other day in their system.
5641074	5641494	Why not?
5641674	5644056	Quickly looking at the handhelds, checking out the Vita.
5644136	5644976	Oh, Little Big Planet.
5644996	5645977	That's kind of a big release.
5646017	5646958	That's out in Japan this week.
5647758	5648459	Little Big Planet.
5648999	5650360	And did you say that's coming out here too?
5651041	5665102	we'll be playing it in a couple weeks damn, I really want to play that lastly on the 3DS, nothing this week, strangely, everything's next week for the 3DS, nothing this week let's travel to the UK Alan, are you able to fill in for Jamie tonight?
5666542	5674193	Yes, over in the UK, starting on September 18th, Connect Nat Geo TV and Connect Sesame Street TV.
5675375	5677718	On the 19th of September, LittleBigPlanet on the Vita.
5678579	5682485	20th of September, Rayman Jungle Run on the Android and iPad.
5683291	5705995	Torchlight 2 for PC September 21st F1 2012 for PS3 PC and 360 I think this title is being listed twice one in English one in Japanese but One Piece Kaizoku Musou and also One Piece Pirate Warriors that has the same box art I'm assuming it's the same game Borderlands 2 on September 21st and then that's it for that week
5707803	5726130	Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom this is why I love having chatters live.vognetwork.com they set us straight when we're wrong Alpha Kanatagram says LittleBigPlanet Vita came out two days ago Sony said fuck it and released it early I'm playing it now the box version is not although now I have to charge my Vita
5726880	5754178	I know, I'm all about LittleBigPlanet on the Vita, I'm excited about that I was just a target today, if I'd seen that I would have snatched it up It's not been released box, maybe digitally I think somebody broke street date, I think GameStop broke street date I seem to remember now, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine that said GameStop broke street date Oh, I'm not surprised, they do that shit all the time Oh, but if anyone else breaks street date, all hell's gonna break loose Ooh, somebody's bitter over there
5754468	5760393	Well, no, seriously, they're the big proponents of not having street dates in the first place because they have a competitive advantage over everybody else.
5760513	5763216	Alpha Cananogram says, I have the box version.
5763376	5763916	It's out.
5764136	5773785	Black Wolf says, it's only on sale at the Evil G. Black Wolf said, Sony told Evil G to break street dates.
5775950	5776230	Weird.
5776490	5777051	Fuckers!
5777631	5780213	It's not supposed to be out for a couple weeks, but okay.
5780754	5781074	Cool.
5781954	5784456	That'll make for an interesting conversation.
5784576	5785377	I'm waiting two weeks.
5785397	5788359	I'm not going to you-know-where just to get LittleBigPlanet.
5788379	5790641	I'm excited about LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not that excited.
5791341	5796225	Too bad, Sony, because a great way to get my attention would have been to do that before Mr. Pandaria's out.
5796245	5801249	Because if you're going to try and get my attention after Mr. Pandaria's out, yeah, good luck.
5803010	5803490	Who am I kidding?
5803510	5804391	I'll still get LittleBigPlanet.
5804738	5807300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5834857	5841964	of military installations on the island of Lemnos, Greece.
5843625	5857597	And of course they were caught and they had the footage and stuff and apparently it's illegal, I'm surprised, legal to take video and photographs of military installations.
5858478	5858638	So...
5860840	5861621	Yeah, that's not good.
5863102	5868306	And, of course, you know, Bohemia Interactive, you know, they've confirmed it, yes.
5868326	5876793	You know, they were arrested during their holiday trip, and it says they visited the island with the sole purpose of experiencing the island's beautiful surroundings.
5877814	5877974	And...
5881781	5882421	Yeah, I don't know.
5883302	5883962	That kind of sucks.
5884242	5888784	But, I mean, it's against the law to take pictures of that stuff, so maybe you shouldn't.
5889684	5890824	That's crazy.
5891104	5899267	Maybe, you know, the Greek military would not like you putting their military installation in your game.
5900668	5901328	I'm just saying.
5901348	5902148	Might not be a good thing.
5902248	5902889	Might not be a good thing.
5902969	5903549	Might not be good.
5904649	5906130	Wow, that's crazy.
5907111	5907491	All right.
5908292	5910795	Can I tell a true story that's completely random once?
5911156	5915041	I went to Canada in 2006 with my good friend John at the time.
5916162	5920768	He was my roommate when we had the studio in the garage, so I can't remember if he ever popped on OLR or not.
5920788	5923572	He played Final Fantasy, and that's about it.
5925693	5928795	We went to Canada together and he's a big picture taker.
5928875	5929875	Takes pictures of everything.
5930115	5933497	He'll take pictures of food at the dinner table, take pictures of signs, whatever.
5933517	5934377	He'll take pictures of everything.
5934737	5942340	So we're in the little line waiting at the airport because the plane lands, you have to go through customs first before you get to technically enter the country, right?
5942700	5943921	He's taking pictures in customs.
5944841	5947424	Which, okay, he's being a dumb tourist, whatever.
5947764	5951288	So we get up to the front and the lady behind the thing is all, it's this one.
5951908	5955091	And the security guard comes up and is like, what kind of pictures are you taking?
5955772	5957013	And he's like scared shitless.
5957614	5960417	And so he's like showing the guy on the camera the pictures he's taken.
5960837	5963019	And like the lady behind the counter is like, why are you shaking?
5963059	5963660	Why are you nervous?
5963880	5966262	And we're like, fucking Canada's hardcore.
5966282	5966663	Yeah.
5967864	5975028	But keep in mind, this was only five years after a major event that changed the way we travel in many ways.
5976149	5978090	So he was just like, honestly, he didn't know better.
5978171	5980812	But yeah, they don't fuck around with picture taking and stuff like that.
5980852	5986016	Even though he was just taking pictures of the Canadian and the US flags together and the signs.
5986416	5989818	Nothing you or I would think is bad, but they don't know that.
5989878	5991720	And apparently there's some top secret shit in there.
5991740	5993721	They don't want people knowing how the system works or whatever.
5994782	5996623	The true origin of maple syrup.
5998229	5999334	It's people!
6000098	6001042	It's people!
6003838	6007379	Alright, let's go to a much simpler time.
6008920	6014161	When all you needed to get to Canada was a birth certificate, not a passport.
6014961	6018962	It's a segment we call the classic game of the week.
6019402	6026905	Every week, DarkSakura likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey, you kids ought to be playing this game this week.
6026965	6027945	But she's not here.
6027965	6028005	Oh!
6029886	6032148	So we get to tap into my brain instead tonight.
6033409	6035390	Sometimes Alan will do this, sometimes Loki will do this.
6035430	6036171	Tonight I'm doing it.
6036704	6041085	So, tonight's classic game of the week is a real old, old game.
6041706	6047107	Tonight's classic game of the week is Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.
6048448	6049268	That's right.
6051069	6054050	Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns was on a lot of systems back in the 80s.
6054110	6056630	It dates all the way back to the Atari 2600, actually.
6056670	6059771	It was the original releases on the Atari 2600 from 1984.
6060132	6063593	I remember this game fondly from the Commodore 64 games.
6065955	6067118	It was on a lot of different systems.
6067598	6071807	The 5200, the ColecoVision, the MSX, the ZX Spectrum, the PC Booter.
6071827	6072167	Apple II.
6072308	6075434	It was on a lot of different systems.
6076550	6082975	The reason why I picked Pitfall 2 over Pitfall 1 is that personally I have a lot more fond memories playing this one.
6083776	6089060	And I think this really lends itself to a lot of the games that we have today.
6089441	6097968	Pitfall 2 was about exploring the cavern, whereas Pitfall 1 was really just kind of like a very linear... Remember Pitfall 1 was just kind of like you didn't...
6098408	6101409	You could go down in the cave and skip screens, but it was very linear.
6101729	6110471	Pitfall 2 really fleshed out that feeling of like, I can go down here and then I can backtrack and go back here and get the item I got here to go get the rat over here.
6111411	6119933	And it was one of the first games on the Atari 2600 to have background music, a similar piece to the one you're hearing right now from the Commodore 64 version.
6123888	6128652	Pitfall 2 was similar to Pitfall 1, but obviously Lost Caverns had a lot of different features.
6129052	6131414	Pitfall Harry had unlimited time and lives.
6131574	6133996	The original game was limited to, I think, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
6134476	6136418	So you could never lose the game.
6136698	6137959	You never could actually die.
6138359	6142723	Whenever you would get hit, you will just flash back and the sad little music plays.
6143163	6144905	Pitfall 2 has 27 Horizontal Levels
6161402	6166307	They're all about the same height, but sometimes there's balloons that will let you go up to new areas.
6167348	6177197	There are no snakes or crocodiles like there were in Pitfall 1, but there are scorpions, there are bats, there's condors, electric eels in the water and frogs.
6178638	6185341	There was also not just Pitfall Harry, but there was his little friends, the Mountain Lion, which was Quick Claw, and there was Ronda.
6185361	6186442	And that was the object of the game.
6186482	6192025	You were trying to save Ronda, Quick Claw, and I believe find a diamond ring was like all that stuff.
6193044	6198526	All those characters ended up appearing on the Saturday Supercade children's cartoon that's based on Pitfall.
6199427	6204649	Ronda and Quick Claw were actually created for that before this game was released about a year sooner.
6205109	6209311	The maximum possible score in the game, 199,000 points.
6209771	6213893	That is different from the Atari 8-bit and 52 version that I'll get into in a minute.
6214913	6220614	You can actually see Quick Claw, one of the goals of the game, you see him right under you when you start the game.
6221355	6230257	So that's kind of cool that like, that's probably the last thing you'll collect as you're doing the game, is that you kind of end up where you started.
6230737	6235698	It's kind of a neat little, you know, especially for game design back in the day, it was kind of neat that you ended up where you started there.
6237579	6251408	of course the soundtrack as well that would change keys and stuff depending on how well you're doing what you're hearing in the background right now is kind of like the heroic theme whenever you collect a treasure you'll hear a ding and it starts over if you die there's a slower theme that plays
6252208	6253829	So this was a huge game on the Atari 2600.
6253929	6256190	It was really pushing the envelope.
6257271	6264455	The hardware was six years old when this game came out, but Pitfall 2 brought scrolling, detailed animation, and of course the musical score.
6265355	6275801	David Crane actually designed and patented a display processor chip which would enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and could process the music in three channels plus drums.
6276661	6284268	They were hoping that this would push the limits of the Atari 2600, but considering this came out in 84, what else happened around that same time?
6284708	6285769	The video game crash.
6285969	6288591	So this kind of came out when the party was already over.
6289312	6291594	Now there's another version of the game that's really cool.
6291954	6293655	It's the Adventurers Edition.
6293675	6297418	This is only available on the 5200 and the Atari 8-bit versions.
6299841	6299901	Huh.
6323510	6330912	Well, they came out and said, they being the marketing, they said, no, the two versions are not allowed to be different.
6330952	6338015	Because you may think things are bad now where you have the same game on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.
6338055	6344757	But back in the day, dude, it was Apple, Commodore, Coleco, Atari, Intellivision.
6344877	6349939	Like, you can go find ads from old gaming magazines that would show you screenshots from ten different versions of the game.
6349959	6350359	Yeah, there were...
6351259	6354141	Usually anywhere between six to eight valid platforms.
6354481	6356602	Really small niche ones during that time.
6356682	6357183	Early 80s.
6357583	6358103	Absolutely.
6358183	6361705	So marketing said, no, you can't have different sections of the game.
6362146	6363446	So what happened?
6363947	6366108	Well, Brad Freger, who is the producer...
6366508	6368509	They left it in and made it an Easter egg.
6368789	6371810	So they just kind of hid it away in the game, but you can get it.
6372310	6375792	So the new level will have way more challenging stuff.
6375832	6379413	There's new creatures, rabbit bats that fly more erratically.
6379493	6381354	They also will reverse direction.
6382274	6384915	There's also frogs that go all the way across the screen.
6385355	6387116	Fire ants and piranha fish.
6387836	6389217	We're fast creatures as well.
6390518	6391659	Yeah, all this stuff was new.
6391799	6394380	And then you have to collect different items as well.
6395161	6398663	You would get a rope, a pot, a trumpet, and a snake charmer.
6399103	6404387	And what happens is that you get all the way to the last guy and it would scroll across the bottom of the screen.
6404667	6407249	Charming the golden rope is Pitfall Harry's only hope.
6407609	6411912	So it brings the game full circle because if you have the rope, the pot, the trumpet, the snake charmer...
6412512	6413513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6433331	6436092	There is also, and I'll leave it at this, there was an arcade version.
6436252	6438313	Sega made an arcade version in 1985.
6438413	6440454	It was very different.
6440854	6442175	It looked very cartoonish.
6442235	6443756	It looked very Alex Kidd to me.
6444356	6445896	But it had definitely some elements.
6445956	6447197	It had some of the similar music.
6447237	6451239	In fact, do we have... I think I should have here ready... Yes.
6451679	6452699	Here's the Sega version.
6452859	6454740	And you can hear it's a little bit similar here.
6455380	6456461	If we actually fast forward...
6461892	6464613	So it's kind of like similar, but the game design is very different.
6464653	6466274	It's split up into four stages.
6466734	6469335	There is a timer because it was an arcade game.
6470396	6475818	And, you know, there is kind of a definitive beginning and end that doesn't have to do with collecting the same things you did.
6475878	6480361	So it was kind of like they took the name and the idea and made this completely different type of game out of it.
6480401	6481321	But it's worth checking out.
6481361	6485483	That's, of course, the Sega version of Pitfall 2 The Lost Caverns that was out in the arcade.
6486143	6487464	One other port...
6488264	6489846	Super Pitfall on the NES
6509545	6529296	The week it was released because I was such a fan of Pitfall 2 Super Pitfall is absolute fucking garbage It is one of the worst games they ever released on the NES It is buggy as shit There's flickering Go look at some of the long plays that are on YouTube People walking through walls and shit Like Waters...
6529876	6557745	water caverns that just suddenly end and you can fall down a waterfall to like a whole new level things like that like it just doesn't fucking make sense like it's one of the seriously it is like somebody pooed in a cartridge and put it out it is one of the worst NES games they ever made and when you're that young or at least in my experience it takes because we're not obviously we weren't as discriminating back then to realize oh no I was I played it and I was like this is fucking garbage
6558465	6560750	Even as a 10-year-old, I was like, what the shit?
6560770	6561792	It took like a day or two, though, right?
6561832	6562133	Or no?
6562233	6562574	No!
6563155	6566161	Like, even the first time I played it, I was like, that doesn't even look like Pitfall Harry.
6566462	6569007	Who's this blue munchkin with the mustache?
6570516	6572557	Fuck this guy in the hard hat.
6573478	6574378	It was terrible.
6575659	6575799	Ugh.
6576539	6578040	Breakman in chat backing me up.
6578100	6579561	Sky is a million percent correct.
6579601	6581802	Super Pitfall is one of the worst games ever made.
6582202	6583343	It is such garbage.
6583443	6589726	I would love for some month on the show to have Jamie change this segment and do the unclassic game of the week.
6590667	6594589	And I'll tell you, Super Pitfall is one of the worst games that ought to be featured.
6595629	6597290	Anyhow, let's not focus on the bad.
6597350	6598291	Let's go back to the good.
6599092	6607437	If you're going to play an Atari 2600 game at some point in your life, because maybe you weren't born yet when the Atari 2600 was kind of a big deal, go play Pitfall 2.
6608298	6611660	It was a great game that really pushed the envelope for the technology of the Atari 2600.
6613672	6614012	All right.
6615233	6617155	Let's move on and take a break.
6617855	6622659	We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we have plenty more show to come, which is great because Part A was two hours.
6623119	6632547	So we're going to come back with some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, as well as more news stories, including a really interesting Microsoft patent we've got to talk about when we come back.
6632847	6638972	Your emails, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics, and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6645294	6652256	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 473rd episode for this September the 16th of 2012.
6653436	6660958	Kind of a long show so far, but lots of talk this week about the news on Wii U and all that good stuff in Part A, and then there was other stuff, too.
6661258	6665859	I don't even think Loki has gotten to officially talk about Earth Defense Sports, the new one, yet.
6666179	6667280	Is that even on the show roll?
6667300	6667700	Nah, probably not.
6667720	6668460	How did that happen?
6670162	6671143	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6697137	6704339	Podcast listeners, you won't notice a thing different except the fact that the show was taped a little bit early, so the news might be just a couple days behind.
6704399	6709620	But you should still have the same great show, and DarkSakura will be back for that taping on Thursday.
6711660	6711920	Let's see.
6711960	6712741	Did I cover everything?
6712821	6713281	I think so.
6713481	6716962	I think we're getting ready to get back to it with some rapid-fire news.
6717282	6718102	So, Loki.
6718542	6739415	All right, so we talk about Kickstarter pretty regularly, and there's a new Kickstarter from a developer that you might recognize, Obsidian, famous for Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout New Vegas, the new South Park game that's going to be coming out.
6740785	6745168	Well, they're kickstarting a new project called Project Eternity for PC.
6745408	6757797	It's a new MMO, kind of like a fantasy world game, and their goal was to raise $1.1 million, and they pretty much have already hit their goal.
6758798	6764162	Actually, they already have hit their goal, and they're going beyond that now to the stretch goals, but...
6765923	6771865	So if you want to back them up, check out what they have to offer as far as what the game's going to be about.
6773325	6773565	Cool.
6775166	6781607	And I know I remember reading a tweet that Notch had kicked them, I think, 10 grand or something.
6781687	6783008	So that's kind of cool.
6783428	6784648	Yeah.
6784868	6791430	And then, of course, if you're into some time waster stuff, there's a cool Flash game that was created by...
6793619	6795840	IndieGames.com 2012-09 Freeware Game Pick Pac-Man Portal
6817052	6822955	I'm sure you can just search for Pac-Man Portal in Google and find it just as well.
6823196	6823716	It's kind of neat.
6823896	6826437	You can teleport around the map.
6827158	6831820	And then last but not least, a brand new update is going to be coming to the PlayStation 3 very soon.
6833761	6838144	4.25, and that's going to be the update, of course, that's going to give the increased storage space for PlayStation Plus.
6838524	6838985	Thanks for watching!
6851820	6852280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6871375	6879021	If all you want is kind of the bare bones little portable Neo Geo X thing that I believe, if I remember right, you can hook it up to a television through the system as well.
6879041	6879382	Probably.
6879442	6884245	Kind of like some of those bootleg Nintendos that are coming more and more prevalent you see now.
6884446	6885627	What was that one you got me called?
6885647	6887008	I can't remember the name of that thing now.
6887608	6887788	The...
6888909	6890230	FC Mobile, is that it?
6890250	6890771	Something like that?
6891531	6895274	Anyhow, if you just want the little handheld device itself, it will be $130.
6895715	6901659	This is a Neo Geo that comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo games.
6902020	6909986	So you could spend that money on a Neo Geo X, so 20 games, or almost have enough money for a Wii U tablet in Japan.
6910166	6912268	Or you can buy a Dingu and it plays the same stuff.
6912288	6912828	Yeah.
6913849	6931071	The Dingu Ate My Baby Double Dragon Neon If you are listening live to Orange Lounge Radio you heard a song or two from the soundtrack during the break If you are on the podcast sadly I can't replay the songs due to rights issues during the break but good news you can get the soundtrack for free
6932312	6932972	Check that out.
6933112	6936093	It is available for free on the site Bandcamp.
6936973	6941174	vert.bandcamp.com slash album slash double dash dragon dash neon.
6941854	6943454	That link is floating around the internet.
6944074	6944894	Here's the thing, though.
6945454	6948195	You can contribute however much you want.
6948535	6957597	You can put a big fat zero in that box if you want, but if you have the money to chip in or you find you do enjoy the soundtrack, maybe go back and give a
6959617	6961918	Who's basically making the soundtrack free.
6962279	6964580	It's not just remakes of the old songs.
6964640	6969183	There's also inspired music from the 80s.
6969903	6974466	There was definitely a song in that first stage that sounded like it was Heart or some shit playing in the background.
6974506	6975126	It was great.
6975867	6976447	It's great.
6977548	6978248	So good job.
6978668	6984112	That is Jake Kaufman who goes by Vert, which is why it's on vert.bandcamp.com.
6985272	6988775	And I definitely wanted to tip the hat to this at some point tonight.
6988916	6990097	I think this is a great cause.
6990657	6993780	And I know we have a variety of different people that listen to OLR.
6993820	6999265	And I know for a fact that there's some people out there who are facing some disability in their gaming.
6999345	7003268	Perhaps it's that they are blind, can't see at all.
7003688	7010915	Or I've heard of some folks that are unable to use all of their limbs or some of the other things that people take for granted sometimes.
7011315	7022400	Well, the Able Gamers Foundation created a 48-page document that they want to have be a how-to guide for developers and publishers on how to create more accessible games.
7023000	7025981	In a quote from founder Mark Barlett, quote, And I love this.
7040126	7050569	They actually put like a little screenshot of Bejeweled 3 and they say, this is what Bejeweled 3 looks like to, you know, the most gamers, gamers that don't face a visual disability.
7051089	7055230	But then they show, this is what it looks like to somebody who can only see in black and white.
7055731	7061672	This is what it looks like to somebody who has red colorblind or blue colorblind or whatever it is, green colorblind.
7062132	7067114	It shows kind of the different ways the screens look and I think that's a great way to get somebody to, you know, think about their game.
7067954	7080754	and I love this in the PDF document they actually show like a list they actually show like a checklist of you know keep this checklist handy this is what your game should have and it's things like remappable buttons
7082619	7084721	I don't even really face a disability.
7084741	7091224	I'm very thankful and fortunate and lucky that I don't have these same challenges that other people do in their lives.
7091605	7094366	But even I can appreciate a game with remappable buttons.
7094947	7099829	Because, damn, sometimes you look at the default controls and you're like, why is the game this way?
7099869	7103892	Or sometimes you have a joystick that, you know, a controller or whatever that...
7104452	7107534	A button wears out on it.
7107554	7113596	For some reason, these Microsoft controllers, the wired ones, the L3 button breaks a lot.
7114437	7115657	So it'd be cool to remap that.
7115757	7121240	And AbleGamers believes every game should have remappable buttons, which just makes sense.
7121260	7122100	And then it's other things.
7122280	7124441	Sometimes, think about the Vita.
7124481	7131645	When the Vita first came out, if you're blind, you can't use a touchscreen the same way somebody that can see can.
7132525	7160554	so why on earth would you not make it so that or why on earth would you make it so you can't use the controller to choose well thankfully the Vita patched that in in their last patch but it was because of response like this undoubtedly so anyway I know I spent a little time on that but I thought that was a great great document that they put out that I do think every game developer company out there ought to have a little printed copy of it somewhere for reference I think it would be a good thing Alan are you gonna go with your rapid-fire stories
7162361	7165064	Yes, just get the thing when it beeps.
7165685	7176398	Terraria, a game that sold 1.6 million on PC, most of that probably through Steam, is coming to XBLA and PlayStation Network in early 2013.
7178760	7204668	and I have Terraria I've only really tinkered with it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes but I know that it's I don't want to say that it's a 2D Minecraft but it's it's an adventure game with a lot of building and exploration you dig into tunnels and you find monsters and it's just a really huge indie hit from the last I think two years you have Terraria right didn't you didn't you have a bunch of people trying I do I bought it for like three other people too yeah I doubt and I bet none of them are playing it
7205410	7214793	Yeah, so Terraria, if you're a Terraria fan, the graphics are very cutesy, Super NES, 16-bit, pixely, cute look.
7214953	7219935	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says the Terraria hardcore are pissed about this news.
7220695	7220795	Oh.
7220895	7223236	This is right up there with the Bayonetta 2 being on the Wii U.
7224739	7230341	Someone's Cool Kids Club is having its pretension barriers lifted.
7230581	7235743	We have a saying, and it's deal with it, and then shades will fall from the sky and fall right on your nose.
7235843	7239084	Yeah, sorry that I'm not a part of the cult of Traria, but it's, you know.
7239344	7240265	What was it you said earlier?
7240345	7241145	Go pee your bed.
7241305	7242485	Yeah, go pee your bed.
7244726	7245687	What else do I have?
7248295	7251277	Shifty Look, I'm not sure who that is.
7251877	7254319	There's a Katamari webcomic coming out by them.
7255540	7257621	And the art direction looks great.
7257661	7260102	It looks very weird and silly like Katamari does.
7261183	7264765	And September... Oh, this is already out.
7265245	7266266	No, tomorrow, actually.
7267387	7270789	The new Katamari webcomic will debut on ShiftyLook.com on September 17, 2012.
7271929	7272530	So that's tomorrow.
7272590	7276973	It's a free-to-read series based on the popular junk-rolling package flashing...
7278013	7279954	and Namco Bandai Gaming Franchise.
7280514	7281995	It will be updated twice a week.
7282815	7289158	So, yeah, if you're into Katamari, there's going to be an official... Looks like this is a... Namco doesn't have a problem with it.
7289878	7291279	Webcomic for you to read and enjoy.
7291959	7296741	And there's a... I can paste the link in the chat and you can see what the art is going to look like.
7298602	7305625	My last quickfire news story is people are wondering, especially with Capcom, I guess the story we covered last week about...
7306885	7307105	Watch.
7307145	7307365	Watch.
7332270	7347948	watch so yeah the 25th anniversary is looming and people are like saying Capcom's gonna do something but Capcom used to be that cool they're not that cool anymore if they were gonna release it they were gonna they would have announced it by now
7348263	7349304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7367154	7372158	The devs stopped supporting the PC version, said they weren't making any more updates.
7372558	7375160	Then they announced a console version with new features.
7375220	7375821	That stank.
7376001	7377102	Okay, that is a little stank.
7377622	7381765	So that's them pooping the bed, not you peeing it.
7383307	7384067	Who pooped the bed?
7384808	7385608	Who pooped the bed?
7385688	7387049	Terraria developers did.
7387650	7388050	All right.
7389751	7392774	Let's move on with the foogle question of the week.
7400934	7405839	Every week we ask you guys a question on our fan communities on Facebook as well as Google+.
7405879	7411905	If you want to find us on Google+, well, there's no short links on Google+, so just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
7411925	7412606	We'll come right up.
7412886	7415689	If you want to find us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7421209	7425333	This week's Google Question of the Week, it's all about the Wii U, because we haven't talked enough about it during the show.
7425453	7429377	Did the Nintendo Wii U conference this week change your mind on if you wanted a Wii U or not?
7430018	7434622	At this point, are you planning on buying a Wii U between November 18th and the end of the year?
7435723	7440608	Red Entertainment says on Google+, I want to buy a Wii U, but it probably won't happen until after the end of the year.
7441308	7442269	He has other priorities.
7443130	7452597	Actdeft says, Well, I'm still not sold completely on the system, so I'll wait at least a year to get one and see what games will be released and see if the system is definitely worth a purchase or not.
7453037	7455419	That's what I'm currently doing with the 3DS.
7456600	7463565	Flacco Jones replied on Google+, and says, It convinced me that they're going to have more games on the system than just the Nintendo staples.
7464125	7490785	I could see myself buying one a year from now if they start getting the multi-platform games at the same time and if the price goes down or built-in memory goes way up they also need to bundle in a remote plus there are just too many hidden costs for me to afford when it launched that was an interesting response because he said it convinced me that they're gonna have this new stuff but I'll consider it a year from now which to be fair there's a lot of people that are in that boat I don't exactly blame him with that one
7491445	7493688	Let's go over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there.
7493728	7495590	There were a lot of answers on Facebook.
7495650	7497412	I'm not going to be able to get through all these.
7497752	7499214	So I apologize in advance.
7499274	7503138	If you want to see all the answers, go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7503178	7506402	And I'm going to have to shorten a lot of these too to even get through some of them.
7507843	7509184	Don't hear me wrong, though.
7509224	7511145	We love the fact that so many people are responding.
7511546	7517870	Lama Juice says, I went to a Nintendo event about a week ago where they let a small group of people in and played the Wii U stuff.
7517890	7519491	Oh, yeah, we had somebody call in on that a little while ago.
7520171	7525935	After an hour and a half with the system, I came to the conclusion it's not a system I want, but a system I'd want to play at a friend's house.
7527934	7538718	Critical Myth from our Monday, Wednesday, Friday show at Voicy Geeks Network replied and said, The Wii was fun for a couple weeks until it became apparent that the controls were too much trouble compared to the PS3 or 360.
7538758	7543499	The Wii U takes that to the next level and doesn't have compelling excuses.
7543640	7544320	We're gonna pass.
7545765	7553150	DarkCharger says as an owner of all current consoles and handhelds I will eventually pick up a Wii U but I see no reason to pick one up at launch.
7553810	7559654	Few games in the launch window interest me and history tells us that some of those will invariably get delayed.
7560134	7563937	I have no doubt there will be an exclusive that will compel a purchase sometime next year.
7564357	7565077	Probably Bayonetta 2.
7567254	7570017	Kevin S replied and said, I'd rather purchase an Ouya.
7570277	7571558	Nintendo ruined it for me.
7571658	7572879	$100 is feasible.
7573420	7575221	I kind of wish the answer was longer there.
7575602	7581787	I want to know more about the reasoning behind that answer because $100 is feasible for a new system?
7582728	7585511	I'm not dismissing the answer.
7585531	7590255	I'm just saying I wish he'd written more because I want to know more about why does the Ouya stand out?
7590395	7591336	Is it just the price?
7592819	7595341	Anyhow, Stan replied and said, I'm sold.
7596061	7599984	First Pikmin 3 was announced and I'm sure a new Mario Kart Smash Brothers will come out.
7600084	7601345	Bayonetta 2 on top of that.
7601745	7603867	As Fry would say, shut up and take my money.
7606550	7609732	Tiara said, I'm still not interested, especially for the price point.
7610053	7615996	If there's a drastic price cut like there was with the 3DS, I may invest at a later point, but right now it's not worth the money.
7616957	7622901	Giovadea says, with what I spent on the Wii and all the games that I own and don't play on that system, my answer is no.
7623281	7629585	While I loved Bayonetta, I can't see the second one doing so well on Wii U that it stays an exclusive past the launch date.
7630345	7634027	I do want to clarify, though, even though a lot of people are theorizing that, Nintendo is publishing it.
7634147	7635588	It will not be on any other system.
7635968	7636648	Not going to happen.
7638229	7640330	So far, that's the only game mentioned that I care about.
7642691	7645393	Kareem J replied and said, Short answer, no.
7645893	7650796	Storage is so cheap now, I don't know why Nintendo didn't opt for a 16 gig version instead of a 32 gig version.
7651816	7653418	No one starts at 8 anymore.
7653558	7656622	Even Apple moved away from that storage capacity.
7656662	7658384	250 pounds for an 8 gig device.
7658665	7661148	Excuse me, 250 euros for an 8 gig device.
7661268	7661889	Give me a break.
7662850	7665994	Acidic Vampire says, no, not enough Imagine Babies games.
7667421	7667741	Just wait.
7668161	7669042	Imagine babies will happen.
7669062	7670002	You gotta give it time, man.
7670022	7670582	Give it time.
7671042	7671542	Give it time.
7672503	7674864	Gamer Girl says, I'm not sure if I want one just yet.
7675044	7676644	Might wait a while before deciding.
7677985	7680385	Besides, if I get one now, I'll just regret it later.
7680486	7684527	I kinda wanna wait for the price to drop and more games added to the library.
7684607	7686207	Kinda learned my lesson to the Wii.
7686888	7689048	Don't get me wrong, but it's lacking in titles.
7689809	7692350	James S. replied and said, Hi guys, I'm new to OLR.
7692390	7693190	Thanks to Stitcher.
7693570	7694111	Well, thank you.
7694511	7705923	And thank you, Stitcher, where you can hear us, by the way, on Stitcher Radio, which is, in some ways, kind of like where podcasting's going right now is apps like Stitcher and TuneIn and all that, especially with podcasting becoming its own app.
7706623	7707985	But that's a discussion for another day.
7708325	7710007	Welcome to the show, and here's the answer.
7710447	7711067	Thank you for watching!
7740216	7764354	uh he wants to throw in a plug why not plug plug search James Anthony on Amazon Kindle for my 99 cent highly rated horror comedy books fine I will give a listener a shout out um back to the answer though it's it's actually a real similar answer to where I'm at to be honest that's almost exactly what I said earlier right Bayonetta 2 fucking great not enough
7765839	7766319	So there you go.
7766360	7769422	Those are the answers on Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7769522	7771544	I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them all.
7772044	7773886	There was just like 20 of them and that's a lot.
7773966	7774907	So go read them.
7774987	7779671	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and then answer next week's when it comes up.
7780712	7784715	TigerClaw says he made a quick link for the Orange Lounge Radio Google Plus page.
7784755	7786316	I didn't even know that was a thing you could do.
7786817	7790700	Gplus.to slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7791761	7792201	Well, thank you.
7792281	7794203	It's much easier for me to give out than say
7794622	7796083	Go to Google and search for it.
7797024	7797585	Fantastic.
7799126	7801288	All right, that's it for the Fugle Question of the Week.
7801428	7807253	And just to clarify, if there was any question here in studio, are you buying a Wii U?
7807533	7808934	Did the conference change your mind?
7809134	7809475	Loki?
7810255	7813238	Not buying a Wii U. Did not change anything.
7814579	7818302	Alan, sorry, I know you're mid-bite there on that delicious quesadilla, but your thoughts?
7819043	7820244	Like I said earlier, I don't care enough.
7821514	7843786	me I am still on the fence I really am it is going to come down to how much extra money do I have burning a hole in my pocket around that time I'm thinking probably not right away I just think I'm trying to save for other life priorities right now I just don't know but I could still be convinced Nintendo tell me that an F-Zero game's coming in 2013 and I'll be like
7846397	7850950	Beatmania 2DX Volumes 1-15 Yeah, right.
7851010	7851892	Don't get my hopes up.
7852925	7855607	Alright, Beatmania 2DX was a great game.
7855687	7858109	It's too bad that it's kind of a shadow of what it used to be.
7858149	7859089	But anyway, that's for another day.
7859630	7860410	Hey, Loki!
7860570	7861911	Why don't we get back into some news?
7862411	7870517	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about some wonderful new, hopefully soon, tech from Microsoft.
7870537	7875780	They patented a new immersive display experience.
7875820	7879543	Basically, the way it works is in conjunction with Kinect,
7880283	7886405	It would project a display on your walls, kind of like a projector would.
7887245	7894047	I actually saw some... They have a video that they showed off, I think it was a couple of years ago or whatever.
7894567	7895668	It was a similar type of thing.
7895768	7901790	It was during one of their campus tours, kind of talking a little bit about home automation and stuff.
7902430	7908752	And the way it works is, in conjunction with the camera, it will detect different movements you're doing, but it'll also kind of...
7910072	7911313	Adjust for your room.
7911533	7919521	For example, they were talking about game applications that it would correct the perspective of the scene based on the objects you have in your room.
7919541	7930790	So if there's a chair or something like that, it'll know that the chair is there and it'll adjust the perspective of whatever object is being mapped onto it so that it looks like one seamless thing, which is pretty awesome.
7931771	7939898	and some other applications they showed in the campus tour that they did in May 2011.
7940538	7946983	It was more Windows-based, more computing.
7947744	7950126	One example was a kid's room or something.
7950186	7954590	They had a completely interactive display on their walls.
7955170	7956231	It was all projector-based.
7956991	7972996	and it had like you know tweets and social networking stuff was popping up on the wall and you know they could you know make a gesture or whatever and pull up music and you know just the interface was really huge and kind of cool very immersive I guess
7974400	7976681	You know, there's a part of me that wants to say this is full of shit.
7977041	7980403	This is the same thing we heard about the revolution in 2006.
7980783	7982764	Remember when the Wii was going to be called the revolution?
7983244	7983624	LOL.
7984204	7988506	And we talked about it was going to be fucking holograms in your room.
7989526	7991067	Go back and listen to the shows from 2006.
7991627	7996249	That was one of the rumors about the Nintendo Wii was that it was going to do holograms and all this shit.
7996669	7998890	So here we kind of go again, I feel like, in a way.
7999410	8000431	But the way you describe it,
8002119	8006121	It doesn't sound far off from where Microsoft's going.
8006601	8008561	There's a lot with it that I can dig.
8009082	8018045	And if you think about it, we've kind of had that technology before where you can have like a thing that projects images on kids' walls and stuff.
8018105	8021226	Like that's how you have like the dancing circus animals and stuff.
8021266	8024307	Like it's a very, very basic light with the cutouts, right?
8024327	8025748	Well, even if you're talking a little bit more politically.
8025828	8026448	It's seriously cool looking.
8026468	8027228	They had it on MS... Was it...
8055199	8057441	I think it was MSN or something.
8057461	8059563	But it's like a seven minute long video.
8059863	8063526	If you skip like five minutes into it and it shows... Now, I hadn't seen this before.
8063746	8064206	Oh, damn it.
8064226	8065567	It wants me to put on Silverlight.
8065728	8066508	Can I do this other one?
8067349	8068410	This is only like a minute.
8069030	8069811	That will still work.
8069831	8071332	It's showing some of the other stuff.
8071352	8073954	But it's not the interactive one I was telling you about.
8074235	8075255	But see, it gives you the idea.
8075356	8076496	See how the room is whole.
8076717	8077157	Oh, yeah.
8077617	8078658	Integrated into it.
8079259	8082041	That looks like the Interventions building at Disneyland.
8082081	8083102	The type of stuff that's in there.
8083516	8084136	That makes sense.
8084276	8089579	I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, okay, it's not going to be like the holodeck from Star Trek.
8089599	8090699	It doesn't look that good.
8090759	8097322	It looks like projections on a wall, but it's kind of rad in a real sci-fi kind of way, you know?
8097902	8108067	Yeah, I mean, imagine if you will, like your apartment here, you just have this thing that's in the middle of the room and you're interacting with the entire room as like...
8109761	8110661	Xbox, fill my walls with boobies!
8137335	8148711	Yes, I can't... That is one of the things that I am... Loki could walk into his spare bedroom that could be his wall of boobies, his boobie palace, and just projections of boobies all over the wall, bouncing in slow motion.
8148752	8148812	Or...
8150868	8152249	MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K MM2K
8176067	8176748	I think it'd be cool.
8176788	8179090	I mean, because you can use it with pretty much anything.
8180131	8181172	It's just a display.
8181373	8186698	To be fair, the Kinect looked really cool at first, but there's like two types of games for it.
8186778	8189681	Well, yes, the tech right now for the Kinect is terrible.
8190041	8199111	I'm going to say right now it's terrible, but even the PC version is slightly better, but right now it's terrible, but next iteration of it may be better.
8199751	8202552	It's just like, you know, the iToy camera.
8202852	8204012	The iToy was crap.
8204432	8209214	And the PlayStation Eye is less crappy, but it's still not quite there.
8209594	8213515	But the technology is growing so fast that this is going to be possible.
8214295	8216796	Well, hell, it's possible now because they're showing it.
8216816	8220877	What I want to know is how the fuck is everything projecting on things because projectors aren't cheap.
8221257	8224118	So I want to know what kind of hardware I got to have.
8224398	8226359	I got to mount a fucking thing to my roof or something?
8226379	8227619	I mean, how's this going to work?
8229036	8232237	Don't get me wrong, I'm going to mount a fucking thing on my roof if I can do that shit.
8232257	8234258	You know, the technology will always be glitchy.
8234298	8243301	Like, if you tried to do that thing where you're like, Xbox, guns, it'll probably think you said Xbox, nuns, and there'll be people praying all over your walls for your soul.
8243321	8244141	Well, it wasn't even that.
8244201	8249243	It was still motion censored and stuff, but I don't think the voice commands are going to be necessary.
8250063	8256665	You know, if they've got a, you better connect, because I think a lot of the voice commands now are because connect doesn't really read you very well.
8258026	8261228	It doesn't really listen to you very well either, but, you know, I don't know.
8261589	8262029	It'll work.
8263030	8263370	All right.
8263390	8273518	Well, meanwhile, while Microsoft is working on, you know, projecting boobies on your wall, we have the 3DS that is working on getting Game Boy Advance games, possibly in the eShop.
8273558	8274979	This is all a rumor right now.
8275179	8275860	However...
8276760	8279581	I mean, Game Boy Advance games on the 3DS are nothing new.
8279661	8283183	There was the Ambassador program, and we did have some games that came out on that.
8283243	8289266	If you were a 3DS early adopter, you got some pretty fucking good Game Boy Advance games, all things considered.
8289286	8293387	Like, there was the Metroid, not Zero Mission, but the other one, Metroid Fusion.
8293707	8303132	There was the Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Adventure remake, which I think was Advance 4?
8303452	8303792	I can't...
8304472	8305213	I've lost count.
8306213	8307334	But yeah, you had a lot of those games.
8307394	8310616	Fire Emblem, there was a lot of good stuff that was a part of the ambassador program.
8310676	8321543	Well, apparently, Nintendo Australia's eShop software page was recently updated, and it added a Game Boy Advance category to the virtual console spread.
8321943	8327047	The only title that was listed there was Dr. Mario, as in the classic NES version.
8327427	8331910	That's kind of weird, though, because why would they put that there instead of just a regular NES game?
8332350	8337093	Could it have been the Game Boy Advance version of the Nintendo game, which seems really redundant?
8337634	8338935	I don't know, but there it is.
8339635	8344238	It's possible that Nintendo Australia may have spilled the beans on that.
8344298	8345419	I mean, it makes sense.
8346300	8350002	Although, didn't they say at one point, these games will never come out for sale?
8351203	8355366	And I think we all sat here going, yeah, sure, yeah, right, they will come out for sale at some point.
8356738	8357439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8379818	8380338	That's that.
8381639	8391486	Just a few more news stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag and soon the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype if you want to add us, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8391966	8393147	But first, Alan.
8393967	8395688	You've just given me all the Valve stories today.
8396429	8397250	I know you're a fan.
8397430	8397610	Yes.
8399110	8406138	Black Mesa, McPixel, and others are the first to pass through their Greenlight, Steam's Greenlight program.
8406238	8411925	It's basically indie developers pay a one-time fee to kind of keep the amount of crap submissions down.
8411945	8413166	That was the story we covered last week.
8413607	8417271	To have their game be say, hey, we want to distribute this on Steam.
8417731	8422452	Please, because it's pretty much the best digital platform for buying games in existence right now.
8422853	8423833	So vote for our game.
8425313	8443619	And the 10 titles that have passed the gauntlet and gotten the amount of votes that they needed was Black Mesa Source, Cry of Fear, Dream, Heroes and Generals, Kenshi, McPixel, No More Room in Hell, Project Zomboid, Routine, and finally a game called Towns.
8444579	8447100	These games will be released independently in the months ahead.
8447900	8452122	as they are in varying stages of completion, Valve spokesman has said.
8452823	8454603	I actually checked for Osfer in chat.
8455204	8463588	Black Mesa source is not yet on Steam Greenlight because a big reason for that could be because the last stage of it, like the last 10% of the game, Xen,
8465048	8470050	isn't in it yet, and this is pure speculation on my part, but it could be that.
8470250	8474492	Because obviously the game is being downloaded everywhere on their actual website.
8475233	8480535	It could be that Valve could be like, you've already said that this game isn't completely done, so however long that takes.
8480675	8486537	But yeah, some of these games should start appearing and be searchable through the Steam store.
8486898	8487878	These are the first 10 to make it.
8489415	8489915	Fantastic.
8489955	8491196	Well, congrats to those games.
8491596	8499621	Now we need to convince Aaron to put Bungee Ferret Tossing as part of this Project Greenlight thing so we can get Bungee Ferret Tossing on Steam.
8499701	8502863	It's too bad that the Xbox indie games don't support Kinect.
8504424	8505464	It is too bad, isn't it?
8505504	8506665	Because we could actually toss...
8507185	8507966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8529128	8534031	I can't believe that some silly idea here on Orange Lounge Radio is now turning into a media empire.
8534411	8537673	But there is an official soundtrack for six bucks.
8538153	8544557	It looks like Dan Period is the guy that wrote... Do we want to play a little snippet of some of the music from Bungie Ferret Tossing here?
8545037	8546918	Here's a song called Jungle War.
8546958	8547859	That sounds like a good title.
8547879	8548319	I'll present it.
8555413	8559177	That sounds like a bungee tail, or excuse me, a ferret tail whipping really quick.
8559197	8562340	I was going to say, whose dog's barking in the background there?
8563301	8563801	That's good, though.
8563821	8566104	That's very professional.
8571414	8571734	Love it.
8572455	8574918	It's like that 80s power guitar in there.
8574939	8576601	So you can check that out on Amazon.com right now.
8577482	8581066	Thank you for giving me an excuse to somehow inadvertently plug Bungie Ferret Tossing again.
8582128	8583069	But yes, Project Greenlight.
8583109	8584190	Congrats to those developers.
8584270	8584491	Yes.
8585392	8587675	Oh, weird... Excuse me.
8589596	8591877	Steams, what's it called?
8592757	8594118	Big Picture?
8594238	8595098	Big Picture, yeah.
8595498	8604262	I clicked on that, and it made my monitor not spaz out or anything, but it made my system run really slow, and then it's like, oh, you're supposed to hook this up to your TV.
8604542	8609765	Yeah, that's for people that, like Dan and Jamie, have their computer on their TV so they can watch YouTubes and stuff.
8609905	8616588	Yeah, but my TV already has an HDMI on it, so why wouldn't I just run an HDMI from my PC to the TV?
8617208	8639062	that's what they want you to do that's what they want you to do but it's it makes it so that you're not like windows because it looks different on a tv it's like all full screen basically like it looks more like a console i guess is the trick got it whatever it's optional right yeah so steam's just releasing either they're just going crazy because they've got the workshop for mods that was the first thing that was a
8644914	8646635	Still need to play Skyrim on PC.
8647215	8647835	Yes, you do.
8648135	8650275	And Portal 2 on PC that I still need to play with.
8650655	8651295	Yes, you do.
8652136	8658257	I got Dawnguard like two weeks ago, or basically, yeah, about two weeks ago, and I haven't really played any of the new content yet.
8658357	8660577	It just got me to load up Skyrim after taking a couple months off.
8660597	8666378	I loaned my Xbox 360 copy to my sister because she wanted to play it, and she's a fan of glitchy games.
8666418	8672019	I mean, she played Driver 3 forever, so, you know, Skyrim's really glitchy.
8673015	8676738	All the good domain names are taken at this point.
8697052	8704915	I'm going to give you, this is free right here, free for whoever, you know, hears it first and decides to name their company this.
8706215	8707475	You want to get in the people's faces?
8707795	8709676	You name your company, Ermagerd.
8715658	8716478	That's name recognition.
8716518	8717799	Ermagerd Streaming.
8719679	8720359	Exactly.
8721260	8722220	Ermagerd Germs.
8723712	8731158	So, Agawi, apparently they've announced a partnership with Microsoft and they're going to bring cloud streaming games to Windows 8.
8732439	8741926	And of course it's going to tie in with Microsoft's Windows Azure Cloud Platform.
8745348	8748711	They promise popular AAA games will be playable within the coming months.
8751178	8757561	And they didn't really say how it's going to work with a tablet, but I guess virtual D-pads are some garbage.
8759802	8760042	Yay.
8761842	8762843	Ermagerd Verg.
8765084	8765844	Verg Network.
8767321	8768542	Alright, it doesn't have the same ring to it.
8769463	8774626	Let's do one more story here before we get to the mailbag and see what people are emailing us and ermagirding about tonight.
8775487	8778249	Ikaruga's creator is making a new game.
8778329	8779190	Yay!
8779690	8781111	Because who doesn't love Ikaruga?
8781231	8782372	Unless you, like, hate shooters.
8782412	8784094	I don't know what to tell you in that case.
8784474	8789778	Hiroshi Yuichi is going to release a new shooter called Kokuga.
8790178	8791799	It's for the 3DS.
8792460	8796423	And the trailer is now out, so if you are an Ikaruga fan...
8797023	8799526	Might be time to get a 3DS because this is what awaits you there.
8799546	8805291	It looks a lot more of the polygon-esque kind of 3D graphics going into this game.
8805311	8806592	Trying to get in some Raiden vibes.
8806973	8807513	Yeah, a little bit.
8807533	8808554	A little bit there.
8808995	8809876	Bullet hell!
8809896	8810716	Bullet hell!
8810857	8812218	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
8812618	8814459	I bet that will make you barf in 3D.
8815259	8815699	Should be fun.
8836590	8838112	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8838833	8845283	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Sorry, I have to say this.
8847596	8852479	MM2K says in chat, Ermagerd is patent too, just like gamer.
8852899	8859322	Oh my God, somebody needs to trademark Ermagerd and then sue the entirety of the internet for infringing on that trademark.
8860363	8861904	Amazing idea, MM2K.
8861924	8863465	You should do that right now.
8863525	8864945	All right, moving on.
8865506	8867407	Mailbag, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
8867747	8871429	DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag every week and find some emails to read for you all.
8871469	8872590	But since she's not here...
8873610	8877754	Alan has stolen her hazmat suit so that he can walk in the mailbag and find some email for you.
8878194	8884300	I'm reading this first email and it sounds like it's talking about a cheat in Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
8884320	8886963	Should I read this if it tells you how to cheat?
8887163	8888264	You can leave that part out if you want.
8888792	8893856	Okay, this email is from MM2K.
8894956	8897718	First off, I want to apologize if this is the second email you got for me.
8898199	8903502	I originally went to the old R site to send, but the character limitations made it seem like a bunch of babble.
8903562	8905424	Here's my question for Rob and DarkSakura.
8906884	8912027	Multiplayer is rather tough on the game, and I had problems surviving past bronze difficulty.
8912227	8915869	And this is me now inserting this.
8915889	8917710	This is talking about Mass Effect multiplayer.
8918330	8922432	Then some cool people showed me the Striker Assault Rifle Cheat.
8922532	8926995	This allows you to convert this weapon's ammo to cobra missiles, resulting in one-hit kills with each shot.
8928035	8929116	But that's cheating.
8957944	8963632	I see their shrieks as mindless chest pounding over game ranking, which again means jack shit if you're all at the level cap.
8963992	8965895	If we win, we all get the same amount of cash.
8966035	8967277	To me, we should be happy.
8967357	8968559	I'm assisting them to win.
8968979	8969801	To me, they should be happy.
8969821	8970562	I'm assisting them to win.
8970922	8979704	I also play the harder levels as a Turian soldier without the cheat and I tell you 80-85% of the people who play these levels have no idea what WTF they're doing anyway.
8980244	8990807	Winning isn't everything but if it's the difference between us wasting power-ups to die at wave 3 and only get 20,000 credits or completing the playthrough and getting 75-240,000 credits God, that must be how much you get for platinum, that's crazy.
8991827	8999532	I would be glad that someone was aboard that could help when we were all about to die as I was when I met the person who showed me the glitch.
8999632	8999953	Thoughts?
9000353	9007157	Am I thinking like the gaming jackass that many are claiming or do I have a fair point?
9007637	9007977	P.S.
9008118	9009679	You and Bobby's show is the freaking best.
9010539	9016443	I think you should take over G4, turn it into a 24-hour radio show network and make Blair Herder, a.k.a.
9018466	9019287	Ross from Friends.
9020189	9021791	That's David Schwimmer.
9022232	9022973	I don't get that reference.
9022993	9024175	I think that was a character.
9024276	9025277	Oh, I don't know.
9025317	9027080	Bring you smoothies and Cheez-Its all day.
9028089	9030510	That reference is lost on me, but thank you nonetheless.
9031130	9034211	Let's get back to the question at hand about the whole Mass Effect 3 cheat.
9034271	9035111	Here's the problem.
9035632	9048416	You may think you're trying to do a good thing by helping these people out of trouble, but the problem with what you're doing, and in your mind you're thinking you're doing a good thing, and it's like, oh, hey, I'm saving you from death and losing all these credits.
9048856	9054238	You have to remember you're making a big assumption here, that all these people that you're playing with are only in it for the credits.
9054918	9056858	Some people are in it for the challenge.
9057299	9059579	Some people are very anti-cheating.
9059879	9066440	And I tend to notice that type of mentality usually comes when you're very passionate about a series like Mass Effect fans tend to be.
9067021	9076362	Some people feel like, I don't want you to cheat because I don't want to be associated with you so that if Bioware catches you and you get banned, I get banned too.
9076763	9078223	I don't want to be around that shit.
9078623	9084064	So that's the problem with what you're doing is that you're bringing other people into it who didn't consent to do that.
9084144	9094289	Yeah, and that and also there is a money element to this because I have my two or three favorite classes that I try to keep at level 20 when I want to try and do silvers and golds.
9094709	9101772	The reason why I play silvers and golds at level 20 is because I want credits so I can buy the upgrade packs to unlock the new characters and the weapon upgrades and blah, blah, blah.
9102152	9109035	I could also spend five bucks on Bioware's website and get a pack of like 300 Bioware points and then...
9110416	9112057	Manually buy those with cash.
9112637	9115538	Don't know why you do that, but I'm sure there are tons of people that have spent hundreds of dollars.
9116419	9129945	When you're helping people farm credits in that way, like if you were to do that in Firebase White with the geth, and I'm getting way too technical in the game, you're kind of screwing over the people that are paying money.
9130225	9132166	Does that make sense for those packs?
9132186	9132266	Yeah.
9132626	9136588	So you may be well-intentioned, but not everybody really understands that.
9136688	9138089	So here's my advice to you.
9138149	9141331	If that's the way you want to play, and keep in mind, you're taking a risk.
9141951	9145853	If BioWare catches you exploiting too many credits that way, you don't know what's going to happen.
9145933	9147114	So use caution.
9147194	9147874	That's all I'm going to say.
9149435	9150696	Do it with a consenting audience.
9150936	9154758	Only do that stuff with your friends, with the people that you know online.
9155078	9158380	You mentioned in your email that somebody showed you how to do that.
9158680	9159461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9178303	9184812	But Loki's on the right track when he talks about his Grand Theft Auto 4 matches, that they cheat like hell in those matches.
9185253	9186474	But it's all internal.
9186595	9188157	It's all people that know each other.
9188557	9193884	It's all, you know, when, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, when you go on Xbox Live and play against strangers, you don't cheat.
9194125	9194926	You play it straight up.
9195507	9198431	No, we don't play those mods anymore anyways.
9198511	9205140	But yeah, when we were playing those mods, we only played against each other because we all had the same mods and it was all modding new weapons that were all balanced.
9205200	9208164	It wasn't so that we could cheat other people.
9208245	9211930	It was just, look at all these crazy fucking weapons that we have.
9212313	9213634	We're going to shoot each other with them.
9214194	9214494	All right.
9214834	9217875	So I guess the moral of the story, and I'll end with this.
9218135	9219216	Long story short, too late.
9219936	9221356	Make it like Monopoly.
9221757	9223817	Set the house rules in advance.
9224478	9227279	Is there going to be a jackpot when you land on free parking?
9228599	9230420	You know, set all those house rules.
9230460	9232961	Do people really go to jail if they roll three doubles in a row?
9233441	9235102	Set the house rules in advance.
9235842	9239784	And if you're going to play with strangers, then the house rules have already been set.
9240124	9241045	There are no house rules.
9241065	9242185	You have to play by Bioware's rules.
9242265	9245927	You can just say, hey, can I rocket glitch this, bros?
9246007	9247008	Hey, can I rocket glitch?
9247028	9251410	And if they're like, no, fuck off, then maybe that's not the round for you.
9251430	9251830	Yeah.
9252330	9255711	MM2K is actually in our chat tonight and wanted to give a follow-up to the email.
9256171	9261972	By the way, the person that showed me got banned, so I stopped the day after I sent that email.
9262372	9265133	Sorry for the babble.
9265693	9267394	Before I knew that, we kind of warned you.
9267834	9271555	If you get caught, you'll be the one that gets banned and the people that want to be associated with you.
9271835	9272235	You know what?
9272575	9276856	Despite the fact that that's already a resolved situation, I thought it was a good thing to talk about, so no worries.
9277196	9281097	I'm sure there's plenty of other games and communities where something like this goes on.
9281892	9282132	All right.
9283993	9284233	All right.
9284333	9288455	And next email is from Catastrophic Moggy.
9288755	9290296	Not sure I've heard this reader before.
9290316	9290916	I have.
9290936	9291337	Our listener.
9292837	9299641	OLR, no doubt you've already got the classic game of the week covered, but if you don't mind, I'd like to add my own, given that this game will likely be unheard of.
9300121	9302482	And then he's got a, they've got a gameplay link.
9302962	9320178	I will bring that up here while you start to read it on YouTube school days for the ZX Spectrum or ZX Spectrum if you're in the UK you play as a schoolboy named Eric though you could change the name if you wanted to and your goal is to get the combination to the safe that holds your permanent record
9321365	9326246	to get the combination you have to grab or shoot these little shields scattered around the school with your catapult.
9326786	9328327	It's not as easy as it sounds.
9328807	9335889	Some you can't reach without knocking over your classmates to get a boost so you can jump higher or deflect shots off of a teacher's head.
9336289	9339950	I'm wondering if catapult is British for a slingshot.
9340506	9341367	Thank you for watching!
9360719	9362600	Get too many and you may be excluded.
9363240	9365401	I imagine that's expelled.
9366641	9376164	You've also got the other kids to deal with, particularly the bully who is trying to get you into trouble and the SWOT, S-W-O-T, who runs to the teachers whenever he sees you do anything wrong.
9377324	9378725	Like a narc or a snitch, I guess.
9379305	9387247	For anyone interested in the game, there was a fan-made remake release called Class of 99, with improved graphics and sound.
9387267	9390107	I have no idea if it works on Vista or Win 7, though.
9391108	9391828	And then I'll link to that.
9392368	9392768	P.S.
9392948	9398729	I'm pissed at the moment because, predictably, Persona 4 Arena has been delayed in Europe to God knows when.
9398909	9402230	So much for it coming out in all territories in quick succession, my F.U.,
9403110	9404371	of the week is region locking.
9433555	9434096	Hold on.
9434416	9437759	I think that was it.
9437820	9438240	Did you get it?
9438340	9440822	No, there's one more email.
9443285	9446968	Last week's episode was weird because a lot of the content that was discussed.
9447589	9448390	I don't want to get into it.
9448630	9449811	This email kind of addresses that.
9449931	9450912	Let me look at it real quick.
9452373	9453955	I mean, I think we need to read...
9460407	9461110	What's wrong with this?
9461411	9461993	This is funny.
9463579	9463799	Okay.
9464924	9465827	Are we looking at the same one?
9465847	9466670	The one from Osfer?
9466750	9466891	Yeah.
9468246	9469346	Okay, this is fine.
9470147	9473528	Dear DarkSakura, I think it's in your best interest to not take Rob's advice.
9473608	9480410	Diving headfirst into the mailbag is a horrible idea as you never know how deep or shallow in emails it will be.
9480570	9483251	I would recommend stepping in slowly to test the depth.
9483331	9486992	Bring Garrus along with you for sure as he can calibrate the mailbag afterwards.
9487733	9489333	You read way too much.
9489493	9492454	What was the controversy you saw in that email?
9492714	9494495	I didn't see your name.
9494555	9495315	I saw Dan's.
9495335	9495575	Oh!
9498953	9500413	You shouldn't take Dan's advice.
9500733	9506134	That's a cute little pun on the, when I always say DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst.
9506514	9508455	Way to make a funny joke awkward.
9508475	9508995	I know.
9509035	9509795	Womp womp.
9509995	9511935	This is why you don't get invited to parties, Alan.
9512075	9512355	Yeah.
9515696	9518376	And he, Oscar was like, ooh, who's gonna read my email?
9518396	9519157	And I'm like, it's gonna be me.
9519177	9520337	And then I just pissed all over it.
9520377	9521517	So, Austin, I'm very sorry.
9521737	9523817	This is for Alan reading emails.
9525478	9525958	It's fine.
9528260	9529780	Why would I read Your Name is Dance?
9530401	9531941	Yeah, that's what I want to know.
9533142	9536263	Rob and Dan don't even have same letters in common.
9537143	9537843	You know what you saw?
9537883	9545125	You saw Garrus as Dan, because Jamie always talks about how Garrus kind of reminds her of Dan, which is kind of cute in a really weird way.
9546646	9553468	We need to get her that Moe cuddle pillow for her of Garrus, and then Dan will be like, I don't want that in my house.
9554108	9554868	That's it for Mailbag.
9558820	9560482	Good job reading the mailbag tonight.
9561042	9564466	Well, if you do a really bad job at something, then people will ask you to not do it anymore.
9568169	9568750	Is that a hint?
9569430	9569911	Is that a hint?
9572067	9573989	That's it for the mailbag.
9574029	9583418	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR We'll get some Twitter topics in there as well.
9583458	9585180	But first, a couple quick stories.
9585240	9585540	Loki.
9586561	9588263	I thought first we had the FUs of the week.
9588483	9589344	Oh shit, you're right.
9589884	9591546	FU to me for getting the FUs of the week.
9591946	9592807	Well, you know what?
9593968	9594849	Alan threw off my wrist.
9610912	9620938	So I guess F you to FedEx for not just losing one pallet of games, but two different pallets of the same game.
9622179	9624900	I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointed Borderlands 2 fans.
9625881	9628943	And also old people driving on the freeway there, driving like 30 miles an hour.
9629283	9629903	What the fuck?
9629943	9630724	I mean, seriously?
9630744	9632565	30 miles an hour on the freeway?
9634705	9637346	Two missing pallets of a top-tier game?
9637386	9638386	That shuts on eBay.
9638426	9640127	Someone lifted that off a truck.
9640247	9641347	No, it was just misrided.
9641707	9641987	Oh, okay.
9642327	9642907	How convenient.
9643248	9647409	Oh, so they're somewhere, they're just not where they need to be sold to people.
9647429	9651830	They apparently flunked geography and thought that Oklahoma City was Memphis.
9653390	9654891	Oh, I make that mistake all the time.
9655131	9660052	Yeah, so they shifted to Memphis and, oh, hey, shit, this isn't Oklahoma City.
9660852	9662673	Elvis' mansion's in Oklahoma City, right?
9663183	9666271	or Indianapolis instead of, you know, Perrysburg, Ohio.
9668497	9670102	Alan, do you have any interviews of the week you want to share?
9671542	9683827	Very minor in first world, but we bought juice at Target, and orange juice is, like, really good, and we got two cartons of it, and apparently we just left it on the counter in the bag and fucking walked away and left and got into the car and drove away.
9683947	9685647	Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.
9686028	9688168	Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life.
9688188	9695111	But now, because it happened, I'm, but yeah, now it happened, I'm like, I really, for no reason, I want orange juice at, you know, 9 o'clock at night, because we forgot it.
9695191	9698117	Do you need me to go to Save Mart and get you some orange juice?
9698137	9702705	So F you to just, I guess, walking away from a counter and leaving behind things that you paid for.
9703186	9704809	Even if it's just $1.50 orange juice.
9706587	9707668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9731366	9733807	It's not like I'm having a gun held to my head.
9733847	9735628	I don't have to be doing the things I'm doing.
9735828	9739170	But still, it's keeping me very busy.
9739670	9743792	But I'm able to work in some good stuff, and I know there'll be a good payoff.
9744773	9745113	All right.
9746053	9750936	Before we get into the next story, I want to say F you to one other thing as well.
9751516	9756879	And that is the fact that we got so tied up in that Wii U conversation earlier in the show...
9757759	9762203	I didn't get to embarrass Loki with the fact that his birthday was this past week.
9762844	9763044	Oh yeah.
9763224	9764506	On September 11th.
9764786	9768650	It's not a hard day to, or it's an easy day to remember, I guess I'll put it that way.
9769731	9770872	What'd you end up doing for your birthday?
9771808	9776311	I went to work, and then I went and saw The Expendables 2 afterwards.
9776491	9778393	Well, what a manly way to spend a birthday.
9778593	9782195	And to be honest, The Expendables 2 was better than the first movie.
9782215	9783916	It was actually entertaining.
9784076	9785277	Yeah, but Chuck Norris is in it.
9785297	9787118	Chuck Norris is awesome.
9787138	9789720	My brother saw it and said it was awesome, but my brother's also like 18.
9791041	9794543	Chuck Norris was awesome, though, because his character is like this lone wolf or whatever.
9794803	9795704	He just comes in, and it's like...
9796264	9801126	Yeah, I just murdered everybody, because I'm Chuck Norris, and that's what the fuck I do.
9802507	9806749	Now, F you to the fact that I'm having to have listeners remind me about my life.
9807449	9810531	TigerClaw says, don't you mean F you to that table that hit you in the face?
9810771	9812912	Yes, F you to the table that hit me in the face.
9813492	9814973	But anyhow, let's go back to Loki.
9815293	9818715	So it was your birthday this past week, so Alan and I wanted to say happy birthday.
9818935	9819595	Aw, thank you.
9819615	9821856	Give you something to open on air there.
9822056	9822897	So a little bit of, oops.
9823017	9824197	Hold on, let me put this down here.
9824217	9824897	It's just a card.
9826198	9829060	That's probably one of the worst wrapping jobs I've ever done.
9829400	9829901	We're boys.
9829921	9830661	We don't wrap gifts.
9831902	9837786	And we recycled... Look on the other side.
9840188	9846653	It is a Skylanders portal keeper where he can keep all his little Skylanders dolls.
9846693	9848874	And all your Skylanders toys.
9848914	9851376	You can open it and you might find something a little more useful inside.
9851837	9852797	Skylanders.
9852997	9854458	I hope it's more Skylanders.
9855339	9856461	Oh sweet, 1600 point guard.
9856521	9857542	There you go.
9857743	9858524	And a little more useful.
9858724	9863030	I figured that, you know, it's cute that Josh can put stuff in it when he's old enough to.
9863070	9870460	Well, he does need a toolbox because he's got like some frou-frou, like flowery boxes he's keeping his tools in right now.
9870580	9871220	There you go.
9871280	9876543	So we figured, even though you might not actually put portals in there, it's actually the perfect size for a little lunch or something.
9876723	9877283	Exactly.
9877563	9878824	Here's another lunchbox.
9878924	9880865	Now you have to carry around a Skylanders purse.
9881945	9890269	I originally joked that we should just get you one of the figures, but I'm like... I had some of the figures, actually, for a while, because I was selling them.
9892170	9892630	Put it this way.
9892970	9897172	There used to be a gray market for Skylanders, and they just... Really fast.
9897574	9898134	All right, I'll get it.
9898194	9902416	The chatters are demanding a picture, so I'll get one of those really quick and get it up on orangelaundry.com.
9902476	9903176	I'll grab the iPad.
9903756	9907238	Misty also says, quit being sexist in our chat room.
9907678	9909638	I can't wrap presents for shit either.
9909759	9910979	Thank fuck for gift bags.
9910999	9912380	I normally don't wrap presents.
9912480	9913500	I apologize.
9913940	9915061	You're absolutely right.
9915401	9918822	But thank fuck for gift bags is absolutely right as well.
9919822	9921023	Did not mean to stereotype.
9921083	9921743	I apologize.
9922743	9923204	I appreciate it.
9923224	9923544	Thank you.
9923564	9924324	The card's funny too.
9924464	9924924	You're welcome.
9924944	9925905	Yeah, the card's funny too.
9927545	9927885	All right.
9928666	9928926	Oh, yeah.
9928946	9930987	We're going to have to wait for him to do the card because he has the next story.
9931527	9932588	Birthday bad.
9932988	9934008	Cake good.
9935049	9935969	And it has a fat cat on it.
9936150	9937310	Yeah, my fat cat.
9937830	9940052	Well, she's not fat, but she threw up last night again.
9940692	9940812	Oh.
9941652	9942393	Hairballs.
9942553	9943053	Oh, my God.
9943273	9947195	That was the first card I was looking at was a cat on it saying, I'm getting all choked up because it's your birthday.
9947215	9948856	And then he opened it up and it says, oh, just kidding.
9948876	9949416	It's a hairball.
9950077	9951277	Oh, if I'd known your story.
9951737	9952018	Oh, well.
9952558	9952758	Yeah.
9953416	9961765	Alright, so you know of course Australia's got the brand new R18 Plus rating for their game ratings.
9962445	9973877	Of course, they have guidelines for the classification and it should be no surprise, like anything that's rated out there, they're being stricter on games than any other form of media.
9975238	9996810	And of course, you know, it says, Given the opposition to the introduction of the R18 Plus category from a vocal yet unrepresentative section of the community, along with a largely conservative group of attorneys-generals, it is no surprise that the new guidelines hold video games to a higher standard across a number of categories compared to film and what originally existed for video games.
9997290	10001573	As we have previously stated, we are concerned with the acknowledgment
10003514	10018740	are in the guidelines that the interactivity has a greater impact on the players despite the Federal Attorney General's Office Publishing and Literature Review in September 2010 that found no evidence to support these claims.
10018900	10031045	There will be continued debate about whether the interactivity of video games has a greater impact than other forms of media and we will continue to refer to the lack of evidence to support these claims.
10031465	10032226	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10049594	10067625	I think it'd make me less violent because if there's an annoying character in a movie and I want to punch him in the face, that makes me want to punch somebody in the face, whereas if I have the ability to punch him in the face in the game, then I may not have that urge to punch somebody in the face because, well, I've taken out my aggression.
10069706	10075870	Well, at least they can have the games out there on Australia that were banned previously.
10075910	10077891	I mean, at least there's that, so...
10078917	10079377	Whatever.
10080738	10081158	Alright.
10082358	10083238	I'm trying to remember.
10083298	10092562	We have a secret email you use to upload these pictures to and I can't remember what it is because remember our site got hella spammed once so we changed it and I don't remember the address.
10092602	10093882	Jamie has it saved on her phone.
10094942	10095182	Crap.
10095202	10096743	We have a sent items folder.
10099307	10101028	Can it be piped to the OLR Tumblr?
10101228	10103509	Because I think Ramna's on.
10103529	10105050	He does that, right?
10105550	10108972	How would I search for emails that I sent to an OrangeLaunchRadio.com address?
10110533	10112534	You just go to your sent items.
10114214	10116616	Yeah, go into your sent folder and then do the search from.
10116676	10119717	I know it's live radio, but I need tips on how to use my mailbag.
10119797	10122078	Oh, no, it's not OrangeLaunchRadio because they go to Flickr.
10123079	10123739	That's the problem.
10125126	10125587	Is that it?
10125727	10126268	I bet it's this.
10126868	10128570	Don't say that on air, but I think this is it.
10129331	10129592	Yes.
10132215	10132976	Yes, that's it.
10133196	10134037	Okay, I found it.
10134257	10134658	Yay.
10134738	10140445	Just host fail because I forgot the correct that they went to Flickr, not to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
10140465	10140806	Ahem.
10140866	10141106	Ahem.
10143820	10145000	Great live radio, huh?
10168667	10176835	Indie Game Stand will be a place that will sell a new indie game every four days for a pay-what-you-want fee.
10177857	10179618	That's a pretty bold way to do it.
10179679	10181701	It's going to launch September 26th.
10182321	10186626	A lot of Steam and Desura keys will be available on the game.
10187046	10190130	10% of whatever you do will benefit a charity of the developer's choice.
10190570	10193912	More than 50 indie developers are signed on to this right now.
10193992	10199614	Spiderweb Software, Cypher Prime, Digital Eel, Magical Time Beam, and so on and so on.
10199794	10205597	If you create an account before September 26th, you will get the platformer Chester for free.
10206077	10208678	IndieGameStand.com That's pretty cool.
10210279	10212300	I like the whole charity aspect to that as well.
10212420	10214321	It's pretty bold to do pay what you want.
10214361	10216342	I'm surprised there's no minimum whatsoever.
10216422	10218563	That's... Wow.
10220934	10223095	OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny, OnePenny
10244480	10248944	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10248984	10254770	The Skype line is open right now for you to send in your phone calls.
10255831	10268103	Meanwhile, it's going to take me a minute to get that picture up because I need to bring up Twitters on my iPad here so we can talk about tweets to twitter.com slash OLR.
10269524	10270865	While I bring that up... Oh, never mind.
10270885	10271445	We're getting a call.
10272086	10273567	I will do last-minute stories in a minute, though.
10273587	10275248	But first, we have a call on the line.
10275308	10276268	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10276288	10276649	Who's this?
10277449	10278570	Who else but Ranma?
10278830	10279450	Hey, Ranma.
10279470	10280231	What's on your mind, buddy?
10281772	10282412	Oh, God.
10282812	10283653	Yeah.
10284333	10286494	Wii U. All right.
10286534	10287295	Yeah, let's do it.
10287355	10288195	Wii U. What's up?
10290277	10297201	The money for that Wii U is staying in my bank account because I'm not buying into that bullshit.
10298285	10299886	It's a pretty strong word, bullshit.
10301347	10308531	Because first things first, the price that they're asking for, I think, is a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it.
10308931	10316015	Another thing is, they haven't even said the specs behind the Wii U. I haven't been able to find anything in regards to it.
10316816	10324300	There's only three games that they announced that I want, and truth be told, the console can stay on the shelf until those three games come out.
10325851	10327413	But they're not staying on the shelves.
10327453	10328975	They're selling out the pre-orders.
10330657	10331218	I can wait.
10331278	10332560	I'm a very patient person.
10334483	10335664	What do you think it would take?
10336465	10337326	What's missing here?
10337426	10340911	What would it take for you to say, you know what?
10341292	10342333	I'm plunking the money down.
10342393	10342934	Let's do this.
10344582	10345642	Pack a Mario game.
10346202	10348103	No, forget that whole Nintendo Land stuff.
10348383	10352844	Take it back to the old school when the NES came with Super Mario Brothers.
10353064	10355825	When Super Nintendo came with the Super Mario Brothers game.
10356005	10357285	Then they changed things around.
10357485	10358545	Take it back to the old school.
10358565	10360126	Put in an awesome Mario title.
10360746	10361766	That's what I'm looking at.
10362166	10363307	Well, there is a Mario title.
10364087	10365787	Nintendo Land doesn't count in my book.
10365907	10369408	What about New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever it's called?
10369844	10370425	That's an extra $60.
10370465	10378694	And I don't know if you've noticed, the price that they're asking for the Wii U games brings me back to the days of Super Nintendo when games were $69.99 to $79.99 a pop.
10382628	10388992	BlackWolf in our chatroom, you know he's one ready to challenge you on things once in a while.
10389412	10394976	BlackWolf says, you're right, it's a little bit higher than people are willing to pay for it, hence why it's currently sold out of the pre-orders.
10396076	10401640	The price of the Wii U games brings me back to the days of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
10403221	10404281	You have to admit that's funny.
10405643	10413553	The way I look at it, the price kind of reminds me of the PS3 when it was so expensive because they're trying to put the Blu-ray players in everybody's living room.
10413573	10416476	There's a big difference between $2.99 and $5.99 as in half.
10420043	10427346	I know, but I'm just saying that they're trying to get everyone on the whole tablet thing, which is why the console is so expensive.
10427627	10433269	And truth be told, as much as I enjoy the features that the tablet's going to offer, I don't need it.
10433369	10436631	Just give me a Wii U, a Pro Controller, and that's it.
10436711	10437851	That's all I really want.
10440552	10442533	Well, I guess you can't get that.
10443996	10446617	Yeah, I know, and I see that.
10447698	10470628	And the sad yet interesting yet funny part is, even though Nintendo's playing catch-up with all of this, even if the Wii U falls flat on their face, they will still come out on top because remember, except for the 3DS when they did a price cut on, except until recently, every console Nintendo put out has made a profit off of.
10473254	10475516	Except for that whole 3DS price cut.
10475556	10476616	That's a very true point.
10477357	10481840	I believe Microsoft and PlayStation took losses on theirs, so it is interesting.
10482720	10482961	Yeah.
10484221	10489325	Alright, well, what will you be playing this holiday season with no Wii U in your house?
10490657	10495540	I will be probably playing more games on my PS3, my 360, and a tablet that I just bought.
10495980	10506605	And if you're also wondering, my younger brother begged me, so I will be going with him to Nintendo World dressed as Luigi during that weekend release of the Wii U because evidently I have nothing else better to do that weekend.
10506685	10511728	So even though you're not going to buy the Wii U, you're going to pull out Black Luigi just because?
10512369	10517412	Yeah, I have to shamelessly plug out a couple of awesome sites that I help work for.
10517613	10518153	There you go.
10518273	10519994	Take some VOG flyers.
10521055	10522816	My business cards have VOG on them.
10523056	10524137	Good, good, good.
10524637	10529120	All right, well, the chatters are complaining because somehow you broke the stream, but here's my question.
10529160	10532182	If the internet just went down, why are we still connected on Skype?
10532903	10536525	Because you're supported by my awesome files connection.
10536746	10538807	66 megabits down and 33 megabits going up.
10538887	10539487	Can't beat that.
10539708	10539988	Whatever.
10540028	10540668	It's not the size.
10540728	10541449	It's how you use it.
10541949	10545590	Alright, bye Ranma, take care buddy.
10545850	10546751	Peace, stay fabulous.
10546991	10547511	Yeah, always.
10548531	10552772	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lawn Tradio if you want to give us a call.
10553633	10554633	I did get that picture up.
10556273	10557974	Loki, did you have any last minute stories you wanted to do?
10558735	10561556	Yeah, I was going to mention there was a few things.
10561636	10567238	There was an article I saw about the whole multiplayer, or the Just Cause 2 multiplayer project.
10568178	10571019	They've got up to 1,800 people playing on one server.
10572039	10575520	And this is all fan done, you know, kind of talking a little bit about Black Mesa stuff.
10575660	10578661	I mean, multiplayer in a game that doesn't have multiplayer.
10578801	10580862	They have 1,800 people on that goddamn server.
10582303	10583604	That's pretty impressive.
10584766	10589531	And then also Black Ops 2 is supposed to have a zombie campaign, like as in a single player campaign.
10589631	10590392	That's kind of neat.
10592370	10594031	And what else?
10594171	10600234	Oh, I want to mention I had actually, because I'm on Kickstarter a lot, I tweeted about this.
10600915	10602756	There's a game called Rhythm Destruction.
10603216	10611320	It is a game that's a cross between a shmup and a rhythm game and features music by Kyle Ward.
10611761	10616703	So if you want to check that out, check out Rhythm Destruction on Kickstarter.
10616743	10619645	They've got 18 days left, five bucks net to the game.
10619945	10620966	So that's not bad.
10621986	10628393	and that's including, I think, a Steam key and they're supposed to be bringing that out, I think, on Xbox Indie games as well.
10628493	10630415	It does support an Xbox 360 controller.
10630636	10631877	It's also on Steam Greenlight.
10632478	10636041	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10636061	10639305	If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open.
10641823	10642203	That's all.
10642344	10648269	Otherwise, I was responding to folks in the chat room, apparently about the breaking of our stream or what have you.
10649070	10654876	Also, the Indie Games, or Indie Royale, they have a back-to-school bundle that's out with seven games.
10655537	10656217	Pay what you want.
10657499	10662604	Includes Lunar Flight, Bunny Must Die, Chelsea, and The Seven Devils.
10665606	10674071	Clion, FlyingRedBarrel, Sequence, CuteThingsDyingViolently, and an 18-track chiptune album, Bias.
10684597	10686999	Alright, going to some tweet topics real quick.
10687079	10693185	First, I want to say Bobby Blackwolf, who sent us a tweet to a story about how LittleBigPlanet Vita's street date was lifted.
10693825	10694406	You're a jerk.
10695707	10697188	But yes, we already addressed this.
10697729	10698970	The street date was lifted.
10699711	10702853	Sony says retailers can begin selling the game once they receive copies.
10702873	10705055	Well, apparently my local Target didn't receive copies.
10705416	10707578	So this news is still false, as far as I'm concerned.
10709183	10710484	TigerClaw sends us some tweets.
10711465	10714647	Oh, this was really sad, and it does have a tie-in to the gaming world.
10715467	10717429	I don't know if, well, hopefully you heard about this.
10717469	10720311	Hopefully you're not that shut off to the world around you, but there was a U.S.
10720351	10726475	Embassy attack that happened in Libya, and it took the lives of a few people, and one of them was this huge EVE Online player.
10726795	10729258	Like apparently he was really big in the EVE Online community.
10729518	10736486	His nickname in the community was Vile Rat, but he was known to his friends and family also as Sean Smith.
10736907	10740331	And unfortunately he died in that senseless attack this week that was...
10742313	10743193	Very unfortunate.
10744774	10747034	The EVE community is grieving his loss.
10747054	10755497	They're saying that over the years, Vile Rat rose to become one of the most well-known and respected diplomats for one of the most powerful alliances in EVE.
10755897	10759598	He was instrumental in shaping the universe we all play in today.
10759958	10764139	That was Chairman Mark Hurd on the CSM behalf.
10764179	10767240	That would be the Council of Stellar Management for EVE Online.
10768040	10788986	there you go uh very sad very sad um moving on another link from Tiger Claw uh consoles lacking in an important functionality for MMOs I want to see what this is about because I don't know this one so he sent us a story from GameSpot that talks about I don't want to see this give me this one here
10791232	10793673	Sorry, my iPad's acting up and not showing me the right story there.
10793713	10797754	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio if you want to call in.
10799655	10806518	The VP of Publishing at Wargaming.net says, Long approval times on consoles are restricting development of MMOs.
10806978	10810699	Otherwise, they would be there if manufacturers made it easier for developers.
10812020	10817622	This is according to Andre Yaren...
10819302	10824826	and Yaran Sao, who is at the World of Tanks World Championship Final.
10825287	10827468	Oh, have you heard about that MMO, World of Tanks?
10828289	10828789	I've heard of that.
10828809	10829870	I've heard of that before, too.
10829910	10831531	It's supposed to be, like, massive.
10832171	10841458	They were pimping it out over at the air show I went to, World of Tanks, and there's also some other one, World of War, or World of Planes or something.
10841718	10842459	Well, here's a quote.
10842479	10843519	Again, I'm reading this article.
10843559	10847322	I'm sight-reading this article for the first time because of the tweet we got from Tigerclaw.
10847962	10853586	Consoles are a nice, attractive part of the market because there are no really well-known MMOs there, and the install base is huge.
10853927	10857089	But as you know, the consoles are still lacking in important functionality.
10857529	10861872	In MMOs, it is very important for developers to have a fast reaction time for the service.
10862332	10869477	If you're a big company like Sony or Microsoft, then the approval time for release candidates is so, so long, you can't change the game immediately."
10870939	10876207	So interesting, kind of blaming the console development cycle for the reason that MMOs aren't coming out.
10878260	10889845	Well, Square Enix might have something to say about that when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn, or whatever they're calling it, which is still coming out later this year, as far as I know, or at least it's going into testing.
10890746	10893727	And Zaku in our chatroom reminds us about Final Fantasy XI.
10894647	10900910	SSJ100Matt, lastly on Twitter, wanted to remind us about the Bungie Ferret Tossing soundtrack, but I already plugged that earlier.
10901670	10902531	So that's it for tweets.
10903231	10905372	Any other last-minute stories, Logie?
10907556	10908838	I think that was it.
10909699	10910040	Alright.
10910721	10915628	Well, Skyflying's not looking too popular tonight, so unfortunately I'm going to go ahead and shut it down.
10917348	10922332	If you think of something later on, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be a great place to send an email to.
10922352	10928778	Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com But the show's running a little long anyway because we had a very long first half.
10929138	10930979	So I think it's about time to wrap things up anyway.
10931680	10933602	Alan, thank you for being here tonight as always.
10933962	10937365	I appreciate you filling in even though you feel like you have to do it apparently.
10938145	10940147	I won't ask you next time then and see how you feel.
10941428	10942589	Enjoy Black Mesa and all that.
10943510	10945031	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
10947113	10949455	Chicken.
10949855	10956381	I would like to remind everybody that this show is free and we don't ask for much, but please tell a friend or two about the show.
10956461	10957662	Help spread the word, word of mouth.
10957682	10968831	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show and support independent podcasting, especially those shows at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
10969512	10972934	We love being a part of this indie network that helps to bring...
10973695	10993151	The voices of gamers everywhere to you even when they're being shy like they are tonight Ranma's not shy though at least, we know that Loki, thank you as always for being here and enjoy the Skylanders purse and the points more importantly that maybe can buy you something you'll actually be using but any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
10995374	11007252	play on our Minecraft server if you haven't done that yet because it's awesome and you should check it out and then of course on Tuesday play Borderlands 2 with me because I need someone to play with
11008596	11011138	And my final thought tonight is, yes, play those games.
11011258	11014841	Play World of Warcraft and listen to Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
11015281	11018784	Or if you're extifer, play Guild Wars 2 and still be on a Warcraft podcast.
11019485	11026050	Listen to that and also play Bungie Ferret Tossing tomorrow on Xbox Live Indie Games.
11026470	11027171	Very exciting.
11027971	11028771	That's it, guys.
11028831	11031252	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11031292	11032512	Thank you, as always, for tuning in.
11032833	11036354	Remember, we will not be live Sunday next week.
11036434	11039515	However, a new episode will still be playing on the feed.
11039895	11041875	Podcast listeners, nothing will change for you.
11041895	11043856	You'll still have a new show next week because I'm out of town.
11043896	11045096	So I just want to remind everybody of that.
11045556	11050718	We'll be back live in two weeks with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11050978	11052798	And that would be in two weeks, episode number 475.
11054719	11055520	We're climbing on up.
11055761	11057423	Moving on up.
11057623	11058144	500's almost here.
11058685	11059646	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
11059846	11060107	Take care.
11061081	11064103	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
