0	20840	Tonight, September 16th, 2012, the Wii U launch details are official, Zynga files a counterclaim
20840	29840	against EA, and is Microsoft planning an immersive display experience for their next console?
29840	34640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34640	41560	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 473 for
41560	46920	Sunday, September 16th, 2012. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the
46920	51640	next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and gaming
51640	57160	lols with my co-host, not with us tonight, sadly, the one, the only, Dark Sakura. She
57160	62120	has the night off, it is a holiday in her religion, so a happy Rosh Hashanah to those
62120	66400	of you that celebrate it. We do have here tonight, though, in-studio, Techmaster Loki
66400	67400	joining us.
67400	68400	Hello.
68400	69400	How are you, Loki?
69400	70400	I'm doing alright.
70400	74720	Awesome. And joining us in Jamie's absence, always a wonderful stand-by guest host we're
74720	78120	happy to have here, as if he had a choice, say hello to Alan.
78120	79120	Hello.
79120	80120	How are you doing, Alan?
80120	81120	Good.
81120	82120	What's new with you lately?
82120	83640	Not much, working a lot.
83640	87280	Yeah? Have you had time for any hobbies outside of video gaming and work?
87280	88280	No.
88280	89280	No?
89280	90280	No.
90280	91280	What else do you do on the interwebs?
91280	92280	Tumblers.
92280	93280	Tumblers, you're a big Tumblr fan?
93280	94280	Yes.
94280	97400	Why do you like Tumblr? I have a hard time getting into Tumblr.
97400	101880	Because for like funny reaction gifs and fandom stuff and screenshots, that's where everyone
101880	103040	fits into that.
103040	104040	There was an amazing-
104040	105040	Is on there.
105040	108740	There was an amazing gif I saw on Tumblr last night that was, it said, starships are meant
108740	113880	to fly and it was an old lady going up one of those moving chairs. I guess you had to
113880	114880	see it.
114880	119400	All right. Anyhow, all right. We'll talk to Alan Moore as the show goes on. We do of course
119400	125280	tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or VOG Network. VOGnetwork.com
125280	131440	is the place to be. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
131440	135080	Another quality show from Bobby tonight. And we even got into a little bit of a debate
135080	138280	at the end there on a topic we'll be talking about here shortly. And you can check that
138280	143200	out at VOGnetwork.com when Bobby posts his show very soon. But you should be participating
143200	148920	live. You can also participate with us and chat in our chat room, live.VOGnetwork.com
148920	154040	where we have some good, some good well wishes tonight. Rama saying l'chaim SSG100 mad. Happy
154040	158200	new year. So some other well wishes there for those celebrating the holiday today.
158200	161280	All right. We're going to break form a little bit tonight. We're going to get right into
161280	166460	some news tonight. Obviously there was huge news this week. Let's address that pink elephant
166460	167460	in the room.
167460	172680	It's the transforce four. I know it's amazing. It's going to be fantastic. And I can't wait
172680	173680	to play it.
173680	177680	Not quite the same thing I had in mind, but all right. Uh, we're going to go to a clip
177680	181400	here. I want to start with this clip. It's a two minute clip. This is a clip from our
181400	189840	show episode four 63 from July 1st. Let's go to the clip. The Wii U, uh, I think is
189840	194900	a reasonable price. It's got a few reasonable prices. Actually. There's three different
194900	199860	skews they're going to be launching with. What's in those skews? No idea. Uh, what I
199860	205200	think they are, I'll get into in a second. So the cheapest you're going to find a Wii
205200	214280	U will be $249.99. So there's that. The next price up $299.99 and then $349.99 are the
214280	218480	three different price points. Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely
218480	224400	speculative. I don't know for a fact this is what it is. Um, $249.99 is going to get
224400	231600	you a Wii U system with the game pad controller and that's it. So system, game pad. It's basically
231600	236000	you own a Wii right now. You have all this, you know, Wii remotes and... Go on the online
236000	241280	shop and enjoy. Yeah, nunchucks. Done. There you go. You've got a system. You're ready
241280	247600	to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U. $299.99 buys you a system
247600	255640	that's going to have the Wii U game pad and then additional Wii remote plus and a nunchuck.
255640	261400	Kind of like, you know, the Wii hat. And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the
261400	267040	game pad controller, the Wii remote plus, the nunchuck, and another pack-in game. Because
267040	272560	I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land. It just seems like such a pack-in
272560	276760	type game that I think they're going to do that. Honestly, I do not think they're launching
276760	280320	the system with two game pads because there's no games that support it and people will be
280320	285240	like, it won't sell. That may come later on when they have, you know, games that support
285240	289200	two game pads but right now it's absolutely useless to do that which is why they're not
289200	294840	going to do that. Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing
294840	299240	the price points and release date in September but there are the price points. Release date
299240	305920	is probably going to be the 18th of November. So that's that. I think it's somewhat reasonable.
305920	311680	That again, a clip, it's done. The clip was from episode 463 on July 1st, 2012. Let me
311680	318160	start by applauding you. Honestly, clap, clap, clap. Show me anyone else that was that close.
318160	322420	Was it perfect? No. You did make one major flaw. Let's talk about the flaw. Where was
322420	327840	the different, obviously, $299.349 ended up being legit. You called multiple SKUs. The
327840	333200	Wii did not, well, multiple bundles. People don't like it when you say SKU. Multiple bundles,
333200	338640	you called that. We didn't have that but Wii U does. You did call that. You missed the
338640	344000	boat on there being this $249 bundle. Why do you think that happened? I think it happened
344000	348240	for a few reasons. One, three SKUs would be too confusing for the consumers or the average
348240	352080	consumers. People wouldn't know what to buy. They'd be like, okay, am I supposed to get
352080	358720	the $299 one, the $349 one, $249? It's just too confusing for the populace. That's why
358720	364920	they only launched the two SKUs for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. No one does more
364920	370720	than two SKUs because it's too confusing. I also think they can't get the cost that
370720	375740	low. They couldn't get the cost of the system to be $249 so they just dropped that bottom
375740	384000	SKU because I think that's why they haven't announced the price until now. It's because
384000	387400	they didn't know what the system was going to cost. They were trying to get that cost
387400	392400	down and probably at one point they did have the packing controllers and stuff but it was
392400	396440	just too expensive for them. Well, we know about what that tablet cost thanks to the
396440	400480	Japanese Nintendo Direct and I think what was the price? It would translate it to somewhere
400480	406700	around $150 US for just the tablet. That's a lot higher than I would have thought because
406700	410640	to me that thing isn't much more than the bottom half of a DS except a little bigger.
410640	415880	Let's say a DS XL. I guess maybe it's a little bigger than that too. I was kind of surprised
415880	420240	it's got to go that high and that certainly would set off a chain of events that would
420240	425360	cause the $249 bundle to get eliminated. Well, even their reasoning behind not having remotes
425360	430520	and nunchucks in there, they're like, well, there's 100 million remotes or like 10 million
430520	435080	remotes out there or something like that. I think it's 100 million remotes out there.
435080	439240	We don't need to include that because you probably already have one. Cool. You're talking
439240	444200	to somebody that owns a Wii system. What if I don't own a Wii system? Then I don't have
444200	448360	one. So I got to spend all this extra money to buy those. Well, to be fair, what about
448360	452200	the secondhand market? There's going to be tons of that stuff floating around as people
452200	454320	are... Yeah, but secondhand market's going to be... I don't think it's going to be a
454320	459080	lot of those remote pluses. I think it's going to be the remotes and then you got to buy
459080	464880	Wii Motion Plus to plug into that thing because they don't sell those anymore and a lot of
464880	472920	people trade in their old remotes to buy the Wii Motion Plus enabled remote pluses. But
472920	477460	I think, like I said, that they cut the bottom skew just because they couldn't get the price
477460	482160	cheap enough. Well, still, I mean, despite the fact that, you know, that part didn't
482160	485800	end up being true and you even said in that clip you were kind of pulling what was in
485800	491240	those bundles out of your ass and you still kind of got the $349 one right. You were pretty
491240	495360	cool. I mean, there's a part in that clip I cut out where I went on this... I'm like,
495360	499480	I think the $349 bundle will have two Wii tablets and dah, dah, dah. What was I wrong?
499480	502920	That's another reason why you're not, well, you're not seeing two tablets because one
502920	507840	no game support. You're not seeing them sell the tablets separately because... Here. Once
507840	512300	again, well, not here, because people will be confused and they'll think, oh, this is
512300	515640	just an add-on for the Wii. I'm going to buy the tablet and they go home and it doesn't
515640	522400	fucking work in my Wii. Why does this work? This tablet's the Wii U, right? No, it's not.
522400	527340	So you have to, you just have to think about the consumer and, you know, whether they're
527340	530580	going to be confused by what you're trying to sell to them.
530580	535120	GioVidea agrees with you in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and puts it into slightly
535120	539320	different words. The secondhand market comes from people upgrading as well. You need those
539320	543000	parts even if you upgrade, so there isn't going to be a huge market. I suppose that's
543000	547080	true. People are going to need those Wiimotes and things for the new system if they want
547080	552300	to play all the games. Nintendo Land, the pack-in game, that's the weird thing to me,
552300	555580	that it isn't coming with another Wiimote because doesn't Nintendo Land's mini games
555580	561420	kind of require those Wiimotes? I think they're all multiplayer games. A better pack-in game
561420	566320	would have been the new Super Mario Brothers U. Now I understand why they did Nintendo
566320	569760	Land because Nintendo Land's like Wii Play, Wii Sports, whatever, it's basically tech
569760	577960	demos to get you familiar with how you use the controllers and stuff like that. But it's
577960	582360	also a multiplayer game, so if you buy it for your kid or something like that and you
582360	586720	don't have a Wii, well, sucks to be you and you're not going to be playing very much of
586720	592120	it because you've got to go get those extra controllers and stuff. And it gets confusing
592120	599720	I think because you've got all these different control methods with this thing. You've got
599720	607080	the remotes, the nunchucks, the classic controllers, the pro controllers, this tablet thing, you've
607080	614680	got the balance board and just figuring out what you need for each game. Oh, nunchucks
614680	622260	with everything too. It's just going to get confusing. It's interesting. There is a lot.
622260	627000	There's a lot of peripherals over in Nintendo Land, that's for sure. Chris109 in our chat
627000	631600	at live.fognetwork.com says, my sister was thinking that the Wii U pad was just an add-on
631600	637280	and that you write a U next to the, and it got cut off, but I'm assuming next to the
637280	641840	word, Wii. So maybe not everybody is still, I mean, Jimmy Fallon, I was going to reference
641840	645360	that clip too. There was that big clip a couple months ago where, you know, even Jimmy Fallon
645360	650880	didn't get it and Reggie had to kind of hold on. It's a whole new system, but you know,
650880	654140	you can sit there and be a skeptic. I can sit there and be a skeptic. I'm not sure where
654140	659160	Alan's at, but we'll ask him in a little bit. The fact of the matter is pre-orders are going
659160	663000	fast as we have a story coming up later on. As we have to take the word from Nintendo
663000	666200	that they're going fast. Well, if you try to go to GameStop yourself, they're not going
666200	669800	to give you one right now. Well, that's because Nintendo tells GameStop how many they can
669800	675440	sell. But we don't know what that number is. Of course not, because they want to make it
675440	679240	sound like it's in high demand, like they do with the Wii. Remember all those artificial,
679240	685880	I'm sorry, real life shortages. Totally not artificial shortages whatsoever. Well, to
685880	690660	be fair, Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox 360 launch. I distinctly remember
690660	696440	how long it took to find a stinkin' 360, trying to go on and check Best Buy's inventory every
696440	700800	day. That crap was madness. Okay, yeah, that may have lasted for a few months. Nintendo's
700800	706720	Wii launch lasted for a few years that they did that, okay? It wasn't even, you know,
706720	713040	a few months. It was, okay, we got our supply line taken care of in a couple months, but
713040	717400	the Wii, it was just like, oh, it's so hard to get, it's so hard to get, it's the must-have
717400	722720	toy for, you know, your kids. I don't know, whatever, you know, I'm skeptical. There's
722720	727640	some talk about the things that the Wii U could be leaving out. Tigerclaw in our chat
727640	731640	at live.vognetwork.com says, the only thing you have to take into account is the Wii U
731640	735840	is not GameCube compatible, so if you still play your GameCube games, you'll need to keep
735840	741080	that Wii. Or find a GameCube, to be fair. You could find a GameCube, but it's cheap.
741080	746240	Nowadays, Wiis aren't compatible with GameCube either. And that's right. Sj100matt followed
746240	750800	up saying they dropped GameCube controller compatibility in new Wii models, so I wouldn't
750800	754520	expect it on the Wii U. He left out the part about the games don't play in the new Wii
754520	758800	models either, but certainly the controllers aren't there either. You know, I'm surprised
758800	762760	that the system doesn't do, I guess I understand why they don't do it, so they can do their
762760	767720	own HD remakes and stuff, but I'm surprised, you know, since you can play these games on
767720	772280	your PC and emulator and HD and stuff, that it wouldn't be that hard to, you know, take
772280	776600	the old games and kind of upgrade them a little bit. And hell, I mean, even the Playstation
776600	782120	3 does that with Playstation 2 games and Playstation 1 games. To a little bit of, you know, smaller
782120	787520	extent they kind of smooth them out a little bit. And even like, you know, the Xbox 360
787520	790800	did that with the Xbox games, it kind of smoothed it out a little bit to make it look a little
790800	794920	bit nicer. But I'm surprised they don't do that with the Wii stuff. It's just, you would
794920	798320	think that would be kind of a cool selling point. Hey, all your games look better now.
798320	802160	I mean, because that might even be a way to get people to purchase one if they're not
802160	803160	going to.
803160	807000	Well, we'll talk a little bit more when we get into the news segment of our show, the
807000	810920	official news segment of our show, on some more of the details with the Wii. There's
810920	813760	some pretty big ones we're leaving out right now, but we'll come back to it in the official
813760	819360	news segment, talk a little more about it, see where everybody here in studio is on if
819360	822120	they're going to get one or not, and then later when we get into the Fugu question
822120	825980	of the week, and throughout the show with our chatters, we'll see where the listeners
825980	829920	are at with do they want to Wii U or not, because obviously this is kind of a very polarizing
829920	836440	thing in the gaming world right now. Very back and forth on Twitter. Lots of fanboys,
836440	842680	lots of anti-fanboys, a few people in the middle, but not a lot.
842680	846880	I did, though, want to take a second to say, though, again, congrats, because you nailed
846880	851640	the date back in July before any other rumor was out there. A lot of people jumped on the
851640	856400	November train the closer we got here to the September conference, but you nailed it, so
856400	857400	props to you.
857400	862800	Yes, thank you, EpicMickey2, because that was the giveaway, considering that they're
862800	870120	launching EpicMickey2 on all SKUs on the 18th. Disney never launches a game on Sunday. They
870120	872160	never do that, so it was pretty obvious.
872160	876520	That was your hint right there. Well, whatever it was, props to you, because I didn't hear
876520	880040	anybody else get as close as you did, even some top industry analysts.
880040	883520	But that's all right, because no one noticed.
883520	890480	All right, let's move on into our gaming weeks. Obviously, there's no chance to play a Wii
890480	894840	U just yet, so we've been playing some other stuff to pass the time. Alan, I haven't heard
894840	898280	from you a lot yet, so let's start with you tonight. How was your gaming week? What have
898280	899280	you been up to?
899280	900280	Amazing.
900280	901280	Yeah?
901280	905720	Black Mesa Soars. It's so good, I lost my mind. It is so good.
905720	909840	All right, back up a little bit. For those that may not know, what is Black Mesa Soars?
909840	916160	It is a eight years in the making fan project to completely remake Half Life 1 and the Half
916160	922160	Life 2 source engine with completely new HD assets, new voice acting, new face models.
922160	926680	It is indistinguishable from something that Valve could have made themselves. It is that
926680	927680	good.
927680	928680	That's a pretty good endorsement right there.
928680	929680	Yes.
929680	932600	Can I read an email you sent me earlier in the week, if I can dig it up?
932600	933600	Yeah.
933600	936600	Dear Rob, I love you, XOXO. No, I'm just kidding.
936600	938600	That's not true.
938600	946440	Okay. Let's see. Where is it? Where is that one you sent me? Oh, this is great radio,
946440	953480	isn't it? I think you just sent it to me. Okay, here it is. I think this mod may be
953480	959080	the greatest accomplishment a fandom has ever produced for a franchise. I'm serious. There
959080	964000	are tons of little added ambient dialogue bits and everything is professional. It is
964000	970760	literally indistinguishable, italicized, from something Valve could have made themselves.
970760	976800	This is not a mod. This is a wholesale creation that had the added benefit of model to reference.
976800	981440	These developers deserve college scholarships or offer letters from Valve. And I'll be
981440	986080	angry if Gabe Newell doesn't make some kind of statement by the end of the month acknowledging
986080	991160	how fucking good this is. They perfectly mimic the lobby of Black Mesa that is referenced
991160	996120	from the more recent Half-Life 2 Episode 2 that of course looks nothing like the same
996120	1000720	room in the 98 original. Anyone who still complains this took eight years to make is
1000720	1001720	a fool.
1001720	1007560	I'm allowed to have some hyperbole in my emails to my boyfriend, thank you. I was very
1007560	1008560	heated.
1008560	1012560	Well, it certainly got the point across. But I mean, for something you didn't pay any
1012560	1016240	money for, you felt very... Well, I mean, it's a positive review.
1016240	1021200	When the game loads up and you're on that monorail going through all of the extra rooms
1021200	1024920	and shit they added, I had to pause it in like two places and be like, what the fuck
1024920	1030720	am I looking at? This is like, this is incredible. It's just like what the trailer was that came
1030720	1036920	out in 09. But better, it's... Half-Life in itself is a fucking awesome game. And this
1036920	1039760	just complete for a fan project has blown my mind.
1039760	1043400	Well, and despite, you know, what you said in your email about college scholarships and
1043400	1048200	Gabe Newell should essentially give them big hugs and what have you, you have to admit
1048200	1053680	it is pretty impressive. Valve themselves said, cool, just don't call it Half-Life and
1053680	1054680	we're good.
1054680	1055680	Yeah.
1055680	1058440	You know, don't infringe on the trademark and we're good. In fact, we'll help you distribute
1058440	1059440	it on Steam.
1059440	1060440	Yeah, it's on Greenlight.
1060440	1061440	For free.
1061440	1062440	It's on Greenlight. Yeah.
1062440	1063640	It is free. That's huge.
1063640	1069040	You just have to own any source game. If you own a fucking Portal game, you can get this.
1069040	1070640	Which they've given away for free.
1070640	1076640	Yes. So, Portal I think is the most accessible title that you would have that you could play
1076640	1080280	this with or Left 4 Dead because Left 4 Dead is also crazy popular.
1080280	1085880	Now, what about, can't you download the client for Team Fortress 2 since that's Source 2,
1085880	1086880	isn't it?
1086880	1087880	Yeah, that could also be it too.
1087880	1088880	And that is free.
1088880	1089880	Yeah.
1089880	1090880	Aha. Loki working the system, like usual.
1090880	1095160	So yeah, you asked me, am I ever going to play Half-Life, either Half-Life the original
1095160	1100440	or Half-Life Source? No, there's no reason to because Black Mesa Source is there.
1100440	1102680	That's a big endorsement from a Half-Life fan like you.
1102680	1103680	Yes.
1103680	1105560	So now the next question, where the fuck is Half-Life 3?
1105560	1106560	Well, this is...
1106560	1107560	Another eight years.
1107560	1112640	Yeah, I know. And there are people that are, there are people on the forums kind of being
1112640	1117000	smart asses, but they're right saying, when I legitimately thought that this fan project
1117000	1120480	was vaporware, I had a little voice in the back of my head that said, even if this is
1120480	1127000	vaporware, we're still going to see this before Half-Life 3. And those people are all right.
1127000	1132360	Amazing. Going to our chat, Tigerclaw saying, I was hoping somebody would talk about Black
1132360	1136400	Mesa. I heard Black Mesa doesn't have Xen.
1136400	1140440	That is true. They announced that two weeks ago when they finally put up the release date,
1140440	1145480	the seven-day counter. This is real. Xen was probably one of the first, one of the worst
1145480	1149560	parts of the original game. It's the last chapter. It's the last 10% of the game. You're
1149560	1155440	in an alien dimension. Gravity is weird. It's got all these weird platforming bullshit puzzles
1155440	1158280	in it for a first-person shooter. You don't really want to do that. It's probably the
1158280	1163080	biggest misstep in the original game. The Black Mesa source developer said, we are putting
1163080	1170320	out 90% of the game once you enter the portal to go into Xen. I haven't gotten there yet,
1170320	1173040	but I imagine there's a screen that's like, we're saving your game. This is going to be
1173040	1177680	patched in. They haven't, of course, they, these people are terrified of giving deadlines,
1177680	1182520	but they're like, it is coming. We're working on Xen. It's mostly done. Xen is just, Xen's
1182520	1184400	coming later and that's the end of the game.
1184400	1188120	Yeah. Dungeon Buster in chat says it's not finished yet. Everything's remade up to Lambda
1188120	1192640	Core, but they figured they'd release what they have now and the rest later. Breakman
1192640	1200680	asks, Jesus, did he play the game or marry it? No shame. I don't care. You know, and
1200680	1208720	I think the part here we don't want to overlook very important point. Valve didn't do this.
1208720	1215760	Valve embraced it, but they didn't do it. Fans did it. Think about that. What has your
1215760	1217160	fandom accomplished?
1217160	1223100	The, they, well, they added women to, cause the, in the original game, all the security
1223100	1226880	guards and scientists are just men just because it's only two or three different models, right?
1226880	1232220	They added women. There's the guards and the scientists. There's like 16 unique face models
1232220	1238000	so that when you come across these NPCs, like, Oh, this is like a new person. It's all of
1238000	1242920	the, the, the added voice acting of just the guards being killed by monsters running around
1242920	1248400	that you encounter. It sounds like they found the original people from the first game and
1248400	1253200	they just added all these lines of dialogue. It's, it's crazy what they did with this.
1253200	1258000	So props to the folks who put this together. Certainly. Uh, it's, it's hard to make an
1258000	1264600	argument not to go download this right now. Correct? It's a classic game, free. They,
1264600	1268520	they made some little changes to the maps because obviously someone like I've, I've
1268520	1272040	beaten the original half-life maybe eight times from start to finish so I could zerg
1272040	1276560	my way through it. But I'm like, Oh, they added this area or, Oh, they changed. They,
1276560	1279400	they closed this door that I used to go into and I have to go over here and this is all
1279400	1283480	new. So they know that they added their own little, they added their own little spice
1283480	1284480	to it.
1284480	1288760	Dungeon buster at live.vognetwork.com says black Mesa's really great work. Glad they
1288760	1294040	kept the, or glad they kept the faith to continue with it for so long. Very good point as well.
1294040	1300400	Consider what happened to them in 09 where they came out, they said Q3 or Q4 of 09, it's
1300400	1304940	going to happen. They realized the parts that they had left the program were the hardest
1304940	1310700	parts. They had at least a year's worth of work left to do. And they made a design decision
1310700	1315320	to basically cut out huge chunks of the game that they didn't know how to code. And once
1315320	1320200	010 or once 2010 hit, they're like, okay, now that we've take, now that we've cut all
1320200	1324080	of this shit out because it was too hard for us to do, we're now embarrassed by this and
1324080	1325800	we don't want to put it out like this.
1325800	1329880	So they're like, fuck it. Media blackout. They took down their Twitter or they just,
1329880	1332240	they stopped updating their Twitter and their YouTube and they're like, we're going to put
1332240	1336600	all this shit back in however long it takes us to do it. And it took until September of
1336600	1337600	this year.
1337600	1342040	Wow. Still, that's amazing dedication because that sort of demotivation would have killed
1342040	1345560	a lot of people. Yeah. It's very impressive what fan communities do. You know, we've seen
1345560	1349560	a lot of these stories throughout the years. I can remember way back when there was the
1349560	1354000	fan translation of final fantasy five for emulators. Remember that back in the day before
1354000	1356920	there was a PlayStation release three, I think was the first one, right? The next one. Cause
1356920	1358320	that's the first game we didn't get.
1358320	1363120	Uh, no, I think five got the translation first. Three came soon afterwards. Okay. Cause I
1363120	1368480	think the NES was harder to patch or something. I don't know. Um, I also remember second at
1368480	1372960	sets with three was the other huge, huge one that they did the fan translation for. Uh,
1372960	1378240	and then of course I remember the, um, don't call it King's quest, but the silver lining
1378240	1383400	name that was heavily inspired by King's quest at one time was called King's quest nine,
1383400	1386440	but like Black Mesa, they had to take the King's quest out of their name to avoid the
1386440	1390760	legal situation they had found themselves in. So it's really impressive what a lot of
1390760	1394600	like fan communities have accomplished. And I'm like, would I be that motivated to do
1394600	1398400	anything like that? Oh yeah. I have had a podcast for 10 years. I guess that's kind
1398400	1403320	of cool, but this shit's easy. Black Mesa. I don't think that was nearly as easy. So
1403320	1407520	that's, that's, you know, major props. So, well, what else in your gaming week? Anything
1407520	1408520	else?
1408520	1414480	Um, tinkered around with a little wow. Checking out the, the balance changes and the class
1414480	1418960	changes to my druid. She was my main and I haven't really played as much wow as I should.
1418960	1424560	And then, um, mass effect three multiplayer a little bit. They had a multiplayer weekend
1424560	1429560	last little bit, a little bit the last weekend when they had their, um, every other week
1429560	1434600	they do, um, log in and do this squad challenge and you get like a free rare all elite weapon
1434600	1439240	on Wednesday or whatever. I completely spaced it because I'm like, what level are you in
1439240	1445240	mass effect three multiple? My N seven score. It's like about six 80 and then I'll still
1445240	1450280	log in and in a match with someone with an N seven score of like 8,000 I'm like, you
1450280	1455280	know what? I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad. They're sharing their account. That's
1455280	1459680	what's going on there. All right. Um, anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
1459680	1463160	No, that's it. Let's go to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, I played lots of
1463160	1471560	Minecraft. I've been just building this massive, massive, massive castle on the VOG network
1471560	1476880	server, which you should join by the way, if you haven't already. It's pretty fun. Get
1476880	1482240	a few people on there. Um, I see a few people on that fucking castle. You're building is
1482240	1488440	astounding. That I could see that all the way from my little house. That's like a ways
1488440	1492040	away. I can't believe we're talking about a fake world, but my house is like all the
1492040	1497280	way away. The one that some smart ass nut man to put four foreclosure signs all over.
1497280	1502120	Did I show you that? Yeah. Little troll. And you know what? Sad as I took retribution on
1502120	1505920	the wrong house because I'm like, Loki, who fucking did that? You're the server admin.
1505920	1510000	Tell me who did it. And you're like, I think it was the guys up on the Hill from you, which
1510000	1514700	is like Logan 89 or something. And I would, there's some people I can't, like there's
1514700	1520560	some like I don't see them on the map. Like not man. I haven't seen actually play, but
1520560	1524080	there's like a few spots cause I need everybody to start like post. I mean, if you haven't
1524080	1528040	already like put a sign out front of your house. So I know who's it is cause there's
1528040	1531920	like a bunch of spots. Like I had my coworker is the worst. He keeps starting new places.
1531920	1535920	He's like, I want to build in this Island. I'm like, you already have four fucking houses.
1535920	1540480	I'm breaking all of them. If you don't fucking, you know, pick a spot, pick a spot and stick
1540480	1545240	to it. And like the other day he's like, I think I'm going to build over here. I'm like,
1545240	1548760	no, you're not. You're building where you fucking said before. And I actually had to
1548760	1553400	go in there and like I switched it up to creative to go and destroy his like other houses they
1553400	1557280	built because they were, I don't want all these like half built things. Well, I will
1557280	1564440	let nut man know the banker that I have started digging up clay from all the lakes I can find
1564440	1569400	and started baking some bricks so I can make a house out of brick. So go pick on the guys
1569400	1574000	up on top of the Hill who also have a stone house or go try to foreclose Loki's cows.
1574000	1577840	I know it's all in good fun. I'm not really mad. I laughed. I really did laugh. I made
1577840	1583880	a gate on my castle that works with pistons. Although I came back to it today and it was
1583880	1589800	all glitched out so I had to fix it again. But so surprisingly fun Minecraft multiplayer
1589800	1594000	and all that get on this, get on the fog server right now. The reason why I haven't checked
1594000	1599760	out the server yet is that I hadn't played it in so long. They went from patch one, two,
1599760	1604160	five to one, three, two. Yeah. And a lot of my, I don't say my mods are broken cause I'm
1604160	1608320	still able to load my world, but I need to go update all that shit. And it's just a pain
1608320	1612560	in the ass. Well, yeah, that's why I haven't, that's why I run a vanilla server because
1612560	1617160	I'm like, I don't know how to fucking set this up with bucket and stuff. I'm like, what
1617160	1624400	mods? The mods that I use are mostly just quality of life stuff. They're not like spawn
1624400	1630480	diamonds everywhere. No, no, no, no, no. I thought you would frown on that even though
1630480	1635720	he's probably doing it himself. I know I do find myself in creative mode a little bit
1635720	1640240	more than I probably should be. Just a flyer. You know what? When I saw those endermen outside
1640240	1644000	my house, I was like, no thank you. I'm going to log out for about 30 minutes and come back
1644000	1648880	on those guys. They honestly, uh, cause like I said, the other day we were fucking around
1648880	1655600	with it and my friend took on like 20 of them at once. I mean, they're really not that if
1655600	1660560	you just don't look at their face, you can walk right past them. They're scary. They
1660560	1665800	are kind of creepy. They are creepy survival horror. It is hilarious though, watching them
1665800	1669600	like in the rain because I was like building in the rain. I'll say I see this like red
1669600	1674920	flash go past my screen. Like what the fuck was that? It's like a bug or something. It's
1674920	1678360	because they're flipping out because they keep teleporting and they hit the rain and
1678360	1681960	then they take damage. So they teleport again. So they're teleporting all over the place.
1681960	1688440	It was kind of funny. But anyways, so I played lots of Minecraft. Um, and then I played a
1688440	1693560	little bit Call of Duty. I'm playing some of that cause we have some more people we're
1693560	1698280	playing with now at work and stuff. We haven't played Minecraft during our breaks, so that's
1698280	1703720	kind of fun. I repurposed our arcade cabinet that we had running MAME and stuff to play
1703720	1711520	Minecraft. And um, and then yesterday I started playing Borderlands 2 on the Xbox 360. Ooh,
1711520	1718240	little early or broken release street dates and I'm like, okay. Whatever. It's, I like
1718240	1722880	it. It's um, you know, right now I was kind of, um, I didn't know who I should play as,
1722880	1727520	so I played as Zero cause it was kind of a little similar to Mordecai, which is how I
1727520	1732040	played the first game. You know, sniper, pistol. I don't know if he's a proficient in pistol,
1732040	1736340	but I know he's a proficient in sniper rifle. So I've been doing the sniper pistol thing
1736340	1742320	and um, I like it so far. What's kind of unique about this one versus the last game, uh, they
1742320	1745520	still have the same kind of jokes in there from like, you know, if you remember the intro
1745520	1750320	to the first game, you know, where this guy gets hit by a car. There's that in there,
1750320	1754520	then they take it a little bit further and it's kind of funny. Um, so they've got that
1754520	1759360	and then um, there's a clear cut villain in it, which is a little bit unique versus the
1759360	1763560	last game. In the last game there wasn't really a villain until like kind of towards the end
1763560	1768000	and even then it was like, okay, well the villain kept changing. It was a little weird,
1768000	1772400	but now there's a clear cut villain in there and he's awesome. You know, handsome Jack.
1772400	1779200	So um, it's pretty sweet. And the game seems a little bit harder. Um, for me at least,
1779200	1785040	like the enemies are a lot more mobile and they're less dumb. They will actually take
1785040	1789920	cover a lot better than they did before. But this one has like an easier, like cause they
1789920	1795380	have the BFF mode, right? It hasn't come out yet. Oh, BFF modes in the Macromancer, which
1795380	1799880	is, uh, I didn't realize that until October. Oh, okay. It doesn't matter. You don't need
1799880	1806380	that needs. You don't need, you don't need that if you want. I mean, it's just a skill
1806380	1810680	tree. You don't even get skills like I think until like way later in the game. Like I haven't
1810680	1814520	gotten the skill trees yet. So I thought you started getting those level five. Then again,
1814520	1818820	remember I'm playing level five. Yeah, but I'm only level four right now. I haven't even
1818820	1823480	gotten there. Wow. Okay. I mean, it takes a little bit, but um, it's, it's nice. I like
1823480	1828600	the game. It's fun. So I will definitely be playing that. Have to balance my time between
1828600	1831120	that and mine. You're only level four. It sounds like you're not playing it. And I only
1831120	1835280	played it for a couple hours. Okay. All right. I mean, cause I was like, well tell me to
1835280	1841080	go back in Minecraft. Oh, I should play this. You know, it's like me and Warcraft. Same
1841080	1844680	thing. Same thing. All right. Is that it for your gaming week? That's it. Uh, my gaming
1844680	1848080	week, I didn't talk about rock band blitz last week, so I just want to quickly kind
1848080	1852000	of give it a shout out. And I really, I've been wanting, meaning to write a review for
1852000	1857120	voggenetwork.com, but I've just been very busy between my day job and the show I'm directing
1857120	1861880	for early October. I haven't had a lot of time to just, when I do have free time, it's
1861880	1866280	like, I don't want to do more work. So I apologize. But, uh, rock band blitz, I'll tell you some
1866280	1871960	of my early thoughts on it now. Um, obviously how great is it to have an enhanced value
1871960	1877080	for all the DLC that you already have? And I think a lot of rock band blitz's strength
1877080	1883380	is just value, you know, $15 for not a bad brick of songs, you know, considering that
1883380	1887040	you have some top recent hits in there and so forth and some classics like queen and
1887040	1891720	so forth. Um, the fact that those songs will import into rock band three is great. And
1891720	1897240	just if you have hoard and downloaded as many songs for rock band, the series, as I have
1897240	1902840	on your three 60, what an amazing value to have this new game that uses them in this
1902840	1908740	whole new way. Um, some of the things I didn't like, I don't think the game is as strong
1908740	1913600	as frequency and amplitude. I think it's, you know, the whole fact that it's like two
1913600	1919480	buttons and has this kind of interesting mechanic where the way you increase your score is to
1919480	1925480	try and, uh, get up all the multipliers by a certain point in the song. But you might
1925480	1929380	have to know the song a little bit to know that, Oh, your only chance to up the vocal
1929380	1933840	multipliers is in this one part. That was a little weird to get used to, but I'm okay
1933840	1937800	with it. But the part that starts to bug me is then when you, if you really want to do
1937800	1941600	well on a song, you got to use power ups and some of the power ups are pretty cool. Like
1941600	1947200	I love the pinball and I love all that stuff, but then we get all Facebook up in here. The
1947200	1953500	only way to get these power ups is with coins and you get coins through either playing songs
1953500	1958240	or completing challenges. How do you sign up for challenges? You got to link the game
1958240	1964560	to your Facebook. Now I got to say Harmonics does get props for thinking outside of the
1964560	1969800	box and doing something a little different and integrating a game so well with the whole
1969800	1976620	Facebook thing and so forth. But I kind, and I, I, I'm also very thankful they resisted
1976620	1981360	the temptation to let you buy coins and I hope that never happens and go to that, you
1981360	1987220	know, free to play model when the game isn't really free. So I really am, I'm respectful
1987220	1991280	that they did that and I'm thankful they're not doing that. I just kind of think the whole
1991280	1996840	coins mechanic to begin with is just silly. You know, I, I props to you for thinking outside
1996840	2000600	the box. I think this is one of those things that doesn't stick. It doesn't really work
2000600	2004700	for me. And they've tried, they've, they've like tripled the number of coins you get from
2004700	2008360	challenges and they, they've done some kind of hot fixing on the fly. So I think they're
2008360	2013720	hearing that people aren't so big on this. So that's great. Harmonics does seem to give
2013720	2018400	a shit and I think that's very important when you're considering giving a company your money.
2018400	2023560	It's just that, you know, I think, um, I think it's just a little bit flawed. I think you
2023560	2028220	kind of took something that was meant to be for a free to play game and tried to put it
2028220	2032540	in this game and it's not working out so well as you can tell because you're already changing
2032540	2038360	the weights of things in the first couple of weeks. But again, 15 bucks, good songs,
2038360	2044080	new game that uses your old DLC. Not a bad deal. I, I, if you like music games, you probably
2044080	2050120	already have it. Um, some other games I've played this week. Borderlands one, cause it's
2050120	2055160	free on PlayStation plus right now. Free with the quotes cause PlayStation plus isn't free,
2055160	2059720	but you know what I mean? Um, ironic cause I already own it on the PC, but I don't know,
2059720	2062720	sometimes I just want to sit on the couch and play it that way with a controller, even
2062720	2065980	though I'm not as accurate with a controller. I've already got farther on PlayStation three
2065980	2070720	than I did on PC. Go figure, but I'm having a good time. Uh, the other new game I want
2070720	2075480	to talk about double dragon neon. Speaking of free things on PlayStation plus, did you
2075480	2080240	know double dragon neon came out this last week? Now, Alan, I distinctly remember this.
2080240	2085080	There was a previous show you were on, you were filling in for Jamie and you and I had
2085080	2090000	played through double dragon on Xbox cause I just randomly had the version that was on
2090000	2093760	Xbox like five years ago. Yeah. And then Dan came in and yelled at us. That's right. Yeah,
2093760	2099360	yeah, yeah. And we played through it and, and uh, we were like, God, what? This game
2099360	2104360	is shitty. Like what were people, why did we, why did we love this game? It did not
2104360	2108880	age well. The clipping and the falling off platforms and just the difficulty and is kind
2108880	2113480	of janky and slow and yeah. Yeah. And so Dan came in and yelled at us going, shut up. Double
2113480	2118520	dragon is a great game. But like, you know, we were like, uh, so now there's this remake
2118520	2122840	double dragon neon that came out and I got to admit I approached this remake going, double
2122840	2126600	dragon stupid, but I'm hearing a lot of good things about it. So whatever, I'll get on
2126600	2134360	there and check it out. I got to say, well done way forward. They made double dragon
2134360	2139520	kind of fun again. They did the, you know, it's not, it's not a straight up remake. It's
2139520	2143920	not a shot for shot remake type of thing. They added some new things into it. Like Billy
2143920	2149680	and Jimmy can now throw fireballs. But what I love about the game is that it's so tongue
2149680	2154760	in cheek about how stupid it is. And there's a lot of over the top-ness of it, like an
2154760	2160840	awesome 80s soundtrack, right? And the, the things that people say, like, um, like you
2160840	2164360	can whip, like, you know how you can pick up the whip that the, um, lady baddies drop
2164360	2169200	and you can start whipping people. He'll go, yeah, release the crack and start saying things
2169200	2174040	like that. It's really stupid. And then there's this whole stupid thing you can do. What,
2174040	2179840	what the hell was it called? It was, um, instead of co-op, it's called bro op and you can use
2179840	2185360	the right stick or something to just give your high, give a high five to your bro. Yeah.
2185360	2191280	High five bro. You know, it's, it's ridiculous. It's so stupid, but I'm just eating it up.
2191280	2197520	Like it's, I feel like the guys that way forward who developed it and to give this company
2197520	2201000	props, they've done a lot of the other good remakes too, of which I'm drawing a blank
2201000	2204440	right now, but I know there were some other really good ones they did. Son of a bitch.
2204440	2208320	Why can't I remember? Somebody in chat will help me out. But, um, they, it's like they
2208320	2214640	kind of knew that it was a bad game. They were adapting, but you know, made it fun.
2214640	2218800	So I love that. Uh, tiger class says, I heard they changed how a Bobo looks in the new double
2218800	2223120	dragon. Yeah. They made them like twice the size. There's definitely some Ninja turtle
2223120	2226920	arcade game elements to like the bad guys flash when they're getting weaker in health
2226920	2233480	and stuff. I just, I love that the game is self-aware. It's great. That adds so much.
2233480	2239440	I love when a game developer just, just understands the game that they're making. So, um, I mean,
2239440	2244880	if you're a PlayStation plus user, this is a no brainer. Obviously go get it. It's free.
2244880	2251400	If you have to pay money for it, um, you know, the game itself, is it going to last past
2251400	2256200	the first few LOLs and all that stuff? I don't know. It just depends how into these types
2256200	2259720	of side scrolling fighting games you are. If you liked games like final fight and all
2259720	2262840	that back in the day, and of course the original double dragon, there's something here for
2262840	2267920	you. You'll enjoy it. Ninja turtles arcade game. I'd say it's, it's on par with that.
2267920	2271960	If you didn't enjoy those games, then it's probably a pass. Probably won't be as funny
2271960	2276200	to you, but I think it's worth checking out. Thank you. Game guru in the chat room. Contra
2276200	2280960	four was a great, great game that they did. That was one of those. Um, a lot of people
2280960	2286960	miss that it was on the DS, but, um, yeah, thank you. Game girl. I knew, I knew our chatters
2286960	2292160	would help us out. Ah, degenerate Johnny in the chat says double dragon neon, the ultimate
2292160	2299480	bromance in a way it is the way double dragon should be. It's great. All right. Uh, I guess
2299480	2303720	that's it for my gaming week. So now let's get into some housekeeping. Actually, there
2303720	2310080	is a bit of housekeeping tonight. Um, first off the show, uh, we will not be here live
2310080	2316800	next week. Apologies guys, live listeners. Um, I'm going out of town, so a studio OLR
2316800	2323780	will be closed next Sunday. There will be a new episode of OLR up, so you can do that
2323780	2327480	still next week. So that will be up. We're going to tape it earlier in the week and it
2327480	2332720	will replay on Sunday night so you can hear that. So that's just a special note for our
2332720	2336960	live listeners. I don't want to discourage you from a tuning in though because Bobby
2336960	2341640	has a really good interview next week and I want to get into that because this is a
2341640	2346440	great media partnership for the network that we're on, the voice of geeks network. Um,
2346440	2349880	you know, we haven't been around that long. All things considered, we just launched what?
2349880	2354960	Uh, the official launch was June. We did a soft launch in May. We'll get this. The VOG
2354960	2361200	network is an official media partner of the siege expo. This is the southern interactive
2361200	2365760	entertainment and game expo. It's going to be taking place October 5th through 7th in
2365760	2370720	Atlanta, Georgia. You can kind of think of this like game developers conference, but
2370720	2376280	a little more localized. If you're in the southeast area, if you're in Jamie's hometown
2376280	2380760	of Mobile, you're in Bobby's hometown of Atlanta, you're in Florida. I know we got some listeners
2380760	2384440	in Florida. If you're in that area and you're interested in developing games, this is a
2384440	2388760	great opportunity for you. October 5th through 7th in Atlanta. Bobby Blackwolf will be there
2388760	2392580	representing the voice of geeks network and he's going to be there. Um, he'll be covering
2392580	2397200	the show on our website, of course, as well as his own show. Uh, he'll be helping out
2397200	2401680	the Georgia Game Developers Association with doing audio and video from the panels and
2401680	2405120	keynote speeches through the weekend. So that's really cool. This is the sixth year of the
2405120	2410240	expo. Um, some people that are going to be there. Dustin Clingman, who's the executive
2410240	2414400	director of the International Game Developers Association. Rob Carroll, who's the director
2414400	2419920	of publishing for TapJoy, uh, and so on. Panels on programming, 3D modeling, game audio. This
2419920	2424600	is not E3. No new game announcements here. You know, it's not going to be that type of
2424600	2429320	expo. But if you're curious about the industry, you want to know more about how to break into
2429320	2433320	it. How are the games really made? What's going on in game development right now and
2433320	2437760	you're in that neck of the woods, I highly encourage you to go October 5th through 7th,
2437760	2443160	Atlanta Marriott, Northwest in Atlanta, Georgia. Passes are anywhere from $39.95 to $104.95
2443160	2447240	depending on your current membership with Georgia Game Developers Association or if
2447240	2451520	you're a student or what have you. You can check out more info at their website. It is
2451520	2460300	siegecon.net, net, excuse me, s-i-e-g-e-c-o-n dot net. And props to Bobby was obviously
2460300	2464120	because that's about his backyard, a huge part of establishing that partnership. Props
2464120	2471000	to you, my friend, pushing our network forward. Um, one other big announcement. I got a lot
2471000	2474200	of stuff tonight for housekeeping and not just plugging the Facebook at facebook.com
2474200	2479240	slash orange launch radio or twitter at twitter.com slash o-l-r, though I just did. Last week
2479240	2483800	we had Aaron on the show or y-y-r and he was pimping his game Bungee Ferret Tossing and
2483800	2488520	you might be asking yourself, where the hell is it? Well, Aaron tweeted earlier and he
2488520	2494280	says Monday. The game will be out tomorrow so by the time most of you hear the podcast
2494280	2499400	version of this, Bungee Ferret Tossing will be out on Xbox Live Indie Games. Guys, let's
2499400	2503400	make this a success. This is o-l-r inspired. This is one of our dream games, becoming a
2503400	2508900	reality and it's one stinkin' dollar. You probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting
2508900	2514000	in your wallet already. So, go get this game on Monday. Bungee Ferret Tossing. We will
2514000	2518360	have links on the Twitters and on the Facebooks and all that good stuff as soon as the game
2518360	2525040	is out and we can link you to it. Check that out. Whoo, alright. Now I'm done with housekeeping.
2525040	2531600	Yay. We got it, right? No live next week but prerecorded. We have Siege and we have BFT
2531600	2537080	on Monday. Facebook, Twitter. Busy, busy. Back to the Wii U then, Loki? Yes. Let's talk
2537080	2542920	about some of the stuff we missed. Alright, so a few things about the Wii U. Well, there's
2542920	2549160	a lot of things about the Wii U but first off, Bayonetta. Bayonetta 2 is actually going
2549160	2555560	to be an exclusive title for the Wii U that's coming through with a partnership between
2555560	2560280	Platinum and Nintendo. So they've got that. One of the things that they're talking about
2560280	2565200	also, game pricing. Everyone was kind of wondering when the pricing was. I think I've mentioned
2565200	2570240	this in the past. It's going to be like the current gen consoles. $59.99 is going to be
2570240	2577480	the kind of going price for Wii U games which is kind of a duh. I mean, it makes sense that
2577480	2585320	it would be that price. Those pro controllers are going to be going for $49.99. Also, the
2585320	2589680	different launches. Of course, we know we're getting it over here in North America on November
2589680	2599720	18th. Europe's getting it on November 30th followed by Japan getting it on December 8th.
2599720	2604680	This is kind of interesting too. Not only does Japan get it on the 8th but they're also
2604680	2610720	getting their systems without sensor bars. They would never do that over here because
2610720	2617200	they never sold the sensor bar separately. Third party. Third party, yeah. Can you imagine
2617200	2623080	how confused people would be? Because, I don't know. That's really banking on people owning
2623080	2633680	the Wii. Yeah, it's an interesting choice. Of course, there is some other stuff. One
2633680	2642680	of the features that they were kind of pimping out was the Nintendo TV service. TVII. Gotta
2642680	2648360	stick with the whole naming scheme. Hate on it all you want. It's cute and it fits. The
2648360	2655960	name's fine. Alright, I'm just saying. It's a little interesting. It's kind of like the
2655960	2661000	same stuff that we're doing on the other consoles where they've got a bunch of different streaming
2661000	2666320	services bundled together plus also you can watch live TV because you can apparently hook
2666320	2670720	it up to, well, they haven't shown it yet because no one's allowed to take pictures
2670720	2674260	of the back panel, but the thought is that you're going to be able to hook it up to your
2674260	2684080	cable line. But it does tie in with TiVo, Netflix, and I believe Amazon streaming services.
2684080	2689160	And then of course you can also set stuff to TiVo if you have your TiVo. And apparently
2689160	2700160	they're working with all the different subscribers, Comcast, all the cable and satellite providers.
2700160	2705600	Does this mean that it has the technology where like in your house, let's say, Loki,
2705600	2708720	you want to watch American Idol because I know you're such a Nicki Minaj fan, you'll
2708720	2712720	be watching this year. You're going to watch American Idol on the big TV and then if Nellie
2712720	2716840	doesn't want to watch that, she can watch the Oprah network on the Wii U device. I don't
2716840	2720440	think it works like that. Not quite like that? I don't think it works like that. Maybe one's
2720440	2728640	got to be Netflix? Yeah, but see at this point, everything streams Netflix. True. You know,
2728640	2735160	the 3DS streams Netflix. If you're a Nintendo fan, you probably have a 3DS as well. Hell,
2735160	2741400	your Wii streams Netflix. Your phone streams Netflix. Your iPod streams Netflix. Your PC
2741400	2745760	streams Netflix. Everything fucking streams Netflix. We don't need another device. My
2745760	2755400	pants do not yet stream Netflix. You need better pants. But it's just, I mean, cool,
2755400	2759920	okay, whatever. So that's the selling point, whatever, they want to make that. Of course,
2759920	2765000	they announced also that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is going to be coming to the Wii
2765000	2772200	U as well, also 3DS. That's coming out next year, though. March 31st is a tentative day
2772200	2779640	right now. Obviously, it's a placeholder, but probably March next year. We know that
2779640	2782760	the Wii U controllers are pretty expensive because they're selling them separately in
2782760	2788360	Japan for some reason, even though there's no games that support it, but cool. If you
2788360	2798680	want to spend extra money, why not? And yeah, that's nothing about online other than there's
2798680	2803480	supposedly some sort of premium service that they're going to give you 10% back on any
2803480	2810200	downloads that you pay for. I'm really bothered by the lack of online information. You know
2810200	2814160	what else is weird? Have they shown, like, this is what the Wii U looks like when you
2814160	2818840	turn it on. This is the interface. No, they talked about it. Did they? They said it's
2818840	2824760	going to just boot right into that Nintendo, the Mii Plaza home thing or whatever the hell
2824760	2827080	they're calling it. Was that the thing with the little messages that we're showing them?
2827080	2832080	Yeah. It looks like it could be interesting. I don't know. But here's the other thing too
2832080	2837680	that's kind of bothersome is the amount of storage that's on this thing. I mean, 8 gigs
2837680	2842480	for the cheap one and 32 for the more expensive one. Well, they made the right decision though
2842480	2846160	because Reggie confirmed in an interview that you can just plug in any old drive and it
2846160	2852960	will work. I understand that, but fuck that. I get a 250 gigabyte drive or something, but
2852960	2856800	the thing is if they're going to be offering games digitally and they've already said that
2856800	2865160	these games, the disks are going to be up to 25 gigabytes, I'm going to get like a third
2865160	2869720	of a download for, you know. Well, let's be real. How many games are going to really take
2869720	2873800	up all that space? If it's like Blu-ray, then if it's a PlayStation 3 type game, a lot of
2873800	2880560	them actually will take up, you know, over 20 gigs or at least up to 20 gigs. If you
2880560	2886160	have a Wii set up to load games to a hard drive that you can plug in the Wii, which
2886160	2889800	is something we've talked about on the show before, so that you can load disks that you
2889800	2894680	own onto the Wii for quick access, whatever, you'd be surprised how small some of those
2894680	2900080	games are. Well that, but that's the Wii though. Remember the Wii is last generation graphics,
2900080	2904520	therefore it doesn't, anything is probably going to fit onto a single layer DVD. I mean
2904520	2908920	they only had a couple dual layer DVD games, whereas everything is a dual layer DVD on
2908920	2915120	the Xbox 360 and on the PlayStation 3 it's, you know, Blu-ray and obviously those are
2915120	2922840	going to be a lot bigger. I don't know. Once again, it's added expenses that, I mean, granted
2922840	2927880	the average consumer is probably not going to be downloading games, you know, other than
2927880	2935000	the WiiWare stuff or whatever, eShop crap, but they're not going to be digitally downloading
2935000	2940560	stuff. It's just, it's added expense stuff to it. Like if I'm buying this system and
2940560	2944480	I want to do the same type of things I can do on the PlayStation 3, you know, if I want
2944480	2948440	to play with my family or whatever, I've got to buy all these extra controllers because
2948440	2951760	God knows what configuration of controllers I'm going to need for whatever game I want
2951760	2955840	to play. You know, they're talking about up to five people in your household, you know,
2955840	2960100	playing a game on the Wii. Think of how exciting it will be to spend all that money to buy
2960100	2964520	those controllers. You know, whether you did it, you know, when you had the Wii or you
2964520	2969000	did it now because you don't own a Wii, so you have to spend all that money. Then on
2969000	2973520	top of that, if you want to digitally download stuff, you know, like actually first party
2973520	2978080	games or, you know, full console games, you're going to have to spend, you know, money to
2978080	2982360	buy a hard drive, which hard drives have come down in price, but still it's an added expense.
2982360	2987740	You know, you still have to do that and, I don't know, it's just, it's kind of annoying
2987740	2991960	that they have all these things that they cut out to make the console cheaper. You know,
2991960	2998200	stuff that we gave, you know, other console manufacturers crap for, you know, like cutting
2998200	3004680	out USB ports. That's another thing too. Like if I'm going to plug in like some sort of,
3004680	3009000	you know, USB drive into this thing or like a hard drive or something, how many fucking
3009000	3013960	USB ports on this thing? Like two? So what happens when, you know, say I got to play
3013960	3018240	another game that requires some other USB peripheral? Would a hub work? Like a, well,
3018240	3022160	yeah, at an expense. I got to buy a fucking hub now because they're not that, they're
3022160	3024880	not that bad. It doesn't matter though. I don't have to buy a fucking hub. If you bought
3024880	3033160	three USB devices, you can spare the money for a hub or whatever. I'm just saying, you
3033160	3037680	know, it's an extra expense that they're not talking to, you know, the consumers about
3037680	3041560	or they're not even, they don't even know what their fucking online plan is yet. Can
3041560	3046840	we, yeah, that, that concerns me too. I really, I need to hear from Nintendo that they understand
3046840	3052100	online now. Like they haven't even said, here, here is, you know, our online, here is, here's
3052100	3056540	what it looks like, you know, you know, requesting, you know, friend requests, here's this and
3056540	3061300	that. All we've seen is just, you know, hey look, you can post stupid messages on a message
3061300	3065860	port about this game. Haha, this level is hard. Whoa, smiley face. You know, I mean,
3065860	3070640	that's all it really just, just so you know, uh, Loki and the chat, the chatters are correcting
3070640	3075500	you on something, uh, starting with black Wolf and JVM on following four USB ports.
3075500	3082800	They said two in front, two in back. Well, cool. That, that should do it then. But, um,
3082800	3086760	still though, I don't want to have to buy all these extra things. Let's take a step
3086760	3089400	back for a minute. Alan, I'm going to ask your opinion on all this too, because you're
3089400	3094320	being too quiet over there. But hold on, before I get to you, uh, I want to take a step back
3094320	3097600	Bayonetta two, because obviously that was the big thing that people walked away from
3097600	3104520	this whole, uh, you know, expo going, Whoa, Bayonetta two it's real. Oh my gosh. And okay,
3104520	3109620	it's on the Wii U. All right. In my opinion, that's exactly the type of bullet Nintendo
3109620	3115220	needed in their gun, you know, pun intended. That was, but for me though, it wasn't quite
3115220	3120320	enough. I'm don't get me wrong. I'm glad Nintendo saved it from not existing at all. And I'm
3120320	3124600	glad that, you know, that that's a step in the right direction. It's just not enough
3124600	3128040	in the right direction to really convince me like, Holy shit, I need one of these day
3128040	3133820	one. I needed to see F zero, Metroid, Zelda, one of those Nintendo properties. That's not
3133820	3138280	just another Mario game in the same vein as the three that have already come out recently.
3138280	3142480	Well, here's the thing too about Bayonetta two. I mean, Bayonetta didn't sell very well.
3142480	3147120	I mean, it's a niche game. I mean, it didn't sell that great, but now you're narrowing
3147120	3151760	it down even more. All those fans, but it's fucking great. I understand it, but your devil
3151760	3155960	may cry. It's the same game and that game does well. You're looking at the same situation
3155960	3159440	with mad world. Mad world was an awesome game for the way they have, cause it's like fucking
3159440	3164400	look at, we understand adult games. We have a game that's, you know, just fucking awesome
3164400	3170880	that's on our platform and it sold like shit. So that's unfortunately a lot of the platinum
3170880	3175040	games. You know, granted, I'm sure that, you know, male horizon is probably gonna do really
3175040	3181000	well, but they haven't sold very well. Go ahead. So for the Bayonetta thing, for the
3181000	3185480	last two years I've been asking, even if it's just in Japan and we don't get it, where's
3185480	3189400	Bayonetta two? Because I mean, Japanese games, they love their sequels, right? So I'm like,
3189400	3193080	where is it? Where's Bayonetta two? What's platinum games working on? So when I finally
3193080	3200440	said Bayonetta two is real, but it's Wii U exclusive, I'm still kind of disappointed
3200440	3204240	and buttoned out about that, but I'm going to think realistically, will it be ported
3204240	3209440	to at least a 360 or PS3 within two years after the Wii U? No. No, it's not? It's published
3209440	3216120	by Nintendo. Yeah. Oh. Nintendo has it by the balls. Okay. All right. Well there's that,
3216120	3221760	but one, I guess I just won't play it then. And two, like what Bobby Blackwolf was saying,
3221760	3227080	if it means Nintendo dropping a big sack of money in platinum games laps saying give us
3227080	3231440	Bayonetta two, if that had to happen or else Bayonetta two wasn't going to happen at all,
3231440	3238360	then fine. Yes, I would rather there be a Bayonetta two. Don't swell his ego anymore.
3238360	3242440	You need to understand something about all these people going, Oh my God, Bayonetta two,
3242440	3247640	the Wii U has it all the time. Did they announce a fucking release date for it? Oh, wait, that
3247640	3251600	wasn't there? Gee, I wonder why, because maybe that platinum games right now is working on
3251600	3255120	Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. That doesn't come out until February. So that means they're
3255120	3259160	still going to be fucking working on the game till at least January. What was in that? That
3259160	3264240	trailer was literally nothing. Was it in that 50 game launch window? No, it's not a launch
3264240	3268640	title. That's probably next year sometime. You'd be lucky if it's next year holiday.
3268640	3273360	I bet you 2014 just like, Hey, Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and everyone's like,
3273360	3278520	Oh my God, Smash Brothers, I need to buy a Wii U. It's not fucking coming out for years.
3278520	3285160	It's, it's, it's a lot of the 3DS syndrome. I hate to say pilot wings resort, not the killer
3285160	3290680	game to launch your system with. They're teasing shit. That's not going to be coming out forever
3290680	3295000	because it, people are dumb enough to go, well, I'm buying the system for Bayonetta two. Cool.
3295000	3298920	You're buying that system. It's going to be fucking collecting does until the two years
3298920	3305240	from now that Bayonetta is going to be fair. Nintendo land for what it is. Uh, uh, we have
3305240	3310200	the Abu collection of mini games and so forth. It looks pretty neat. I'm kind of sold on
3310200	3315360	Nintendo land, I gotta say. Cool. I'll probably enjoy that more than I actually played. We
3315360	3319640	sports, we sports is one of those things is fun for five minutes and then you're like,
3319640	3325080	Oh, I get it. I mean, I wish they would have something that would be, you know, Oh my God,
3325080	3328840	I have to have the system for it, but they just don't. And that's, that's my thing. That's
3328840	3332520	why I'm not getting one. I'm not saying that, Oh, you're wrong for, you know, someone else
3332520	3335400	is wrong for getting it because they have something that they're like, Oh my God, I
3335400	3339880	want to play that. You know, Oh God, I got to play Mario Brothers in HD. Peekman has
3339880	3344640	a cult following. That's not my game that I ever really got into, but I could understand
3344640	3348040	where somebody is like, fuck yeah, Pikmin. I got to get this. But that's the thing is
3348040	3353440	they're trying to grab all these niche areas. Like, okay, Pikmin has a following of like,
3353440	3357880	maybe there's a, they have a fucking Mario game coming out on it. Loki. That's your non
3357880	3363120	niche game. Mario that's been out. It looks very similar to the Mario that just came out
3363120	3371360	a second ago. Those games sell like crazy. It's going to be a success. It could be Mario's
3371360	3376800	douche factory and people will eat that shit up. Okay. I, it doesn't matter. It's just,
3376800	3383120	I'm sure it's going to be a fun game, but the thing is for me, it's not that like, wow,
3383120	3391960	it's not that it's, it's the same experience I can get right now, you know, on a 3DS or
3391960	3396440	on a Wii or something like that. That's, that's my problem. You know, and the gimmicky thing
3396440	3400960	of, Hey, look, I can use this tablet and I can tap the screen and it makes platforms.
3400960	3405920	Fuck. You could probably do that if you made some sort of connectivity between the DS version
3405920	3411200	and the Wii version. You could do the same shit with your stylus on the touch screen,
3411200	3414760	but no, we're just not going to do that. Alan, you never got to finish your thought
3414760	3420840	because Loki, you know, got on his tangent, but yeah, so I'd rather there be a bed Bayonetta
3420840	3427160	to that. I'll never play the no Bayonetta to at all. And when Bobby was reading those
3427160	3432080	tweets about this is the worst thing since the mass effect three ending, I was like,
3432080	3437840	Oh Jesus Christ, go pee your bed. What really? That's, this is the thing that people are
3437840	3443120	talking about, but yeah, whatever. But I really have no fucks to give for the Wii U. I don't
3443120	3447400	care. I'm the Wii, the Wii, we don't play it here. It's the one system that I don't
3447400	3452220	bought that I didn't have my own copy of when I moved in with you. So I played Wii Fit for
3452220	3457200	like a week. Once in a while I get into Wii mode. You have to admit, yeah. Once you're
3457200	3460840	gonna pick up, you're gonna pick up Wii Fit U because Wii Fit U's got the crappy pedometer
3460840	3466960	with your little Miya on it. Oh my God. And guess what? If someone's watching TV, you
3466960	3475640	can look like a goddamn fool staring into a little tablet and exercising. I, well, okay.
3475640	3481280	Let's Alan, let's say you had the, have had the money. Money's not a concern and so forth.
3481280	3487480	You still would not buy a Wii U on this principle of there's not really something you want to
3487480	3491640	play on it right now. Right? Correct. And I also, I agree with what Loki was saying
3491640	3498360	that 20, 25 second Bayonetta 2 reveal trailer is literally nothing. So like there's, they
3498360	3502200	have not probably even started to work on this game even a little tiny bit yet. Let's
3502200	3506440	be fair. It's two years off. Just, if you're interested in Wii and you haven't pre-ordered
3506440	3510040	it yet, you're probably not going to fucking get it at launch anyways. Just chill the fuck
3510040	3515760	out. Let the whole like, you know, oh my God, I'm a crack addict. I need my Nintendo crack,
3515760	3520360	you know, right now. Just let that like kind of calm down, get out of your system and just
3520360	3524640	give it like a year and then you know, a Zelda game will be fucking coming out. The system
3524640	3527560	will probably drop in price and there'll be stuff that you'll actually want to play. I
3527560	3531440	think the 3DS is going to be an awesome system that is going to have dozens of must have
3531440	3535300	games for it in another two years. The Vita is going to be an awesome system with dozens
3535300	3539440	of must have games for it in another two years. So Wii U is probably going to be the same
3539440	3544960	way. Uh, GameGuru brings this comment to chat that has the facts I was looking for and arguing
3544960	3550680	with Loki earlier. Thank you GameGuru. New Super Mario Brothers U sold 25, I think he
3550680	3556180	meant to say New Super Mario Brothers. New Super Mario Brothers sold 25 million copies.
3556180	3562200	It's the biggest title Nintendo could bring out for Wii U. 25 million copies as a franchise
3562200	3568480	or as a title because I don't think that's as a title. And it was a packing game. Semantics.
3568480	3573400	It doesn't matter. It's a huge game. The point still stands. It's the biggest title Nintendo
3573400	3579240	could bring out for Wii U. Or they could have made a new Mario game. You know, why settle
3579240	3583080	for just the same franchise that you know, you've already been pimping them for a while.
3583080	3586100	Yeah, those numbers look nice if you're talking franchise because you've only, how many New
3586100	3590120	Super Mario Brothers games have you released? Yeah, that's what I thought. I can't wait
3590120	3595480	to buy Legend of Zelda. The new one? No, all of them. Again and again. All right, look,
3595480	3599040	but now let's go back to the real world for a minute here, Alan, because you know, you're
3599040	3602880	not living by yourself anymore. You're in a committed relationship with an individual
3602880	3607640	who tends to be a bit of a consumer whore. Yes. So there probably will be a Wii U in
3607640	3614160	the house within the next year. Yes. How does that make you feel? I don't care about the
3614160	3620280	Wii U. You won't even touch it? You won't look at it? Well, it's hooked up. I'll play
3620280	3627600	it, but I mean... Well, it's there. I'll have my hour where I go, oh, okay, use the controller
3627600	3635760	and all right, then boom, never again. All right, fair enough. Technus in chat wondering,
3635760	3641360	so I wonder what will come out first, Bayonetta 2 or the Wonderful 101? Live.vognetwork.com.
3641360	3644720	Clearly the Wonderful 101, right? Yeah, Wonderful 101 because that's the launch window title
3644720	3652760	and Bayonetta is not even fucking being worked on yet. You know what, though? Again, I will
3652760	3657320	say props to Nintendo for the Bayonetta 2 thing. Now give me like three more of those
3657320	3662840	on that level and we're sitting really, really, really good. Platinum tends to release about
3662840	3668440	one game a year, I think. They don't have to be Platinum Games. I'm talking about other
3668440	3674960	exclusive things would be great. No, I'm talking about Platinum Games as the company being
3674960	3680260	released, you know, one title they work on about once a year, I think, because they did,
3680260	3686080	I think Platinum Games did, what was it, Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns in the US here,
3686080	3691200	you know, that's not out yet. Then, of course, they've got, you know, next year, Metal Gear
3691200	3696040	Rising Revengeance, so probably 2014. All right, let's move on with some more Nintendo
3696040	3700200	news. This is a story on the Nintendo Network. We've kind of touched on this, so I'll make
3700200	3704240	this quick. If you shell out the money for the higher end Wii U, you're going to get
3704240	3708680	not just some more gigabytes, you will get access to Nintendo Network Premium. Nintendo
3708680	3713600	Network is the online service. It's going to be free, but apparently Nintendo said at
3713600	3717320	one point, well, maybe it won't always be free, we just don't know yet. There's a lot
3717320	3721120	we're still figuring out. We haven't figured out the whole Network thing. So it looks like
3721120	3728000	what we have now is Nintendo Network Premium, and people were going so like Xbox Gold, PlayStation
3728000	3733520	Plus, what the hell. Nintendo Network Premium right now looks to be nothing more than rewards.
3733520	3738800	If you are one of these premium users, you get a game, you get 10% of the purchase in
3738800	3743920	points that you can exchange for a redemption code to trade in for other games or DLC. This
3743920	3749800	sounds a lot like that coins thing they already have in a way, except this is more encouraging
3749800	3754680	people to do stuff online, I guess, although they did that with the new Super Mario Brothers
3754680	3759000	2 Gold Mania or whatever the hell that's called on the 3DS. They were offering double coins
3759000	3763240	if you download it digitally. So is this like a yearly subscription thing or is this just
3763240	3767320	I buy the fancy system? You buy the fancy system and you get it. Now the other thing
3767320	3774760	from the Japanese conference only offered till December 2014. Okay. Oh my god, will
3774760	3780280	I be able to get it in this like two year window? Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot
3780280	3785120	of question mark here that I'm not, you know, and that's the problem is that after that
3785120	3789200	press conference, there should not have been this many question marks. That's a two year
3789200	3795220	console cycle. Stop. And they'll have the Wii UU. Well I get if it's only free until
3795220	3800080	December 2014. But then what? What do the non deluxe people get? Is that all it is as
3800080	3804640	a discount program? How do I, are we still on friend codes? Do we have Nintendo gamer
3804640	3811920	tags now? What's going on? Hello? I guess I'm not supposed to ask those questions. I'm
3811920	3820640	supposed to say, ooh Bayonetta, pretty. Moving on. Let's do more Nintendo news. Yes. So websites
3820640	3829520	that are offering preorders for the Wii U system, either of the bundles, are marking
3829520	3835020	themselves as being sold out. So the assumption that could be made is that this thing is selling
3835020	3842600	like crazy, at least in the preorder cycle. It looks like Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Target
3842600	3848720	are sold out online of both versions. Sears and Kmart are only listing the deluxe as
3848720	3855600	sold out with the cheaper SKU not there at all. Again, GameStop online can't preorder
3855600	3859180	it. Doesn't really mention Amazon in this article that I'm referencing. Well there's
3859180	3863120	another issue going on there, but I'll come back to that. So we already kind of talked
3863120	3867380	about this a little bit where, you know, Matt was saying, well, we don't know how much,
3867380	3870720	like Nintendo dictates to them what numbers there are before they have to consider themselves
3870720	3876960	sold out. But it looks like Walmart grown, who's also making things more difficult because
3876960	3883620	Walmart does their own bundle within the bundle. Walmart online is offering their Walmart solution
3883620	3887800	bundle which are even more expensive. The basic one with the shit that they are bundling
3887800	3893960	in is $400 and then $450 for the deluxe Wii U SKU plus whatever bullshit they're in. So
3893960	3899560	if you want to get in on the Wii U preorder, Walmart I guess is a good place to start.
3899560	3903180	So I guess Nintendo's not looking to have these long lines and stuff this time because
3903180	3907200	if Target and Walmart both did preorders and, you know, that's where all the lines were
3907200	3913780	showing up before. I'm telling you, if they sold out in one day, there's no way. There's
3913780	3917680	no stories about people lining up at the fucking store to make preorders. There's no way that
3917680	3922400	there's a large amount of systems being preordered. Even if everybody fucking rushed down and
3922400	3927440	bum rushed, you know, GameStop, there's no way that they have a lot. But they're doing
3927440	3931800	it though so that it makes a good headline. You know, the system's selling out, look how
3931800	3937240	fast it's sold out. Yeah, if I offered one for sale and, you know, it would sell out
3937240	3941280	instantly. I mean, so on a website where you can't see how many they have. I mean, fuck,
3941280	3946560	look at the iPhone 5. Is that shit selling out? And I'm sure they're going to sell millions
3946560	3952040	of those. So I mean, I just have a hard time believing that there's going to be a lot being
3952040	3956440	sold. Um, it seems like all hope is not lost though. There are some stores that just aren't
3956440	3960680	going to do preorders. Like Fry's is one that I can think of. They don't ever do preorders.
3960680	3964720	So if I really want to get a Wii U launch day, I'll just go there early, I guess. Um,
3964720	3968360	but I was surprised at the lack of Amazon, but apparently there's something deeper going
3968360	3973920	on here. And that's the whole fact that Amazon hasn't carried the 3DS or the 3DS XL and they
3973920	3980520	haven't said anything about the Wii U. They used to carry the 3DS. Exactly. I bought a
3980520	3985140	3DS game from them. They used to carry the 3DS. The 3DS, they had a problem with people
3985140	3990080	reporting broken hinges and so they got returned to them. And the thought is that they tried
3990080	3994120	returning those to Nintendo. Nintendo said, fuck you, you're stuck with them. And so they're
3994120	3998720	like, fuck you, we're not carrying your hardware. Which is fine. You know, to be honest, they
3998720	4002800	don't need that shit because you know why? The hardware, there is no markup on the hardware.
4002800	4008080	They're making nothing off that. So there's no reason for them to carry it. But Amazon,
4008080	4012200	that's not the type of company Amazon is. Amazon will slit throats to get you to go
4012200	4015920	to their site and buy this shit on their site. I understand that, but if, if it's come down
4015920	4021760	to where, you know, hey, we're losing hundreds of dollars on this thing. Amazon lost their
4021760	4029320	biggest competitive advantage yesterday. Amazon is now in a whole new world as of yesterday.
4029320	4033680	Guess what changed at Amazon.com yesterday? Started charging tax. That's right. Sales
4033680	4038280	tax. Sales tax in the state of California. And I think a few others too. I don't think
4038280	4043180	it's just California. Cause when you file for your state taxes every April in California,
4043180	4046560	it says, did you order something online from out of state? Because please enter the amount
4046560	4051440	here so that we can factor in sales tax. Everyone goes next. Fuck no. I'm sure everybody has
4051440	4056800	always been a hundred percent honest. They've got a shoe box of receipts and Amazon invoices.
4056800	4060360	Yeah. But now it doesn't matter if you're in California. You tell me if I've ordered
4060360	4065920	something. Oh, you don't know. Well then I didn't. Yeah. I love that system. We're going
4065920	4070160	to plead the honor system, right? You're like, you're going to be honest with me if you're
4070160	4076880	charging me too many taxes. No, you're not. Okay. So what's this that Bobby's linking
4076880	4083240	me to? He's linking to an actual, it looks like a 3ds Cosmo black. Ah, here's the trick
4083240	4088800	though. It says 17 left in stock sold by Emacs and fulfilled by Amazon. So technically that's
4088800	4094360	not Amazon. That's one of their little mini sub stores that's doing it. So yes, they have,
4094360	4099700	you can get, okay, if you want to get me on a technicality, you can get the 3ds on Amazon,
4099700	4105520	but it's not going to come from Amazon. No, it's going to come from a third party. Yeah.
4105520	4111520	So very interesting. Uh, I'm, I, I still am surprised that Amazon, you know, despite all
4111520	4115160	that madness would, you know, it's nothing that the other companies aren't having to
4115160	4119320	put up with. Don't take the returns then. Well, I think it became a problem where, you
4119320	4124040	know, customers were complaining that, you know, it's a defective system and they were
4124040	4128680	just returning them in mass or something. I don't know, but I, I would assume that'd
4128680	4134360	be the only reason why they wouldn't carry it. Hmm. Um, so let's talk a little bit, something,
4134360	4138120	something different than Nintendo for a while. Yes, please. Believe it or not, there was
4138120	4142020	other news this week besides Nintendo. Can I just take a minute real quick? It's nowhere
4142020	4146000	else on our show roll tonight. I can't believe it got left off. I just need to tip the hat.
4146000	4152260	You mentioned it. iPhone five is huge gaming news. Like it or not, they come out and say,
4152260	4156920	it's a huge gaming handheld. I think even more so than the iPhone five, I think we all
4156920	4161120	need to not forget there if, cause if you don't even want it for the phone or whatever,
4161120	4165480	there is still the iPod touch. Is that what they call the ones that are the phones without
4165480	4170400	the phone? They announced that too. That is basically an iPhone five and all those games
4170400	4176240	and all that stuff. So despite however you feel about Apple, that is a huge, you know,
4176240	4180060	the angry birds of the world is all going to be over there and stuff. So that's a pretty
4180060	4184440	big gaming news. I just wanted to get that out there cause those were two big, big, big
4184440	4190720	gaming stories this week. Cool. Real racing's on it. Fantastic. The fact that it's a new
4190720	4197240	resolution is a little bit strange too. And I, I, I still, why are they still talking
4197240	4204120	iPad mini? There is no reason for an iPad mini. An iPad mini is an iPod touch. Why do
4204120	4208880	we still have all these crazy rumors about the iPad mini? I don't get it because seven
4208880	4216920	inch tablets are popular. Just get the iPad. You won't be disappointed. It's pretty. And,
4216920	4228440	and as Netflix, everything fucking has Netflix. Okay. Everything seriously to register participation
4228440	4235120	for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase guitar.
4235120	4243000	So Zynga has filed a counter suit or filed, I guess, a counterclaim against EA. And of
4243000	4246600	course, you know, they're saying, you know, today we respond to EA's claims, which we
4246600	4253080	believe have no merit. We also filed a counterclaim, which addresses actions by EA. We'd be believed
4253080	4258080	to be anti-competitive and unlawful business practices, including legal threats, demands
4258080	4263200	for no higher agreements. We look forward to getting back to focusing all our efforts
4263200	4269520	on delighting our players. And then to which I add with our clone games. Um, but seriously,
4269520	4273880	that's the whole thing. There's like basically saying, Oh yeah, no, we're not copying the
4273880	4281640	Sims social. No, I'm sorry. They are. That's I mean, come on. Anybody that probably listens
4281640	4287040	to the show, that's seen the evidence of them copying many other games. We know better.
4287040	4291100	I mean, who are they trying to fool? Obviously the court, but well, they, I mean, this is
4291100	4294080	also one of those things though. It's like a does zinc is not going to take this long.
4294080	4298200	Well, you caught us there. Yeah, we did. You're IDA. Yeah. We were, we were ripping off all
4298200	4303000	your games. Here you go. Here's the billion dollars you were asking for. So this is not
4303000	4310600	a surprise, right? Yeah. Not at all. Come on. And so, um, I don't know. I mean, of course,
4310600	4317040	you know, they're break man and chat at live.vognetwork.com says Zinga considers copying other people's
4317040	4321120	games to be a completely legal process. I didn't mean to cut you off. You sound like
4321120	4324600	you were trailing off with that thought there. No, no, no. They're, they're basically saying
4324600	4329880	here's their whole reason there. It's, it's, it's okay to do what we're doing. Basically.
4329880	4335000	Um, you know, the, the alleged certain modes of expression are customary and necessary
4335000	4340000	to express the genres such as seeing on a couch, watching TV, taking a shower and going
4340000	4347160	to sleep in a bed. Such modes of expression are known as, uh, scenes affair, uh, are not
4347160	4353440	protectable. Uh, one company, uh, allowing one company to own them with work, competition,
4353440	4359360	innovation and creativity. Employing the scenes affair, um, common functions or functional
4359360	4364980	elements is not a copyright infringement. It is how a genre is expressed. So what they're
4364980	4369920	saying is our game looks slightly different, but just because, you know, Sims, I'm sorry,
4369920	4374040	him or Ville person, whoever, what the hell they're calling it, sits down to take a crap
4374040	4380880	doesn't mean that, you know, it's the same thing. Except once again, it's, they're not
4380880	4385100	just copying the fact that, you know, this person takes, you know, can take a nap or
4385100	4389840	this person, you know, cooks on a stove or something like that. They're copying the character
4389840	4398360	editor or the art style or, you know, the menus or the, you know, palette for your skin
4398360	4402280	tones, you know, that kind of stuff.
4402280	4407520	All right, let's move on to other legal news. This one's, this one's a tricky issue. Oh
4407520	4416720	boy, this is, um, wow. Okay. So who owns the word gamer? G A Y M E R a word that describes
4416720	4422040	a gay gamer. It's kind of a name that the community's taken up a little bit here. Uh,
4422040	4425760	you've might've heard of gamer con was a big thing that we were talking about, uh, before
4425760	4429880	on the show. Cause I talked about that. That's the only Kickstarter I've ever backed. Well,
4429880	4436400	um, you may or may not have heard of a site gamer.org G A Y M E R.org. And back in 2007,
4436400	4441100	the owner, Chris Vizzini, I hope I'm saying that right. Um, announced that he was going
4441100	4447360	to trademark the term gamer. I seem to remember reporting on this back then because the show's
4447360	4451320	been around a while and I seem to remember reporting on this back then saying, I'm not
4451320	4454860	a big fan of this. You know, the fact that he's trying to trademark this word and I don't
4454860	4460740	think anybody did. Well, I think the part we missed, he got the trademark. The United
4460740	4468100	States gave him the trademark on the word gamer for his website, gamer.org. So the trademark
4468100	4472800	applies to online communities, hosting and maintaining an online website for others to
4472800	4478600	discuss receive and disseminate information concerning video games. So he owns the trademark
4478600	4484320	on that when it comes to online communities. Well, this past week, a cease and desist letter
4484320	4492040	from Chris Vizzini was sent to Reddit. Talk about a David versus Goliath scenario. The
4492040	4499600	gamers community on Reddit is something like 17,000 some odd people. Gamer.org, not really
4499600	4504400	a big website. It was a good concept, but gaygamer.net kind of came around and did it
4504400	4510640	better. I don't mean any disrespect to gamer.org because, you know, look at Orange Lounge Radio.
4510640	4514960	Shit, we've been around 10 years and we still haven't made it big, quote unquote. So, you
4514960	4519320	know, I can kind of sympathize in that sort of regard, but I'm not so sure I would have
4519320	4527880	picked my battle with Reddit either. You know, like, Redditers are crazy. We mean that in
4527880	4536120	the nicest possible way. But like, to quote a famous gif of Whoopi Goldberg, you in danger
4536120	4548160	girl. So, and gamer.org ended up being shut down just like not even a day later with after
4548160	4554080	this whole stuff. So here's, here's the situation. He responded and so forth. Here's his response.
4554080	4559400	I informed the mod team of our gamers that we'd received a cease and desist for the infringement
4559400	4564400	of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed, I'm sorry, is this,
4564400	4568560	I'm sorry, I am reading, scratch that, my bad, I am reading what the admin on Reddit
4568560	4573640	said. Like, as I'm reading it here, it doesn't make sense. Okay, sorry. How embarrassing.
4573640	4576920	I informed the mod team of our gamers that we received a cease and desist letter for
4576920	4581920	infringement of the gamer trademark and that our legal counsel had informed us that the
4581920	4586980	letter presents a real threat that they would sue Reddit. I let them know so that they could
4586980	4591080	start planning how to respond, including seeing if there's any way for them to work things
4591080	4598600	out with the owner of the trademark. Now the response from gamer.org. He sent the cease
4598600	4603800	and desist because as a trademark holder, you have to defend your trademark or you will
4603800	4612000	risk losing it. He's emailed Reddit twice before and no response. He says, I started
4612000	4618900	gamer.org in 2003 and began to build gamer as a brand. That's why I trademarked and word
4618900	4623800	marked the name. At that time, there was only one other site around dedicated to gay gamers.
4623800	4628480	I have spent countless hours and thousands of dollars on gamer.org. I have done so gladly
4628480	4634960	as it's brought happiness to many people. He is not pursuing gamer con because his trademark
4634960	4640760	is only about online communities. I would think though, gamer con, if they're going
4640760	4646220	to be as big as Fanime or PAX or any other big convention, will probably have an online
4646220	4651800	forum at some point. So I would still be a little worried if I was on the planning board
4651800	4658680	at gamer con about the impact this could have. Now, you might be curious about my thoughts
4658680	4666400	as a gay gamer. And my thoughts is I don't necessarily fault Chris in this circumstance
4666400	4673440	because he does have to defend his trademark. He should have never been given that trademark
4673440	4679280	in the first place. That's the problem. Why did they give him that? He should have every
4679280	4686940	right to gamer.org. But the word gamer, that's a really broad thing to have. And especially
4686940	4693800	this far, I mean, there was a dude on the tester whose name was gamer, his little online
4693800	4699160	thing. That didn't ruffle any feathers, I guess, because again, gamer doesn't have his
4699160	4704200	own online community. But as many of the folks on Reddit and all around the internet were
4704200	4709160	quick to point out, that word gamer has existed dating back to Yahoo! groups and all this
4709160	4714400	stuff before that. I mean, it's just kind of a little play on word that makes a lot
4714400	4718800	of sense. Why was he given the trademark in the first place?
4718800	4722800	Because the patent offices don't know better. Because he filed first. Probably no one thought
4722800	4729680	about trademarking it, so he did. What he could have done if he's just defending it
4729680	4735160	because, oh, I need to and otherwise I will lose my trademark, whatever. He could license
4735160	4742800	it to him for free. Okay, yes, you may use this as your forum thing or whatever, but
4742800	4750600	I have the rights to. It is a trademark of blah, blah, blah. That'd be the nice thing
4750600	4751600	to do, I guess.
4751600	4756280	Rama in chat says, Sky, a treaty alliance between both organizations. I wish. That would
4756280	4762080	be the nice thing to see here. In a minority of a minority community, is this what we really
4762080	4766800	need to have happening right now? This sucks. Especially when things are kind of gaining
4766800	4770200	steam with the convention and all this right now, this is a real shot in the foot. This
4770200	4773880	is a terrible time for something like this to happen.
4773880	4780960	I get that gamer.org feels the need to defend their trademark and the thousands of dollars
4780960	4785840	they've invested. Shit, we've invested thousands of dollars in this program and the community
4785840	4790600	we've built and all that stuff, but I just kind of think at a certain point you have
4790600	4797160	to let it go. And you kind of have to just admit the term gamer has become something
4797160	4803200	much larger than gamer.org. I forgot there was a gamer.org until I saw this site earlier
4803200	4809600	this week. No offense, the site hasn't been able to keep itself in the public eye the
4809600	4817760	way gaygamer.net has. Or the Reddit. He looks like he was updating it back in August and
4817760	4823680	July and then kind of took off. Because he had to get his site back, he had to do a rollback
4823680	4827260	of a month. So a lot of the stuff that was up there disappeared. Because there was something
4827260	4831040	up there on the OUYA. I managed to see it before it went down and there was something
4831040	4835820	on there about the OUYA and some of the other stuff. But there's the forums. Again, I mean
4835820	4841200	no disrespect to that community because we have a small community. Shit, Loki named the
4841200	4849120	Wii U release date in July and I bet you nobody knows that. But I don't know. But then of
4849120	4854680	course you come around and say, well if somebody tried to start a community called Orange Lounge
4854680	4857980	Video, would you have a problem with that? And there's a part of me that's kind of like
4857980	4862540	yes and no. If you're just trying to piggyback on our success, yes I'd have a problem with
4862540	4867640	that. But at the same time, Orange Lounge Radio wasn't exactly our name 100% either.
4867640	4873160	And we've always admitted that. We were inspired to name ourselves after something we were
4873160	4878260	all fans of, the way a Beatles tribute band might call them Yellow Submarine or something
4878260	4885040	like that. It's very kind of akin to that. But if Orange Lounge had this common meaning,
4885040	4889640	if Orange Lounge was suddenly the term that everybody called their video game room or
4889640	4895000	something, I think there'd have to be a point where you just kind of let it go. I don't
4895000	4901440	know. Loki, you're on the outside looking in. You probably have no reason to go to a
4901440	4907960	gamer reddit or gamer.org. What do you think of all this kind of back and forth debacle?
4907960	4915080	That's typical, typical trademark copyright garbage. You know, someone trademark something.
4915080	4921360	Like if we're going to totally make it non-sexually oriented at all. I mean look at the guy that
4921360	4927200	tried to trademark Mame a while back. A great comment from Dungeon Buster in the chatroom
4927200	4934400	about this is the USPTO, the same place that gave Langdell his trademark over Edge. Remember
4934400	4940320	that? And then there's not just Edge, but then there is the, what is the other one?
4940320	4945640	The one that hit against Elder Scrolls. Was it Scrolls? Yeah, it's the Mojang game. It's
4945640	4951880	called Scrolls, right? So there's that whole debacle too. Like holy hell do we need this
4951880	4958360	stuff reexamined. I mean we're in this technological age where the laws from the 17 and 1800s don't
4958360	4965000	work anymore. Again, I really feel like he should have never been given the trademark
4965000	4970200	in the first place. Stop, I mean I can feel for the guy because it's like, oh you were
4970200	4975040	given this great thing and now the internet's trying to take it away. But it's like, you
4975040	4978960	shouldn't have had that. You should have gotten gamer.org. That's all yours buddy. You get
4978960	4982800	that. Let me put it this way. Gamer probably too, like someone that's not familiar with
4982800	4988480	anything on the internet. You know, people that work at the patent office. Probably,
4988480	4992840	you know, hey that's a unique thing. You know, we'll go ahead and give it to that guy. I
4992840	4997760	mean they don't do any research, but that's the problem though is they'll just give it
4997760	5002640	to whomever. And you know, yeah it kind of sucks for everybody else, but I don't really
5002640	5008380	know where, you know, something becomes so commonly used that they can't trademark it
5008380	5013280	anymore or something. I don't know. I don't really know how that works. Well as somebody
5013280	5017840	who's supporting GamerCon and would think that logically that's going to have a community
5017840	5024320	at some point, and just like a gamer myself, I kind of think this guy needs to let it go.
5024320	5031760	I understand he wants to defend what he's invested his hard earned money in, but there's
5031760	5037260	a way for everybody to win in this scenario. If he wanted more visibility for his site,
5037260	5043080	why not work with Reddit? It's a pretty powerful, if you want to get yourself promoted, you
5043080	5047040	want to get the word around the internet, Reddit's a pretty fucking great place to go
5047040	5052720	for that type of stuff. You know, it seems like they could have, he could have got more
5052720	5057880	for his site working with Reddit than he's getting working against them. And that goes
5057880	5065660	for any large, large, large online community. And I hate seeing these, these factions fight.
5065660	5070880	It sucks. Alright, moving on. I need some happier news or something. Can you deliver,
5070880	5076200	Alan? Not really happy news, but some sassy news. Okay, I'll take sassy. So this is probably
5076200	5080320	one of the most ludicrous stories that I've reported on whenever I've guest hosted on
5080320	5087640	this show. Electronic Arts usually, they've, I don't want to say butted heads, but they've
5087640	5093400	had snippy things to say about Valve and Steam in the past, where I guess that one EA guy,
5093400	5100160	excuse me, was saying that when Steam discounts games as much as it does and has those crazy
5100160	5106040	99 cent sales and stuff, that it sort of devalues PC games and this, that, and the other, even
5106040	5109580	though indie developers have come out and said that putting their game on Steam versus
5109580	5114840	Xbox Live was one of the best things they ever did, blah, blah, blah. The Origin client,
5114840	5120440	which became a mandatory thing for Mass Effect 3, is fucking terrible. And EA and Origin
5120440	5124600	doesn't have the sales that Steam does and blah, blah, blah. So EA is always trying to
5124600	5130560	be up Valve's ass. I guess EA on two different occasions have tried to enter talks with Valve
5130560	5136480	to purchase the company. Going upwards of some of the preliminary talks they did offered
5136480	5140400	up to a billion dollars if Valve was going to take the offer seriously. That's how much
5140400	5149760	they were willing to front to start the conversation. And Gabe Newell is like, no, that's not going
5149760	5157160	to happen. Quote, co-owner and company founder Gabe Newell, however, said that the likelihood
5157160	5162640	of his fiercely independent company selling to an Electronic Arts or one of the other
5162640	5167200	major multinational publishers like Activision or Ubisoft is about as likely as Nintendo
5167200	5172160	selling off the Mario brand. Newell said that Valve would sooner disintegrate than sell
5172160	5180160	out to a major publisher. It's way more likely we would head in that direction than say,
5180160	5182960	let's find some giant company that wants to cash us out and wait two or three years to
5182960	5189480	have our employment agreements terminate. So, yeah, EA I guess has tried to buy Valve
5189480	5193160	and it sounds ridiculous. One of the dumbest things I've ever heard. And we don't even
5193160	5198160	know what Valve is doing with the fact that the story that we covered last week where
5198160	5203880	Valve's looking for industrial engineers for this maybe PC box that's going to run Steam
5203880	5208760	maybe on television sets. That's what people are speculating on. So we don't know what
5208760	5214120	Valve is up to, but obviously they're not in a position to be bought by anyone and they
5214120	5222760	have more money than God because Steam already commands a membership of 54 billion active
5222760	5229040	users and growing. So they're not in want for money for EA to buy them.
5229040	5236560	I would say it's surprising that EA's tried to buy Valve. I don't think that's surprising.
5236560	5241500	It gives me warm fuzzies to know that Gabe Newell basically laughed in their face. That
5241500	5246240	gives me warm fuzzies. Especially after that PopCap story from last week.
5246240	5250120	From a business standpoint, if you're a company as big as EA, hey, they make good shit. Let's
5250120	5255920	say, hey, hey, you guys for sale? That's legit. EA's can ask that if whoever they want. Gabe
5255920	5261160	Newell is like, no. I love this. That's what's funny. I love this comment from mm2k in our
5261160	5266680	chat room. Thank God the people at Valve own Valve. EA buying it would be the coming of
5266680	5274120	Satan. Well, that's not a dramatic statement. Would EA bring Half-Life 3 out faster? Cause
5274120	5280080	I don't know. Oh no you didn't. Oh no you didn't. And Zynga buying it would be ultra
5280080	5292280	Satan. I want somebody to buy Valve and legitimize them. Is that possible? EA should buy Zynga.
5292280	5300440	What better way to settle this whole thing? That would be funny. It would be hilarious.
5300440	5305960	Activision buys Zynga and then rolls it in with Blizzard and the sky turns black. Oh,
5305960	5313200	can you imagine how terrible World of Warcraft would be? Possibly. It already got worse when
5313200	5317800	Activision bought them. But anyway, BlackWolf in our chat room says, VoG, however, would
5317800	5323840	not say F you to EA. EA bring your money trucks to my house, please. Wait a minute, Bobby.
5323840	5331200	It's not a gaming station. EA doesn't have interest in that gaming is one part of nerdom.
5331200	5335040	That's fine. They can roll those money trucks up. I'll be able to sell my gaming part of
5335040	5341440	it. That's true. I think all of us are sitting here going, yeah, we'd sell out. Money? Sure.
5341440	5346280	All right, let's move on. Travel around the world and check out some release dates and
5346280	5352400	what is coming out near you in a country near you. Loki, start us off. There's some decent
5352400	5356280	stuff coming out this week. Of course, we've got Borderlands 2 coming out on PlayStation
5356280	5366720	3 and Xbox 360 and PC. The Kirby's Dream collector's special edition. That's way too many adjectives
5366720	5374080	for that. That's coming out on the Wii this week. NCIS 3D on the 3DS. Hotel Transylvania
5374080	5380720	on the DS and 3DS. Collector's Edition for Borderlands 2. Deluxe Vault Hunter Collector's
5380720	5386640	Edition and the Ultimate Loot Chest Edition. That's coming out as well. F Ultimate Loot
5386640	5393640	Chest Edition. I almost got that. The chest on that thing is huge. Although the collector's
5393640	5400320	edition for Black Ops 2 looks pretty sweet. And it has a bigger chest. It's all about
5400320	5407920	the bigger chest. Formula 1 2012 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The Street Fighter 25th Anniversary
5407920	5418760	Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3. And Connect Sports Ultimate Collection. It's a re-release
5418760	5426000	of Connect Sports 1 and 2 on one disc. It's coming out on 360. Harley Pasternak's Hollywood
5426000	5434160	Workout on Xbox 360 and the Wii. And this week we get our Connect TV games. Connect
5434160	5442240	Sesame Street TV and Connect National Geo. Or Net Geo TV on 360 as well. When's Surface
5442240	5447240	coming? Do we know? I'm sorry. What the hell was that thing called they showed at E3? The
5447240	5453880	Surface? No, the name of the... Is it called Surface? The thing that will let my iPad be
5453880	5458680	a touch controller. Oh, Smart Glass. Thank you, Smart Glass. That's in the fall update
5458680	5462600	I think. Surface is the Microsoft touch. We still don't know when that's coming either.
5462600	5466840	Surface is the tablet. I thought it's in Vegas for slot machines or in Digital Blackjack
5466840	5471780	and that's it. We had a great, I will say, when we went to PAX08 or whatever, we had
5471780	5476000	a great bonding time with Bobby sitting around one of those... Was somebody else with us
5476000	5481840	too? Maybe for a little bit. I want to say one of the gals from the Bay Area that's also
5481840	5485720	podcasting was there with us. But we were having some bonding time around Microsoft
5485720	5491720	Surface. It was good times. Good times. All right, let's move on. Let's take a look at
5491720	5498160	release dates in Japan, starting with the Xbox 360. Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning. Hey.
5498160	5502760	It's new for Japan coming out of there. I'm assuming this is some type of localized version.
5502760	5510600	There's also Majiten, Majidetenshe Suksemita in limited and regular edition is coming out
5510600	5515840	this week. I'm not sure exactly what this is, but based on some of the screenshots...
5515840	5522840	Yeah. It's naked anime chicks. Look at that booby. Or excuse me, not booby. Look at that
5522840	5528280	booty. Yeah, naked anime girls, but their faces look like they're 12. That is how the
5528280	5535400	Xbox 360 is going to sell in Japan. That's how you sell a Wii U. That's how you sell
5535400	5540840	a Wii U right there. Yeah, the little LCD controller is x-ray, so the TV, she's got
5540840	5544520	her top on, but then you have the controller and it's... That's how you do it. Nelly's
5544520	5549760	watching American Idol on the TV. You're watching porn on the Wii U. They had, and I don't remember
5549760	5553280	what the hell the game was called, they had a game that came out in the UK. It was on
5553280	5558800	the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. And it was like one of those, not like a Leisure Sue Larry
5558800	5562760	or like a Playboy the Mansion game, but there was something like that where you're picking
5562760	5567320	up women and you have to do weird things, you know, to get in their favor. But one of
5567320	5572120	the mini games had to do with manipulating their nipples. And what were the nipples?
5572120	5579940	But the two analog sticks. Wow. That was great. Awesome. Alright, PlayStation 3, big releases
5579940	5586520	this week. We have Daikokai Jidai Online Second Age. I don't know what game this translates
5586520	5590760	to, but there's a regular and limited edition. It looks like some type of online game. I'm
5590760	5595760	getting a vibe similar to like a Final Fantasy XI is, or a White Knight Chronicles almost
5595760	5600680	even, this kind of looks like to me. But yeah, it's second age, so it's some type of second
5600680	5604720	generation MMO I'm just not familiar with from the Japanese name. There's also a game
5604720	5610000	called Akatsuki no Goei Trinity comes out in also a regular and limited edition this
5610000	5617480	week in Japan. Eureka Seven AO, Jungfrau no Hanabanatachi game. It's one of those video
5617480	5626240	game and the hybrid anime disc. F1 2011, Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning, Shin Sangoku Musou Six
5626240	5631320	Empires, that's Dynasty Warrior if I'm not mistaken. And a new wireless headset from
5631320	5635360	Sony is all coming out this week. Big week in Japan there on the PlayStation 3. Yeah,
5635360	5638920	they do have a new wireless headset. I'm not really sure what it is though. I just saw
5638920	5643560	it the other day in her system. Why not? Quickly looking at the handhelds, checking out the
5643560	5647800	Vita. Oh, Little Big Planet, that's kind of a big release. That's out in Japan this week.
5647800	5652320	Little Big Planet and did you say that's coming out here too? Little Big Planet is in a couple
5652320	5658480	weeks. Damn, I really want to play that. Lastly on the 3DS, nothing this week strangely. Everything's
5658480	5664240	next week for the 3DS. Nothing this week. Let's travel to the UK. Alan, are you able
5664240	5671520	to fill in for Jamie tonight? Yes, over in the UK starting on September 18th, connect
5671520	5677080	Nat Geo TV and connect Sesame Street TV. On the 19th of September, Little Big Planet
5677080	5684120	on the Vita. 20th of September, Rayman Jungle Run on the Android and iPad. Torchlight 2
5684120	5692960	for PC. September 21st, F1 2012 for PS3, PC and 360. I think this title is being listed
5692960	5697800	twice, one in English, one in Japanese, but one piece Kaizoku Musou and also one piece
5697800	5702720	Pirate Warriors that has the same box art, I'm assuming it's the same game. Borderlands
5702720	5708960	2, woohoo, on September 21st and that's it for that week. AlphaKananagram in our chat
5708960	5712800	room. This is why I love having chatters. Live.vognetwork.com, they set us straight
5712800	5717320	when we were wrong. AlphaKananagram says Little Big Planet Vita came out two days ago. Sony
5717320	5725320	said fuck it and released it early, I'm playing it now. The box version is not. Although I'll
5725320	5729320	have to charge them a Vita. I know, I'm like, I'm all about Little Big Planet on the Vita,
5729320	5733560	I'm excited about that. Nothing at all is disappointed about. I was just a target today,
5733560	5737400	if I'd seen that I would have snatched it up. It's not been released boxed, it's maybe
5737400	5742240	digitally. I think somebody broke Street Date. I think GameStop broke Street Date, I seem
5742240	5745480	to remember now, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine that said GameStop broke
5745480	5748840	Street Date. Oh, I'm not surprised, they do that shit all the time. Oh, but if anyone
5748840	5753920	else breaks Street Date, all hell's gonna break loose. Oooh, somebody's bitter over
5753920	5757400	there. Well no, seriously, they're the big proponents of not having Street Dates in the
5757400	5761120	first place because they have a competitive advantage over everybody else. AlphaKananagram
5761120	5770120	says I have the boxed version, it's out. BlackWolf says it's only on sale at the Evil G. BlackWolf
5770120	5778400	said Sony told Evil G to break Street Date. Weird. Fuckers! It's not supposed to be out
5778400	5784560	for a couple weeks, but okay. Cool. That'll make for an interesting conversation. I'm
5784560	5788760	waiting two weeks, I'm not going to You-Know-Where just to get LittleBigPlanet. I'm excited
5788760	5793000	about LittleBigPlanet, but I'm not that excited. Too bad, Sony, because a great way to get
5793000	5797920	my attention would have been to do that before Mr. Pandaria's out. Because if you're gonna
5797920	5803440	try and get my attention after Mr. Pandaria's out, yeah, good luck. Who am I kidding, I'll
5803440	5806760	still get LittleBigPlanet. Alright, Loki, one more story and then we're gonna get to
5806760	5811360	the classic game of the week, which I am stealing tonight in Dark Soccer's absence. Alright,
5811360	5819600	so apparently the developers of the wonderful military game ARMA, Bohemian Interactive,
5819600	5826640	there's a few employees that have been arrested on spying charges. Apparently they were out
5826640	5832200	looking for, I guess, buildings and stuff that they can put in their game, so they're
5832200	5845000	taking photographs and stuff of military installations on the island of Lemnos, Greece. And of course
5845000	5852680	they were caught and they had the footage and stuff and apparently it's illegal, surprise,
5852680	5863240	legal to take video and photographs of military installations. So, yeah, that's not good.
5863240	5870680	And of course, you know, Bohemian Interactive, they've confirmed that yes, they were arrested
5870680	5874760	during their holiday trip and it says they visited the island with the sole purpose of
5874760	5885880	experiencing the island's beautiful surroundings and, yeah, that kinda sucks, but I mean, it's
5885880	5891280	against the law to take pictures of that stuff so maybe you shouldn't. That's crazy. Maybe
5891280	5898840	you know the Greek military would not like you putting their military installation in
5898840	5903200	your game. Just saying. Might not be a good thing. Might not be a good thing. Might not
5903200	5910240	be good. That's, wow, that's crazy. Alright. Can I tell a true story that's completely
5910240	5916420	random once? I went to Canada in 2006 with my good friend John at the time. He was my
5916420	5920120	roommate when we had the studio in the garage so I can't remember if he ever popped on OLR
5920120	5926560	or not because he played Final Fantasy and that's about it. But we went to Canada together
5926560	5930920	and he's a big picture taker, takes pictures of everything. He'll take pictures of food
5930920	5934760	at the dinner table, take pictures of signs, whatever. He'll take pictures of everything.
5934760	5938680	So we're in the little line waiting at the airport because the plane lands, you have
5938680	5942740	to go through customs first before you get to technically enter the country, right? He's
5942740	5948080	taking pictures in customs. Which, okay, he's being a dumb tourist, whatever. So we get
5948080	5952960	up to the front and the lady behind the thing is all, it's this one. And the security guard
5952960	5957640	comes up and is like, what kind of pictures are you taking? And he's like scared shitless.
5957640	5961600	And so he's like showing the guy on the camera the pictures he's taken and like the lady
5961600	5964880	behind the counter is like, why are you shaking? Why are you nervous? And we're like, fucking
5964880	5971840	Canada's hardcore. But you know, keep in mind this wasn't, it was only five years after
5971840	5977400	a major event that changed the way we travel in many ways. So he was just like, honestly,
5977400	5980160	he didn't know better, but like, yeah, they don't fuck around with picture taking and
5980160	5983960	stuff like that. Like even though he was just taking picture of like the Canadian and the
5983960	5989360	U S flags together and the signs and say nothing you or I would think is bad, but they don't
5989360	5992240	know that. And apparently there's some top secret shit in there. They don't want people
5992240	6000200	knowing how the system works or whatever. So the true origin of maple syrup, it's people,
6000200	6009760	it's people. All right, let's, let's go to a much simpler time when all you needed to
6009760	6017480	get to Canada was a birth certificate, not a passport. The segment we call the classic
6017480	6022520	game of the week. Every week, dark soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find
6022520	6027400	a game that she says, Hey, you kids ought to be playing this game this week, but she's
6027400	6034680	not here. So we get to tap into my brain instead tonight. Sometimes Alan will do this. Sometimes
6034680	6039800	look, you'll do this tonight. I'm doing it. So tonight's classic game of the week is a
6039800	6048720	real old, old game. Tonight's classic game of the week is pitfall to the lost caverns.
6048720	6054120	That's right. Um, pitfall to the lost caverns was on a lot of systems back in the eighties.
6054120	6057960	It dates all the way back to the Atari 2,600. Actually it was the original releases on the
6057960	6065960	Atari 2,600 from 1984. I remember this game fondly from the Commodore 64 itself, but it
6065960	6070960	was on a lot of different systems. The 5,200, the Coleco vision, the MSX, the ZX spectrum,
6070960	6076560	the PC booter. I mean, it was, it was everywhere. Apple two, it was on a lot of different systems.
6076560	6081600	The reason why I picked pitfall two over pitfall one is that personally I have a lot more fond
6081600	6088000	memories playing this one. And I think this really lends itself to a lot of the games
6088000	6093500	that we have today. Pitfall two was about exploring the cavern. Whereas pitfall one
6093500	6097520	was really just kind of like a very linear, it was all remember pitfall one was just kind
6097520	6100640	of like you didn't, you, you could go down in the cave and skip screens, but it was very
6100640	6106400	limit linear. Pitfall two really fleshed out that feeling of like, I can go down here and
6106400	6109880	then I can backtrack and go back here and get the item I got here to go get the rat
6109880	6117080	over here. And it was one of the first games on the Atari 2600 to have background music.
6117080	6124120	A similar piece to the one you're hearing right now from the Commodore 64 version. Pitfall
6124120	6129340	two was similar to pitfall one, but obviously lost caverns had a lot of different features.
6129340	6132840	Pitfall Harry had unlimited time and lives. The original game was limited to, I think
6132840	6138640	20 minutes, 30 minutes. So you could never lose the game. You never could actually die.
6138640	6142660	Whenever you would get hit, you will just flash back and the sad little music plays
6142660	6148980	the little sadder music. And he goes back to the red cross and you lose points. So pitfall
6148980	6153200	two, if you really wanted to be the master, you had to get the best possible score that
6153200	6159560	would show that you never died. Pitfall two has 27 horizontal levels compared to pitfall
6159560	6165100	one's two. They're all about the same height, but sometimes there's balloons that will let
6165100	6170980	you go up to new areas. There are no snakes or crocodiles like there were in pitfall one,
6170980	6178680	but there are scorpions, there are bats, there's condors, electric eels in the water and frogs.
6178680	6182720	There was also not just pitfall Harry, but there was his little friends, the mountain
6182720	6186480	lion, which was quick claw, and there was Rhonda. And that was the object of the game.
6186480	6191060	You were trying to save Rhonda, quick claw, and I believe find a diamond ring was like
6191060	6196520	all that stuff. All those characters ended up appearing on the Saturday Supercade children's
6196520	6202320	cartoon that's based on pitfall. Rhonda and quick claw were actually created for that
6202320	6206480	before this game was released about a year sooner. The maximum possible score in the
6206480	6213040	game 199,000 points. That is different from the Atari eight bit and 52 version that I'll
6213040	6218360	get into in a minute. You can actually see quick claw, one of the goals of the game,
6218360	6223940	you see him right under you when you start the game. So that's kind of cool that like,
6223940	6229040	that's probably the last thing you'll collect as you're doing the game is that you kind
6229040	6232480	of end up where you started. It's kind of a neat little, you know, especially for game
6232480	6237560	design back in the day, it was kind of neat that you ended up where you started there.
6237560	6241540	Of course, the soundtrack as well that would change keys and stuff, depending on how well
6241540	6246040	you're doing, what you're hearing in the background right now is kind of like the heroic theme.
6246040	6249640	Whenever you collect a treasure, you'll hear a ding and it starts over. If you die, there's
6249640	6255440	a slower theme that plays. So this was a huge game on the Atari 2600. It was really pushing
6255440	6261280	the envelope. The hardware was six years old when this game came out, but pitfall two brought
6261280	6267160	scrolling, detailed animation, and of course the musical score. David Crane actually designed
6267160	6272960	and patented a display processor chip, which would enhance the 2600 graphics capabilities
6272960	6277680	and could process the music in three channels plus drums. They were hoping that this would
6277680	6283520	push the limits of the Atari 2600, but considering this came out in 84, what else happened around
6283520	6288280	that same time? The video game crashed. So this kind of came out when the party was already
6288280	6293720	over. Now there's another version of the game that's really cool. It's the Adventurers edition.
6293720	6301360	This is only available on the 5200 and the Atari 8-bit versions. They remade David Crane's
6301360	6305960	version and Tom Schoder had to remake the game from the ground up for the Commodore
6305960	6311680	version. Well, Mike Lorenzen, who did the Atari version, he reused David Crane's code
6311680	6317640	from the 2600 version. So it's shorted the debugging process. So what did he do? He made
6317640	6322300	a whole new level in the game, like almost like a second, like a Zelda second quest type
6322300	6329160	of thing. Well, they came out and said, they being the marketing, they said, no, the two
6329160	6333360	versions are not allowed to be different because you may think things are bad now where you
6333360	6339640	have the same game on Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. But back in the day, dude, it was
6339640	6347520	Apple, Commodore, Coleco, Atari, and television. Like you can go find ads from old gaming magazines
6347520	6351440	that would show you screenshots from 10 different versions of the game. Yeah, there were usually
6351440	6357040	anywhere between six to eight valid platforms, really small niche ones during that time.
6357040	6362200	Yeah, absolutely. So marketing said, no, you can't have different sections of the game.
6362200	6367600	So what happened? Well, Brad Fregger, who is the producer, they left it in and made
6367600	6372560	it an Easter egg. So they just kind of hit it away in the game, but you can get it. So
6372560	6378040	the new level will have a way more challenging stuff. There's new creatures, rabbit bats
6378040	6383360	that fly more erratically. They also will reverse direction. There's also frogs that
6383360	6389840	go all the way across the screen. Fire ants and piranha fish were fast creatures as well.
6389840	6395240	Yeah, all this stuff was new. And then you have to collect different items as well. You
6395240	6400240	would get a rope, a pot, a trumpet, and a snake charmer. And what happens is that you
6400240	6405000	get all the way to the last guy and it would scroll across the bottom of the screen. Charming
6405000	6409400	the golden rope is Pitfall Harry's only hope. So it brings the game full circle because
6409400	6413440	if you have the rope, the pot, the trumpet, the snake charmer, then the snake charmer
6413440	6419080	will play the trumpet and the little rope will raise from the pot and all four of you
6419080	6423680	escape the cave. So like you and Rhonda and quick law escape the cave. So it really brought
6423680	6427520	it full circle. So it's kind of funny that this was all a hidden thing that marketing
6427520	6434080	didn't really want to allow in the beginning. So yeah, very cool. Um, there is also, and
6434080	6439200	I'll leave it at this. There was an arcade version. Sega made an arcade version in 1985.
6439200	6445040	It was very different. It looked very cartoonish. It looked very Alex Kidd to me, but it had
6445040	6449120	definitely some elements that had some of the similar music. In fact, do we have, I
6449120	6453880	think I should have here ready? Yes. Here's the Sega version and you can hear it's a little
6453880	6463400	bit similar here. If we actually fast forward. So it's kind of like similar, but the game
6463400	6468380	design is very different. It's split up into four stages. There is a timer because it was
6468380	6473160	an arcade game. Um, and you know, there is kind of a definitive beginning and end that
6473160	6476640	doesn't have to do with collecting the same things you did. So it was kind of like they
6476640	6480560	took the name and the idea and made this completely different type of game out of it. But it's
6480560	6484480	worth checking out. That's of course the Sega version of pitfall to the lost caverns that
6484480	6492660	was out in the arcade. One other port ask of this or a highly inspired by this game,
6492660	6498360	super pitfall on the NES, not on the super NES on the NES was super pitfall because remember
6498360	6504420	it was a sequel to an Atari 2,600 game super pitfall on the NES. I bought it the week it
6504420	6508960	was released or well at that age I convinced my mom to buy it for me when I got straight
6508960	6515020	A's the week it was released because I was such a fan of pitfall to super pitfall is
6515020	6520520	absolute fucking garbage. It is one of the worst games they ever released on the NES.
6520520	6525680	It is buggy as shit. There's flickering. Go look at some of the long plays that are on
6525680	6531040	YouTube. People walking through walls and shit like waters, water caverns that just
6531040	6536160	suddenly end and you can fall down a waterfall to like a whole new level things like that.
6536160	6540960	Like it just doesn't fucking make sense. Like it's one of the, seriously, it is like somebody
6540960	6547320	pooed in a cartridge and put it out. It is one of the worst NES games they ever made.
6547320	6551600	And when you're that young or at least in my experience it takes, cause we're not obviously
6551600	6555760	we weren't as discriminating back then to realize, Oh no, I was, I played it and I was
6555760	6561840	like, this is fucking garbage. Even as like a 10 year old, I was like, what the shit?
6561840	6565640	No, like even the first time I played it was like, that doesn't even look like pitfall
6565640	6576640	Harry. Who's this blue munchkin with the mustache. Fuck this guy in the hard hat. It was terrible.
6576640	6580360	Breakman and chat backing me up. Sky is a million percent correct. Super pitfalls, one
6580360	6586040	of the worst games ever made. It is such garbage. I would love for some month on the show to
6586040	6591800	have Jamie change the segment and do the unclassic game of the week. And I'll tell you super
6591800	6596800	pitfalls, one of the worst games that ought to be featured. Anyhow, let's not focus on
6596800	6601040	the bad. Let's go back to the good. If you're going to play an Atari 2,600 game at some
6601040	6605280	point in your life, cause you know, maybe you weren't born yet when the Atari 2,600
6605280	6609800	was kind of a big deal. Go play pitfall two. It was a great game that really pushed the
6609800	6617880	envelope for the technology of the Atari 2,600. All right, let's move on and take a break.
6617880	6621040	We're going to take a break and when we come back, we have plenty more show to come, which
6621040	6625720	is great cause part A was two hours. So we're going to come back with some rapid fire news,
6625720	6629580	the frugal question of the week, as well as more news stories, including a really interesting
6629580	6634280	Microsoft patent we've got to talk about when we come back. Your emails, FUs of the week,
6634280	6638880	Twitter topics and more, when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after
6638880	6645520	this.
6645520	6651600	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with our 473rd episode for this September
6651600	6657040	the 16th of 2012. Kind of a long show so far, but lots of talk this week about the news
6657040	6661400	on Wii U and all that good stuff in part A. And then there was other stuff too. I don't
6661400	6665960	even think Loki has gotten to officially talk about earth defense sports, the new one yet.
6665960	6673200	Is that even on the show? Roll? How did that happen? I know it is a crime. All right. Also
6673200	6678840	not here tonight. Dark Sakura. She has the night off because of the holiday for her religion.
6678840	6682520	So happy Rosh Hashanah to those of you celebrating and Yom Kippur because I know that's coming
6682520	6689360	up as well. Again, for those joining us a little late live, just kind of a footnote.
6689360	6694640	There is no live OLR next week. We are going to tape in advance, however, so that way you
6694640	6699440	do still have a new show next week. Podcast listeners, you won't notice a thing different
6699440	6703480	except the fact that the show is taped a little bit early. So the news might be just a couple
6703480	6707720	days behind, but you should still have the same great show and Dark Sakura will be back
6707720	6713840	for that taping on Thursday. Let's see. Did I cover everything? I think so. I think we're
6713840	6720160	getting ready to get back to it with some rapid fire news. So Loki. All right. So we
6720160	6728560	talk about Kickstarter, you know, regularly, and there's a new Kickstarter for from a developer
6728560	6734320	that you might recognize, Obsidian, you know, famous for Knights of the Old Republic 2,
6734320	6739120	Neverwhere Nights, Fallout New Vegas, the new South Park game is going to be coming
6739120	6747720	out. Well, there's kickstarting a new project called Project Eternity for PC. It's a new
6747720	6755200	MMO, kind of like a fantasy world game, and their goal was to raise 1.1 million dollars,
6755200	6760040	and they pretty much have already hit their goal. Actually, they already have hit their
6760040	6766240	goal and they're going beyond that now to the stretch goals, but, you know, so if you
6766240	6770960	want to back them up and check out what they have to offer as far as, you know, what the
6770960	6778040	game's going to be about, cool. And I know I remember reading a tweet that Notch had,
6778040	6784960	you know, kicked him, I think, 10 grand or something, so that's kind of cool. Yeah. And
6784960	6791040	then of course if you're into some time waster stuff, there's a cool Flash game that was
6791040	6801000	created by a Russian programmer named, or calling himself DJ Smart, and it's a Pac-Man
6801000	6808880	game with a portal gun, Pac-Man portal, and you can check it out on his website, or actually
6808880	6816200	it's a website at IndieGames.com slash 2012 slash 09 slash freeware game, pick Pac-Man
6816200	6822240	port. I'm sure you can just search for portal Pac-Man, or Pac-Man portal in Google and find
6822240	6827840	it just as well. It's kind of neat, you can teleport around the map. And then last but
6827840	6833800	not least, brand new update is going to be coming to the Playstation 3 very soon, 4.25,
6833800	6836600	and that's going to be the update, of course, that's going to give the increased storage
6836600	6840840	space for Playstation Plus. I think it rolled out this week. Yeah. I think my Playstation
6840840	6847560	grabbed it. So it's one gig space instead of what it was previously, and of course save
6847560	6853200	game data is going to be increased as well. Nice. Alright, well the Wii U wasn't the only
6853200	6858120	console that had some news this week. Remember the Neo Geo? We've been following this a little
6858120	6861560	bit. I know this isn't the first time we've talked to this new Neo Geo coming out, but
6861560	6867480	there is going to be the Neo Geo X standalone system. It's going to be $130. This is different
6867480	6872440	from the $200 gold version that has a charging dock and joystick. If all you want is kind
6872440	6876760	of the bare bones, little portable Neo Geo X thing that I believe, if I remember right,
6876760	6879640	you can hook it up to a television through the system as well. Probably. Kind of like
6879640	6884440	some of those bootleg Nintendos that are coming more and more prevalent you see now. What
6884440	6889240	was that one you got me called? I can't remember the name of that thing now. The FC Mobile?
6889240	6894760	Is that it? Something like that? Anyhow, if you just want the little handheld device itself,
6894760	6903120	it will be $130. This is a Neo Geo that comes preloaded with 20 Neo Geo games. So, you could
6903120	6908760	spend that money on a Neo Geo X, 20 games, or almost have enough money for a Wii U tablet
6908760	6916000	in Japan. We're gonna buy a Dingu and it plays the same stuff. The Dingu ate my baby. Double
6916000	6920320	Dragon Neon. If you are listening live to Orange Lounge Radio, you heard a song or two
6920320	6926200	from the soundtrack during the break. If you are on the podcast, sadly, I can't replay
6926200	6930480	the songs due to rights issues during the break, but good news, you can get the soundtrack
6930480	6938440	for free. Check that out. It is available for free on the site Bandcamp, vert.bandcamp.com
6938440	6944160	slash album slash double dash dragon dash neon. That link is floating around the internet.
6944160	6949560	Here's the thing though, you can contribute however much you want. You can put a big fat
6949560	6954800	zero in that box if you want, but you know, if you have the money to chip in or you find
6954800	6958840	you do enjoy the soundtrack, maybe go back and, you know, give a couple bucks to this
6958840	6964800	guy who's basically making the soundtrack free. It's not just remakes of the old songs.
6964800	6970800	There's also like inspired music from the eighties. Like there was definitely a song
6970800	6974440	in that first stage that sounded like it was heart or some shit playing in the background.
6974440	6981740	It was great. It's great. So good job. Uh, that is Jake Kaufman who goes by vert, which
6981740	6988520	is why it's on vert.bandcamp.com and I definitely wanted to tip the hat to this at some point
6988520	6992720	tonight. I think this is a great cause and I know we have a variety of different people
6992720	6997440	that listen to OLR and I know for a fact that there's some people out there who are, um,
6997440	7002640	facing some disability in their gaming. Perhaps, you know, it's, it's that they are blind,
7002640	7006980	can't see at all, or I've heard of some folks that are, you know, unable to use, you know,
7006980	7010480	all of their limbs or, you know, some of the other things that people take for granted
7010480	7016420	sometimes. Well, the AbleGamers Foundation created a 48 page document that they want
7016420	7021920	to have be a how to guide for developers and publishers on how to create more accessible
7021920	7027620	games. In a quote from founder Mark Barlett, quote, we are gamers first. To us, that means
7027620	7032200	the core of the game should never be changed or altered in any way. Our mission has been
7032200	7036880	and always will be to include as many accessibility options for those who need them that are also
7036880	7041820	invisible to those who don't. And I love this. They actually put like a little screenshot
7041820	7047680	of Bejeweled 3 and they say, this is what Bejeweled 3 looks like to, you know, the,
7047680	7052520	the most gamer, gamers that don't face a visual disability. But then they show, this is what
7052520	7056840	it looks like to somebody who can only see in black and white. This is what is some,
7056840	7060240	this is what it looks like to somebody who has red color blind or blue color blind or
7060240	7064280	whatever it is, green color blind. It shows kind of the different ways the screens look.
7064280	7068080	And I think that's a great way to get somebody to, you know, think about their game. And
7068080	7073280	I love this. In the PDF document, they actually show like a list. They actually show like
7073280	7078360	a checklist of, you know, keep this checklist handy. This is what your game should have.
7078360	7084800	And it's things like remappable buttons. I, I don't even really face a disability. I'm
7084800	7089160	very thankful that, you know, I'm fortunate and lucky that, you know, I don't have these
7089160	7093320	same challenges that other people do in their lives. But even I can appreciate a game with
7093320	7098880	remappable buttons. Cause damn, sometimes you look at the default controls and you're
7098880	7103520	like, why is the game this way? Or sometimes you have a joystick that, you know, a controller
7103520	7108040	or whatever, that a button wears out on it. Like my wired controller, for some reason
7108040	7114760	these Microsoft controllers, the wired ones, uh, the L3 button breaks a lot. So it'd be
7114760	7119140	cool to remap that. And AbleGamers believes everybody should be able, every game should
7119140	7122940	have remappable buttons, which just makes sense. And then it's other things like sometimes,
7122940	7127400	you know, like think about the Vita. When the Vita first came out, if you're blind,
7127400	7132920	you can't use a touch screen the same way, you know, somebody that can see can. So why
7132920	7137080	on earth would you not make it so that, or why on earth would you make it so you can't
7137080	7142000	use the controller to choose? Well, thankfully the Vita patched that in in their last patch,
7142000	7146560	but it was because of response like this, undoubtedly. So anyway, I know I spent a little
7146560	7150920	time on that, but I thought, uh, that was a great, great document that they put out
7150920	7155080	that I do think every game developer company out there ought to have a little printed copy
7155080	7159200	of it somewhere for reference. I think it would be a good thing. Alan, are you going
7159200	7164760	to go with your rapid fire stories? Uh, yes. Just get the thing when it beeps. Yep. I will.
7164760	7171880	You got it. Um, Terraria game sold 1.6 million on PC. Most of that probably through steam
7171880	7180160	is coming to XBLA and a PlayStation network in early 2013. And I have Terraria. I've only
7180160	7185040	really tinkered with it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but I know that it's, I don't want
7185040	7188780	to say that it's a 2d Minecraft, but it's, it's an adventure game with a lot of building
7188780	7195020	and exploration. You dig into tunnels and you find monsters and it's just a really huge
7195020	7198600	indie hit from the last, I think two years. You have Terraria, right? Didn't you, didn't
7198600	7201760	you have a bunch of people trying to do it? I do. I bought it for like three other people
7201760	7207080	too. I doubt, I bet none of them are playing it. Yeah. So Terraria, if you're a Terraria
7207080	7215160	fan, it's the graphics are very cutesy super nest, 16 bit pixely cute, cute look. Uh, Bobby
7215160	7221040	Blackwolf in our chat room says the Terraria hardcore are pissed about this news. Oh, this
7221040	7226320	is right up there with the Bayonetta 2 being on the Wii U. Someone's cool kids club is
7226320	7233360	having its pretension barriers lifted. We have a saying and it's deal with it and then
7233360	7237000	shades will fall from the sky and fall right on your nose. Yeah. Sorry that I'm not a part
7237000	7240760	of the cult of Terraria, but it's, you know, what was it you said earlier? Go pee your
7240760	7250160	bed. Yeah. Go, go pee your bed. Um, what else do I have? Uh, a shifty look. I'm not sure
7250160	7257360	who that is. Uh, there's a Katamari web comic coming out by them and the art direction looks
7257360	7264080	great. It looks very weird and silly like, like Katamari does. And, uh, September, oh,
7264080	7269080	this is already out or no tomorrow actually. Um, the new Katamari web comic will debut
7269080	7273400	on shifty look.com on September 17th, 2012. So that's tomorrow. It's a free to read series
7273400	7280640	based on the popular junk rolling package flashing Namco Bandai gaming franchise. It
7280640	7284640	will be updated twice a week. So yeah, if you're into Katamari, there's going to be
7284640	7290000	an official, um, it looks like this is a, Namco doesn't have a problem with it, a web
7290000	7295020	comic for you to read and enjoy. And there's a, um, I can paste the link into chat and
7295020	7300640	you can see what the art is going to look like. Um, my last quick fire news story is,
7300640	7305040	uh, people are wondering, especially with Capcom, I guess the story we covered last
7305040	7311360	week about Mega Man had too many competing franchises that were stealing sales from each
7311360	7315220	other. So not one single franchise was selling well. And it's like, okay, well who's fucking
7315220	7320640	fault was that Capcom? And there's a rumor that a new Mega Man game may be on the 25th
7320640	7326720	anniversary. Um, Capcom says, don't get your hopes up. Uh, I know Rob was theorizing that
7326720	7330360	they're going to just reboot Mega Man altogether. They're going to reboot it with a new creative
7330360	7337200	person watch, watch. So yeah, the 25th anniversary is looming and people are like saying Capcom's
7337200	7344520	gonna do something, but Capcom used to be that cool. They're not that cool anymore.
7344520	7348320	If they were going to release it, they were gonna, they would have announced it by now.
7348320	7352960	Let me go back to your Terraria story for a minute here. Cause Black Wolf gives a further
7352960	7360240	insight. I did not frequent the fan community, so I did not see why they were so mad, but
7360240	7367120	Black Wolf says there may be some justification for the bedwetting and he says the short version,
7367120	7372640	the devs stopped supporting the PC version, said they weren't making any more updates.
7372640	7376440	Then they announced a console version with new features. That stank. Okay. That is a
7376440	7385200	little stank. So that's, that's them pooping the bed, not you peeing it. Who pooped the
7385200	7401000	bed. Terraria developers did. All right, let's move on with the Fugal question of the week.
7401000	7405360	Every week we ask you guys a question on our fan communities on Facebook as well as Google
7405360	7410040	plus. If you want to find us on Google plus, well, there's no short links on Google plus.
7410040	7414080	So just search for orange lounge radio. We'll come right up. If you want to find us on Facebook,
7414080	7422200	Facebook, excuse me, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. This week's Fugal question of
7422200	7424960	the week. It's all about the Wii U because we haven't talked enough about it during the
7424960	7429000	show. Did the Nintendo Wii U conference this week change your mind on if you wanted a Wii
7429000	7434000	U or not at this point, are you planning on buying a Wii U between November 18th and the
7434000	7438800	end of the year? Retertainment says on Google plus, I want to buy a Wii U, but it probably
7438800	7444160	won't happen until after the end of the year. He has other priorities. Act Def says one
7444160	7448800	still not sold completely on the system. So I'll wait at least a year to get one and see
7448800	7453160	what games will be released and see if the system is definitely worth a purchase or not.
7453160	7458880	That's what I'm currently doing with the 3DS. Flaco Jones replied on Google plus and says
7458880	7462800	it convinced me that they're going to have more games on the system than just the Nintendo
7462800	7468320	staples. I could see myself buying one a year from now. If they start getting the multi-platform
7468320	7473520	games at the same time and if the price goes down or built-in memory goes way up, they
7473520	7477680	also need to bundle in a remote plus. There are just too many hidden costs for me to afford
7477680	7482260	one at launch. That was an interesting response because he says it convinced me that they're
7482260	7488080	going to have this new stuff, but I'll consider it a year from now, which to be fair, there's
7488080	7491660	a lot of people that are in that boat. I don't exactly blame him with that one. Let's go
7491660	7494880	over to Facebook and check out some of the answers over there. There were a lot of answers
7494880	7499320	on Facebook. I'm not going to be able to get through all these, so I apologize in advance.
7499320	7503240	If you want to see all the answers, go to facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and
7503240	7508480	I'm going to have to shorten a lot of these to even get through some of them. Don't hear
7508480	7512560	me wrong though. We love the fact that so many people are responding. Llama Juice says
7512560	7516580	I went to a Nintendo event about a week ago where they let a small group of people in
7516580	7520320	and play the Wii U stuff. Oh yeah, we had somebody call in on that a little while ago.
7520320	7523440	After an hour and a half with the system, I came to the conclusion it's not a system
7523440	7530000	I want, but a system I'd want to play at a friend's house. Critical Myth from our Monday,
7530000	7534480	Wednesday, Friday show at Voicy Geeks Network replied and said the Wii was fun for a couple
7534480	7538680	weeks until it became apparent that the controls were too much trouble compared to the PS3
7538680	7543760	or 360. The Wii U takes that to the next level and doesn't have compelling excuses. We're
7543760	7549120	going to pass. Dark Charger says as an owner of all current consoles and handhelds, I will
7549120	7554480	eventually pick up a Wii U, but I see no reason to pick one up at launch. Few games in the
7554480	7558960	launch window interest me, and history tells us that some of those will invariably get
7558960	7563340	delayed. I have no doubt there will be an exclusive that will compel a purchase sometime
7563340	7570640	next year. Probably Bayonetta 2. Kevin S. replied and said I'd rather purchase an Ouya.
7570640	7575520	Nintendo ruined it for me. $100 is feasible. Kind of wish the answer was longer there.
7575520	7580880	I want to know more about the reasoning behind that answer because, you know, $100 is feasible
7580880	7585840	for a new system. I don't, like, you know, I'm not dismissing the answer. I'm just saying
7585840	7589320	I'm like, oh, I wish he'd written more because I want to know more about like, why does the
7589320	7596560	Ouya stand out? Is it just the price? Anyhow, Stan replied and said, I'm sold. First Pikmin
7596560	7600560	3 was announced and I'm sure a new Mario Kart and Smash Brothers will come out and Bayonetta
7600560	7607720	2 on top of that. As Fry would say, shut up and take my money. Uh, Tiara said, I'm still
7607720	7611720	not interested, especially for the price point. If there's a drastic price cut like there
7611720	7616320	was with the 3DS, I may invest at a later point, but right now it's not worth the money.
7616320	7620760	Uh, Joe Vidaia says, with what I spent on the Wii and all the games that I own and don't
7620760	7625400	play on that system, my answer is no. While I love to Bayonetta, I can't see the second
7625400	7630600	one doing so well on Wii U that it stays an exclusive past the launch date. I do want
7630600	7634040	to clarify though, even though a lot of people are theorizing that Nintendo is publishing
7634040	7639300	it, it will not be on any other system. Not gonna happen. Uh, so far that's the only game
7639300	7646480	mention that I care about. Um, Kareem J. replied and said, short answer, no. Storage is so
7646480	7651000	cheap now, I don't know why Nintendo didn't opt for a 16 gig version instead of a 32 gig
7651000	7656040	version. No one starts at 8 anymore. Even Apple moved away from that storage capacity.
7656040	7662640	250 pounds for an 8 gig device, excuse me, 250 euros for an 8 gig device. Give me a break.
7662640	7668880	Uh, Acidic Vampire says, no, not enough Imagine Babies games. Just wait. Imagine Babies will
7668880	7673760	happen. Give it time, man. Give it time. Give it time. Um, Gamer Girl says, I'm not sure
7673760	7678920	if I want one just yet. Might wait a while before deciding. Uh, besides if I get one
7678920	7682780	now, I'll just regret it later. I kind of want to wait for the price to drop and more
7682780	7687840	games added to the library. Kind of learned my lesson to the Wii. Don't get me wrong,
7687840	7692560	but it's lacking in titles. James S. replied and said, hi guys, I'm new to OLR. Thanks
7692560	7696680	to Stitcher. Well, thank you. And thank you Stitcher where you can hear us by the way
7696680	7701760	on Stitcher Radio, which is in some ways kind of like where podcasting is going right now
7701760	7705840	is apps like Stitcher and TuneIn and all that, especially with podcasting becoming its own
7705840	7710480	app. But that's a discussion for another day. Welcome to the show. And here's the answer.
7710480	7714860	The inclusion of Platinum Games announcement that Bayonetta 2 will be a Wii U exclusive
7714860	7719520	intrigues me. And I have no doubt that there will be many more surprises from Nintendo
7719520	7724640	to come, but I just don't believe quite yet that these justify a purchase. We just need
7724640	7730160	that extra oomph from Nintendo, a AAA in-house exclusive for launch day. Sigh. That rumored
7730160	7733800	Zelda A Link to the Past remake and or sequel would have been enough to warrant a purchase
7733800	7738360	for me. But as of right now, I'll hold off just for a little while longer. Love the show.
7738360	7745040	Keep it up. He wants to throw in a plug. Why not? Plug plug search James Anthony on Amazon
7745040	7751720	Kindle for my 99 cent highly rated horror comedy books. Fine. I will give a listener
7751720	7757840	a shout out. Back to the answer though. It's it's actually a real similar answer to where
7757840	7763480	I'm at. To be honest, it's almost exactly what I said earlier, right? Bayonetta 2 fucking
7763480	7768960	great. Not enough. So there you go. Those are the answers on Facebook.com slash orange
7768960	7773160	launch radio. I am sorry I didn't get a chance to read them all. There was just like 20 of
7773160	7777160	them and that's a lot. So go read them. Facebook.com slash orange launch radio and then answer
7777160	7783560	next week's when it comes up. Tiger Claws says he made a quick link for the orange launch
7783560	7788440	radio Google plus page. I didn't even know that was a thing you could do. G plus dot
7788440	7793520	two slash orange launch radio. Well, thank you. It's much, much easier for me to give
7793520	7800280	out than say, go to Google and search for it. Fantastic. All right. That's it for the
7800280	7806000	frugal question of the week. And just to clarify, if there was any question here in studio,
7806000	7812040	are you buying a Wii U? Did the conference change your mind? Loki, not buying a Wii U
7812040	7816600	did not change anything. Uh, Alan, sorry. I know you're mid bite there on that delicious
7816600	7822240	quesadilla, but your thoughts, man, like I said earlier, I don't care enough. Me. I am
7822240	7826480	still on the fence. I really am. It is going to come down to how much extra money do I
7826480	7831000	have burning a hole in my pocket around that time. I'm thinking probably not right away.
7831000	7836820	I just think I'm trying to save for other life priorities right now. I just don't know,
7836820	7844080	but I could still be convinced Nintendo tell me that it has zero games coming in 2013 and
7844080	7851720	I'll be like, be mania two DX volumes one through 15. Yeah. Right. Don't get my hopes
7851720	7857360	up. All right. Be mania two DX was a great game. It's too bad that it's kind of a shadow
7857360	7860880	of what it used to be. But anyway, that's for another day. Hey, Loki, why don't we get
7860880	7866840	it back into some news? All right. So let's talk a little bit about, um, some wonderful
7866840	7875680	new hopefully soon tech from Microsoft. They patented a new immersive display experience.
7875680	7883280	Basically, the way it works is it in conjunction with like connect, it would project a display
7883280	7889440	on your walls, kind of like a projector would. Um, I've actually saw some, um, they have
7889440	7895020	a video, um, that they showed off. I think it was a couple of years ago or whatever similar
7895020	7900240	type of thing. It was during one of their campus tours, um, kind of talking a little
7900240	7905640	bit about home automation stuff. And the way it works is they in conjunction with the camera,
7905640	7910760	it will detect, you know, different movements you're doing, but it also kind of adjust for
7910760	7915880	your room. Like, for example, they were talking about game applications that it would correct
7915880	7919780	the perspective of the scene based on the objects you have in your room. So if there's
7919780	7922960	like a chair or something like that, it'll know that the chair is there and it'll adjust
7922960	7928720	the perspective of whatever objects being, uh, mapped onto it so that it looks like one
7928720	7933680	seamless thing, which is pretty awesome. And, um, you know, some other applications they
7933680	7942560	showed in that, uh, kind of the campus tour that they did, uh, in May 2011, it was kind
7942560	7949280	of like a more windows based, more just kind of like computing. One example was a kid's
7949280	7955160	room or something. They had, you know, a completely interactive display on their walls based.
7955160	7960880	It was all projector and it had like, you know, tweets and social networking stuff was
7960880	7965380	popping up on the wall and, you know, they could, you know, make a gesture or whatever
7965380	7971920	and pull up music and, you know, just the interface was really huge and kind of cool.
7971920	7976240	Very immersive, I guess. You know, there's a part of me that wants to say this is full
7976240	7981280	of shit. This is the same thing we heard about the revolution in 2006. Remember when the
7981280	7986360	Wii was going to be called the revolution, LOL? And, um, we talked about it was going
7986360	7991120	to be fucking holograms in your room. That was one. Go back and listen to the shows from
7991120	7995520	2006. That was one of the rumors about the Nintendo Wii was that it was going to do holograms
7995520	8000400	and all this shit. So here we kind of go again, I feel like in a way, but the way you describe
8000400	8008640	it, it doesn't sound far off from where Microsoft's going. There's a lot with it that I can dig.
8008640	8014320	And if you think about it, we've kind of had that technology before where you can have
8014320	8019080	like a thing that projects images on kids' walls and stuff. Like that's how you have
8019080	8024160	like the dancing circus animals and stuff. Like it's a very, very basic, well, even,
8024160	8027200	even if you're cutouts, right? And a little bit more practical than that, you know, they
8027200	8033000	have the projectable keyboards and stuff that you can get for PDAs and stuff like that where,
8033000	8037480	you know, it projects an image down on the ground and, you know, you type on it like
8037480	8042200	you would a keyboard and it will interact with, you know, what you're doing. And that's
8042200	8046360	what they kind of show too with like different surfaces and stuff. And definitely worth checking
8046360	8051840	out the video for it. I mean, it's seriously, uh, it's seriously cool looking. They had
8051840	8058800	it on MS, uh, was it, uh, I think it was an MSN or something, but it's like a seven minute
8058800	8063400	long video. If you skip like five minutes into it and it shows, I hadn't seen this before.
8063400	8067880	Oh, dammit. It wants me to put on Silverlight. Can I do this other one? This is only like
8067880	8072400	a minute. Uh, that will still work. It's showing some of the stuff, but it's not the, not the
8072400	8075960	interactive one I was telling you about, but see, it gives you the idea. See how the room
8075960	8081680	is whole integrated into it. Uh, that looks like the interventions building at Disney
8081680	8085480	land, the type of stuff that's in there. That makes sense. I mean, it's one of those things
8085480	8089840	where it's like, okay, it's not going to be like the holodeck from Star Trek. It doesn't
8089840	8095140	look that good. It looks like projections on a wall, but it's kind of, kind of rad in
8095140	8100400	a real sci-fi kind of way. You know? Yeah. I mean, I mean, if imagine if you will, like,
8100400	8104300	you know, your apartment here, you just have this thing that's in the middle of the room
8104300	8111040	and you're interacting with, you know, the entire room as like, as you're basically your
8111040	8115000	display. I mean, you could pop in, you know, okay, I want to play Minecraft on this wall
8115000	8118740	and I want my tweets on this wall and I want, I'm going to put, you know, windows media
8118740	8123440	player on this wall or this little section right here. Or I want, I want this, I'm gonna
8123440	8127680	make a fake poster that's going to be right here and this is going to update with my friend's
8127680	8132000	pictures on Facebook or something like that. You could do all that. So that'd be kind of
8132000	8140000	cool. Xbox fill my walls with boobies. Yes, I can. That is one of the things that I am.
8140000	8145040	Loki could walk into a spare bedroom that could be his wall of boobies, his booby palace
8145040	8151000	and just projections of boobies all over the wall or bouncing in slow motion. That'd be
8151000	8155140	awesome. No, but even Nellie would be kind of like that or, or you could do like the
8155140	8163440	whole matrix thing, girl, Xbox guns. I'm going to need more guns, but that could be in a
8163440	8168000	game. It would be awesome. That would be awesome. It would be very sweet. Mm two K in our chat
8168000	8171760	room at live.vognetwork.com. Bringing up a good point though, before we get too carried
8171760	8177560	away. Cool looking, but is it cool playing? I think it'd be cool. I mean, cause you can
8177560	8183240	use it with pretty much anything. You would, it, it's just a display. To be fair, the connect
8183240	8187840	looked really cool at first, but there's like two types of games for it. Well, yes, the
8187840	8192120	tech right now for the connect is terrible. I'm gonna say right now it's terrible, but
8192120	8197680	and even the PC version slightly better, but it right now it's terrible. But next iteration
8197680	8204320	of it may be better. It's just like, you know, the place, the itoy camera, the itoy was crap
8204320	8210280	and the PlayStation eye is less crappy, but it's still not quite there. But the technology
8210280	8215120	is growing so fast that this is going to be possible probably. Well, how they're already,
8215120	8218160	it's possible now cause they're showing. What I want to know is how the fuck is everything
8218160	8223480	projecting on things. Cause projectors aren't cheap. So I want to know what kind of hardware
8223480	8227120	I got to have. I got to mount a fucking thing to my roof or something. I mean, how's this
8227120	8231440	going to work? Don't get me wrong. I'm going to mount a fucking thing on my roof if I can
8231440	8235040	do that shit. You know, the technology will always be glitchy. Like if you tried to do
8235040	8240460	that thing where you're like Xbox guns, well, it'll probably think you said Xbox nuns and
8240460	8244280	there'll be people praying all over your walls for your soul. It wasn't even that it was
8244280	8250080	still motion censored and stuff, but I don't think the voice commands are going to be necessary.
8250080	8253520	You know, if they've got a, you better connect because I think a lot of the voice commands
8253520	8258860	now are because connect doesn't really read you very well. It doesn't really listen to
8258860	8264240	you very well either, but yeah, I don't know. It'll work. All right, well meanwhile, while
8264240	8269860	Microsoft is working on, you know, projecting boobies on your wall, uh, we have the 3DS
8269860	8273960	that is working on getting Game Boy advanced games possibly in the eShop. This is all a
8273960	8279680	rumor right now. However, I mean Game Boy advanced games on the 3DS are nothing new.
8279680	8283360	There was the ambassador program and we did have some games that came out on that. If
8283360	8288640	you were a 3DS early adopter, you got some pretty fucking good Game Boy advanced games,
8288640	8292640	all things considered. Like there was the Metroid, um, not zero mission, but the other
8292640	8299560	one, Metroid fusion. There was, uh, the super Mario brothers, uh, super Mario world to Yoshi's
8299560	8306480	adventure remake, which I think was advanced for, I can't, I've lost count. Um, but yeah,
8306480	8309480	you had a lot of those games, fire emblem. There was a lot of good stuff that was a part
8309480	8316040	of the ambassador program. Well, um, apparently Nintendo Australia's eShop software page was
8316040	8321960	recently updated and it added a Game Boy advanced category to the virtual console spread. The
8321960	8327720	only title that was listed there was Dr. Mario. Yes. In the classic NES version. That's kind
8327720	8331840	of weird though, because like, why would they put that there instead of just a regular NES
8331840	8336180	game? Could it have been the Game Boy advanced version of the Nintendo game, which seems
8336180	8341520	really redundant? I don't know, but there it is. Um, it's possible that, uh, Nintendo
8341520	8346440	Australia may have, uh, spilled the beans on that. I mean, it makes sense. Although
8346440	8351520	didn't they say at one point, these games will never come out for sale. And I think
8351520	8356840	we all sat here going, yeah, sure. Yeah, right. They will come out for sale at some point,
8356840	8361080	but it's not like there aren't a lot of advanced games that are worth coming out on virtual
8361080	8365160	console again. I mean, the Game Boy advances is aging pretty quick here. We're at 10 years
8365160	8369720	ago at this point. So I remember when I bought my advance, I was, I was still back in the
8369720	8373800	days when I was first getting into DDR. So, uh, systems kind of old, there's still a lot
8373800	8382280	of great games that I think would sell for 3DS. So that's that. Just a few more news
8382280	8386620	stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag and soon the Skype line at 1 877 game
8386620	8392040	O L R or our username on Skype. If you want to add us orange lounge radio, all one word,
8392040	8399240	but first Alan, he's given me all the valve stories today. I know you're a fan. Yes. Black
8399240	8404880	Mesa, McPixel and others, uh, are the first to pass through their green light as steam's
8404880	8410520	green light program. It's basically a indie developers pay a one time fee to kind of keep
8410520	8413860	the amount of crap submissions down. That was a story we covered last week to have their
8413860	8418920	game be say, Hey, we want to distribute this on steam please. Cause it's pretty much the
8418920	8424640	best digital platform for buying games in existence right now. So vote for our game
8424640	8430080	and the 10 titles that have passed the gauntlet and gotten the amount of votes that they needed
8430080	8437920	was Black Mesa Source, Cry of Fear, Dream, Heroes and Generals, Kenshi, McPixel, No More
8437920	8445000	Room in Hell, Project Zomboid, Routine, and finally a game called Towns. These games will
8445000	8450240	be released independently in the months ahead as they are in varying stages of completion.
8450240	8456320	A valid spokesman has said, um, I actually checked for Ospher in chat. Black Mesa Source
8456320	8461240	is not yet on steam green light because a big reason for that could be because the last
8461240	8467760	stage of it, like the last 10% of the game Zen isn't in it yet. And this is pure speculation
8467760	8473040	on my part, but it could be that because the game, obviously the game is being downloaded
8473040	8476880	everywhere on their actual website. Um, it could be that valve could be like, you've
8476880	8481400	already said that this game isn't completely done. So however long that takes. But, um,
8481400	8486600	yeah, some of these games should start appearing and be, be searchable through the steam store.
8486600	8491920	These are the first 10 to make it. Fantastic. Well, congrats to those games. Now we need
8491920	8497360	to convince Aaron to put bungee ferret tossing as a part of this project green light thing
8497360	8502000	so we can get bungee ferret tossing on steam. It's too bad that the Xbox indie games don't
8502000	8507360	support connect. It is too bad, isn't it? Cause we could actually toss, could have been
8507360	8510360	an Easter egg in the game, except I don't think, I don't think Aaron wants to put porn
8510360	8517920	in his game. So sadly, uh, but we'll take what we can get. Uh, also I wanted to say,
8517920	8521200	I just wanted to put a shout out out there. Um, we already talked about how bungee ferret
8521200	8525560	tossing is coming out on Monday. Apparently you can get the soundtrack is out now for
8525560	8530320	six bucks on Amazon. Just search for it. Bungee ferret tossing. I can't believe that some
8530320	8534600	silly idea here on orange lounge radio is now turning into a media empire, but there
8534600	8540520	is an official soundtrack for six bucks. It looks like Dan period is the guy that wrote
8540520	8544000	do do we want to play like a little snippet of some of the music from a bungee ferret
8544000	8555760	tossing here? Here's a song called jungle war. That sounds like a good title. That sounds
8555760	8560440	like a bungee tail or excuse me, a ferret tail whipping really quick. Say who's dogs
8560440	8573920	barking. That's good though. That's very, very professional. Love it. Like the eighties
8573920	8577800	power guitar in there. So you can check that out on amazon.com right now. Thank you for
8577800	8582480	giving me an excuse to somehow inadvertently plug bungee ferret tossing again. But yes,
8582480	8591360	project green light. Congrats to those developers. Yes. Oh, um, weird. Excuse me. Um, steams.
8591360	8596880	What's it called? The thing that you can picture big picture. Yeah. I clicked on that and it
8596880	8602320	made my monitor like not spaz out or anything, but it made my system run really slow. And
8602320	8606040	then it's like, oh, you're supposed to hook this up to your TV. That's for people that
8606040	8609920	like Dan and Jamie have their computer on their TVs. They can watch youtubes and stuff.
8609920	8615600	Yeah. But my TV already has an HDMI on it. So why wouldn't I just run an HDMI from my
8615600	8619720	PC to the TV? That's what they want you to do. That's what they want you to do. But it's,
8619720	8623000	it makes it so that you're not like windows cause it looks different on a TV. It's like
8623000	8628120	all full screen basically. Like it looks more like a console, I guess is the trick. Got
8628120	8633880	it. Whatever. It's optional, right? Yeah. So steams just releasing either. They're just
8633880	8639000	going crazy cause they've got the workshop for mods. That was the first thing that was
8639000	8645040	a couple months ago for Skyrim. Green light and now big picture. It's only a play. I still
8645040	8650000	need to play Skyrim on PC. Have yes, you do have portal two on PC. They still need to
8650000	8655560	play with. Yes, you do. I got Dawn guard like two weeks ago or basically yeah, about two
8655560	8658880	weeks ago and I haven't really played any of the new content yet. It just got me to
8658880	8662920	load up Skyrim after taking a couple months. I love my Xbox three 60 copy to my sister
8662920	8666940	because she wanted to play it and she's, she's a fan of glitchy games. I mean she played
8666940	8675480	driver three forever. So yeah, Skyrim's really glitchy. All right, let's move on. Um, so
8675480	8680600	yet another streaming service for video games and yet another streaming service for video
8680600	8685480	games with a really fucking weird name. I mean seriously, what is it with these? I mean,
8685480	8692920	okay, on life, not so bad, but like guy, Kai and shit like that. Uh, a golly. I mean, what
8692920	8697120	the fuck is a golly? All the good donate. Domain names are talking at this point. I'm
8697120	8702640	going to give you, this is free right here. Free for whoever, you know, here's it. First
8702640	8708040	of the size of name their company. This you want to get in the people's faces. You name
8708040	8715800	your company or my good.
8715800	8726920	That's name recognition streaming. Exactly. Um, so I golly, uh, apparently they've announced
8726920	8731160	a partnership with Microsoft and they're going to bring a cloud streaming games to windows
8731160	8738560	eight. And of course it's gonna tie in with Microsoft's windows as your cloud platform.
8738560	8751640	Um, they promised popular AAA games will be playable within the coming months and they
8751640	8757160	didn't really say how it's going to work with a tablet, but I guess virtual D pads or some
8757160	8768520	garbage. Yay. Ermahgerd, VIRG, VIRG network. All right. It doesn't have the same ring to
8768520	8772280	it. Uh, let's do one more story here before we get to the mailbag and see what people
8772280	8778440	are emailing us and Ermahgerding about tonight. Um, Ikaruga creator is making a new game.
8778440	8782720	Yay. Cause who doesn't love Ikaruga unless you like hate shooters. I don't know what
8782720	8790240	to tell you in that case. Um, Hiroshi Yuichi is going to release a new shooter called Kokuga.
8790240	8797120	It's for the three D S and the trailer is now out. So if you are an Ikaruga fan might
8797120	8801600	be time to get a three D S cause this is what awaits you there. It looks, um, a lot more
8801600	8806040	of the, um, polygon as kind of three D graphics going into this kind of getting some Raiden
8806040	8812560	vibes. Yeah. A little bit, a little bit there. Bullet hell. Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.
8812560	8818480	I bet that will make you barf in three D should be fun. Little, uh, it looks like little chips
8818480	8822960	at the bottom there. Remaining cards. Oh yeah. Like little, it looks like little play cards
8822960	8826600	on the bottom screen that you can throw into the game and then you have a remaining card
8826600	8832160	counter. That's kind of a neat little mechanic. It's like making, mixing poker and Ikaruga.
8832160	8840440	Very cool. Ikaruga. Ikaruga. All right, let's go to the mailbag mailbag at orange lounge
8840440	8851200	radio.com. Sorry, I have to say this. Uh, mm two K says in chat or McGird is patent
8851200	8857260	to just like gamer. Oh my God. Somebody needs to trademark or McGird and then Sue the entirety
8857260	8863200	of the internet for infringing on that trademark. Amazing idea. Mm two K should do that right
8863200	8868320	now. All right, moving on. Uh, mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com dark soccer will
8868320	8871680	dive into the mailbag every week and find some emails to read for you all. But since
8871680	8876860	she's not here, Alan has stolen her hazmat suit so that he can walk in the mailbag and
8876860	8880620	find some email for you. I'm reading this first email and it, it looks, it sounds like
8880620	8885320	it's talking about a cheat in mass effect three multiplayer. Should I read this? It
8885320	8890680	tells you how to cheat. Um, you can leave that part out if you want. Okay. First off,
8890680	8896240	I want to, okay, this email, sorry, is from mm two K. First off, I want to apologize if
8896240	8900360	this is the second email you got for me. I originally went to the OLR site to send, but
8900360	8903640	the character limitations made it seem like a line of, uh, like a bunch of babble. Here's
8903640	8910200	my question for Rob and dark Sakura. Uh, multiplayer is a rather tough on the game and I had problems
8910200	8916280	surviving past bronze difficulty. And, um, this is me now, uh, inserting this, this is
8916280	8921760	talking about mass effect. Then some cool people showed me the, uh, striker assault
8921760	8925600	rifle cheat. This allows you to convert this weapons, ammo to Cobra missiles resulting
8925600	8931280	in one hit kills with each shot. That's cheating. Not to piss off fellow gamers. I make sure
8931280	8935040	that I only use this cheat when it's past way for when other players are in trouble
8935040	8938800	and I'm the only one left in a wave or all players are at the character level cap of
8938800	8942880	20 therefore meaning I'm not robbing any one of experience points. However, in about half
8942880	8946480	of the games I played recently, people are getting pissed, kicking me off, kicking me
8946480	8951680	off the team after the game and getting rabies and getting all rabies like over the mic.
8951680	8956080	Most of the complaints are, fuck you jerk. How, how did you do that? Oh my God, why did
8956080	8961780	you do that? I see their shrieks as mindless chest pounding over game ranking, which again
8961780	8965360	means jack shed. If you're all at the level cap, if we win, we all get the same amount
8965360	8969760	of cash. To me, we should be happy. I'm assisting them to win. To me, they should be happy.
8969760	8973060	I'm assisting them to win. I also play the harder levels as a Turian soldier without
8973060	8979000	the cheat. And I tell you 80 85% of the people who play these levels have no idea what WTF
8979000	8982560	they're doing anyway. Winning isn't everything, but if it's the difference between us wasting
8982560	8986560	power ups to die at wave three and only get 20,000 credits or completing the playthrough
8986560	8991360	and getting 75 to 240,000 credits, God, that must be how much you get for a platinum. That's
8991360	8995520	crazy. I would be glad that someone was a board that could help when we were all about
8995520	9000800	to die as I was when I met the perfect person who showed me the glitch. Thoughts? Am I thinking
9000800	9008520	like the gaming jackass that many are claiming or do I have a fair point? PS, you and Bobby
9008520	9014080	show is the freaking best. I think you should take over G four, turn it into a 24 hour radio
9014080	9022280	show network and make Blair herder, AKA Ross from friends. That's David Schwimmer. So I
9022280	9025600	don't get that reference. I think that was a character. Oh, I don't know. And bring you
9025600	9031280	smoothies and cheese. It's all day. That reference is lost on me, but thank you. Nonetheless,
9031280	9034440	let's get back to the question at hand about the whole Mass Effect three cheat. Here's
9034440	9038600	the problem. You may think you're trying to do a good thing by helping these people out
9038600	9043200	of trouble, but the problem with what you're doing and, you know, you're in your mind,
9043200	9046920	you think you're doing a good thing and it's like, oh, hey, I'm saving you from, you know,
9046920	9050300	death and losing all these credits. You have to remember you're making a big assumption
9050300	9055080	here that all these people that you're playing with are only in it for the credits. Some
9055080	9060700	people are in it for the challenge. Some people are very anti cheating. And I tend to notice
9060700	9064880	that type of mentality usually comes when you're very passionate about a series like
9064880	9070200	Mass Effect fans tend to be. Some people feel like, I don't want you to cheat because I
9070200	9075200	don't want to be associated with you so that if BioWare catches you and you get banned,
9075200	9080440	I get banned too. I don't want to be around that shit. So that's, that's the problem with
9080440	9083700	what you're doing is that you're bringing other people into it who didn't consent to
9083700	9089160	do that. Yeah. And that, and also there is a money element to this because if you have
9089160	9092760	it, because I have my two or three favorite classes that I try to keep at level 20 when
9092760	9096400	I want to try and do silvers and golds. The reason why I play silvers and golds at level
9096400	9100480	20 is because I want credits so I can buy the upgrade packs to unlock the new characters
9100480	9105200	and the weapon upgrades and blah, blah, blah. I could also spend five bucks on BioWare's
9105200	9112760	website and get a pack of like 300 BioWare points and then manually buy those with cash.
9112760	9115120	Don't know why you do that, but I'm sure there are tons of people that have spent hundreds
9115120	9122180	of dollars when you're helping people farm credits in that way. Like if you were to do
9122180	9127400	that in Firebase, why with the Geth and I'm getting way too technical in the game, you're
9127400	9132680	kind of screen over the people that are paying money. Does that make sense for those packs?
9132680	9137720	So you may be well intentioned, but not everybody really understands that. So here's my advice
9137720	9142000	to you. If that's the way you want to play and keep in mind, you're taking a risk. If
9142000	9145960	BioWare catches you exploiting too many credits that way, you don't know what's going to happen.
9145960	9151160	So use caution. That's all I'm going to say. Do it with a consenting audience. Only do
9151160	9156080	that stuff with your friends, with the people that you know online. You mentioned in your
9156080	9160240	email that somebody showed you how to do that. Well, that would have been a great person
9160240	9164000	that you may, you know, this is probably one of those things in retrospect, but maybe that
9164000	9167680	would have been a great person to add to your friends list so you can play the game with
9167680	9171920	them that way later on. I mean, that's what meeting strangers online is all about. Finding
9171920	9175320	the ones that you want to play with again. In a way, I can't believe I'm going to say
9175320	9180280	take inspiration in your gaming from Loki, but Loki's on the right track when he talks
9180280	9185440	about his Grand Theft Auto 4 matches that they cheat like hell in those matches, but
9185440	9190240	it's all internal. It's all people that know each other. It's all, you know, when Loki,
9190240	9193520	correct me if I'm wrong, when you go on Xbox live and play against strangers, you don't
9193520	9198580	cheat. You play it straight up. No, we don't. Well, we don't play those mods anymore anyways,
9198580	9201260	but yeah, when we were playing those mods, we only played against each other cause we
9201260	9205520	all have the same mods and it was all modding new weapons that were all balanced. It wasn't
9205520	9210960	so that we could, you know, cheat other people. It was just, look at all these crazy fucking
9210960	9213800	weapons that we have and we're going to shoot each other with them.
9213800	9218480	All right. And so, so I guess the moral of the story, and I'll end with this long story
9218480	9224840	short too late, make it like monopoly. Set the house rules in advance. Is there going
9224840	9230480	to be a jackpot when you land on free parking, you know, to set all those house rules. Do
9230480	9235840	people really go to jail if they roll three doubles in a row, set the house rules in advance.
9235840	9240120	And if you're going to play with strangers, then the house rules have already been set.
9240120	9242080	There are no house rules. You have to play by Bioware.
9242080	9246960	You just say, Hey, Hey, uh, can I, can I rocket glitch this bros? Hey, can I rock a glitch?
9246960	9251800	And if they're like, no fuck off, then maybe that's not the round for you.
9251800	9256800	MM2K is actually in our chat tonight and wanted to give a follow up to the email. By the way,
9256800	9262560	the person that showed me got banned. So I stopped the day after I sent that email. Sorry
9262560	9268160	for the babble. So like we meant before I knew that we kind of warned you, if you get
9268160	9271200	caught, you'll be the one that gets banned. And the people don't want to be associated
9271200	9274800	with you. You know what, despite the fact that that's already resolved situation, I
9274800	9278000	thought it was a good thing to talk about. So no worries. I'm sure there's plenty of
9278000	9282800	other games and communities where something like this goes on. All right.
9282800	9290720	All right. And next email is from Catastrophic Moggy. Not sure I've heard this reader before
9290720	9295920	or listener. Uh, O R no doubt. You've already got the classic game of the week covered,
9295920	9299360	but if you don't mind, I'd like to add my own given that this game will likely be unheard
9299360	9304320	of. And then he's got a, they've got a gameplay link. I will bring that up here while you
9304320	9311320	start to read it on YouTube school days for the ZX spectrum or ZX spectrum. If you're
9311320	9316240	in the UK, uh, you play as a school boy named Eric though you could change the name if you
9316240	9321380	wanted to. And your goal is to get the combination to the safe that holds your permanent record.
9321380	9324940	To get the combination, you have to grab or shoot these little shields scattered around
9324940	9329780	the school with your catapult. It's not as easy as it sounds. Some you can't reach without
9329780	9334600	knocking over your classmates to get a, to get a boost so you can jump higher or deflect
9334600	9339440	shots off of a teacher's head. I'm wondering if catapult is a British is British for us
9339440	9343960	slingshot. That guy just shot a teacher in the back of the head with a slingshot. Okay.
9343960	9348160	Oh my God. That's so would. Okay. Think about this bite. And I don't know if that's where
9348160	9352880	the email is about to going, but like think about trying to put out a game like that in
9352880	9357200	today's world. Not going to happen. You had to do this without being caught too often
9357200	9362980	or missing too many lessons or you'd be given lines, uh, get too many and you may be excluded.
9362980	9368120	I imagine that's expelled. You're also, uh, you've also got the other kids to deal with,
9368120	9373400	particularly the bully who is trying to get you into trouble and the SWAT S W O T who
9373400	9378400	runs to the teachers whenever he sees you do anything wrong, like a narc or a snitch,
9378400	9383140	I guess for anyone interested in the game. There was a fan made remake release called
9383140	9388800	class of 99 class K with improved graphics and sound. I have no idea if it works on Vista
9388800	9394920	or wind seven though, and then only to that P S I'm pissed at the moment because predictably
9394920	9400280	persona for arena has been delayed in Europe to God knows when so much for it coming out
9400280	9405480	in all territories and quick succession. My F you of the week is region locking. Oh God.
9405480	9409560	And that's the PSI cause I was just about to say, Oh, we'll just get the import. The
9409560	9413920	U S one, the PS three is regional region free. Oops. That was the game that they region locked
9413920	9417680	and there was all the controversy around that. Sorry for the background noise. I'm still,
9417680	9423580	I've got this school days movie still running there in the background. Interesting. Yeah.
9423580	9428640	You wouldn't see that today. That's for sure. I'm sorry to hear about the persona for delay
9428640	9430680	though. Sucks.
9430680	9443440	Hold on. I think that was it. Did you get it? No, there's, there's one more email. It's
9443440	9447800	last week's episode was weird because a lot of the content that was discussed, I don't
9447800	9452740	want to get into it. This email kind of addresses that. Let me look at it real quick. I mean,
9452740	9465240	I think we need to read. What's wrong with this. This is funny. Okay. And are we looking
9465240	9470880	at the same one? The one from Ospher? Yeah. Okay. This is fine. Okay. Dear Dr. Kerr, I
9470880	9475600	think it's in your best interest to not take Rob's advice. Diving headfirst into the mailbag
9475600	9480620	is a horrible idea as you never know how deep or shallow in, uh, in emails it will be. I
9480620	9484360	would recommend stepping in slowly to test the depth. Bring Daris along with you for
9484360	9491380	sure as he can calibrate the mailbag afterwards. You read way too much. What was the controversy
9491380	9499440	you saw in that email? I didn't see your name. I saw Dan's. I said, Oh, you shouldn't take
9499440	9505120	advice. That's, that's a cute little pun on the, when I always say dark soccer dives into
9505120	9510200	the mailbag head first way to make a funny joke. Awkward. I know. Womp, womp. This is
9510200	9517560	why you don't get invited to parties, Alan. Yeah. And he asked for, was like, Ooh, who's
9517560	9519920	going to read my email? And I'm like, it's going to be me. And then I just pissed all
9519920	9528280	over it. So Austin, I'm very sorry. This is, this is for Alan reading emails. That's fine.
9528280	9532040	Why would I read your name as dance? Why? Yeah. Why? That's what I want to know. Why
9532040	9537920	did you mean Rob and Dan don't even have same letters in common. You know what you saw?
9537920	9542080	You saw Garris is Dan cause Jamie always talks about how Garris kind of reminds her of Dan,
9542080	9548320	which is like kind of cute in a really weird way. We need to get her that moe, that moe
9548320	9553040	cuddle pillow for her of Garris. And then Dan will be like that. I don't want that in
9553040	9561320	my house. That's it for mailbag. Good job reading the mailbag tonight. Well, if you
9561320	9568360	do a really bad job at something, then people will ask you to not do it anymore. So is that
9568360	9575020	a hint? Is that a hint? All right. That's it for the mailbag mailbag at orange launch
9575020	9579560	radio.com. Just a couple more news stories for you guys. Before we get to the Skype line
9579560	9584000	at one eight seven seven game OLR, we'll get some Twitter topics in there as well. But
9584000	9589000	first, a couple quick stories. Loki. I thought first we had the FUs of the week. Oh shit.
9589000	9594280	You're right. FU to me for getting the FUs of the week. Well, you know what? Alan threw
9594280	9595920	off my wrist.
9595920	9618920	Uh, so I guess FU to FedEx for not just losing one pallet of games, but two different pallets
9618920	9626120	of the same game. I'm sure we'll get a lot of disappointed Borderlands 2 fans and also
9626120	9629840	old people driving on the freeway. They're driving like 30 miles an hour. What the fuck?
9629840	9636320	I mean, seriously, 30 miles an hour on the freeway. Thanks. Two missing pallets of a
9636320	9641480	top tier game. That shuts on eBay. Someone lifted that off a truck. No, it was just mis-routed.
9641480	9646120	Oh, OK. How convenient. Oh, so that they're there somewhere. They're just not where they
9646120	9650640	apparently sold to people. They apparently flunked geography and thought that Oklahoma
9650640	9656480	City was Memphis. Oh, I make that mistake all the time. Yeah. So, so they, they shipped
9656480	9661600	it to Memphis and oh, hey, shit, there's, this is an Oklahoma City. Elvis's mansion's
9661600	9668800	in Oklahoma City, right? Or Indianapolis instead of, you know, Perrysburg, Ohio. Alan, do you
9668800	9675120	have any FUs of the week you want to share? Very minor in first world, but we bought Juice
9675120	9679280	at Target and orange juice is like really good. And we got two cartons of it. And apparently
9679280	9683000	we just left it on the counter in the bag and fucking walked away and left and got into
9683000	9686320	the car and drove away. Everybody's done that shit at some point in their life. Everybody's
9686320	9690000	done that shit. But now because it happened, but now we don't have, but yeah, now it happened
9690000	9694760	and like, I really are no reason I want orange juice at nine o'clock at night because we
9694760	9699200	forgot it. Do you need me to go to Safemart and get you some orange juice? So FU to just,
9699200	9703520	I guess, walking away from a counter and leaving behind things that you paid for, even if it's
9703520	9708360	just a dollar fifty orange juice. But then it's like, what else did we forget? What else
9708360	9715360	did we forget? Anyhow, one other FU of the week would be for me, although I don't have
9715360	9723560	a whole lot, FU to a lack of motivation. I've not been very good at going to the gym like
9723560	9729440	I need to be. So FU to me needing to get into shape. But FU to just the fact I've been so
9729440	9734440	busy too. I mean, it's not like I'm having a gun held to my head. I don't have to be
9734440	9741160	doing the things I'm doing, but still it's keeping me very busy. But I'm able to work
9741160	9746760	in some good stuff and I know there'll be a good payoff. All right, before we get into
9746760	9752960	the next story, I want to say FU to one other thing as well. And that is the fact that we
9752960	9759540	got so tied up in that WU conversation earlier in the show, I didn't get to embarrass Loki
9759540	9765160	with the fact that his birthday was this past week. Oh yeah. On September 11th. It's not
9765160	9769960	a hard day to, or it's an easy day to remember. I guess I'll put it that way. Uh, would you
9769960	9775440	end up doing for your birthday? Uh, went to work and then I went and saw The Expendables
9775440	9780280	2 afterwards. Well, what a manly way to spend a birthday. And to be honest, The Expendables
9780280	9784840	2 was better than the first movie. It was actually entertaining. Yeah, but Chuck Norris
9784840	9788840	is in it. Chuck Norris is awesome. My brother saw and said it was awesome, but my brother's
9788840	9793680	also like 18. Chuck Norris was awesome though. Cause like his character is like this lone
9793680	9798720	wolf or whatever. He just comes in. It's like, yeah, I just murdered everybody cause I'm
9798720	9804520	Chuck Norris and that's what the fuck I do. Now FU to the fact that I'm having to have
9804520	9809520	listeners remind me about my life. Uh, Tiger Claw says, don't you mean FU to that table
9809520	9814160	that hit you in the face? Yes. FU to the table that hit me in the face. But anyhow, let's
9814160	9818220	go back to Loki. So it was your birthday this past week. So Alan and I wanted to say happy
9818220	9822840	birthday. Give you something to open there. Open on air there. So a little bit of, oops,
9822840	9828060	hold on, let me put this down. It's just a card. It's probably one of the worst wrapping
9828060	9837480	jobs I've ever done, but we're boys. We don't wrap gifts and we recycled. Look on the other
9837480	9845400	side. Look on the, it is a Skylanders portal keeper where he can keep all his little Skylanders
9845400	9850440	dolls and all your Skylanders toys. You can open it and you might find something a little
9850440	9856480	more useful inside. Skylanders. I hope it's more Skylanders. Oh sweet. 600 point guard.
9856480	9861120	There you go. Something a little more useful. I figured that, you know, it's cute that Josh
9861120	9865120	can put stuff in it when he's old enough to. Well he does need a toolbox cause he's got
9865120	9871360	like some frou frou, um, like flowery boxes, keeping his tools in there. There you go.
9871360	9875040	So we figured even though you might not actually put portals in there, it's actually the perfect
9875040	9879240	size for like a little lunch or something. So figured out another lunchbox. Now you have
9879240	9884360	to carry around a Skylanders purse. I originally joked that we should just get you one of the
9884360	9890240	figures, but I'm like, I had some of the figures actually for awhile cause I was selling them
9890240	9897760	this way. There used to be a gray market for Skylanders and they did really fast. All right,
9897760	9900920	I'll get it. The chatters are demanding a picture, so I'll get one of those really quick
9900920	9906520	and get it up on orange.com. I'll grab the iPad. Um, Misty also says, quit being sexist
9906520	9911280	in our chat room. I can't wrap presents for shit either. Thank fuck for gift bags. I normally
9911280	9917680	don't wrap presents. I apologize. You're absolutely right. But uh, thank thank fuck for gift bags
9917680	9923360	is absolutely right as well. So did not mean to stereotype. I apologize. I appreciate it.
9923360	9929040	Thank you. Cards. Funny too. You're welcome. Yeah, the cards funny too. All right. Oh yeah.
9929040	9932120	We're going to have to wait for him to do the car cause he has the next story. Birthday
9932120	9938720	bad cake. Good. And it has a fat cat on it. Yeah, my fat cat. Well, she's not fat, but
9938720	9943520	she threw up last night again. Oh, she's a hairball. That was, Oh my God. That was the
9943520	9946560	first card I was looking at was a cat on it saying, I'm getting all choked up because
9946560	9949640	it's your birthday. And then he opened it up and it says, Oh, just kidding. It's a hairball.
9949640	9955760	Oh, if I'd known your story. Oh well. Yeah. All right. So, um, you know, of course Australia's
9955760	9963640	got the brand new R 18 plus, um, rating for their, uh, game ratings. Of course. Um, they
9963640	9968400	have guidelines for the classification and it should be no surprise like anything that's
9968400	9975480	rated out there. They're being stricter on games than any other form of media. And of
9975480	9981320	course, you know, it says given the opposition to the introduction of the R 18 plus category
9981320	9985360	from a vocal yet unrepresentative section of the community, along with largely conservative
9985360	9990880	group of attorneys, uh, dash generals, it is no surprise that the new guidelines hold
9990880	9994680	video games to a higher standard across a number of categories compared to film and
9994680	10000000	what originally existed for video games. As we have previously stated, we are concerned
10000000	10007800	and with the acknowledgement of the are in the guidelines that the interactive, uh, interactivity
10007800	10013240	has a greater impact on the players. Despite the federal attorney general's pub office
10013240	10018240	publishing and a literature review in September, 2010 that found no evidence to support these
10018240	10024060	claims. There will be continued debate about whether the interactivity of video games has
10024060	10029280	a greater impact than other forms of media. And we will continue to refer to the lack
10029280	10033460	of evidence to support these claims. And I agree. I mean, it's stupid that, you know,
10033460	10036760	just because you can interact with stuff, I mean, watching videos and stuff, people
10036760	10043040	still get, you know, very worked up, I guess about stuff just because I can push a button
10043040	10049520	to like punch somebody in the face or something doesn't mean that's gonna make me more violent.
10049520	10053520	I think it'd make me less violent because, you know, if, if like there's an annoying
10053520	10057120	character in a movie and I want to punch him in the face, you know, that makes me want
10057120	10060560	to punch somebody in the face. Whereas if I have the ability to punch him in the face
10060560	10064560	in the game, then I may not have that urge to punch him in the, or somebody in the face
10064560	10073560	because, well, I've taken out my aggression. Well, at least they can have the, uh, games
10073560	10079280	out there in Australia that were banned previously. I mean, at least there's that. So whatever.
10079280	10086080	All right. I'm trying to remember, we have a secret email you use to upload these pictures
10086080	10090040	to, and I can't remember what it is because remember our site got hella spammed once,
10090040	10095200	so we changed it and I don't remember the address. Jamie has it saved on her phone.
10095200	10102240	Crap. I have a sent items folder. Can it be piped to the O L R tumbler? Can I, cause I
10102240	10106320	think Ramna Ramna is on. He does that. Can I search for email? How would I search for
10106320	10112400	emails that I sent to an orange launch video.com address? He sent you go and get your sent
10112400	10117240	items. Yeah. Go into your sent folder and then do the search from, I know it's live
10117240	10121120	radio, but I need tips on how to use my mail back. Oh no, it's not orange launch radio
10121120	10127280	because they go to flicker. That's the problem. Is that it? I bet it's this. Don't say that
10127280	10135440	on air, but I think this is it. Yes. Yes. That's it. Okay. I found it. Yay. Just host
10135440	10140520	fail. Cause I forgot the correct that they went to flicker and not to orange launch radio.com.
10140520	10148360	Great live radio, huh? One more story before we open up the Skype line. And that is about
10148360	10153040	a new way to sell indie games. It's called the indie game stand. It's going to start
10153040	10158040	on September 26th and it's, um, getting its inspiration from the humble bundle as well
10158040	10162120	as woot. That's a site I like, I like woot. You can get some good deals there. Although
10162120	10166840	I have yet to ever get a bag of crap on woot, but I know some people that live for bags
10166840	10172580	of crap on woot. Um, indie game stand will be a place that will sell a new indie game
10172580	10179860	every four days for a pay what you want fee. That's a pretty bold way to do it. It's going
10179860	10186560	to launch September 26th. Um, a lot of steam and desura keys will be available on the game.
10186560	10191600	10% of whatever you do will benefit a charity of the developer's choice. More than 50 indie
10191600	10196880	developers are signed on to this right now. Spider web software, cypher prime, digital
10196880	10202040	eel, magical time beam and so on and so on. If you create an account before September
10202040	10208320	26th, you will get the platformer Chester for free. Indie game stand.com. That's pretty
10208320	10213520	cool. Uh, I like the whole charity aspect to that as well. It's a pretty bold to do
10213520	10221560	pay what you want. I'm surprised there's no minimum whatsoever. That's a wow. One penny,
10221560	10227800	one penny. I hope, but I mean the indie game bundles do very well, but it's multiple. They
10227800	10233500	also offer incentive to have a minimum amount, which is good. And you know, if you're going
10233500	10237500	to rip off all those charities, you just kind of, you know, you, you do have the whole bad
10237500	10243240	karma thing going on there. All right, well I will be signing up for that site. Why not?
10243240	10247400	There's a free game involved. All right. Uh, one eight seven seven game O L R or our username
10247400	10254040	on Skype, orange lounge radio. The Skype line is open right now for you to send in your
10254040	10259040	phone calls. Meanwhile, it's going to take me a minute to get that picture up because
10259040	10266840	I need to bring up Twitters on my iPad here so we can talk about tweets to twitter.com
10266840	10272360	slash O L R. Uh, while I bring that up, Oh, nevermind. We're getting a call. I will do
10272360	10275580	last minute stories in a minute though, but first we have a call on the line higher on
10275580	10281560	orange lounge radio. Who's this? Who else but Rama. Hey Rama, what's on your mind, buddy?
10281560	10290280	Oh God. Yeah. Um, we, you know, all right. Yeah, let's do it. We, you know, what's up
10290280	10296640	the money for that. We, you is staying in my bank account because I'm not buying into
10296640	10303080	that bullshit. It's a pretty strong word. Bullshit. Cause first things first, the price
10303080	10307920	that they're asking for, I think is a little bit higher that people are willing to pay
10307920	10313880	for it. Another thing is they haven't even said the specs behind a Wii U. I haven't been
10313880	10319000	able to find anything in regards to it. There's only three games that they announced that
10319000	10323800	I want and truth be told, the console can stay on the shelf until those three games
10323800	10331200	come out, but they're not staying on the shelves. They're selling out the preorders. I can wait.
10331200	10337240	I'm a very patient person. What do you think it would take? What, what, what's missing
10337240	10342480	here? What would it take for you to say, you know what, I'm plunking the money down. Let's
10342480	10348960	do this. Pack a Mario game. Don't forget that whole Nintendo land stuff. Take it back to
10348960	10354680	the old school when the NES came with a Super Mario brothers, when super Nintendo came with
10354680	10358640	the Super Mario brothers game. Then they changed things around. Take it back to the old school.
10358640	10364440	What an awesome Mario title. That's what I'm looking at. Well, there is a Mario title.
10364440	10368840	Nintendo land doesn't count in my book. What about new Super Mario brothers Wii U or whatever
10368840	10372960	it's called? That's extra $60 and I don't know if you've noticed the price that they're
10372960	10378280	asking for the Wii U games brings me back to the days of Super Nintendo when games were
10378280	10386720	$69.99 to $79.99 a pop. Black Wolf in our chat room, you know he's, he's one ready to, uh,
10386720	10391080	challenge you on things once in a while. Black Wolf says, you're right. It's a little bit
10391080	10394280	higher than people are willing to pay for it. Hence why it's currently sold out of the
10394280	10400720	pre-orders. The price of the Wii U games brings me back to the days of the Xbox 360 and the
10400720	10406720	PlayStation three. Okay. You have to admit that's funny. I mean, the way I look at it,
10406720	10411280	the price, it kind of reminds me of the PS3 when it was so expensive because they're trying
10411280	10417160	to put the Blu-ray players in everybody's living room. There's a big difference between $2.99
10417160	10423400	and $5.99 as in half. I know, but I'm just saying that they're trying to get everyone
10423400	10429200	on the whole tablet thing, which is why the console is so expensive. And truth be told,
10429200	10433680	as much as I enjoy the features that the tablet's going to offer, I don't need it. Just give
10433680	10441760	me a Wii U, a pro controller, and that's it. That's all I really want. Well, I guess you
10441760	10450800	can't get that. Yeah, I know. And I see that. And the sad yet interesting yet funny part
10450800	10458280	is even on Nintendo's playing catch up with all of this, even if the Wii U falls flat
10458280	10464560	on their face, they will still come out on top because remember, except for the 3DS,
10464560	10469540	when they did a price cut on, except until recently, every console Nintendo put out has
10469540	10475920	made a profit off of. Except for, yeah, except for that whole 3DS price cut. That's a very
10475920	10482640	true point. I believe Microsoft and PlayStation took losses on theirs, so it is interesting.
10482640	10490560	Alright, well, what will you be playing this holiday season with no Wii U in your house?
10490560	10496080	I will be probably playing more games on my PS3, my 360, and the tablet that I just bought.
10496080	10500360	And if you're also wondering, my younger brother begged me, so I will be going with him to
10500360	10505140	Nintendo World, just as Luigi, during that weekend release of the Wii U, because evidently
10505140	10508280	I have nothing else better to do that weekend. So even though you're not going to buy the
10508280	10514600	Wii U, you're going to pull out Black Luigi just cause. Yeah, I have to shamelessly plug
10514600	10521120	out a couple of awesome sites that I helped work for. There you go, take some VOG flyers.
10521120	10525800	My business cards have VOG on them. Good, good, good. Alright, well, the chatters are
10525800	10529800	complaining because somehow you broke the stream, but here's my question, if the internet
10529800	10534800	just went down, why are we still connected on Skype? Because you're supported by my awesome
10534800	10540080	files connection. 66 megabits down and 33 megabits going up, can't beat that. Whatever,
10540080	10546320	it's not the size, it's how you use it. Alright, bye Rama, take care everybody. Peace, stay
10546320	10551800	fabulous. Yeah, always. Alright, 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio
10551800	10557280	if you want to give us a call. I did get that picture up. Loki, did you have any last minute
10557280	10561920	stories you wanted to do? Yeah, I was going to mention there was a few things, there was
10561920	10568320	an article I saw about the whole multiplayer, or the Just Cause 2 multiplayer project. They've
10568320	10574200	got up to 1800 people playing on one server. This is all fan done, you know, kind of talking
10574200	10578560	a little bit about Black Mesa stuff. I mean, multiplayer in a game that doesn't have multiplayer.
10578560	10586120	They have 1800 people on that god damn server. That's pretty impressive. And then also Black
10586120	10592560	Ops 2 is supposed to have a zombie campaign, like as in a single player campaign. That's
10592560	10598160	kind of neat. What else? Oh, I wanted to mention, I had actually, because I'm on Kickstarter
10598160	10604600	a lot, I tweeted about this. There's a game called Rhythm Destruction. It is a game that's
10604600	10612200	a cross between a shmup and a rhythm game, and features music by Kyle Ward. So if you
10612200	10618320	want to check that out, check out Rhythm Destruction on Kickstarter. They've got 18 days left.
10618320	10623960	Five bucks net to the game. So that's not bad. And that's including, I think, a Steam
10623960	10628480	key, and they're supposed to be bringing that out, I think, on Xbox Indie games as well.
10628480	10633640	It does support an Xbox 360 controller. It's also on Steam Greenlight. Again, 1877 Game
10633640	10637640	OLR, or a username on Skype, is Orange Launch Radio. If you want to give us a call, the
10637640	10645160	Skype line is open. That's all. Otherwise, I was responding to folks in the chat room,
10645160	10651280	apparently about the breaking of our stream, or what have you. Also, the Indie games, or
10651280	10655880	Indie Royale, they have a back to school bundle that's out with seven games. Pay what you
10655880	10665200	want. It includes Lunar Flight, Bunny Must Die, Chelsea, and the Seven Devils. Looks
10665200	10676440	like a Kleon, Flying Red Barrel, and Sequence. Also, Cute Things Dying Violently. And I guess
10676440	10682880	if you spend over $8 on the bundle, you'll also receive an 18-track Chiptune album, Bias.
10682880	10688800	All right, going to some tweet topics real quick. First, I want to say Bobby Blackwolf,
10688800	10694920	who sent us a tweet to a story about how LittleBigPlanetVita's street date was lifted. You're a jerk.
10694920	10701120	But yes, we already addressed this. The street date was lifted. Sony says retailers can begin
10701120	10704920	selling the game once they receive copies. Well, apparently my local Target didn't receive
10704920	10711040	copies. So this news is still false, as far as I'm concerned. Tigerclaw says in some tweets,
10711040	10715760	oh, this was really sad, and it does have a tie-in to the gaming world. I don't know
10715760	10718560	if, well, hopefully you heard about this. Hopefully you're not that shut off to the
10718560	10722920	world around you, but there was a U.S. Embassy attack that happened in Libya, and it took
10722920	10727240	the lives of a few people, and one of them was this huge Eve Online player. Like, apparently
10727240	10732460	he was really big in the Eve Online community. His nickname in the community was Vile Rat,
10732460	10737960	but he was known to his friends and family also as Sean Smith, and unfortunately he died
10737960	10746560	in that senseless attack this week that was very unfortunate. The Eve community is grieving
10746560	10752040	his loss. They're saying that over the years, Vile Rat rose to become one of the most well-known
10752040	10756880	and respected diplomats for one of the most powerful alliances in Eve. He was instrumental
10756880	10764240	in shaping the universe we all play in today. That was Chairman Mark Hurd on the CSM behalf.
10764240	10771720	That would be the Council of Stellar Management for Eve Online. There you go. Very sad. Very
10771720	10777560	sad. Moving on, another link from Tigerclaw. Consoles lacking in an important functionality
10777560	10781720	for MMOs. I want to see what this is about, because I don't know this one. So he sent
10781720	10788600	us a story from GameSpot that talks about... I don't want to see this. Give me this one
10788600	10795440	here. Sorry, my iPad's acting up and not showing me the right story there. Again, 1877 GameOLR
10795440	10800600	or a username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to call in. The VP of Publishing
10800600	10806000	at Wargaming.net says long approval times on consoles are restricting development of
10806000	10813280	MMOs. Otherwise, they would be there if manufacturers made it easier for developers. This is according
10813280	10825860	to Andre Jarnaso, who is at the World of Tanks World Championship Final. Oh, have you heard
10825860	10830500	about that MMO, World of Tanks? I've heard of that before, too. It's supposed to be like
10830500	10836120	massive. They were pimping it out over at the air show it went to, World of Tanks, and
10836120	10842000	there's also some other one, World of War, or World of Planes or something. Well, here's
10842000	10844840	a quote. Again, I'm reading this article. I'm sight-reading this article for the first
10844840	10849600	time because of the tweet we got from Tigerclaw. Consoles are a nice, attractive part of the
10849600	10854000	market because there are no really well-known MMOs there, and the install base is huge.
10854000	10858340	But as you know, the consoles are still lacking in important functionality. In MMOs, it is
10858340	10862560	very important for developers to have a fast reaction time for the service. If you're a
10862560	10866820	big company like Sony or Microsoft, then the approval time for release candidates is so,
10866820	10872720	so long, you can't change the game immediately. So, interesting. Kind of blaming the console
10872720	10879000	development cycle for the reason that MMOs aren't coming out. Hmm. Well, Square Enix
10879000	10883060	might have something to say about that when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV or Realm Reborn
10883060	10888480	or whatever you're calling it, which is still coming out later this year, as far as I know,
10888480	10893360	or at least it's going into testing. And Zaku in our chat room reminds us about Final Fantasy
10893360	10898640	XI. sg100matt, lastly on Twitter, wanted to remind us about the Bungee Ferret tossing
10898640	10904800	soundtrack, but I already plugged that earlier. So that's it for tweets. Any other last-minute
10904800	10913880	stories, Logie? I think that was it. All right. Well, Skyfline's not looking too popular tonight,
10913880	10918960	so unfortunately I'm going to go ahead and shut it down. If you think of something later
10918960	10922680	on, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com would be a great place to send an email to. Again,
10922680	10927680	that's mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. But the show's running a little long anyway because
10927680	10931360	we had a very long first half, so I think it's about time to wrap things up anyway.
10931360	10935240	Alan, thank you for being here tonight, as always. I appreciate you filling in, even
10935240	10939680	though you feel like you have to do it, apparently. I won't ask you next time then and see how
10939680	10944320	you feel. All right. Enjoy Black Mesa and all that. And do you have any final thoughts
10944320	10952800	for listeners tonight? Chicken. I would like to remind everybody that this show is free
10952800	10956860	and we don't ask for much, but please tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread
10956860	10959780	the word, word of mouth. If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell
10959780	10965880	a friend or two about the show and support independent podcasting, especially those shows
10965880	10971360	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. We love being a part of this indie network
10971360	10977040	that helps to bring the voices of gamers everywhere to you, even when they're being shy like they
10977040	10982840	are tonight. Rama's not shy though, at least we know that. Loki, thank you as always for
10982840	10989040	being here and enjoy the Skylanders purse. Thank you. And the points more importantly
10989040	10992800	that maybe can buy you something you'll actually be using. But any final thoughts for listeners
10992800	10999520	tonight? Play on our Minecraft server if you haven't done that yet, because it's awesome
10999520	11006280	and you should check it out. And then of course on Tuesday, play Borderlands 2 with me, because
11006280	11011340	I need someone to play with. And my final thought tonight is yes, play those games,
11011340	11015280	play World of Warcraft and listen to Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth,
11015280	11020080	or if you're extra for play Guild Wars 2 and still be on a Warcraft podcast. Listen to
11020080	11028200	that and also play Bungie Ferret Tossing tomorrow on Xbox Live Indie Games. Very exciting. That's
11028200	11031520	it guys, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you
11031520	11037080	as always for tuning in. Remember we will not be live Sunday next week, however a new
11037080	11041800	episode will still be playing on the feed. Podcast listeners, nothing will change for
11041800	11044440	you, you'll still have a new show next week because I'm out of town. So I just want to
11044440	11049760	remind everybody of that. We'll be back live in two weeks with another episode of Orange
11049760	11055840	Lounge Radio and that would be in two weeks, episode number 475. We're climbing on up,
11055840	11060440	moving on up. 500's almost here. Have a wonderful night everybody, take care.
