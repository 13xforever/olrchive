Tonight September 9th, 2012

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Rumors return about Valve creating a new console

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The homebrew scene may have cracked the Vita

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And one company finally decides to end their controversial DRM method

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 9th of 2012

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, it's September 9th, you know what that means

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Happy birthday to you

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Happy birthday to you

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Happy birthday dear Dreamcast

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Happy birthday to you

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, speed mix

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was gonna say it's a little early for my birthday

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're almost to your birthday though

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right, you've got, your birthday's just two days away, Techmaster Loki

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We've gone and screwed up the intro, everything is all amiss

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sorry, I can't talk yet

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's alright

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I've been shunned

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining us tonight

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hi, you can introduce Jamie first

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I've decided to do things different tonight

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Differently

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Also say hello to Grammar Master Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
She'll cut a bitch

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will cut a bitch

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't even care

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How are you doing?

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Um, yeah

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, great

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are live of course at The Voice of Geeks Network

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
VoGnetwork.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I gotta say, props to Bobby

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
6, 7 years now

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Had our shows back to back, he had an A plus show tonight

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He had an interview with Gearbox Software

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And some of the guys over there, it addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And then Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Must listen episode, loved it

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So check that out at VoGnetwork.com, it'll be posted later tonight

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I love when Bobby rants

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But hopefully you'll listen to our show, I know usually he's so nice and inviting

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And you know, oh we're gonna have the listeners on the show

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And he doesn't get angry very often, but that was

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bang bang

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A little bit, a little bit, alright

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He needs more flannel vests in order to hold out

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
With the game developer this week

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The O.L. Army have been asking for for quite some time

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We have the return surprise of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Say hello everybody to Dan

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dan is back tonight

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yo, what up?

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How you doing Dan?

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm doing good

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
For those who don't know Dan, I'm sorry

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Dan is Dark Soccer's husband

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or me

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's gonna be one of those

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shut up

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
See, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They are just gonna fight all night long, good times

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Just like any other day

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dan, since, how long has it been since you've been on the show?

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's been a good at least six months, right?

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know, it's been a while

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alright, well I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Between, you know, six months ago and now

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So tell us a little bit about your gaming history

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why do you love video games?

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I know you love video games, don't even try to lie

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I like to keep it special

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just show up once in a while, you know at random

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Nobody knows when I'm coming

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But the games, the games

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm like a ninja

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why do you like video games?

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's really having to think about this one

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They've just always been there

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Video games have always been there?

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even when Jamie's yelling at you?

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can turn to video games?

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No, no, I mean like, in the past

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's kinda how we met, kinda

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That and anime

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fan fiction

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Kind of more anime

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, what is your favorite video game of all time?

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I always like to ask guests on the show this

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a tough question

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's supposed to be a tough question

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Symphony of the Night

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's a damn good game

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Metal Gear Solid

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can go back a little bit further

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There's a couple other good ones

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Gunstar Heroes

114
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How do you feel about that?

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I like Gunstar Heroes a lot

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, we were off last week

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Strider

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We didn't have a show last week

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
At the various conventions going on everywhere

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What have you

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we were gone last week

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we missed some of last week's news

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm feeling pretty good

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was watching the trailer and I'm just like

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh my god, it's so long

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He changed his wallpaper

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They keep introducing all these people

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, okay, whatever

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, it's Solid Snake

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, Naked Snake

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, it's Snake

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Awesome

136
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He changed his wallpaper

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, I put my snake wallpaper back up

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or the big boss wallpaper

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah

140
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because big boss is a fucking gangster

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, it doesn't

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like this big intense face

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He's like looking out of the screen like

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Blue Screen of Death that you had before

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That one is awesome

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's old

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, but it's awesome

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But it's old

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But it's awesome

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My wallpaper is far better than yours, thank you

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't care

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
While we were off on break

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Was Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, no, no

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Excuse me!

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Excuse me!

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How dare I?

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, that's not worth it

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's Final Fantasy XIII III

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's be real

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's what it is

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But it's one of those weird Square Enix games

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where they're like

168
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, you know what?

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We're gonna put that subtitle first

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not gonna be a sub anymore

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It is a title

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Final Fantasy will take the back end

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We'll just step down for a second

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Guess we'll take the back end this time

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We're giving them the money shot

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Lightning's gonna explore the back door

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like to savor the last shot before

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Popping the heat sink

179
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're gonna start off the show tonight

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But I have a little bit something

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have something special to get into

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
At the top of the show tonight here

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm gonna play something for you guys

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And unfortunately you only get to see the audio

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or you only get to hear the audio of this

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cause it is a podcast

189
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm gonna give you guys the premiere

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Of the new Xbox One

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And the new Xbox One

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And the premiere of the new Xbox Live indie game

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is coming out very soon

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In fact the designer is gonna be on the line with us

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys

198
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
To talk a little more about this game

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And yes it is an OLR inspired game

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You might remember we used to come up with these little

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Dream games, things we wanted to see

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like what was the one we had the what-they-play.com snap

203
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Which was the, it's like Pokemon Snap

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Shouting fuck

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's like a really old reference to a news article

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
From like 2008

208
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like right now you probably just think that's insanity

209
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And it is, that's a fun thing

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What on the show is this saying

212
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't even remember what inspired it

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But we added the game

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing to the list

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And Aaron went

216
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And he actually made a game

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Called Bungee Ferret Tossing

218
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And it looks awesome

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Here's the debut trailer

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Here on Orange Lounge Radio

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you love flying a helicopter?

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah!

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah!

225
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you love blowing stuff up?

226
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah!

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you love terrorists?

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Awkward

229
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you love blowing up terrorists?

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah!

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you love flying a helicopter

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Swinging from a bungee cord

233
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because that's what you do in

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Which is good because now there's something in Arizona

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But it's bad because it's a terrorist base

242
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So armed only with the most advanced ferret weapons technology

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You must attempt to storm their desert base

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They'll come at you with guns

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Rockets

246
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
High powered rifles

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Higher engines

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And even insane laughter

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets

250
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Proximity ferrets

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Homing ferrets

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And even cluster ferrets

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Will it be enough?

254
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing also features two player co-op

256
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Free difficulty modes

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Full of survival and time attack modes

258
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And a great soundtrack

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Intense action

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Bullet dodging grills

261
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else

262
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's Bungee Ferret Tossing

263
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
On Xbox Live Indie Games

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Love, love, love, yyrgames.com for more information on that

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What do you think DarkSakura?

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I am pleased

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think that might have been your idea

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Are you happy with how that turned out?

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Quite

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And I named the dude, the last name

271
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's right

272
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I forgot what I named him

273
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's get Erin or YYR on the line right now

274
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
To talk a little more about Bungee Ferret Tossing

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you guys are probably thinking there at home

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Like, God, Orange Laundry

277
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top

278
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes we are

279
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Fuck yes we are

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Heck I'm thinking that, I'm at the show

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey Erin, you there?

283
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean, yes, yes I am

284
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Can I just start by saying

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I love you man

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I love you man, seriously

287
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I love you guys too

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're making our dream come true and I love it

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I figured I'd take the ball and run with it

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean, it sat on my plate for a while

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But hey, you guys told me to get on that

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so, eventually, I did

293
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well we are happy that you did

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So how long of a process did it take to grow

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well actually, let me back up a little bit

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because Bungee Ferret Tossing, it's almost done, right?

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like, we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now

299
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Where other game creators basically try it out

300
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Make sure it doesn't crash

301
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Make sure there's nothing objectionable

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And, you know, other things are accurate

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And then, you know, once they find that there's nothing wrong with it

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They pass it

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And once enough people pass it, it's approved

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And then once it's approved, I click a button and it's out

308
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me tell you something, there is some stuff up there right now

310
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I would not wish on any of you

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I play the game so you don't have to, yes

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But, yes, it's actually, I just checked before the show

313
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And it is 75% of the way through review

314
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And it's only been up there since Friday night

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So, this is going to happen very soon

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's all I'm saying

318
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, well, I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it

319
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with

321
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So, I'm just basically going to email everybody and be like

322
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hey, guess what's happening, like, right now, this game, it's coming out

323
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Here's the trailer, here's a press kit

324
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Do you want a review code?

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I'd like to do that before the game comes out

326
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So, basically, it means I'll probably be doing this, like, pretty soon

327
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Alright, I understand, yeah

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, then I'm going to push the button

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest

330
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway

331
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And, actually, this is kind of interesting

332
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have, this is kind of the answer to the Summer Games Arcade

334
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And all the winter, like, all the other promotions they do for the big boy games

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
From the big companies, right?

336
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So, I'm going to be right there with them

340
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So, that's actually kind of exciting

341
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way

342
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And also the fact that it's a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat, because this is too good

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And, by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room

345
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
live.vognetwork.com

346
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Now, we understand that Bungee Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter

347
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Will there be nudity in Bungee Ferret Tossing?

349
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And, of course, it's very fake and cartoony looking

351
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And, by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment

353
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's alright, I'll tell you what you need to know

355
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I mean, I'll tell you something

357
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous

358
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes

359
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Amazing, well, let's put boobs on the list

360
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to draw a line somewhere

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I want it to be as family friendly as possible

363
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You should have darkly colored chickens

364
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Huge dark chickens

365
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Dark chickens?

366
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, from another old joke, big black cock

367
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, stop

368
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We can do dark chickens, I'll put that on the list

369
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Alright, that'll work

370
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let me say this real quick, Jessica Harper

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
from Our Good Pals The Understanding Live

372
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Saturday nights here at VOG says

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me

374
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh my god

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you even think of that?

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I did not

377
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
We gotta be careful, because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation

378
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this, so

379
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Exploding ferrets

380
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This is a fantastic idea

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
At least now there will be something in Arizona, there you go

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, honestly, everyone I've ever talked to who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
has basically said the same thing to me

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's nothing there

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That is the whole reason why I put that in there

386
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Basically I'm acknowledging what they said

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Very nice, very nice

388
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Alright, so let me think, I gotta ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight

389
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I wanted to bring you on, because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here

390
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And even though you're the one that's ultimately gonna profit from it, I still think it's great

391
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It has my full blessing

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let me tell you something, if this game does really well

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I am totally gonna fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff

394
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like that is gonna be

395
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Beer works

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can pay us in beer, sir

397
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You got it, you got it

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Amazing, amazing

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway, so

400
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We're fun, we promise

401
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No exploding ferrets in person though, let's stay away from that

402
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay, so quickly

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't know, we could put a firecracker in one of the little ferrets

404
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
A little more about the game

405
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you

407
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But I can tell it has a great old arcade style look and feel to it

408
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
As all your previous games really have

409
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're very inspired by old school 80's arcade games, aren't you?

410
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Just arcade games and intense action packed games in general

411
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's the only kind of game I'm ever gonna make because that's what I'm most into

412
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So yeah, I don't know if it has an old looking vibe or what

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe because I'm not very good at it

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I wouldn't say it's old looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like

415
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If an Atari 2600 game was modern and that's certainly not a bad thing

416
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We killed hours and hours and hours of boom and stuff, you know what I mean?

417
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It has a Defender-ish look to it

418
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Actually you're not the first person that compares it to Defender

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Obviously you're not saving people, you're destroying them with ferrets

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes you should

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But yes, it has been compared to Defender before

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Nice, but it's a whole new, it's not a Defender clone at all

423
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a whole new, there's bungee cords

424
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Defender meets Bionic Commando

425
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Kinda, it's just

426
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Exploding ferrets

427
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's new while feeling retro

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I think that's true in all your games

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's just awesome

430
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Boom

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Alright, well Erin before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR

432
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What's going on in the gaming world this week

433
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?

434
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You know what, it's been a very long process

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I actually started this project last May

436
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So it's been in the works for a very long time

437
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I nonetheless have had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together

439
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It'll be a dollar, it'll be free to try

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it

441
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you want to hear very quickly the wishlist for the sequel?

442
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Absolutely

443
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this

444
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking

445
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Elemental ferrets, fire, ice and lightning

447
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Strife amethysts

448
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes, not chaos emeralds because we can't rip off anybody

449
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Credits will contain a rhythm game

450
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Other vehicles besides helicopter, like bungee from a motorboat, yes

451
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Dedicated sound for missile launch

452
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Screen-clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered anytime

453
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ferrets equipped with milk tea

454
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Money should be used to buy stuff

455
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, yes, raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club

456
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
These trained ferrets would then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Deformable landscapes summon killer train to attack enemies

458
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
An eagle operating a crane needs to be a stage boss

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city

460
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, wow, Bungee Ferret Tossing 2 sounds epic

461
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But hold on guys, don't sell the original short

462
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The original is still going to be amazing and blow your mind

463
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's just, you know, this may soon, if it does well, wink wink nudge nudge

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This may soon become the start of a new trilogy

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know what, I would love to bring that to you guys

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I got a quick question

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes, Dan?

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Are there any zombies in it?

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Not yet

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Only you'll become if you play the game too much

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There are no indie games without zombies

472
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There's plenty of indie games

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So you gotta put some zombies in

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let me tell you something

475
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Every indie game has zombies

476
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games

477
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's what I'm saying

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm saying every indie game has zombies

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So we need some zombie ferrets

480
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You know what there is in the game though, and maybe I hope I'm not spoiling anything

481
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There are kittens in the game

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are they zombies?

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe

484
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They're just played on the screen when you run the game that says

485
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Please don't throw animals in real life

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah we can't do that with my cat, she's too huge

487
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh I could

488
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But we'll see

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Anyway, okay, Aaron I gotta wrap up and let you go

491
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But everybody be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It will be out in the coming days

493
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process

494
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But it will be out very soon

495
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And it's a dollar for heaven's sake

496
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But we're gonna say buy this

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games

499
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That are having a lot of spotlight this week

500
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We really want Aaron to be able to do well

501
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar

502
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You probably already have it in your leftover points anyway

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And go buy this game

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If you follow Y Y R Games on Twitter you'll know exactly when it comes out

505
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I will tweet the moment it releases

506
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And check out the website of course Y Y R Games dot com

507
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You have other games

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight

509
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But you have other games on the market place

510
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Like Snake 360 and Falling

511
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That are worth checking out absolutely

512
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I appreciate that

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Old arcade game style stuff

514
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Alright, Aaron have a good one buddy

515
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Thank you again

516
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey you too

517
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Thanks so much for having me on

518
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Alright of course

519
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Take care

520
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Bye bye

521
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, and if you're gonna make a game inspired by an Orange Zones Radio idea

522
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll bring you on at the top of the show too

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's be real

524
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I am super excited

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I know I can't wait to play it

526
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I'm not just saying that because we're involved

527
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It just, it looks like fun

528
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't wait

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Ionotropic said ferret returns, bungee ferret tossing 13

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels

531
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But we gotta make this one a success first

532
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Cause if this is a flop then Aaron's gonna be like

533
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Zombies

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Zombies are overrated

536
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Alright alright

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's move into how was your gaming week

538
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What types of video games

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You obviously haven't been playing bungee ferret tossing

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not out yet

541
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But what have you been playing this week

542
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's start with Dark Sakura

543
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Wow, in mass effect

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Three

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
For a change

546
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And two

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Shut up

548
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It was the zombie one

550
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
See, zombies overrated

551
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I hadn't played through it yet

552
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So

553
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What the fuck man

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I have also been doing school stuff this week

555
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And writing

556
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming

557
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And writing

558
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So I have a life

559
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week

560
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
How about you bite me

561
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You just completely and totally squirt the whole segment

562
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
How about you bite me

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming either

564
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me

565
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio

566
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Where every gamer has a voice

567
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And they might use it to fight with their spouse

568
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Live on air

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Dark Sakura

570
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Of course not

571
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And then I shot my husband in the face

572
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's just mass effect and World of Warcraft

573
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan

574
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How was your gaming week

575
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That was it

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But zombies

578
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It was pretty good

579
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah

580
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out

581
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And it just sort of sat on the shelf

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And then for whatever reason this week I was like

583
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You know what, I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies

584
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh, and I did

585
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You like to do a lot of

586
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, and he cursed a lot too

587
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You like to do

588
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, yeah

589
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs too

590
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV

591
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So you can kind of like watch people play games

592
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And stuff, right

593
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube

594
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, you think that's a weird thing

595
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And wrestling

596
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't think it's a weird thing

597
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Kind of to an extent

598
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling

599
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, I will say this

600
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week

601
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It was something on the Game Boy

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It was like, was it DuckTales on the game

603
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
No, it was something even more obscure

604
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Was it Mega Man

605
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No, it was even more obscure than that

606
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It was some licensed game

607
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, The Simpsons

608
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy

609
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch

610
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, yeah

611
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It was Bart vs The Juggernauts

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Well, because a lot of these games are stuff that I've known existed

613
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
But I was always just like, what the fuck is this about

614
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And there's like this World of Long Plays channel on YouTube

615
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And they do just these really good high definition long plays of games

616
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And to an extent it's like, I'd like to check this game out

617
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it

618
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So that's kind of the best way to go

619
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's a good way to sample stuff too

620
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
A lot of the new stuff

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah, well, you know

622
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
A lot of these games suck

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them

624
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Alright, fair enough

625
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Alright, anything else you want to say about your gaming week, Dan?

626
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Uh, no

627
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay, let's go to Loki

628
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Zombies

629
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

630
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3

631
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
A little bit of that

632
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And then I also played McPixel

633
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because I bought that on my Android phone

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And it's pretty fun, it's like a cross between

635
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The old LucasArts point and click adventure games

636
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And MacGyver

637
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But really dirty

638
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Dirty MacGyver?

639
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Like dirty MacGyver

640
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay

641
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Because basically each one of the

642
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Like every single puzzle in the game is

643
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You have 20 seconds to defuse the bomb

644
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You don't know where the bomb is

645
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You don't know how you have to defuse it

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But you just have to figure out how to interact with stuff

647
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And what you need to do

648
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And most of the, well a lot of the puzzles

649
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Involve kicking someone in the nuts

650
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then some of them

651
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
To defuse a bomb?

652
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
To defuse a bomb

653
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's how I play Scribblenauts

654
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Is the bomb in their pants?

655
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Sometimes, yeah

656
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's just, it's such a weird game

657
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And it's awesome though

658
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't know why but I'm suddenly reminded of the game

659
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Don't Shit Your Pants

660
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah

662
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But yeah, it just, it gets really strange

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But it's definitely worth checking out

664
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Either, I think it's also on PC as well

665
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But yeah, McPixel

666
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Really, really crazy but fun

667
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So I played through the entire game of that

668
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And then Minecraft

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I've been playing a lot of Minecraft on PC

670
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Finally launched the VoG network server

671
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I actually have a remote server that I run now

672
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Tell us more about this

673
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Because we need more people on it

674
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, it's a server

675
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's a whitelisted server

676
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So basically you go to the forum thread on the VoG forums

677
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And you say, hey, I want to be let in

678
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And I add your name to the whitelist

679
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And you can go in and build

680
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome

681
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And up on a hill is the clubhouse

682
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You go in there, take a set of tools

683
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Or use that as a home base for a while

684
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Until you figure out what you're going to do

685
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And then go off and build

686
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And it's just a survival thing

687
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's kind of fun

688
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Maybe we could have OLR Village

689
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, I think that's kind of the idea

690
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Is that everybody would have their own little house and stuff

691
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, you just build a house wherever

692
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I still don't have the game and I'm probably not gonna

693
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You got to check, even if you don't buy the game yourself

694
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
At some point have one of us give you a tour

695
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Because it's pretty cool just seeing what other people have created

696
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like in retrospect

697
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's fun

698
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
In retrospect though, I think I might have built myself

699
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing

700
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Which I don't, I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So maybe we can get something on YouTube

702
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But anyway, we'll work on that later

703
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I was playing that this week on the server

704
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I built a sad little house

705
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode

706
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You do have limited mobs

707
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You're on like the easy mode

708
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But you gotta have some mobs

709
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
To give some challenge, right?

710
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, easy mode still has all the mobs

711
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They just don't do all the damage

712
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode

713
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And the other day we were just fucking around

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because since I'm the admin

715
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I can switch shit all the time

716
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Like right now I'm basically playing

717
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Or I was playing in creative mode

718
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Because I was

719
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's put it this way

720
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
When we first started the server

721
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff

722
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And then I had Bobby telling me

723
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hey, I can't go into the clubhouse

724
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?

725
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah, the door doesn't work

726
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Huh? That's weird

727
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay, whatever

728
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I was like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse

729
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm like, what?

730
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why couldn't you go into the clubhouse?

731
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, apparently I built it too close to the spawn point

732
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And see, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point

733
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And build stuff and stuff like that

734
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Other players cannot

735
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through

736
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Because it wasn't updating the block that was there

737
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So I had to tear it all down

738
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And build it up on a hill

739
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Which is kind of funny, but

740
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It looks great though

741
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Because now you have that waterfall and everything

742
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, so we were doing that

743
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But anyway, so

744
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Like I said, I was fucking around

745
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Because I was in creative mode

746
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And so you can spawn whatever you want

747
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Including monster eggs that spawn

748
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Monsters

749
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So my friend's like

750
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You know, I was telling him about the endermen

751
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And he's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those

752
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm like, alright

753
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So I spawned one and he fought it

754
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And he killed it pretty easily

755
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy

756
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm like, okay

757
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So I spawned 20 of them

758
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But you will not make a habit out of spawning random endermen

759
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
No, no, no

760
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch

761
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because we were just spawning all sorts of garbage

762
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It was hilarious

763
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It will be real

764
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
By the way, if you do go on the VoG Network server and play

765
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It will be really easy to find my house

766
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because I thought I went way far away to go build it

767
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But apparently not

768
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Because Loki and I have already managed to connect our mines

769
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It did not take very long

770
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a temporary mine

771
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to abandon mine anyways

772
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Because I'm going to build somewhere else

773
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It just wasn't very feasible right there

774
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But yeah, there's stuff around

775
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I've got to figure out a way to

776
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Maybe we'll put up a sign on our house

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's like, hey, property blah blah blah

778
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, so you don't like accidentally

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean, because someone can go into my mine

780
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And that's fine, I don't really give a crap

781
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But yeah, there's a ton of

782
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Go ahead

783
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game

784
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in the Sims

785
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And build underground

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Live in a cave

787
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Which you can do

788
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh yeah, I mean, that's easy

789
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
A lot of people kind of do that

790
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
They have their main house

791
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And they build little outposts as they're in the mine

792
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
That's a very common thing to do

793
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I mean, just living underground

794
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Now I did see a cool video

795
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf

796
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Area was in Lord of the Rings

797
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Nice

798
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It was really cool

799
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Nice

800
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that

801
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's more like just creative mode

802
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Which we can, you know, if no one wants to play as a rival mode

803
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We can do that

804
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But I didn't want to do like creative mode

805
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything

806
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Because it's like, eh, who cares

807
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You know, I have all the objects

808
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I don't need to go find whatever

809
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I think it's fine

810
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I haven't died yet

811
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, I've come close

812
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But I haven't died yet

813
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
This is still how I play the Sims

814
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But, I mean, and trust me

815
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
When I'm not building that, you know, clubhouse

816
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I am actually playing survival mode

817
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I'm not actually cheating

818
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't have, like, diamond armor or anything

819
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So I'm just playing legit

820
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But, you know, aside from building the start area

821
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You know, that obviously is doing creative

822
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So vognetwork.com forums

823
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If you want to join us, and please do

824
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But don't destroy my house

825
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Or I will find you and I will kill you

826
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, and we've got plenty of server space

827
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I can host up to 35 people at a time

828
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once

829
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Good times

830
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah

831
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Not yet

832
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Please join

833
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Not yet

834
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yes

835
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

836
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No, that's it

837
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already

838
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I bought Minecraft PC this week

839
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server

840
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there

841
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That are not in the Xbox One

842
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Is it worth the 20 bucks?

843
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think it's really fun

844
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I do

845
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I bought the 360 version

846
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I thought it was pretty slick

847
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I started to get bored of it

848
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And the PC version is, like, so much better

849
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah, the PC one you can mod

850
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And do all that stuff too as well

851
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Like, Alan's helping me get a map mod

852
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Which I think would be very useful

853
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, any of that stuff's okay

854
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
As long as it's not like, hey, mod two

855
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You know, x-ray mod and stuff like that

856
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin

857
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now

858
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Walking around in armor, so, you know

859
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But, yeah

860
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Just like in real life

861
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, just like in real life and I'm not wearing a shirt

862
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, I was gonna say, yeah

863
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's definitely worth it and there's a lot more to do

864
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Plus, the thing is

865
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The one thing that really turned me off about Minecraft originally

866
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Was using keyboard and mouse

867
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Especially on my laptop, it's touchpad and keyboard

868
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I said, fuck that

869
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So I actually have, and I even linked it in there

870
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There's a, you know, program you can use with x-pad

871
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Or to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller

872
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And that's actually how it plays

873
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
With an Xbox 360 controller

874
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And it's awesome

875
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's great if you play the 360 version

876
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Sweet

877
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Alright, the rest of my gaming week

878
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news

879
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Because we've been pretty lengthy so far

880
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm just gonna say

881
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
More World of Warcraft, surprise

882
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I got my sixth level 85

883
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Cue the womp womp

884
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Whatever, don't judge me

885
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3

886
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now

887
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So if you are a PlayStation Plus person

888
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You can get Borderlands for free

889
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel

890
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus

891
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But I am not one to turn down a free game

892
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Especially one that I was enjoying on the PC

893
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And the only problem I'm having is that

894
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse

895
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Than it is with the PlayStation 3 controller

896
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's the only bummer

897
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But the game looks good

898
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And it runs really smooth

899
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3

900
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Couple little graphical glitches here and there

901
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But nothing that's a game ruining experience

902
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands

903
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I really like the whole fusion of a role playing game in a first person shooter

904
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It makes the first person shooters very accessible

905
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So, love it

906
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's mostly it

907
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So, for this week that I can think of

908
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let's do some housekeeping

909
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And then we're gonna get into some big news tonight

910
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Right at the top, right Loki?

And when we're gonna have weeks off or what have you

918
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Speaking of weeks off

919
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Dark Sakura will not be here next week

920
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But we will still be doing a show

921
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Maybe we can get Dan to come back

922
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I don't know, we'll see

923
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's a holiday

924
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Alright, moving on

925
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Starting off

926
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
News tonight, Loki

927
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So apparently there is a

928
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
There's this thing that went around the internet

929
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's funny cause I get to watch it happen

930
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There's a distributor that leaked

931
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The Wii U pricing and

932
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The release date, that's just so weird

933
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And they listed three skews

934
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And the price is anywhere from

935
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
$249.99 to

936
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
$349.99 and

937
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah, it's so weird

938
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Never heard that before, crazy

939
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's funny because

940
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I saw it, I was actually reading

941
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Go Nintendo and

942
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Funny enough, it's actually my company

943
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So a little bit

944
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
A little bit of shock there, I was like

945
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But to be clear, it wasn't you

946
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No, it wasn't me

947
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That was the funny thing, it wasn't me

948
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It was some dude goes by Hound Dog

949
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
On YouTube

950
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Which we tracked down

951
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Which I'll get into in just a second here

952
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So yeah

953
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's a little weird, I don't like to talk about

954
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Where I work because you know

955
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It comes back to me sometimes

956
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It did once before

957
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It did once

958
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's documented, people know what happened

959
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Honestly

960
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Quite surprised that the Wii U stuff hasn't

961
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But see

962
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I've kind of removed anything that points

963
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Me back to my company

964
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But yeah

965
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's funny though, everybody

966
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
This is not necessarily a story about

967
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Information I pretty much already told you guys

968
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Based off of

969
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This information

970
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That I've known for a while now

971
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And also other information pointing to the release

972
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Date of the 18th

973
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Which is

974
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
PDP leak and of course some other

975
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Games that are going to be announced probably this week

976
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That are going to be launching on

977
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The 18th that kind of point to

978
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That release date

979
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Is how

980
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The gaming media works

981
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And watching how it works is really

982
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Interesting

983
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
How there's literally

984
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Copy pasted stories, no research done

985
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And then it starts playing the telephone game

986
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Where it gets even more ridiculous

987
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And I kind of, I don't know if anyone's followed my

988
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Twitter, you kind of saw a little bit of that

989
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Because I kept posting articles like

990
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
LOL, did they really just do that?

991
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So it started off in games facts

992
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It went to go Nintendo

993
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And other Nintendo kind of

994
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Websites started running it

995
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And one of the things that kind of got back

996
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
To the higher

997
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ups at our company because we

998
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Started getting calls from our customers

999
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Was the fact that

1000
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
They go, oh

1001
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This distributor

1002
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Supplies Amazon over stock

1003
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And blah blah blah

1004
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
True, we work, we do sell stuff

1005
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
To Amazon but we're not the main

1006
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Supplier for Amazon

1007
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It makes it sound like

1008
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Basically a lot of these places

1009
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Were just like, oh Amazon distributor

1010
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Leaks price because that

1011
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Headline gets a lot more hits

1012
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And it adds a little bit more credence

1013
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
To the information in there

1014
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Despite the fact the funny part is the date's

1015
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Wrong

1016
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's a placeholder date, it's not right

1017
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
At all, no one knows

1018
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What the real date is

1019
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Well, I mean I speculate what the real date

1020
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Is, but that date's not it

1021
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Which is funny because everyone's like

1022
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Well that doesn't go with the rumors

1023
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I've heard that it's the 18th

1024
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's a week before, but it's a Sunday, I guess it's real

1025
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But like

1026
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
CNET, I think out of all the

1027
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Stories I saw from

1028
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The different blogs, CNET's probably the

1029
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Funniest one, and I don't know who this

1030
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Guy is, but

1031
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He first, he put the text

1032
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You know, that was the text information

1033
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's like, yeah okay, so it was the Wii U system

1034
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
1111, and 249

1035
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
299, 349

1036
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But then I got this

1037
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Additional information

1038
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
A screenshot of the website

1039
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Oh, that backs up the information

1040
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh wait, I got another source

1041
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's a video, it's like you're a fucking idiot

1042
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They're all the same goddamn thing

1043
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's the same goddamn source

1044
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And you're like sourcing two other things

1045
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
To make it sound like that it's

1046
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
More legit

1047
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Some comments from our chatroom at

1048
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1049
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Costa journalism

1050
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Frisbee says, control C, control

1051
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
V, that's how the stories go from you

1052
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
To me

1053
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I like that

1054
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There's like a little song about that

1055
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
WhatupG says it would be cool if it was November 11th

1056
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But November 18th makes sense at least

1057
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Historically for Nintendo, that's the exact

1058
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Same day they released

1059
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The Wii, the GameCube?

1060
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
One of the other systems was the exact same day

1061
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So, Mr. Dan

1062
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Having a background in video

1063
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense

1064
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
As a release date

1065
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays

1066
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's really irritating

1067
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And it does also make sense about the 11th that

1068
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
They will be sending them out early

1069
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Because, you know, the stores

1070
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Don't get it, you know, it doesn't just magically spawn

1071
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
In the store Sunday morning

1072
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You know, we have it hidden away somewhere

1073
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So that you can't get it

1074
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You can't steal it

1075
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it

1076
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And post it on the internet

1077
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
No, you never put other people down

1078
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Here's the funny part

1079
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like I said before, you know

1080
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
There is this guy, this anonymous guy

1081
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Hound dog, who leaked it

1082
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Dude

1083
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
First rule of the internet

1084
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Anything that you post on the internet

1085
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Always stays on the internet

1086
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So, when you post

1087
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
A video or whatever

1088
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And then

1089
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You know, think that we're not gonna figure it out

1090
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
First off, his video

1091
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Basically it was a video of a screenshot

1092
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Had a time and date

1093
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
In the bottom corner

1094
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Stupid

1095
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Because, you know what we could do?

1096
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We went back, we looked at our web access logs

1097
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And guess what?

1098
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We query every single search

1099
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
On there

1100
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U

1101
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And

1102
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
During that time frame, there was only two

1103
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And then

1104
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And then it was basically two different customers

1105
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs

1106
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And then

1107
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, guess what? You do a Google

1108
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Cache search on, you know, Hound dog

1109
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And oh, he has a trailer

1110
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
An advertisement for a certain

1111
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Store that happens to be one

1112
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Of the two customers

1113
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, Guerrilla Games and Saint

1114
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Cloud

1115
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Don't hold back now

1116
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So what happened?

1117
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Did anybody go to the guy

1118
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And say, why'd you do it?

1119
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Honestly, I don't know

1120
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Because this was stuff that was handled

1121
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
By managers and upper management

1122
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And stuff like that, because funny

1123
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Like I said, this had nothing to do with me

1124
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I do item setup sometimes

1125
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
For a lot of games, but I don't do

1126
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
First party because our buyer for some goddamn reason

1127
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Wants to hold on to first party even though

1128
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
She fucks everything up

1129
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So

1130
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
She set that up, she didn't

1131
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Flag it to not show up on our website

1132
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Even though maybe she should've

1133
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And it wasn't any of my

1134
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Customers that leaked the information

1135
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So I just sat back and kind of like

1136
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Lol

1137
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Frisbee said she should've used the free Wi-Fi

1138
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
At Starbucks

1139
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh yeah, that was the other thing too, his IP

1140
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Pointed back to Saint Cloud as well

1141
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Whatever, anyway, this is all in

1142
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Moot Point come Thursday

1143
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Exactly, it's all in Moot Point and the whole thing

1144
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Blew over pretty fast, except for the fact that

1145
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Amazon's like, we need an apology

1146
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
From you, we need you

1147
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Blah blah blah, Nintendo of course

1148
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
On people's asses about, hey

1149
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You know, this is not supposed to be

1150
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Which only leads credit to the fact

1151
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That it's probably true

1152
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Except that the date's not right, but you know

1153
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I mean, some information's obviously

1154
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Accurate, like the pricing

1155
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And like I said

1156
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
If you've been listening to this show

1157
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
For the last few months

1158
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
This is no

1159
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This is not news to you

1160
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Put it that way

1161
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I just find it funny though

1162
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Like how, seriously

1163
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Copy paste all these articles are

1164
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And like, big comp- like

1165
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
IGN, and what the fuck, okay

1166
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Seriously, let's step aside here

1167
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What the fuck is it with IGN

1168
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And GameSpot where

1169
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You have an article, okay

1170
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And there's not that much information

1171
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
In this article, it's like, okay

1172
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Distributor, three prices, three skews

1173
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
November 11th date

1174
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They have an article, and then they have

1175
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
A video in the article, that's talking about

1176
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The article

1177
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Why do they, and why is it some

1178
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
British guy, it's always a British guy

1179
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
People don't like to read

1180
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
They're like, having some intern guy read this

1181
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Dude, and there's this like

1182
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This distributor, we can't get

1183
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Into their website because you need to log in

1184
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And password, but this guy got in

1185
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And he got this exclusive information

1186
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And blah blah blah, and

1187
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
People don't like to read

1188
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It's ridiculous

1189
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I feel ignorant without IGN

1190
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Well it's funny you say that, because people

1191
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Can't read, but there is somewhat

1192
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Truth to that, because this makes a very

1193
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Interesting companion piece to

1194
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Bobby's show before us tonight, and the whole

1195
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Girlfriend mode thing

1196
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And how that kind of got carried away

1197
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And all that as well, and that's because people

1198
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Didn't really want to read the entire article

1199
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
They just wanted to read the part where

1200
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode

1201
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Because he clearly hates women

1202
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I think it was a poor

1203
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Choice of words, but really people just need to get over it

1204
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But, I mean, we all make poor

1205
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Choice of words sometimes, I mean, thank God

1206
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
No one really does listen to this show, except

1207
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You know, you fell for, because God, we've

1208
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Said shit on this show that would have gotten us

1209
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Through the coals in the past, because

1210
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That's unfortunately the way

1211
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Our little internet medium works

1212
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Sometimes, and it's- There's no one, no one pays attention

1213
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
To us, but they'll pay attention to like

1214
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Joe Schmo, I mean like

1215
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Seriously, like MTV

1216
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Like, it went

1217
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It went everywhere, it went to MTV's

1218
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Website, they're the gaming block, it went to

1219
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET, it went

1220
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Well CNET takes stuff from Yahoo

1221
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Or, I mean, vice versa

1222
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I think that's just saying that people want to know

1223
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
The Wii U date already

1224
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I understand that, but it's just, it's so ridiculous

1225
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
How, I literally got one

1226
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Email from an independent site

1227
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Asking the, you know, follow up on that

1228
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
One person

1229
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Fucking hilarious, because what did Bobby

1230
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Ran about on his show, just, just

1231
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
An hour ago, what was Bobby's ran on his show

1232
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
About his exclusive interview with Gearbox

1233
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
How did he get that exclusive interview?

1234
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
He asked

1235
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And here's the other thing too that was funny about

1236
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Nobody else had asked

1237
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Here's the other thing that was funny about the CNET article

1238
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And then we went to our gaming gurus

1239
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
In the, in the

1240
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
In the office

1241
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And they, yeah we talked to this editor

1242
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And he said, yeah that sounds like that could be real

1243
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Really? Really? That is your

1244
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Fucking, like, proof

1245
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This guy just says, yeah that sounds like

1246
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Feasible information

1247
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a

1248
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Millionaire? Ask the experts

1249
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Are you on a game show?

1250
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's like, yeah, yeah

1251
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That seems feasible

1252
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Hey Joe Schmo who plays some video games that

1253
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Delivers our mail, do you think that this release date

1254
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Sounds like it could be real?

1255
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Sounds right

1256
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It was the release date

1257
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I have no information to back that up

1258
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But it sounds like a date to me

1259
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I mean it is a date and it hasn't happened

1260
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yet so um

1261
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I guess it could happen

1262
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Anyways, let me just, let me just stop right here

1263
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And reiterate what I've said

1264
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
In the past

1265
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Okay, three SKUs, $249, $299

1266
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
$349, $299 SKU I

1267
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Speculate, Wii U system

1268
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Tablet, that's it

1269
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's in case you already have a Wii

1270
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
A Wii system, Speculate

1271
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay, because I don't know any information other than

1272
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Three prices

1273
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh and November 18th release date, but that's also

1274
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Speculation based on information, but whatever

1275
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Um, not information that I have

1276
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
From Nintendo, nothing from Nintendo

1277
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Um, $299

1278
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
SKU, System

1279
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus

1280
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Nunchuck, in case you don't

1281
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Own a Wii U

1282
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Or a Wii system

1283
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
$349 SKU

1284
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
System, Gamepad, Nunchuck

1285
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Remote Plus

1286
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Nintendo Land, that's my guess

1287
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So we'll see in a few days if I'm right

1288
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We'll find out on Thursday

1289
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's going to be a busy week between the iPhone 5

1290
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
On Wednesday, and then Nintendo on Thursday

1291
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This is Tech Christmas in some ways

1292
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So we'll uh, the blogs

1293
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Will be busy this week copy pasting

1294
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
From each other

1295
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
When they're not live blogging

1296
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Because that's the other big thing, live blogging

1297
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Anyhow, I think I just

1298
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Gave Loki an aneurysm

1299
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's move on, let's move on to something a little more

1300
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Indie, shall we? Something a little more under the radar

1301
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to

1302
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's Steam Greenlight

1303
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?

1304
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's a chance for you to basically

1305
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Help, I don't want to say it's Kickstarter

1306
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Because it's not, but it's helped generate

1307
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Buzz for indie games

1308
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
People that want to get their ideas

1309
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Out there to be approved by the community

1310
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
To be sold on Steam

1311
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, when this first went live

1312
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
A lot of people were putting

1313
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
A lot of crap on there

1314
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Things like Half Life 3

1315
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Showed up on Steam Greenlight

1316
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And things of that sort

1317
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So in order to kind of curb this

1318
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Valve decided to set a $100

1319
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Fee to get your project listed

1320
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
On Steam Greenlight

1321
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
This fee goes to Child's Play

1322
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Pretty interesting solution

1323
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
A pretty ingenious way to figure it out

1324
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
The Valve UI designer

1325
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Alden Kroll said

1326
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play

1327
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
We have no interest in making money from this

1328
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But we do need to cut down the noise

1329
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
In the system

1330
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Which is causing a little bit of controversy

1331
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Because some people think, well for a true indie

1332
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
$100 is a lot of money

1333
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Blah blah blah blah blah

1334
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What do you guys think? Is this fair?

1335
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I think it's a good way to make sure

1336
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
People are serious about it

1337
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I think it's fair

1338
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice

1339
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing

1340
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So, very cool

1341
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Also some other changes to the system

1342
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Now when you log in

1343
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And look at Steam Greenlight

1344
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You're gonna see a smaller list

1345
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You're not gonna get thrown everything at you

1346
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see

1347
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Popular games and new games

1348
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
On Steam Greenlight

1349
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna

1350
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Does that have anything to do with

1351
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?

1352
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's a sequel. It's the one that was on Kickstarter

1353
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm gonna go upvote that right after the show

1354
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They have a demo you can play

1355
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Really? Already?

1356
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah, it's pretty sweet

1357
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Over 700 submissions already since August 30th

1358
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
One thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight

1359
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Just for the record

1360
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Sex games

1361
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
There was a game called Seduce Me

1362
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
That was on Project Greenlight

1363
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And yes, it was removed

1364
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve

1365
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Said, quote,

1366
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Steam has never been a leading destination

1367
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
For erotic material

1368
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Greenlight doesn't aim to change that

1369
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And what a shame

1370
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Alright, I guess we can understand

1371
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Why they don't want that stuff associated

1372
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
With sex is overrated

1373
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Well, because of the media sensation that would occur

1374
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Think about it

1375
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
If they were to sell Booby Game

1376
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Then suddenly it's gonna be on CNN

1377
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And there would be the commentators

1378
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
On Fox News

1379
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh my god

1380
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Can you believe on Steam

1381
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The Booby Games that are corrupting our children

1382
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
They don't let your dirty money

1383
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's Booby Steam

1384
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that

1385
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But I wish people weren't so freakin'

1386
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Uptight? Stick up their ass?

1387
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes

1388
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Have their game, dammit

1389
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Hehe, boobs

1390
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing

1391
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
When you tell a little kid they can't do something

1392
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
What's the first thing they want to do?

1393
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Just go out and do it

1394
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things

1395
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You know, like, vowel language

1396
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Or fucking

1397
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
People are just gonna want to see it more

1398
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Going to

1399
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1400
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Missworldnude13

1401
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
For Greenlight

1402
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Excellent suggestion

1403
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Saig, who knows a thing or two about

1404
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Developing games, is in our chatroom saying

1405
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The Greenlight stuff is cheaper

1406
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Than any other commercial game seller

1407
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Steam is $100

1408
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
For one time

1409
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
iOS is $99 a year

1410
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Mac is another $99 a year

1411
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So, very interesting perspective

1412
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
On what that $100

1413
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
If that really is too much money

1414
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Or what, is that, you know

1415
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That's the same price you're gonna pay for iOS

1416
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Which is seen as a huge indie boom

1417
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm sorry, it's the same amount

1418
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
For one year, and then you have to renew on

1419
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
iOS where you don't with Steam

1420
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's basically

1421
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Like the free to play model

1422
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If you think about it

1423
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You buy the game, or you buy, you know

1424
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You pay your $100, and you're done

1425
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So

1426
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says

1427
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah, like

1428
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Unbaptized babies lactating out of

1429
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Cleopatra's nipple. Oops, that was

1430
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Dante's Inferno

1431
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Good point

1432
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Alright, let's move on

1433
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome

1434
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Dark Sakura

1435
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, I don't know how clean it is, but

1436
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill

1437
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
About the whole

1438
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Steam box thing that we've talked about before

1439
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
There is a job listing

1440
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
For an industrial designer

1441
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
On Valve's website

1442
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And I'll read the quote on here

1443
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We're frustrated by the lack of innovation

1444
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
In the computer hardware space

1445
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So we're jumping in

1446
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Even basic input, keyboard and mouse

1447
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Hasn't really changed any meaningful way over the years

1448
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So basically, they're trying to

1449
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I guess, expand further

1450
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
But they're still kind of denying the whole

1451
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Steam box thing

1452
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Why do these rumors keep perpetuating

1453
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Everywhere? It's interesting

1454
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Although, it does have me thinking

1455
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
If Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time

1456
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's because they keep hiring

1457
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
For people for that

1458
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
That's why

1459
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
When you have someone that's being hired for like

1460
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Hardware design

1461
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Steam software

1462
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year

1463
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Or anytime soon

1464
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
For example, they hired console developers

1465
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
For Diablo 3 at Blizzard

1466
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Doesn't mean that we've seen

1467
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Diablo 3 on consoles yet

1468
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Maybe it'll happen next year

1469
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Or maybe not

1470
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't even see it being its own sort of system

1471
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Maybe the potential of having something as a

1472
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Computer add-on

1473
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You know

1474
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Like a combination storage device

1475
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Maybe graphics boosting

1476
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It would seem so easy

1477
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
To just do a little PC in a box

1478
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That plays very basic Steam games

1479
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You know, what the hell's an Ouya?

1480
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's kind of like that

1481
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Very, very, very bare bones

1482
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Type of system that just plugs in your TV

1483
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Maybe Valve could pump

1484
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Another couple hundred dollars worth of tech

1485
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Into it and have something that could play Portal

1486
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
See, I could do that. It's called my computer

1487
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Well, they could sell it

1488
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That I already have

1489
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That I play Mass Effect on

1490
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Alright, well since we are talking

1491
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
About Valve, there was something else

1492
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Valve going on this week and

1493
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I want to invite our resident Valve fanboy

1494
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
At Orange Lounge Radio here on the program

1495
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
To talk a little bit about this

1496
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So welcome to the show everybody, Alan!

1497
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
How you doing Alan?

1498
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
How was your gaming week? What have you been playing lately?

1499
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Mass Effect 3

1500
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
How's the multiplayer weekend going for you?

1501
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I haven't done it yet, I need to get on that

1502
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Oh my gosh, you better hurry, you don't have much time

1503
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Bejeweled? What's with this new Bejeweled addiction you got going on?

1504
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I just remembered that Bejeweled 2 was good

1505
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And I found a copy of 3

1506
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So why not?

1507
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So what did you want to talk about tonight?

1508
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I have Half-Life news

1509
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So

1510
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
In June 2004

1511
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
To show off the, at the time, brand new

1512
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Source engine

1513
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That Half-Life 2 was going to come out on

1514
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
In November of that year

1515
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Valve put out Half-Life Source

1516
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
They basically piped the original Half-Life game

1517
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Into the Source engine

1518
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done

1519
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's like, okay

1520
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It has better lights and physics

1521
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But otherwise, it's Half-Life

1522
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
1998 game

1523
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And it kind of ticked off about it

1524
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source project

1525
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
They are just amateur programmers

1526
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They're not professionals

1527
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Not getting paid to do this, and they said

1528
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
We are going to take Half-Life

1529
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And literally redesign it and program it

1530
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
From the ground up

1531
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Into the Half-Life 2 engine

1532
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
They had a fiasco in 2009

1533
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Where they released a really awesome trailer

1534
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And ultimately

1535
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The game didn't come out because they're like

1536
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This isn't done

1537
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They went out on a media blackout

1538
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
For the last three years

1539
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And it's coming September 14th, they finally announced

1540
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That's very interesting

1541
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So because they got burned the first time

1542
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It was entirely their fault

1543
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
But they went underground with it

1544
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
They didn't update the Twitter, YouTube

1545
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
No leaked screenshots, they're like

1546
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
We are off the grid, we're still working on it

1547
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Dan just said

1548
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Sounds like Valve to me

1549
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But this isn't Valve

1550
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
But Valve is kind of embracing it

1551
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Some companies would cease and desist

1552
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger

1553
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Remake in Square Enix

1554
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there

1555
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Right?

1556
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I think they asked them to change

1557
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The name because there was some confusion

1558
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That Valve was doing it

1559
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And Valve wasn't offended

1560
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
That people thought

1561
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That they themselves were making it

1562
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
But they were like, you guys need to name this something else

1563
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So that people will be aware that it's an indie project

1564
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And it's your project

1565
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
This is your thing

1566
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I think it's already got its clearance on Steam

1567
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Green light

1568
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Shock

1569
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Steam is probably going to host it

1570
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life

1571
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
If anything

1572
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Get people interested in the franchise

1573
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Again, considering that it's been

1574
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
8 years since Half-Life 2

1575
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Proper came out

1576
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And a good 5 years

1577
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Since Episode 2 came out

1578
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And there's still not a people

1579
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
About Valve for Half-Life 3

1580
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So they also

1581
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Said for this remake

1582
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
They added some dialogue

1583
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it

1584
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
More interesting, but otherwise it's a shot for shot

1585
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Remake

1586
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The trailer is still on YouTube from 3 years ago

1587
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
If you haven't seen the trailer, you should watch it

1588
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's really awesome

1589
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out?

1590
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's free, why wouldn't I?

1591
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And you'll be playing through it?

1592
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So I'll see you in a week?

1593
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Before we say goodbye for now

1594
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Thank you for the update

1595
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I unfortunately am very ignorant

1596
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
When it comes to Half-Life

1597
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We don't have time to play every single game

1598
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But Alan will make me play it

1599
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
At some point I'm sure

1600
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it

1601
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room says

1602
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
It's better they continue working on it

1603
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And when they feel it's ready, to release it

1604
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
No reason to release a buggy game

1605
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
If Half-Life 3 ever comes out

1606
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It'll probably go multi-platform

1607
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The reason I'm teasing Alan with that idea

1608
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles

1609
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Maybe it'll be a PC and

1610
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Playstation 4 exclusive

1611
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Or something like that

1612
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy

1613
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
About the game

1614
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We shall see, however

1615
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Alright, let's move on with some other news

1616
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Loki

1617
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1618
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio on

1619
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
vognetwork.com

1620
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Use the passphrase, thumb

1621
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So this is kind of interesting

1622
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I talked about a game I played during the week

1623
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Which is called McPixel

1624
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And this weekend they actually

1625
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Went about a unique way to advertise the game

1626
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's on the front page

1627
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Of the Pirate Bay

1628
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Pirate Bay being a very notorious

1629
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Website for

1630
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Piracy

1631
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
McPixel, they have a

1632
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Basically a little bit of a letter

1633
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
To people, it's like

1634
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Hi, I'm SOS

1635
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Video games, but not in a big company

1636
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I make games I want to make

1637
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I know that not everyone

1638
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Can afford entertainment, but everyone needs it

1639
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And even though I make games

1640
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
For a living

1641
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I am most happy to just see people

1642
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Enjoy them

1643
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So today you can download a torrent of my game

1644
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And if you like, throw some coins

1645
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
In my general direction

1646
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And so they actually have that on there

1647
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You can download a torrent

1648
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
For it and download it for free

1649
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Or you can

1650
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Once you've done that and you play it

1651
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You can decide to donate money to

1652
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
You know, to them

1653
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Isn't this what Radiohead did for one of their albums

1654
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Like five years ago?

1655
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't remember, but I know that this is what

1656
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Also like

1657
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Oh, the RiffTrax guys do

1658
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Because they're like, listen, we know that

1659
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Not everybody, you know, downloads these from us

1660
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But, you know, if you like them

1661
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You know, maybe kick us some money

1662
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Well, RiffTrax is in a little

1663
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Bit of a stickier situation though

1664
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Because they are doing parody art

1665
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Of movies that you kind of already

1666
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Have to own, like they can't put it out there

1667
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Attaching it to the movie

1668
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff

1669
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
For them to get that, but

1670
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You know, they're in a weird place

1671
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's also a lot more convenient than trying to sync that stuff up

1672
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Because I've synced that stuff up before

1673
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Like I'll have, we watch all the Twilight movies

1674
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
With the RiffTrax stuff on there

1675
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And I had the DVD for Twilight

1676
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
But man, downloading the

1677
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Precinct stuff is way easier than

1678
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Having to have a second source

1679
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
To play the MP3 at the same time as the audio

1680
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Because it gets off sync pretty easy

1681
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Alright

1682
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Um

1683
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
What do you think, um, I mean

1684
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't know if there's a lot to think about this

1685
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Because clearly no big publisher is ever

1686
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Going to do anything like this, but

1687
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Do you think the guy will actually make some money?

1688
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
He'll probably make some money, I mean the game's not that expensive

1689
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
He probably didn't spend that much

1690
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Money on it, so

1691
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I mean, it's exposure to him

1692
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And, you know, if he figures that people are gonna

1693
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces

1694
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And saying, hey, you know what

1695
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Um, at least donate some money

1696
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
If you like it, you know, donate a dollar, five dollars

1697
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Whatever

1698
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity

1699
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
About a game that, let's be real,

1700
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
People probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway

1701
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Unfortunately

1702
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's really hard for indie games to get press

1703
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere

1704
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah, exactly, and the other thing too

1705
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Like, you look at some of the people, it's much like

1706
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
The Humble Bundle, where, you know, some people

1707
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Just pay a penny or whatever to get it

1708
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But there's people that, like, donated a hundred

1709
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
One dollar, or a hundred and forty-one dollars for this game

1710
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
The Brony Bundle group

1711
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
On Twitter or whatever? That always, um

1712
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I get a kick out of that

1713
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
People that band together to donate lots of money

1714
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
But it's, you know, it is a good cause

1715
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I love those Humble Bundles, those are always good times

1716
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But yeah, they've got, like, in fact, let's see here

1717
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Um, I was trying to see

1718
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The, uh, there's a couple of people

1719
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That did, uh, you know, a hundred and forty dollars

1720
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Uh, one hundred and thirty-three dollars

1721
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Sixty-seven, there's a bunch in the fifties

1722
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And the average right now, this is the average price

1723
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That people are paying for is two dollars and fifty-eight cents

1724
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment

1725
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Uh, Neesh said, um, Radiohead

1726
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Did this for their In Rainbows album

1727
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And said it brought more money to them

1728
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Than, um, all their other albums combined

1729
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You know why? Because they cut out

1730
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
The record label by doing that

1731
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Well, yeah, but still

1732
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And if you are

1733
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners

1734
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because this is only going for about another

1735
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Four hours

1736
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend

1737
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Go downloading the torrent

1738
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
While you still can

1739
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And you can do that guilt-free

1740
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And you are totally a law-abiding citizen

1741
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Because the creator has given his blessing

1742
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
He wants this to happen

1743
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
To get the word out

1744
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Although, one little problem with that

1745
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Is that, you know, he says that

1746
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You know, you download the torrent

1747
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And there's, you know, it's only available

1748
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
For four hours, but

1749
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet

1750
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And there's going to be someone always hosting that game

1751
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Or hosting, you know, seeding it, so

1752
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah

1753
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Alright, well, from one controversial viewpoint

1754
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
On piracy to another, Ubisoft

1755
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You know, they're always on

1756
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap

1757
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Over the years, um, or I should say

1758
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Over the years, it's only really been about

1759
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
A couple years, but, um, Ubisoft

1760
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Is now changing their policy on this

1761
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Always-on DRM, you know, it's just been too much

1762
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Headache and so forth, I think some of us

1763
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Saw this coming, but here's the new DRM

1764
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Policy, according to Stephanie

1765
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Parodi, who's the company's worldwide director

1766
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
For online games, Ubisoft PC games

1767
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Are now going to require a one-time

1768
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Online activation when you first

1769
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Install the game, then you can

1770
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You are free to play the game offline

1771
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And they claim this has been Ubisoft's

1772
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Policy since June of 2011

1773
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But, uh, it's

1774
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Been noticed that maybe there's been some

1775
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Games that didn't get that memo, because

1776
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Always-on we've seen in some more recent releases

1777
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
However, um

1778
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
This is going to be their new policy moving

1779
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Forward. A fair compromise?

1780
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What do y'all think?

1781
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It's fair

1782
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I do think it's fair

1783
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But I always have concern

1784
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
For people that can't get

1785
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That online connection

1786
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And, you know, there are still some people

1787
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
In the world that can't get that online connection

1788
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm not just talking about people who live in the sticks

1789
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But I'm talking about, like, military service people

1790
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Overseas, you know, sometimes

1791
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Want to play some games to, you know,

1792
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Blow off steam a little bit

1793
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And, you know, I do realize they can use

1794
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
The satellite connections and some of these things

1795
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But that's not always a reality, or it's expensive

1796
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Or what have you, so

1797
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I just hope there might be some workarounds

1798
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Some considerations made for people

1799
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Who really are trying to do the right

1800
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Thing. They usually do that

1801
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
With a lot of software that phones

1802
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Home is they'll have, you know, the

1803
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Alternate means of, you know

1804
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
It usually involves, you know, calling up a

1805
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Number and you give them, you know, whatever

1806
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And they give you authentication code or something

1807
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That would be fair. I hope there is some type of

1808
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Little plan B in the small print

1809
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
For people that truly can't,

1810
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You know, which is how they create a lot of those

1811
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Cracks out there for software, but I'm

1812
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Just saying, you know, it's

1813
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I mean, they're already expected to be

1814
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Having 93% of their software

1815
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Pirated, so

1816
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85

1817
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on

1818
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
We're running along this segment, of course

1819
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
But we knew we would. DarkSakura

1820
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'll try to keep this one short then

1821
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Basically, the

1822
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being

1823
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Developed by

1824
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Looks like Straight Right

1825
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Who is out of Australia

1826
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up

1827
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Basically saying that

1828
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
They've been putting a lot of work into this

1829
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It's not going to be a rushed deal

1830
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's

1831
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Launch and that it's supposed to be amazing

1832
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Well, thank god they didn't

1833
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Come out and say, you know what, we're going to

1834
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Half-ass it

1835
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out

1836
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And say, eh, whatever

1837
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
You know, you'll like what you get

1838
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Deal with it. They're saying it's supposed to look just

1839
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
As good as the other console versions

1840
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
And, I mean, I'm kind of

1841
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Interested to see exactly how it plays

1842
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
With the little Wii U pad thing

1843
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Wait, did they really say that? Just as good

1844
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
As the other console versions? That's exactly what they said

1845
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It will look just as good

1846
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Now, wouldn't you think

1847
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
With a new console coming out

1848
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You'd want to say, better

1849
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
A new console using old technology?

1850
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I just

1851
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
How can it be any better? I'm just saying

1852
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It's not helping the case of the Wii U

1853
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
It's using old tech. It's using the Wii

1854
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I'm just saying

1855
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So, I would expect it to look as good as a Wii

1856
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I'm being sensationalist

1857
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And latching onto that one quote

1858
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
My headline, my pull quote

1859
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Mass Effect 3 will look about as good

1860
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
As it does on the other consoles on the Wii U

1861
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
There's my pull quote

1862
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Orange Lounge Radio exclusive

1863
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Rob

1864
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Yes?

1865
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There is a quote here

1866
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It says

1867
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time

1868
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
There is a significant technical challenge

1869
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Bringing the game from its original format

1870
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
To the Wii U. It's new, different

1871
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And sophisticated piece of hardware

1872
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
As of

1873
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So there's a good deal of technical energy

1874
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
That's being expended to make that happen

1875
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I mean, you have to see the size of the shoehorn

1876
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
We need to have

1877
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
In order to get that tablet to work

1878
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I mean, seriously

1879
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns

1880
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Of that size

1881
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
We used a hammer

1882
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Look, I will say

1883
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy

1884
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version

1885
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I really kind of wanted to see how it works

1886
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
With the screen and everything

1887
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'm very curious. It could be interesting

1888
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
This is me

1889
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
With no fucks left to give

1890
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Stop

1891
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm just gonna play it on PC

1892
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It's already fun

1893
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen

1894
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Or something, but I don't care

1895
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there

1896
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And a copy of Mass Effect 3

1897
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You know when you come over you'd be like

1898
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I want to kind of see it

1899
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I want it to make me buy a Wii U

1900
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
What would be enough

1901
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
To make you buy a Wii U?

1902
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Fuck if I knew

1903
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
How about a good system?

1904
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
How about it being good?

1905
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
How about it having good games?

1906
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm not saying it doesn't have good games

1907
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We don't know yet

1908
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
This is the problem with Mass Effect 3

1909
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I already have Mass Effect 3

1910
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Shut up

1911
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Uh oh, uh oh

1912
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Dan's got something to say

1913
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
See this is from the woman

1914
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Who wanted a Wii to start with

1915
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
She waited in line overnight

1916
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I was like, fuck the Wii

1917
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's last gen

1918
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
This is the man who played

1919
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Twilight Princess for hours

1920
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours

1921
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I didn't play through Twilight Princess

1922
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
The Zelda games are good

1923
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But at the same time

1924
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I try to do surgery

1925
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I just think it's a stupid idea

1926
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying

1927
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I already have Mass Effect

1928
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect

1929
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
How about you shut the fuck up

1930
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And let me finish what I was saying

1931
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it

1932
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah

1933
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
That was what I was trying to say, dumb butt

1934
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Goody goody gumdrops

1935
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Give Rob back his mic

1936
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Give Rob back his mic

1937
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
No

1938
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
To be fair

1939
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Dan's making a point we've made on this show before

1940
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's hard to get excited about

1941
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
You know, Arkham City redone

1942
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Mass Effect 3 redone

1943
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It's not even that redone

1944
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You can tilt the Wii U tablet

1945
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
To move the battering round

1946
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You can do that also with the 6 axis controller

1947
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
On the PS3 version

1948
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I would love

1949
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Please Nintendo

1950
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday

1951
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And be like, here's what's coming

1952
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It better have like

1953
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Shut up Dan

1954
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Don't make me buy it, okay

1955
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But no seriously, they could come out Thursday and say

1956
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You know, we've got this Zelda

1957
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Or this F-Zero

1958
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Or this new IP that looks really cute

1959
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I would like for that to happen

1960
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That would make me very happy

1961
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
The only thing I fear

1962
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Is that there's a new excite truck

1963
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I want the bite if it's a new excite truck

1964
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet

1965
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Are you kidding?

1966
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It would be amazing

1967
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It would be absolutely amazing

1968
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Use a mic

1969
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Alright

1970
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Let's move on

1971
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I was still

1972
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh I'm sorry, go ahead

1973
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Shut up

1974
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm done

1975
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Are you gonna let him win?

1976
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'll get him later

1977
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Oh, okay

1978
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Let's travel around the world

1979
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And check out release dates of games that are coming out

1980
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
A little sooner than a Wii U

1981
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
There's actually some stuff coming out this week

1982
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Finding Nemo Escape to Big Blue

1983
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The special edition being

1984
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
re-released now by Disney Interactive

1985
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
As opposed to THQ because guess what?

1986
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo

1987
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
That they're re-releasing into theaters

1988
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Kind of appropriate

1989
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's also coming out on the 3DS as well

1990
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So it's not just the DS this time

1991
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Because I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements

1992
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
What happened to movies on the 3DS?

1993
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Wasn't that supposed to be a thing?

1994
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah

1995
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's a serious question

1996
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
They had a couple

1997
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
They did the Tekken 1

1998
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Oh, that's right

1999
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I mean

2000
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
The Tekken 1

2001
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Didn't they do Pokemon anime on Game Boy Advance cartridges?

2002
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Where's my Tron legacy?

2003
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It was a different time

2004
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
That was in E3, remember?

2005
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
When they had those demos for it

2006
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Because that technology just vaporized

2007
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And they gave you free headphones

2008
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Okay, let me put it this way

2009
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises

2010
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Never comes to fruition like online

2011
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But

2012
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
There's a dig at the Wii U

2013
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I'm telling you that online's gonna suck

2014
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Battlefield 3

2015
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
The premium edition for 60 bucks

2016
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You get all the DLC

2017
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360

2018
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
This week

2019
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
NHL 13 on PS3 and 360

2020
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2

2021
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
For PS3 and 360

2022
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Also NHL The Stanley Cup Collector's Edition

2023
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Which is probably a complete waste of money

2024
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Unless you like DLC

2025
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That is coming out for 80 bucks on PS3 and 360

2026
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And

2027
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game

2028
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
For 2012 and probably 2013

2029
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
NBA Baller Beats

2030
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
For Xbox 360

2031
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Fuck yes

2032
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
The game where you have to dribble a basketball

2033
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
To the beat of the music

2034
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
On my carpet

2035
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
In front of Kinect

2036
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Because that's gonna fucking work

2037
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That is coming out this week

2038
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
This game is gonna scare the shit out of the cats

2039
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I can't wait

2040
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
One week from today

2041
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Kirby's Dream Land

2042
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Collector's Special Edition

2043
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
That's too many fucking adjectives

2044
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Collector's Special Edition is too much

2045
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Just call it a

2046
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Special Edition or Collector's Edition

2047
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition

2048
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Limited

2049
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It can't be a 20 years anniversary edition

2050
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Just call it

2051
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Virtual Console Games we could have released

2052
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But we decided to put them on a fucking cart

2053
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Or I'm sorry, CD

2054
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
DVD, whatever, disc

2055
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
It has a cart painted on it

2056
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Hey you know what though?

2057
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And it comes with a special gold cartridge

2058
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That has absolutely nothing inside it

2059
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
At the very least, at least there is

2060
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
More than one ROM on this fucking disc

2061
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
As opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars

2062
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
As a limited edition

2063
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
More than having people buy it for $80

2064
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It has that little retrospective

2065
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Hallway new thing in it

2066
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Look at that

2067
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Well bravo for Nintendo

2068
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
For putting a minute

2069
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Bit of effort into it

2070
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Act deft in our chatroom

2071
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
At live.vognetwork.com

2072
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Fuck you Loki, Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants

2073
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Orange right says

2074
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Super Hyper Kirby EX

2075
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Plus Alpha Zero Turbo

2076
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And then I added for matching service

2077
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You know what? Kirby sucks

2078
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
No, Kirby doesn't suck

2079
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Actually he does suck

2080
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
That is the truth

2081
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
He also blows

2082
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Kirby blows

2083
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
He's gone from suck to blow

2084
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Moving on

2085
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Japanese releases

2086
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2

2087
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
They get in on the fun this week as well

2088
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
September 13 is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360

2089
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Going to the Playstation 3

2090
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Of course, same game there as well

2091
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And a game called Excel World

2092
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Ginyoku no Kakuse

2093
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Comes out, limited and regular editions

2094
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
From also

2095
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That sounds terribly boring, a whole world based on

2096
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
A database program

2097
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Not looking forward to that

2098
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Nothing on the Vita

2099
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
The little big planet is just a couple weeks away

2100
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
At this point in Japan

2101
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week

2102
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Metarot 7

2103
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Kabuto and Kuwagata versions

2104
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I don't know what game this

2105
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
This is two separate editions

2106
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So it looks like little

2107
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
This looks like fighting mech robots

2108
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Looks like you collect little mech robots

2109
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And fight them to the death

2110
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh shoot

2111
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I know what this is

2112
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Tell me that's not a total Pokemon inspired

2113
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Screenshot right there

2114
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I watched some of this

2115
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Where the guy gets

2116
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
These little robots

2117
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It turned out that his dad

2118
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Played these two or something

2119
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
He tried to beat up his little robot

2120
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But his robot wins

2121
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And tears up his house in the meantime

2122
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots

2123
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I don't remember

2124
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I only just saw it once

2125
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Robots tear up a house? Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?

2126
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Little teeny robots

2127
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Sengoku Musou

2128
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Chronicles 2

2129
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
On the 3DS as well

2130
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
You guys know what that is right?

2131
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Once again

2132
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And lastly but not least

2133
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Kiyoshitsu comes out from Nintendo

2134
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
On the 3DS this week

2135
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
This game is not something that looks

2136
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's an artist program

2137
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh this was one of the crazy wacky games

2138
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's art academy

2139
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I can't remember what it's coming out as

2140
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's art drawing things

2141
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Still life, art

2142
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences

2143
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
What the hell is this?

2144
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's coming out in October over here

2145
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I like that painting of the doggy

2146
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Not bad

2147
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Alright there you go that's Japanese releases

2148
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I think it's like art academy you can draw everything

2149
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I think is what it's called or something

2150
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
We'll figure it out

2151
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Go into the UK

2152
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm sorry I was still looking at this funny screenshot

2153
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So in the UK on the 11th

2154
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
We have Battlefield 3 Armored Kill

2155
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
On the 14th Joe Danger 2

2156
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The movie Tekken Tag Tournament 2

2157
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And Chaos Off Deponia

2158
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And

2159
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
That's it

2160
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Alright just a couple more news stories

2161
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
For you guys than the classic game of the week

2162
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But first Loki

2163
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So more Vita hacking

2164
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Independent developer

2165
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Yifan Lu

2166
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Has found an exploit that allows

2167
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Retail systems to run native

2168
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Homebrew Vita code

2169
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
As opposed to running

2170
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
PSP

2171
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Homebrew stuff because that's been the last few

2172
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Hacks

2173
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Okay hey we got some

2174
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Homebrew to run in the PSP mode or whatever

2175
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Using one of the games

2176
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That are out there that you can

2177
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Download to your console

2178
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Of course

2179
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
He's basically

2180
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Saying you know we're not

2181
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm gonna not make anything that

2182
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Will benefit piracy

2183
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
This tool is in fact

2184
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
This tool in fact cannot be used for loading

2185
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Backups or pirated content even if I

2186
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Wanted to because of the physical limitations

2187
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Of the exploit however

2188
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
He says that you know

2189
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
This kind of stuff could lead

2190
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
To people developing a better

2191
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Method that could lead to that stuff

2192
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
But as of right now he is

2193
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In no way endorsing piracy

2194
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Even though everyone thinks that

2195
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Homebrew equals piracy but that's

2196
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Kind of the

2197
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Situation that we're in right now

2198
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Of course he hasn't released any information on it yet

2199
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Because like before whenever

2200
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
They would release an exploit they would

2201
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Patch whatever game was involved with it

2202
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So hopefully

2203
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
This one isn't game reliant

2204
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Like the last few have been

2205
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
How quick do you think

2206
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Sony will patch this up I mean here we go

2207
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Again if it's game reliant pretty

2208
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Quick if it's not it might take a little

2209
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Bit or if it's even something they can

2210
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Patch it I mean they may they should be

2211
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Able to patch it pretty quick and so we don't know how they're

2212
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to

2213
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Get the jump on because before it used to be like

2214
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
You know even before they released something hey

2215
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You know this is the game

2216
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That you need to have in order to

2217
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
You know run this modified

2218
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Save that loads you know the bootloader

2219
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
For some PSP homebrew

2220
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Before that would run in PSP mode but now that

2221
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's in Vita mode you have more

2222
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Access to memory

2223
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And processing power and that kind of stuff

2224
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
It's not throttled like it was before

2225
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So hopefully

2226
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I mean I understand

2227
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
He's hoping that by saying oh

2228
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Yeah it's not going to really run any

2229
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
You know sort of exploit

2230
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
That'll allow you the pirate games

2231
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
That he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer

2232
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that

2233
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Shit as soon as they can

2234
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Alright one more story for you guys

2235
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

2236
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And this is about what was a

2237
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Classic video game network at one

2238
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Point G4

2239
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Some rumors going around about G4 look I want to make

2240
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It clear G4 hasn't been a gaming

2241
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Network for several years at this point

2242
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
You know they switched to that whole

2243
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Cops reruns and stuff quite some time

2244
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
What are their ties to gaming at this point

2245
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
X-Play and Attack of the Show

2246
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Sometimes but X-Play now doesn't have

2247
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Adam Sessler obviously

2248
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Cause he's gone

2249
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Is Morgan Webb still there though?

2250
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I think Morgan Webb's still there

2251
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Even Attack of the Show's lost a lot

2252
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Of their

2253
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Casts that people would watch it for

2254
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Well Variety published an article

2255
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This week that G4 is going geek

2256
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And more chic and this is rumor

2257
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Right now but because G4 is owned by

2258
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
NBC Universal, Comcast

2259
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
They want to change

2260
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
G4 into a direction that's more

2261
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Like GQ

2262
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
The modern male magazine

2263
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So basically I don't know how it's

2264
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
More modern male

2265
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
More refined I guess

2266
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I don't know what kind of programming that would entail

2267
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
So basically Spike but for high brow

2268
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
People

2269
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
For hipsters

2270
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So we're not going to have episodes of

2271
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
A Thousand Ways to Die

2272
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Involve women with big boobs

2273
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Bouncing up and down or explosions

2274
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm not really interested

2275
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Me neither because Logo still has

2276
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing

2277
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
On cable worth watching

2278
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So high brow are they talking about more like GQ

2279
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So they're going to start rerunning episodes of

2280
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that

2281
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Is that how they're going? Is it going to be like the

2282
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Metrosexual channel or something?

2283
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Who knows? I don't know

2284
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Maybe the guys who flip the

2285
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Million Dollar Homes

2286
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
The real estate shows

2287
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It's going to be garbage whatever it is

2288
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
We'll see we'll see but regardless

2289
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Any video game ties

2290
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You might have to this network are

2291
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Looking to be severed pretty soon

2292
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It hasn't been dumped from

2293
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Satellite providers at this point

2294
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
They're not doing too well

2295
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Like you said there's been a huge turnover and so forth

2296
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
So

2297
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
American Ninja Warrior may not have

2298
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
A place on GQ

2299
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
That actually was a pretty good show

2300
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
There's nothing to say about this

2301
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's probably going to get a new name

2302
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
That's the other reason that makes this a big deal

2303
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Is because G4 will probably become something

2304
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I can tell you right now American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike

2305
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So I'm sure that won't be gone for long

2306
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So there you go

2307
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
We'll talk a little more about this story in Part B

2308
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
With our FUGO Question of the Week

2309
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But for now

2310
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Let's take a trip down memory lane

2311
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
For a moment shall we?

2312
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
With a segment we call

2313
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
The Classic Game of the Week

2314
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Where DarkSakura steps into the classic

2315
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Gaming vault

2316
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Moves Shirmi aside

2317
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Blows the dust off the cabinet

2318
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Shirmi's probably still sitting in her older box

2319
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Pulls out a game that she says

2320
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Hey! Play this game this week

2321
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
You ungrateful little brat

2322
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
This comes from a time before there was

2323
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Ultra Limited Collector

2324
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Mega Edition for Special

2325
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Week, whatever it is

2326
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Midnight Special Edition

2327
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
That sounds kinky

2328
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Doesn't it? A little bit?

2329
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Well this game is not so kinky

2330
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But this is a game I looked at it and I went really?

2331
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
In 200 episodes plus

2332
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Of this segment she has not done this game?

2333
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I checked

2334
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Well it's about fucking time this week DarkSakura

2335
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
What is the Classic Game of the Week?

2336
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Blaster Master

2337
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
In Japan it was called

2338
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Chōwakusei Senki Meta Fight

2339
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Which translates to

2340
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Planetary War Record Meta Fight

2341
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Which honestly is a really

2342
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Freaking cool name

2343
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It came out in the US in

2344
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
November 1988 and in Europe

2345
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
On April 25th, 1991

2346
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah they had to wait a long ass time to get this

2347
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We just had to wait a few months after Japan

2348
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
But yeah

2349
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
This game went from having

2350
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
A killer story in Japan

2351
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
To having the dumbest

2352
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Story ever in the US

2353
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I mean that doesn't affect how awesome

2354
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
The game itself was

2355
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Ok get this

2356
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
The Japanese version you're like

2357
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
An explorer landing on Sophia III

2358
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
The planet

2359
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And you have to

2360
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Explore where this ancient civilization was

2361
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And stop this evil emperor

2362
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And go through the whole planet

2363
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Dan shut up

2364
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Hold on I'm getting Dan to comment

2365
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
No seriously man

2366
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It's a game where you drive a tank to save a frog

2367
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
In the US one

2368
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Jamie never played Blaster Master

2369
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
She doesn't know nothing about Blaster Master

2370
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I'm gonna tell you about Blaster Master

2371
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Blaster Master is awesome

2372
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
First of all it's by Sunsoft

2373
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So you know that the music is super

2374
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Choice for the NES

2375
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Second of all it's tough as fucking nails

2376
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
The game is really

2377
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Really hard even for a NES game

2378
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I mean it is Nintendo hard

2379
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And there's no save function

2380
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Which is pretty brutal cause it's not a

2381
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Short game and you upgrade the tank

2382
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And when you die

2383
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And the tank is called Sophia in the NES version

2384
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Sophia III which I always thought was really

2385
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Kind of weird but it's cute in a way

2386
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And you can make it fly

2387
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
You can drive on walls

2388
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
You can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls

2389
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You can jump out of the tank

2390
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And your little dude runs around

2391
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Or you can go into like caves and you run around

2392
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons

2393
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Independently of the character

2394
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Who's named Jason and the tank

2395
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Which once again is named Sophia

2396
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline

2397
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Cause who fucking cares

2398
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
The Japanese version

2399
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
The Japanese version was a

2400
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Failure

2401
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
The Nintendo version is a classic

2402
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Is it both Nintendo?

2403
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
No no no no

2404
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
The NES version

2405
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Whatever you completely didn't

2406
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Listen to anything that I said

2407
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Rob take the mic please

2408
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
The Japanese version of an epic storyline

2409
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It was so wonderful

2410
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The Nintendo version you drive a tank

2411
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
To save a frog

2412
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's awesome

2413
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Saves your frog

2414
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And you can use the pause trick and kill the bosses real easy

2415
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's amazing

2416
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it and then they die

2417
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Now to be fair we might have somebody who's like 14

2418
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Listening to this program with their parents

2419
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
For permission of course

2420
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Jamie please

2421
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Let's continue telling the listeners about

2422
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Master Master

2423
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Well as Dan said there is no save feature

2424
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Whatever

2425
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Shut up

2426
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Jason and Sophia

2427
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Have different power meters

2428
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So they can

2429
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
They take

2430
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Dan you're flustering her

2431
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Let her get through the segment

2432
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And then fluster her while we're on break

2433
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'm about to cut a bitch

2434
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
At any rate

2435
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You've got different power meters

2436
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You can power up separately

2437
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You get 5 continues which he didn't say

2438
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
And you can

2439
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Restart the game at the same level

2440
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
In which you lost all of your lives

2441
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
You have a hover gauge that

2442
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Controls how much thrust

2443
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Is left in your tank

2444
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I don't believe you brought up that the tank

2445
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Flies

2446
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
He did

2447
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh my bad

2448
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Are you the king

2449
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Are you the king of blaster master

2450
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I'm the blaster master

2451
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
James is like

2452
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I play blaster master

2453
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We can turn on the desk right now

2454
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
We can actually turn on 2 nesses and we can have a blaster master

2455
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Race and I will fuck her shit up

2456
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But if we played mass effect

2457
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah that wouldn't even be a good race

2458
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
She'd murder the shit out of me

2459
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
If we cut us out

2460
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Give me the mic

2461
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
For other releases that came out

2462
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
There was

2463
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
A re-release on the playstation

2464
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
For blaster master

2465
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Itself

2466
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Actually my apologies for meta fight

2467
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And ripple island

2468
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Came out on playstation in

2469
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
The volume 4 of sunsoft memorial

2470
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Series in 2002

2471
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And then it came out on the Wii virtual console

2472
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
On December 14th 2009

2473
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And um

2474
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
There was

2475
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Meta fight was re-released for the

2476
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Virtual console on June 29th

2477
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
2010

2478
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
There was blaster master overdrive

2479
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
That um

2480
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Honestly I didn't give a crap about

2481
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So I'm not gonna talk about it

2482
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah

2483
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I actually played the Wii

2484
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Believe it or not I played the Wii remake

2485
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's it just didn't

2486
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Have the charm of the original

2487
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
For me like it just felt I remember the

2488
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Controls bugged me like I seem to

2489
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
It was a few years ago but I remember the controls

2490
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Really bothered me that was an issue

2491
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
That was released by victor ireland

2492
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
From working design

2493
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And rest in peace

2494
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
New company Gaijin works

2495
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yeah Gaijin works There was also a sequel on the

2496
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Genesis which was not

2497
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Produced by the original creator which was not so

2498
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Good there was kind of a pseudo

2499
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Remake for the gameboy advance

2500
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Called uh like enemy within

2501
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Actually no it was for gameboy color

2502
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Which was also not as good

2503
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And there was a punishment from god

2504
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Succo on the playstation called blaster master

2505
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Blasting again

2506
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So really there's only one good blaster master game

2507
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
The whole reason why the story

2508
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Was changed is because um

2509
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
You have to give them credit

2510
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Frogs are pretty awesome

2511
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
They're slimy and stupid

2512
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And they make you hallucinate

2513
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Anyway they changed it because they didn't think

2514
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That the space exploration

2515
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Would be popular in the US

2516
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
That whole genre of anime

2517
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Hadn't really made it over

2518
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
And so they changed it to Jason and his

2519
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Frog and used the name

2520
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Of the planet Sophia the third

2521
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
There was a portion

2522
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Of the map in the fourth level

2523
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
That did not map over

2524
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So actually you have to make this

2525
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Huge jump

2526
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Off a ladder suspended in mid air

2527
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I'm not gonna say anymore

2528
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Alright

2529
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It's an amazing

2530
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Game it's one of my favorite NES games

2531
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Ever and the soundtrack we can't say

2532
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Enough about the soundtrack I mean it's just

2533
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Like I love the soundtrack it's amazing

2534
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
So good alright

2535
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
So then that's it there it is your

2536
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Classic game of the week actually

2537
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Sophia the third made an appearance in

2538
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
A flash game called Super Mario Brothers

2539
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Crossover that we've talked about on the show

2540
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Before how'd that kickstarter

2541
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Go for them they

2542
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Made it they made more than

2543
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Initial I figured they would

2544
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Good times

2545
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Alright this game is hard

2546
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
As hell

2547
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Alright there it is blast I was just watching the

2548
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
YouTube in the background remembering having a horrible

2549
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Horrible nightmares of the game alright there it is

2550
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I thought that that particular playthrough it was

2551
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Because it was a non machine assisted speed run

2552
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
That takes

2553
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
That looked like the

2554
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You can kind of tell when it's an emulator

2555
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And when it's that dirty connection

2556
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
To the TV through an RCA cable like

2557
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
You kind of tell the difference on YouTube and that was definitely

2558
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
The TV being plugged in there so

2559
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

2560
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Blaster Master

2561
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
We're gonna take a break here but don't go anywhere

2562
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
We've got plenty more of show to come

01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000

During the uh skype line

I don't want to be involved in our discussions

2572
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000

Welcome back everybody

2577
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000

2012 Dreamcast day

01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
At vognetwork.com the voice of

2581
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Geeks network we've had a pretty exciting show

2582
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So far this tonight

2583
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Dark Sakura I think they hugged it out

2584
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
During the break yes we're good

2585
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
More like I collapsed on him because I have

2586
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
A headache aw I'm sorry

2587
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
It's okay and something

2588
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
We didn't talk about during part A because we just had so

2589
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Much other stuff going on with the bungee ferret tossing

2590
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And all that we're having Mexican night

2591
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

2592
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Where we've been eating burritos

2593
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
And quesadillas and you know

2594
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Slinging guacamole sadly not

2595
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Real Mexican food like

2596
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Taco bell but much better because it's homemade

2597
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
So kinda yeah

2598
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
We went to the grocery store and got stuff

2599
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
So there you go it's

2600
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
That kind of night here at Orange Lounge Radio Studios

2601
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Okay a couple quick announcements for you guys

2602
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
First off Dark Sakura wants to say something

2603
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And what did I have music for this?

2604
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yes

2605
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Last Saturday was my

2606
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Advanced anniversary

2607
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
We've been married for seven years

2608
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Or was it seven thousand

2609
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
He says at least

2610
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
We've been okay

2611
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
In January

2612
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Coming up next year

2613
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
We will have been together

2614
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
For fifteen years but we've been married

2615
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
For seven

2616
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Yes

2617
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You are such a dork

2618
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
What am I supposed to say?

2619
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I don't know

2620
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I'm leaving you

2621
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Okay this is funny

2622
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Because Rob's cutting his quesadilla with fingers

2623
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
You use a pizza cutter

2624
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Really?

2625
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Rob doesn't have a mic so you can't hear any of this

2626
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Anyway

2627
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So yeah

2628
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Dan and I have been married for seven years

2629
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yay

2630
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
The end

2631
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I love your vision

2632
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I did

2633
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I went back to Alabama and got my clique-o-vision

2634
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And brought it back

2635
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
And then I found someone at work

2636
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That was selling a clique-o-vision

2637
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I found them on the work message boards

2638
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And told you about it

2639
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
You are a liar

2640
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
No I'm not

2641
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
You are such a liar

2642
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Definitely married for seven years

2643
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Jamie and Dan

2644
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Congratulations

2645
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Couple quick things

2646
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
We are just a couple weeks away

2647
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
From episode four hundred and seventy-five

2648
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Wait, one more thing

2649
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
On September 2nd

2650
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I converted

2651
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I became Jewish

2652
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I thought you had already had that

2653
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
No, not this last one

2654
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It meant two years past my conversion

2655
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It was the anniversary

2656
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And that's why you're not here next week

2657
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Because Rosh Hashanah starts

2658
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So Happy New Year all the Jews out there

2659
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Understandable, have a good week off

2660
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Hope you'll listen to the podcast during the week

2661
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Maybe

2662
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Anyhow, episode four seventy-five is coming up

2663
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
We might have some surprises in store

2664
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
So be sure you're here that night

2665
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Mostly for the long-time OLR fans

2666
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
There's something brewing

2667
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Where you long-time OLR fans

2668
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Are going to be like, what?

2669
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
That's all I'm going to say

2670
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Episode four seventy-five, be here

2671
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Alright

2672
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Because reasons

2673
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Rapid Fire News

2674
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Is up next

2675
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
While I finish cutting my quesadilla

2676
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Which, by the way, smells delicious

2677
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You take all the pictures you want

2678
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Of my delicious quesadilla

2679
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
From the work-provided quesadilla maker

2680
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
That I won, thank you

2681
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Picture with scissors

2682
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
So there's a new free Vita game

2683
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
That you can download

2684
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It's called Treasure Park

2685
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And basically it's a game that allows you

2686
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
To create your own grid-based puzzles

2687
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
And with hidden objects and bombs and stuff

2688
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And you can share them with your friends in the near app

2689
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That might be a reason

2690
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
For me to play my Vita

2691
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That I haven't played

2692
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet

2693
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, I heard it was really short though

2694
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It is, but they have all the online level

2695
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
It's a good game

2696
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Alright, fine

2697
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And that pinball, that pinball, now that I haven't really played

2698
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
But I hear it's good, I played it on Xbox

2699
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection

2700
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
As well as the God of War

2701
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
PS3 collections

2702
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Those have been given

2703
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
An update to allow for remote play

2704
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
On the Vita

2705
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix

2706
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
On the go, which is pretty sweet

2707
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Of course

2708
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Those include the first two God of War games

2709
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Ego and Shadow of the Colossus

2710
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So that's pretty sweet

2711
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And last but not least

2712
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Angry Birds is getting

2713
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Yet another spinoff this time in the form

2714
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Of Bad Piggies

2715
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Where you're gonna take the

2716
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Villains, I guess, of the game and play as them

2717
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
In puzzle-like fashion

2718
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I'm sure

2719
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac

2720
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
September 27th

2721
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
With other versions

2722
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Windows Phone, Windows 8

2723
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And PC

2724
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Later on, I guess

2725
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Oh, it doesn't sound very exciting

2726
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But I'm not a big Angry Birds fan

2727
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Nah

2728
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did

2729
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Of course

2730
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Alright, um

2731
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Metroid

2732
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
On the Wii U

2733
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Do I have your attention?

2734
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Alright, well here's the unfortunate part

2735
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
It's just part of Nintendo Land

2736
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat

2737
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version

2738
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Of the Battle.me prototype, if you ever saw that

2739
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
During the trade shows

2740
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
They showed this during the press conference

2741
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Yeah, but isn't this new?

2742
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
The screenshots and everything that are out now?

2743
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Not really

2744
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I thought this was some new stuff, whatever

2745
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
So fine, what's old is new again

2746
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I just got excited because it was Metroid

2747
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Alright, how about this?

2748
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
This is something that's been going around for like five years

2749
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And finally, finally

2750
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Making its way this week

2751
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Dark Tetsuya, listen up

2752
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
La Mulana, finally

2753
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
On WiiWare, September 20th

2754
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Is the big day

2755
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
This is a big sordid story here

2756
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It was gonna come out, and then it wasn't

2757
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Because they didn't think it would make money, da da da

2758
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
They said it was gonna be cancelled

2759
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Then the internet got mad, so here it is

2760
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
There was a lot of QQ

2761
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
The most complete archaeology action and exploration game

2762
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Ever created

2763
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
So that Indiana Jones game

2764
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
That was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game

2765
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I guess that can suck it

2766
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Cause this is the most complete

2767
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Archaeology action and exploration game

2768
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Ever created, over 40 hours of play

2769
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
No, for real

2770
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
For like retro looking games, it looks awesome

2771
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight

2772
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Because here, okay

2773
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I gotta admit

2774
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs

2775
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Cause I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world

2776
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
But the game blogs are saying

2777
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?

2778
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
No

2779
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Shit

2780
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U

2781
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Is like saying the sun is gonna rise in the morning

2782
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
That bears shit in the woods

2783
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
That's what you call a safe bet

2784
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And also what you call

2785
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
A headline that will get people to go

2786
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Oh my god, there's a Zelda game coming

2787
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I need to repog this everywhere

2788
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So your site gets

2789
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
You know, hits

2790
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It's all about the hits, folks

2791
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Here's the thing though

2792
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Why would it be 2014? Why not next year?

2793
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
They haven't announced one yet

2794
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
They've already announced everything they've got coming

2795
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So what's gonna be their big thing next year?

2796
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
They've gotta have something big, big, big next year

2797
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Next year

2798
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Well, unless it's a 3D Mario

2799
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
A Donkey Kong poop throwing game

2800
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Smash Brothers are thinking

2801
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Remember in 2013

2802
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Those Smash Brothers games always take forever

2803
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I don't know

2804
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Alright, that's all I got

2805
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Dark Sakura

2806
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Well, other news

2807
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
We have a

2808
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
A new trademark from Squeenix

2809
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Called Circle of Mana

2810
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So maybe it's gonna

2811
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Be out in that series, who knows

2812
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
The last one that came out was

2813
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Heroes of Mana, which I didn't even bother

2814
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
No news

2815
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
No news yet on Circle of Evermore?

2816
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
No

2817
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
And then Ace Attorney 5

2818
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Will be coming out

2819
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And

2820
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Let me

2821
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
See if there is a date on here

2822
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Well, it doesn't say the date

2823
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
But we're gonna be getting it here and

2824
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
In Europe

2825
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I saw some of the

2826
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Pictures for it

2827
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Who was that other girl that has the side ponytail?

2828
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
She looks awful

2829
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
And then

2830
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Emma, I guess

2831
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I don't know, I hate her pigtail

2832
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And then

2833
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Rhythm Thief

2834
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Is supposed to be coming to the IOS

2835
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
This winter

2836
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So this one is just gonna be

2837
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
One player

2838
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And I think should have leaderboard options

2839
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So that's it

2840
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Sorry, my mouth is full

2841
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Of quesadilla

2842
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Rhythm Thief, I wanna play that though

2843
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Okay

2844
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm not stopping you

2845
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I played the demo on 3DS, it was good

2846
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
What is Dan playing over there? It sounds like a Mario game

2847
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Is that Wario something something?

2848
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Mario 2

2849
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I didn't even know that thing was charged

2850
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That's amazing

2851
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

2852
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Facebook, Google, put them together

2853
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You get foogle

2854
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And we ask a question every week

2855
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
And we read some of the answers

2856
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I wanna reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset

2857
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
That I don't read their answers

2858
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
If I read all the answers, it would be a 5 hour show

2859
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
So we picked some of the answers

2860
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
To read from Google Plus and Facebook

2861
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
About the question

2862
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
The question ties into a story from part A

2863
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through

2864
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Some changes

2865
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech

2866
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Some time ago, we wanna ask you about video game television

2867
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Do you think a dedicated

2868
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Video game television station could work

2869
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
In today's world?

2870
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
If you do, what kind of shows would you wanna see on it?

2871
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
If you don't think it would work, why not?

2872
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Entertainment on Google Plus starts

2873
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
They tried it

2874
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It was G4 in the beginning

2875
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
The problem was that G4 could never draw a large audience

2876
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
As measured by the Nielsen rating system

2877
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
The system is a critically flawed system

2878
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But it is the accepted system

2879
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Unless Nielsen changes to actually measure online

2880
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
In DVR

2881
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Or until Nielsen is thrown out entirely

2882
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
A cable network for gamers cannot survive for very long

2883
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Interesting

2884
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
You know what?

2885
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I actually equivalent the Nielsen system

2886
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
With using BMI to track health

2887
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Both of them are inherently

2888
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Flawed and useless

2889
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Technus replied on Google Plus and said

2890
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is

2891
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Long gone

2892
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns

2893
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
So much, it was nuts

2894
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I remember getting the channel as a preview channel

2895
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
And they would air the same old episodes that I saw

2896
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
A few months ago

2897
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist

2898
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Pretty well with finally cutting out the excess

2899
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Of reruns and shows that nobody really watched

2900
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
From both networks

2901
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV

2902
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
And then they flushed it down the drain and so forth

2903
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
He says at the end

2904
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Though it's all about video on demand

2905
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And IPTV services these days

2906
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And I think that's where a video game network can thrive

2907
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So he thinks in the traditional sense

2908
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
It's done

2909
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And Jim replies and says it would never work

2910
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
The channel wouldn't be able to be very critical

2911
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Of games or the industry in general

2912
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars

2913
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Would have to come from

2914
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Because he thinks that the conflict

2915
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
It would never work

2916
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I think there's some truth in that

2917
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
They can be pretty mean sometimes

2918
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Alright, going over to Facebook

2919
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And checking out some of the answers on Facebook

2920
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Which there's a lot

2921
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And I'm never going to be able to get through some of these

2922
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Another comment from Dark Charger

2923
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
About IPTV becoming the norm

2924
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Nutman says

2925
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I think a video game channel could work

2926
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
But TV executives need to step out of the way

2927
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
G4, like many other TV endeavors

2928
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Failed because guys in suits thought they knew

2929
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Better than the people they hired

2930
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Scott Rubin and others behind G4

2931
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Were met with opposition on everything

2932
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And eventually just gave up entirely

2933
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Executives set it up for failure

2934
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And then asked everybody why it failed

2935
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
So they need to get rid of the management

2936
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Red the Haze says

2937
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Nope, every now and then I remember

2938
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Tech TV and G4 missed those channels

2939
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
But then I remember we have the internet now

2940
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Ronnie says yes it would work

2941
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
There will always be the casual market

2942
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
That doesn't know as much as we do on the internet

2943
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4

2944
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I imagine it would be extremely casual

2945
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Tigerclaw says

2946
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
The problem with having a cable network

2947
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal

2948
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
To a certain demographic which is relatively

2949
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Small to a mass audience

2950
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Who needs a 24 hour cable network devoted to video games

2951
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online

2952
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Looking at some of the other answers

2953
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Degenerate Johnny says

2954
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Especially with the YouTube channels and internet shows

2955
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Being dedicated to video games

2956
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I think that a cable network channel would not work for long

2957
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
So many of these e-shows and podcasts

2958
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content

2959
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
To satisfy gamers of all ages

2960
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Such features include up to date news

2961
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
The latest reviews of games and DLC

2962
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Etcetera

2963
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
These features are all that the average video gamer requires

2964
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV

2965
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
For something that could easily be accessed on the internet

2966
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
In an entertaining fashion

2967
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
We killed G4

2968
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Degenerate Johnny

2969
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Mike simply says

2970
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yes it would work

2971
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how to, achievements

2972
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Type shows

2973
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Wicked says

2974
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market

2975
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
With how diverse and expansive the internet is

2976
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Gaming content that would be on a television network

2977
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Is numerous

2978
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But too far and wide for some

2979
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses

2980
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Would concentrate a lot of good shows

2981
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Topics and games in one location

2982
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
For easy digestion

2983
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
As for what should be on the network

2984
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
That simple

2985
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Look at G4 Tech TV

2986
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Both separate entities during the merger

2987
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And name some various shows there

2988
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It was easy to fill up the network with gaming

2989
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Though a lot of it was tech

2990
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But also hey they knew the demographic

2991
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And I think if done properly it could thrive again

2992
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Just not as G4

2993
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
God I hope not

2994
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Lastly Pete Garuno says

2995
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Charlie Brooker's Game Swipe

2996
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

2998
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Thanks to everybody and Google Plus as well

2999
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio

3000
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Plus and you'll find that

3001
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Thank you to everybody who answered

3002
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
How about you folks here in studio

3003
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Would it work or is it done?

3004
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
It's done

3005
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Well I mean really everyone said

3006
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It goes back to what the other people said

3007
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
The internet's taken over

3008
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And besides that

3009
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game

3010
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
On their TV than watch a show on their TV

3011
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I mean me I don't even watch TV

3012
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I download my shows on the internet

3013
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who

3014
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And that's it

3015
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
If there was a dedicated video game station

3016
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Or station

3017
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
A channel on TV I still wouldn't watch it

3018
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I remember there used to be a show on G4

3019
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
That just showed nothing but gameplay footage

3020
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Like little five minute clips of gameplay footage

3021
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It was a way to like sample all the new games

3022
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
It was interesting

3023
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I have the internet for that

3024
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I mean there's plenty of times when

3025
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Like Dan said

3026
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game

3027
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And look up

3028
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
A particular path in a game that I want to do

3029
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Or

3030
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
He watches playthroughs of stuff

3031
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
All the time

3032
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It's really just

3033
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I don't think that

3034
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It would have to be one or the other

3035
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
If TV was the only way to get the information

3036
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Then yeah then it would work

3037
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But there's so many other outlets

3038
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
That are so convenient

3039
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And you don't have to wait for programming times

3040
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Or wait for it to record

3041
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
It's there when you want it

3042
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
The chatters jumped in

3043
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Cinematech was the show I was thinking of

3044
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Loki

3045
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah it's going to be hard for them

3046
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I think the problem would be

3047
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It's too niche for them to have enough

3048
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Revenue

3049
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Revenue dollars from ads and stuff

3050
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
To warrant keeping the station

3051
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It's just too

3052
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Before going away where it's so generic

3053
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Now that

3054
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You know it gets more viewers I guess

3055
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
People like watching cops and stuff

3056
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
At weird hours at night or they'll just shut

3057
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Off the station for a few hours

3058
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And run their infomercials that's what they do

3059
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Like late at night

3060
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
My answer is yes and no

3061
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Because I think all

3062
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Networks in a sense traditional TV

3063
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
And cable as we know it is all kind of

3064
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
On a ticking clock here

3065
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
And it's really about being able to evolve

3066
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And I think you see a lot of it with tying

3067
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Into the

3068
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Xbox style content

3069
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that

3070
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Even Comcast getting in on that

3071
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And a lot more of that on demand style stuff

3072
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Hulu, Netflix

3073
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I think if a gaming company could kind of build

3074
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Itself around that primary

3075
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And be a cable network secondary

3076
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
They'd be in a much better place

3077
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Than say

3078
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Somebody coming around and just trying to copy

3079
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
G4

3080
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
It's going to be doomed

3081
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Dan

3082
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It could have been doable

3083
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I mean I don't know if it could still be doable

3084
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Because again the money is hard but

3085
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
The problem is that they never played it straight

3086
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Like even the biggest names

3087
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
You know when they had the video game shows

3088
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag

3089
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
He was just such a fucking retard

3090
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And you'd watch and just be like

3091
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I don't want to be associated with this guy

3092
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
And then they had the girl

3093
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Who wasn't really good looking

3094
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Enough to be kind of eye candy

3095
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And people were just like

3096
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Well they're not really talking to gamers

3097
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
They're kind of

3098
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Just doing their thing

3099
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And I believe that they were gamers

3100
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
I believe that they cared about what they were doing

3101
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I just never thought that they were good

3102
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I don't think that they played it real

3103
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I think that if there was a show

3104
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I don't think there could be a network

3105
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
But I think there could be a show

3106
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
That did the trick

3107
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
You know if it played it real and not douchey

3108
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I get what you're saying

3109
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows

3110
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Felt like they were catered to 12 year old boys

3111
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And it gets old

3112
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Talk up to me not down to me

3113
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Some folks in the chat

3114
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
GDR dollar bill agreed with you

3115
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
He said Sessler was a tool

3116
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But fifth dream does not

3117
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Sessler was pretty awesome

3118
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
But Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV

3119
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Because that's all they really needed

3120
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Is one show dedicated to video games

3121
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
And the rest was pretty awesome

3122
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
That's the network you need to copy

3123
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
If you're going to try to copy a network

3124
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Don't copy G4, copy tech TV

3125
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Because that was awesome

3126
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
That's a network I think that could have actually made it

3127
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Give it a little bit more advertising

3128
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Alright, well

3129
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Go ahead, one last thought

3130
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I just don't really understand why

3131
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
TV is still big

3132
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
When you've got the internet

3133
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
What Dan watches is like one show on TV now

3134
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
MasterChef

3135
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And then the rest

3136
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And the rest of it we use

3137
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
The internet, we have Hulu

3138
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
We have everything else

3139
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I'm really paying an insane amount for cable

3140
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Cable is going to go

3141
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well

3142
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And Dan likes MasterChef

3143
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
It's kind of going the way of the landline telephone

3144
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
A lot of people get rid of those too

3145
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Alright, in the meantime

3146
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Let's move on with gaming news

3147
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Thank you again to the folks on Facebook and Google who answered

3148
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Loki, let's start off with more gaming news

3149
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about

3150
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
GameStop

3151
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
But let's also talk about Ouya

3152
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
The GameStop of course is interested in

3153
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Ouya since

3154
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
As of recently they've been

3155
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Interested in pretty much anything that runs Android

3156
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
That they can turn around and

3157
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Get people to pre-order or resell or something like that

3158
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
And it says of course

3159
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
We will be a part of any console launch

3160
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
In the future

3161
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
That's when they were asked about Ouya

3162
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
We think Ouya is cool

3163
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
It has open source components

3164
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Everything we've read is great

3165
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And of course they're used to

3166
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Selling DLCs

3167
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So assuming that this is kind of like

3168
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Steam or Xbox Live Arcade

3169
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Or Playstation or something like that

3170
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
They would probably have like

3171
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Codes that could be redeemed for

3172
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Apps and stuff on there

3173
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But at the same time

3174
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I don't think you can go to

3175
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
GameStop and buy

3176
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
An app that's on the Android marketplace

3177
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Or something like that or Google Play

3178
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
You can't just go hey

3179
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Dan no one can hear you when you don't have a mic

3180
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
It's just like

3181
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I don't know

3182
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I just don't know if people would really

3183
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
They're kind of pointless

3184
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
When it comes to

3185
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Buying stuff online

3186
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something

3187
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
That I can purchase online without having to

3188
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Drive down to the store

3189
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Aside from I'm trading in something

3190
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
But that only works if you're trading in like a console game

3191
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Because right now there's no trading on

3192
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Digital games

3193
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So if really you're playing on a system

3194
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Let's say you only own an OUYA

3195
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
You're probably not going to be going down to them

3196
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
For anything

3197
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Except for maybe hardware and accessories

3198
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Assuming you need like another

3199
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
OUYA controller or something

3200
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
If you didn't want to buy it online

3201
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Well this is all kind of about

3202
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Evolving to match what people want

3203
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Because if OUYA is

3204
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Going to be this big deal GameStop wants a piece of it

3205
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Because

3206
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
GameStop's another one of those companies

3207
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Where as digital distribution becomes more and more

3208
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
They're getting a little worried

3209
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And then another thing

3210
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
There was a game that was on Kickstarter

3211
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Mercenary Kings

3212
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Of course they've surpassed their goal that they had

3213
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
But now they're saying

3214
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
They're going to be

3215
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Putting it on the OUYA as well

3216
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
So right now they're

3217
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Allowing anybody

3218
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
That's ordered a digital copy of the game

3219
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Which is $15 pledged

3220
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
You'll get a copy of the

3221
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Steam key and you'll get a copy of

3222
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
The OUYA key which they believe that there's going to be

3223
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
A key system for that

3224
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet

3225
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
But in some way they'll try to

3226
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Get it so that you can

3227
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Play that and for those who are not aware

3228
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Mercenary Kings is a game that's

3229
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Kind of a cross between Metal Slug and

3230
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Minecraft I guess

3231
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
You craft things based on the

3232
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Components that are dropped

3233
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
By the enemies and it's also

3234
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Animated by Paul Robinson who does

3235
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Really kick ass

3236
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
8 bit, 16 bit

3237
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Animated gifs and he also did the

3238
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Animation in the Scott

3239
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade

3240
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So it is worth checking out

3241
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I backed it

3242
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I love Paul Robinson

3243
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
That sounds like something

3244
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
To check out

3245
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
He's got an awesome animated gif with a dog with an eye patch

3246
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And a robotic dog shooting

3247
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Bullets and glowing dogs

3248
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Nice

3249
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Alright well moving in a different direction here

3250
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Talking about MMOs for a little bit and a way

3251
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
That you could make money off of MMOs

3252
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Sony Online Entertainment

3253
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Not to be totally confused

3254
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
With Playstation 3 stuff because

3255
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
The MMO business is a little

3256
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Different, it's another arm of the company

3257
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
You do see crossover once in a while like

3258
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
What was that, Free Realms or something

3259
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Is on Playstation 3

3260
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It's not worth your time but you might have heard

3261
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2

3262
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
DC Universe

3263
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
That's a big one, thank you

3264
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
These are all big games

3265
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
SOE is looking into

3266
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Something where you the player

3267
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Can create in game items

3268
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And if Sony

3269
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Online Entertainment adds them to the shop

3270
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
You would get a kick back

3271
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Once complete

3272
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Players are encouraged to name and create a description

3273
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
For the item, describe how the item would fit

3274
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Into the perspective games ongoing narrative

3275
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Storyline and submit it to SOE

3276
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
For review and possible inclusion in the SOE

3277
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Marketplace. If a player created

3278
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Item is selected for inclusion in the

3279
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Marketplace, SOE will share

3280
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
40% of the net amount it receives

3281
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
From the sale of the item with the player that created

3282
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
The item. Now before you get too

3283
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Excited or wonder how SOE would

3284
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Not drown under these requests

3285
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Keep in mind to create these items

3286
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
You're gonna have to know how to do 3D

3287
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Modeling. So if you don't know Maya

3288
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Or 3DS Max you

3289
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
May not exactly get to get on this

3290
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Also you don't get to pick stats

3291
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
That's something

3292
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Sony gets to do

3293
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
You can do the design

3294
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
You can do the item and the lore behind it

3295
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
But ultimately it will be up to

3296
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Sony Online Entertainment

3297
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Very interesting

3298
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Sort of prospect but

3299
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Maybe they're thinking word of mouth

3300
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
To help these games succeed because let's say I have

3301
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
An item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of

3302
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I'm likely to start advertising

3303
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
For the game and tell all these people

3304
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Hey go buy my item

3305
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
And it kind of helps the game get more exposure

3306
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And possibly generate

3307
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
More sales which

3308
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Sony gets a cut of

3309
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Not unlike the iOS Marketplace or what have you

3310
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
So

3311
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
It's definitely a neat idea

3312
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I think people

3313
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Will probably use it

3314
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
If they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash

3315
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
We'll see

3316
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
There you go

3317
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Next story Dark Sakura

3318
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Sorry I had a little debate in the chat room

3319
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Oh anything you want to share?

3320
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Progress

3321
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Why I think radio is going to go away

3322
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And why TV

3323
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Is going to go away

3324
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yeah but not tomorrow

3325
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
No I didn't say that at all but I'm saying that

3326
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
It may not even happen in our lifetime

3327
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
But this format isn't going to be around anymore

3328
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I gotta admit I really like radio though

3329
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Obviously we're a

3330
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Podcast so there's a radio element to it

3331
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But traditional radio

3332
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Is in trouble because of things like us

3333
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And satellite and so forth

3334
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?

3335
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Yeah exactly

3336
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
But in the car

3337
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I find myself listening to a lot of radio

3338
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
And I do a lot of driving sometimes

3339
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
So I think a lot of us do

3340
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically

3341
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Like at work while they're doing

3342
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Oh I feel sorry for them

3343
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Some type of job

3344
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I listen to BBC podcasts on history

3345
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Yeah

3346
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So I think there is still a demand

3347
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
For the audio only

3348
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
It just might be the traditional radio

3349
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I mean it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier

3350
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Where traditional TV is in trouble

3351
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow

3352
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
No

3353
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
But eventually it is going to go away

3354
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I can guarantee you that the TV set

3355
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
That I owned when I was in high school

3356
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Wouldn't work now

3357
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
It doesn't have any HD input

3358
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Almost all the stations

3359
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Have gone to an HD format

3360
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore

3361
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I've got video game systems

3362
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
That we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it

3363
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Like that Odyssey that we have

3364
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
We can't play it, we don't have anything it'll work on

3365
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
You know

3366
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
When was the last time you saw a video tape new?

3367
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
In a store?

3368
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Been a while

3369
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Where were you at, the thrift store?

3370
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Radio Shack

3371
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
That's Radio Shack, they're behind the times anyway

3372
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
But the point is

3373
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And keep in mind

3374
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I'm in print media

3375
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And really how long do you think print is going to be around

3376
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Other than a specialty format

3377
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Game Guru

3378
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
In our chat room says

3379
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna

3380
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Radio and TV won't disappear

3381
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
You kinda can, it's getting really close

3382
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Think of it this way

3383
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
20 years ago

3384
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
We got to the internet on dial up

3385
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
20 years ago would have been 92

3386
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Maybe we were at the stage where like

3387
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
28.8K

3388
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Dial up was kind of the big thing

3389
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
About then

3390
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
That was how we were connecting online and all that

3391
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
So we progressed that much

3392
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
From dial up modem 28.8K

3393
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
To where we're at now

3394
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
So think where we're going to be in 20 years

3395
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I think that whole internet off an antenna

3396
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Is right around the corner

3397
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I was thinking about this earlier because

3398
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
There was actually a Cracked article talking about

3399
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Technology then and now

3400
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Saying that like half of a level

3401
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Of Angry Birds would not fit on

3402
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
A duck hunt cartridge or something

3403
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And

3404
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Stan says way less than that

3405
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
It's just a matter of progress

3406
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
It's going to change everything

3407
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now

3408
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Doesn't exist today

3409
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside

3410
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Well one of the reasons that they work

3411
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
You know kind of cutting every

3412
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Or making everybody go digital anyways

3413
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
The whole switch over is

3414
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
The analog frequencies and stuff

3415
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
That are out there

3416
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
You know that was 4 terrestrial broadcasts

3417
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And stuff that's all up in the air now

3418
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
So now they can use that for broadcasting

3419
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Internet

3420
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
And Stan learn InDesign if you're going to do print media

3421
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit

3422
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
You're crazy!

3423
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Maybe this is a little too heavy

3424
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
For our show

3425
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
But what if

3426
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Maybe there comes a time

3427
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet

3428
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
I'm not even going into that territory

3429
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
What if

3430
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Well what if society rejected

3431
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
That technology

3432
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Like I'm not saying everybody goes Amish

3433
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But there are Amish people in the world

3434
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
They have a phone

3435
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Well not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace

3436
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Technology

3437
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And they have a neighborhood computer

3438
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Well that's kind of my point

3439
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Is that what if society

3440
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Doesn't want to keep going that direction

3441
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Or do you think

3442
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
It might happen

3443
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
If war broke out over it

3444
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
It might happen

3445
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Nope, not even then

3446
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Because if war broke out over it then that means that they

3447
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Really want it

3448
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
If war broke out over it it would be who controls it

3449
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Too heavy for the show

3450
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Because the people that wouldn't want it

3451
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
They would just die eventually

3452
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I do like what Tecna said about it not going away

3453
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
It will evolve

3454
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
That's more what I'm thinking of

3455
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You're going to look

3456
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Ten years down the line when we've all got

3457
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Pocket broadband radios

3458
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
We don't have

3459
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Wireless FM radios

3460
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
We don't use radio waves we're using

3461
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Broadband signals

3462
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Well technically a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora

3463
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Is a broadband radio

3464
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
In my pocket

3465
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
But I mean

3466
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Older forms of

3467
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
The same idea are going to fall by the wayside

3468
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That's what progress is

3469
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
That's just how it happens

3470
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Do you have a Victrola Rob?

3471
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Do you know what one is?

3472
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
A hand cranked phonograph

3473
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Not radio the record player

3474
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
When was the last time you used a mimeograph?

3475
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Just saying

3476
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I want to see a DJ use those

3477
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Good times

3478
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Alright let's move on

3479
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Dark Soccer don't skip your story

3480
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I just wanted to make a point

3481
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That's all

3482
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Anyway

3483
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

3484
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
It's gone from games on demand

3485
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
It has been removed

3486
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And

3487
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
They think they added it

3488
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
On August 28th

3489
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And on it's Japanese support site

3490
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
They just said we're sorry for the inconvenience

3491
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
The resumption of delivery is being addressed now

3492
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Please wait for a while

3493
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Yeah

3494
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Nothing else they just said that we're looking into it

3495
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Don't worry we'll receive this about the same time

3496
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
We decide to release a patch for the

3497
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Xbox 360 version of

3498
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Silent Hill HD Collection

3499
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Ever?

3500
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
We'll just kind of file it back

3501
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Or the next DDR game

3502
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Just going to hope everyone forgets about it

3503
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Well I mean if it did have a lot of problems

3504
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Well at the end of the day how is it selling?

3505
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
If it was selling decent enough they'll find a reason to put it back on there

3506
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
But if not

3507
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Okay Stan your friend may have a Victrola

3508
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
But tell me

3509
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Does it use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?

3510
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
It's for the retro kitsch of it right?

3511
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Yeah it's a kitsch collectors thing

3512
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I would love to have a Victrola

3513
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I still have albums

3514
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I don't have anything to play it on

3515
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I used to have this rocking, bitching record player

3516
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
when I was like 5 years old that I could play

3517
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Sesame Street records on and it would light

3518
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
up like these really awesome red and green colors

3519
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
in tone with the audio

3520
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I would love to have that shit again

3521
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
You know what I had? An 8 track player

3522
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
You know what I don't care if I ever have again?

3523
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
An 8 track player

3524
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I downloaded my

3525
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
favorite song from my Muppets 8 track

3526
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
It was Lydia the tattooed lady

3527
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Just saying

3528
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Not the rainbow connection?

3529
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
No it was Lydia the tattooed lady

3530
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Someday we'll find it

3531
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
This was in 1979

3532
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
When did the Muppet movie come out?

3533
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
The original one?

3534
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Yeah

3535
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
So yeah I had a Muppet

3536
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
show best of 8 track

3537
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
It was yellow and I remember how

3538
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
many times I had to fish the damn tape

3539
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
out of the 8 track player and fix it

3540
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Let's see

3541
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
The Muppet movie was

3542
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
1979

3543
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
So it was right around the same time

3544
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Unfortunately I would have been

3545
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
1 year old when this movie came out

3546
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I remember when I was a kid the big deal

3547
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
was Sesame Street follow that

3548
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
bird and that scarring

3549
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
scene of the blue

3550
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
big bird in the cage

3551
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Oh my god just

3552
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
kill me as a child

3553
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
and then return to Oz

3554
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Return to Oz was great

3555
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80's

3556
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Well it was closer to the books anyway but yeah

3557
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Oh yes gaming news

3558
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Hi Loki

3559
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Well you know he did start off as a blue bird

3560
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It was still

3561
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
an homage

3562
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
He was sad and it was hard to see

3563
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Anyways let's talk about TV

3564
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
and you know

3565
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
there's a series of games

3566
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
that were out on the PSP

3567
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
called Invisibles

3568
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
those will be coming out on the Vita

3569
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
they're going to get a new game apparently

3570
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
and it's going to be tied into a TV show

3571
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out

3572
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
and it's going to have a section of the show

3573
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
that's augmented reality

3574
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
where basically you'll take your Vita

3575
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
pointing at the screen and something fancy will happen

3576
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
unlocking new content in your game

3577
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Cool

3578
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I'm guessing

3579
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
that it's probably going to be some sort of

3580
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
AR code or QR code

3581
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
or something like that

3582
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
which will probably just

3583
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes

3584
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship

3585
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
that interacted with the thing on TV

3586
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
and all it was doing was kind of like a

3587
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
light gun type technology it just could see

3588
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
what was on the screen and light

3589
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
does its little things accordingly

3590
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
like and you think you're interacting with the movie

3591
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
but you're really not

3592
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Like the Action Max? Is that what it is?

3593
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I can't remember the name of it, probably

3594
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I had an Action Max. Did you really?

3595
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
My dad used to buy all sorts of weird game

3596
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
consoles, we had an Action Max

3597
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
That's where you got it from

3598
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
It's like my dad doesn't understand why I like video

3599
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
games and I'm like dude you've

3600
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
bought the ColecoVision, you bought me

3601
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
a TI computer, you bought

3602
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
an Action Max at one point

3603
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
you had the Atari adapter and stuff

3604
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
and you can't figure out why I like

3605
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
video games? I don't get it, I can't get the cats

3606
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
to get into video games no matter how hard I try

3607
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
The cats, they're just defiant and everything

3608
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
My cat used to sit on top

3609
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
of my Nintendo. Have you tried the iPad game?

3610
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
It was warm. I haven't because I'm

3611
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
freaked out about the scratching thing

3612
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
They can't scratch the screen

3613
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Everybody says that, but I don't believe it

3614
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Cut their claws! No! Why?

3615
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
No, it's like cutting their little

3616
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
No, it's not like

3617
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
No, I'm not declawing them

3618
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Trim their damn nails, you're supposed to

3619
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
That's part of cat care

3620
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
That's, probably Alan does

3621
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Because they're Alan's cats is the point I was getting at

3622
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
See that's what I do when my cat's being an asshole, I just cut her claws

3623
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
and go ahead and scratch me

3624
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Because you have no fucking claws

3625
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Well, Shermie gets ingrown claws

3626
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways

3627
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
But anyways, yeah, so

3628
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just

3629
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
cut their claws

3630
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch

3631
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
glass. My cat used to

3632
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
paw at the TV, like my LCD

3633
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
TV all the time, and if that

3634
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
thing's not scratched up already by them, then

3635
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
it's no big deal

3636
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I like what Infinal says in the chatroom

3637
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Put little gloves on their paws

3638
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Mitten mittens

3639
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
It's your cat being too loud?

3640
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
You should get the little cat claw

3641
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
cappers that look like nail polish

3642
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Those things are awful

3643
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Again, not my cats

3644
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
not my decision to make

3645
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her

3646
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me

3647
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday

3648
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Really?

3649
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but

3650
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
it's cool

3651
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
My struggles with cats goes back to

3652
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Oh, that's the freaking

3653
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Play it, play it, play it. No, that's not the actual commercial

3654
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
That's the promo for the episode

3655
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I think it's this one

3656
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
My struggle? No

3657
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Not that one

3658
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Great radio

3659
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Great radio right here

3660
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I saw it, I saw it

3661
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Donor and cat

3662
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
enthusiast

3663
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Is your cat making too much

3664
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
noise all the time?

3665
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Is your cat constantly stomping

3666
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
around, driving you

3667
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
crazy?

3668
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Is your cat clawing

3669
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
at your furniture?

3670
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Think there's no answer?

3671
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
You're so stupid

3672
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
There is

3673
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Kitten Mittens

3674
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Finally, there's a

3675
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:11,000
chance to get comfortable mitten for cats

3676
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I couldn't hear anything

3677
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Is your cat one legged?

3678
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Is your cat fat, skinny, or an

3679
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
in between? That doesn't matter

3680
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Cause one size fits all

3681
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Kitten Mittens, you'll be smitten

3682
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
So come on down to Patty's Pub

3683
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
We're the home of the

3684
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
original Kitten Mittens

3685
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Meow

3686
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
The hell was that?

3687
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
That's awesome

3688
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
An amazing fucking television show

3689
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Which is why you should

3690
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
watch your TV once in a while cause that show is

3691
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
fucking hilarious

3692
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
The official dick tell

3693
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Okay

3694
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Shermie would just shit

3695
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
That's all she'd do

3696
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
My favorite is

3697
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
when the cat's walking across the table

3698
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Like, surely

3699
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
PETA called in on that cause I was

3700
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
borderline inhumane

3701
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Serious face

3702
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Back to gaming news

3703
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Oh yes, it's my turn

3704
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Final Fantasy

3705
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
There is no transition

3706
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
You know, if you

3707
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
have a lot of money

3708
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
and you've bought a lot of Kitten Mittens

3709
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Maybe have some more disposable income

3710
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Say $450

3711
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
You could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation

3712
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
It's coming out of Japan

3713
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Every game in

3714
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
the series up through Final Fantasy 13

3715
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
in the Ultimate Compilation

3716
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Does it have 11?

3717
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
It even has 11

3718
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Does it have 14?

3719
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
No it does not

3720
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Does it have Mystic Quest?

3721
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Will you shut up and let me talk about it?

3722
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Just the numbered ones

3723
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Is that Dirge of Cerberus?

3724
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Now I know how you felt when

3725
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Dan kept interrupting you during the classic game of the week

3726
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Hey Rob, Rob

3727
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
What?

3728
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Final Fantasies 1 through 13

3729
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
No 10-2s, no 13-2s

3730
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2

3731
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3

3732
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Cause they're not gonna bother to port it somewhere new, sorry

3733
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6

3734
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9

3735
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
PlayStation 2 version of 10

3736
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
As well as 11

3737
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And 12

3738
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3

3739
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?

3740
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Oh yeah

3741
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
So here's the bet

3742
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Wait a second here

3743
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
But the problem is though you're gonna need to have an old style PlayStation 2 for that to work

3744
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I don't see a hard drive attached there too

3745
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I know it is kind of a little bit like

3746
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Won't work but whatever

3747
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Or if you have an old ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility

3748
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I believe there's a way to do it

3749
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I think they patched it in at one point

3750
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Anyway, 35,000 yen

3751
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
That's about 450 dollars

3752
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
There will also be a commemorative DVD

3753
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
An art collection

3754
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And a 2-disc soundtrack

3755
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Cause there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan

3756
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
There just haven't

3757
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
They need it to be another

3758
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
There it is

3759
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection

3760
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Something I probably won't be buying

3761
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Just cause I have all the ones I won already

3762
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I don't have 450

3763
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But if I had 450 dollars

3764
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I would pay to go to DragonCon or something

3765
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI

3766
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
At this point

3767
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Come on, seriously

3768
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Get the Xbox 360 version

3769
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Seriously, if you're gonna buy a console version right now

3770
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
The 360 version is probably the way to go

3771
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
But PC is pretty good

3772
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Mailbag!

3773
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
We haven't even done the mailbag yet

3774
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
It's 8.30 and we haven't even done the mailbag

3775
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3776
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Is the place to send us emails every week

3777
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
There's the mailbag music

3778
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3779
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
DarkSoccer dives in

3780
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Picks her favorites, reads them now

3781
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
This comes from

3782
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Sam

3783
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Hi Sam

3784
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Hello OLR crew, I probably love the show

3785
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
This one's missing

3786
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I might love the show

3787
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Do any of you think

3788
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
The Wii U will become

3789
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
The lead platform for development

3790
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Since it will be released before the next PlayStation

3791
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Xbox

3792
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
No

3793
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Look at what's happening now

3794
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Let's look to the Dreamcast

3795
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Possibly

3796
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
On a couple games maybe

3797
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
If there's gonna be some stuff that's coming out

3798
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
During that time

3799
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I can see them

3800
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Having slightly better looking games

3801
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
But maybe I don't know if they're gonna necessarily be

3802
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Developing for Wii U first and then porting over

3803
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
It's hard to say

3804
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
It depends on when the next platforms are coming out

3805
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Everyone assumes it's gonna be the end of next year

3806
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
But it could be in a couple years

3807
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
In which case, yeah you may have a few games there like that

3808
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I am dying to see if there is gonna be a game

3809
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
That is Wii U

3810
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
And PS3, PS Vita

3811
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Cause it could happen

3812
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I'm dying to see if that happens

3813
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
A third party could do it

3814
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Or

3815
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Xbox 360 and tablet

3816
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Oh yeah that whole

3817
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Thingy thing they said at E3

3818
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Smart glass, we haven't heard anything on in a while

3819
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
That's true

3820
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
They should call it smart ass

3821
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Okay, next email

3822
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
This comes from Rababababa

3823
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I was playing Rock Band Blitz

3824
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
The night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade

3825
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz

3826
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I was thinking that

3827
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Would be a great name to play with someone

3828
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
But there's no multiplayer

3829
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I just remembered the game I forgot to review

3830
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Then I saw

3831
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Then I saw

3832
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Score War Mode

3833
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And I thought, surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list

3834
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Nope, it just matches you up with

3835
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Any random guy 64

3836
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
So no friends list competition either

3837
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
It's just the leaderboards

3838
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Like many games before it, the game is meant

3839
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
For a social gaming crowd but it isolates you

3840
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
From your friends, fantastic

3841
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I think Rabababa found this

3842
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Because after he sent the email

3843
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app

3844
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
That's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz

3845
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Is there's a lot of enhanced

3846
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Things that are through Facebook

3847
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Which is good and it's bad

3848
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
And I'll leave it at that

3849
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top

3850
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week

3851
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
And I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show

3852
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week

3853
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I have played an awful lot of it

3854
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
The short answer, it's good

3855
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
But

3856
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Bless them at Harmonix

3857
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
They're standing by their guns

3858
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I just think there's some mistakes they made

3859
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Um

3860
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
But that's

3861
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
No, I mean to be fair they make a lot of great games

3862
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I do like Rock Band Blitz

3863
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do

3864
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
But bless them for trying and sticking to it

3865
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
That's all I'll say for now

3866
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Okay

3867
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
This last email is from Nasty Canasta

3868
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Um

3869
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Hi there OLR

3870
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
If you recall back in the famously infamous

3871
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Episode 469

3872
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
I offered a PSN code

3873
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
For a live listener to claim

3874
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
However that meant grumpy Mr. Bobby Blackwolf

3875
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Made a super duper offensive comment

3876
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
That was along the lines of not

3877
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Including podcast listeners in that giveaway

3878
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Yeah Bobby Grumpwolf

3879
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Well Mr. Blackwolf here is my response

3880
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I left in the email a steam code

3881
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
For depth of peril

3882
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
An action RPG with some strategy elements

3883
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And random level generation

3884
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'll leave it to the OLR crew

3885
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
To come up with a way to give this code

3886
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Away to a lucky listener

3887
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Also have fun dealing with the brony fandom

3888
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Once again at the next Dragon Con Mr. Blackwolf

3889
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
In addition

3890
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
If Dark Sacra Sky or Loki is interested

3891
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I have one copy of hybrid RTS

3892
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on steam

3893
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Oooh

3894
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
After you three fight to the death

3895
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Dance battle or whatever it is you three do to decide

3896
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
On things please add me on steam

3897
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
To get the game I apologize for not having

3898
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
A code the Nuclear Dawn

3899
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Developers decided on gifting the

3900
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Option for those who have purchased the game

3901
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
As part of a promotion I promise

3902
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
To keep things discreet and platonic no homo

3903
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Maybe

3904
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Alright

3905
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
We'll make this very simple email us

3906
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com

3907
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Tell us you want the code what's it for again?

3908
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Thank you by the way for the code

3909
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
For depth of peril

3910
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Depth of peril Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com

3911
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
And we'll give it away to one lucky listener

3912
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
There you go

3913
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
But that's just for not the live listeners

3914
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
That was for podcast listeners

3915
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Well you're not going to know if they're one or the other

3916
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
So it really ends up being for everybody

3917
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Well okay how about this

3918
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
You can't email we won't take the emails

3919
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Until after the podcast airs

3920
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely

3921
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Blackwolf says

3922
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And there are furries and bronies all

3923
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Over Dragon Con. Tara Strong was a guest

3924
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I barely saw them

3925
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Meaning they were all up on Tara

3926
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Lastly

3927
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
For Loki did you know there's an official

3928
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D

3929
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Yeah but the problem is

3930
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I don't really care too much about Chip's Challenge

3931
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I mean I cared about it back in the 90's

3932
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
But now it's just like ehhh

3933
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Okay so you said

3934
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
There was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded

3935
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
In April and it's on Steam Greenlight

3936
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Cool

3937
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
It's just yeah

3938
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
You know what one I wish I did get in on it was Guncraft

3939
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft

3940
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
But with guns and stuff that would have been pretty cool

3941
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
That does sound kind of neat

3942
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Okay that's it for emails

3943
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Alright

3944
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
We'll get to Twitter in a minute so your last chance

3945
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
To get the tweets in Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3946
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
But first it's time to get a little bit

3947
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Angsty in a segment we call

3948
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
F-U

3949
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Um

3950
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Fuck this dad headache I've had

3951
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
For the last two days

3952
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting

3953
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And I want my whatever it is

3954
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
In my butt that's hurting

3955
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
And no it's not like that it's one of the muscles

3956
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Around my left hip has been really

3957
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Killing me I would like for it to stop

3958
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Done

3959
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Um

3960
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Thank you for

3961
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
No one being on while I'm on Minecraft

3962
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Like I'm on a lot

3963
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
And there's no one there

3964
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
This is the

3965
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
First week you've been able to mention it on the podcast

3966
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Well that's true yeah I mean literally I started

3967
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
And then I F-U'd myself

3968
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
For accidentally kicking Bobby off the server

3969
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
A few times back

3970
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
You did it on purpose I was just getting

3971
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Revenge is yours I figured out

3972
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Take that Bobby Grumple

3973
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I just figured out how to finally

3974
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Do things on the server I mean

3975
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I've never run a Minecraft server before so

3976
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
It's a little tricky but now I figured it out

3977
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Ignorance is no excuse

3978
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
And

3979
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And just for that an Enderman will be spawning

3980
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
In my house later tonight

3981
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I can make a lot of them

3982
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
No I don't want that

3983
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
They're actually really easy to kill

3984
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
And they're afraid of water

3985
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Oh so it's like signs

3986
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Water damages them

3987
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Alright

3988
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
My F-U I also give an F-U to headaches

3989
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Because I've been getting some killer ones lately

3990
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
And it's no fun

3991
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
F-U to kind of like stress

3992
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Because I've taken on a lot of projects

3993
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Over the next month it's already keeping me busy

3994
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
And I'm starting to feel the pressures

3995
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Of a lot of that stress

3996
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I would have done it if I didn't want to but

3997
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I'm kind of just nephewed to the fact that

3998
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I haven't been hanging out

3999
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Enough with people

4000
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't see enough basically

4001
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
So because I'm taking

4002
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
A lot on it's a good thing because it's allowing

4003
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Me to hang out with people I haven't hung out with in a while

4004
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Or I'm hanging out with all new

4005
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
But at the same time I'm starting to neglect those

4006
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I hung out with before and I don't want to like

4007
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
That up so F-U to there not being

4008
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
48 hours in the day basically

4009
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
And F-U to needing sleep

4010
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Although sleep feels so good

4011
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Dan do you have any F-U's

4012
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
You want to give?

4013
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
He's busy playing game boy advance

4014
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
He's lying out on the floor like a kid

4015
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Playing the advance it is kind of funny

4016
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
You gotta admit that

4017
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
My husband is adorable

4018
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I didn't go that far but alright

4019
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Alright just a couple more stories

4020
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
For you guys and then the Skype line at 1877

4021
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Game O-L-R but first Loki

4022
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
There's a little bit more information coming

4023
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Out now about the whole

4024
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Stardock lawsuit

4025
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I think we talked about it a couple

4026
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Weeks ago where

4027
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Stardock was accusing one of their employees who

4028
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Recently left the company of

4029
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Ruining a game

4030
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Because they claimed that she deleted

4031
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Stuff for it and because of that

4032
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
That's what made the game terrible not because

4033
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Maybe the game was just terrible to begin with

4034
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Not as good as they had hoped

4035
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Well there's a little bit more being added

4036
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
To that

4037
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Apparently the cases

4038
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Now that they're saying

4039
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Alexandria

4040
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Mazetta she had filed

4041
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
A harassment

4042
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Lawsuit for well sex over

4043
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Harassment lawsuit against the

4044
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Head of the company

4045
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Before the whole

4046
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
You know leaving the company thing

4047
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Seeking I guess

4048
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
$25,000

4049
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
In damage or something

4050
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
And um

4051
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I'm sorry unspecified damages

4052
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
In excess of $25,000

4053
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Um

4054
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And she you know had

4055
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Filed complaints at the EEOC

4056
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
And claiming

4057
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Basically that the

4058
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Head of the

4059
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Company had done a lot of lewd things

4060
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Including you know linking to a

4061
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Sexually explicit YouTube video

4062
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Making comments like you know

4063
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Oh you're not chosen to go to some place

4064
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Because you're not

4065
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Just because you're hot or you know asking

4066
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Her to take a purity test question

4067
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Thing that had you know sexual

4068
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Taboo questions and stuff on there

4069
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Stuff that's no one else's business then?

4070
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
You know have you engaged in group sex

4071
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'd like to know that you know because I think

4072
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I have a you know

4073
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Good chance of the oral like it was

4074
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Also I guess there were some witnesses

4075
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
That said oh

4076
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
He described to her he said

4077
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Was it talking about the

4078
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Employees and their breasts and bra sizes

4079
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
And said that you know

4080
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
She should attend a media tour because

4081
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Her nipples look better on

4082
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
TV

4083
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Wow

4084
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
But you know like any court case or anything

4085
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
There's people on both sides and

4086
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
You know she

4087
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
You know her

4088
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
People or

4089
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Whatever you know made all those comments

4090
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
That she of course

4091
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Send him a message basically saying okay

4092
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I don't want you to touch me

4093
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Or any parts of my body not even jokingly

4094
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I don't want you to make comments about

4095
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
You know my boyfriend or future husband

4096
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Or anything like that I don't want you to make sexually

4097
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
You know charged jokes

4098
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent

4099
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Yes

4100
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Let's remind ourselves that email

4101
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Should not have had to have been sent

4102
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I mean never appropriate

4103
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Praise this girl for having the amazing

4104
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Self restraint

4105
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
To be professional at this point about it

4106
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
But despite whatever

4107
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Other allegations are out there

4108
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Fucking A

4109
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Apparently he responded though

4110
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
To this email

4111
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Saying you know

4112
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I don't recall item one

4113
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
But I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful

4114
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I understand number two but I'll be more conscious

4115
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
However number three is unacceptable

4116
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
To me I am an inappropriate

4117
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Sexist vulgar and embarrassing person

4118
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
And I'm not inclined to change my behavior

4119
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
If this is a problem for you

4120
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
You'll need to find another job

4121
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Again I'm not willing to adapt

4122
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
My behavior to suit others

4123
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
If you find my behavior

4124
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Problematic I recommend finding another job

4125
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I'm not some manager or co-worker of yours

4126
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I own the company

4127
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
It and your job here exists to suit

4128
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
My purpose not vice versa

4129
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
The company is an end to

4130
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Or is not an end

4131
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Unto itself

4132
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Is a means to an end

4133
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Which to further the objective of its shareholders

4134
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
In this case me

4135
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Yeah but there's still laws

4136
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at

4137
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
That's a law

4138
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
You can't get around that

4139
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Even if you're a disgusting shit hole like

4140
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
You know

4141
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Sorry

4142
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I mean

4143
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
A man has no excuse

4144
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
To ever act that way to another

4145
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
To a woman or any human being

4146
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Has no right to act that way towards another

4147
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Person at all

4148
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
And then of course he responded

4149
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
You know the whole thing

4150
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Basically to this

4151
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Website quarter of three

4152
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
You know saying

4153
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Okay I'm going to go ahead and respond

4154
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
To this, the incident happened back in 2010

4155
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Myself and Alexandria and a few others

4156
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Were at a pub

4157
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Going to the

4158
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
QT3 dinner

4159
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
That Lloyd Case had

4160
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Set up

4161
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
And while there

4162
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Alexandria got teased and got mad at the time

4163
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I didn't realize she was so upset about it

4164
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And blah blah blah

4165
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Later she emailed me about the incident

4166
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
And stuff like that, basically he plays it off

4167
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Saying oh this stuff you know didn't happen

4168
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Or wasn't as bad as

4169
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Smoking mirrors, smoking mirrors

4170
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
And basically seeing this as retaliatory

4171
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Or the charge that

4172
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Basically the whole thing was insinuating

4173
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
That the retaliatory

4174
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
The legit retaliatory lawsuit

4175
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Of her ruining their game

4176
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place

4177
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
So

4178
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
It's all going to come out

4179
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
They're accusing her of deleting all this

4180
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Stuff or whatever but it doesn't

4181
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
It's one of those things where like you know

4182
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
If the shoe fits, wear it

4183
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Or if the shoe, whatever

4184
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
My point is

4185
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Her incredible professionalism

4186
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
In that email and lack

4187
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Of restraint

4188
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Praise her for being able to show

4189
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
That kind of restraint

4190
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Doesn't match that of somebody who would

4191
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Go in and delete everything

4192
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
It's kind of like you got this over here

4193
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And this over here, it doesn't line up

4194
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
You know what I mean? How do we know?

4195
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
And again I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case

4196
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
So I'm being a total couch

4197
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Jury right now which is probably bad

4198
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
But just throwing it out there

4199
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
If that's the environment this person

4200
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Created at this company where it's like

4201
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
You deal with it because it's my company

4202
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Or what have you

4203
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
How do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?

4204
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Maybe somebody else chose not to take

4205
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
The high road. Just throwing it out there

4206
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Well also the thing too is like

4207
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
They're talking about how she knew where

4208
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
The files were and had access

4209
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
To relevant Google Docs

4210
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Why are you using Google Docs as like

4211
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
A lot of businesses use Google Docs

4212
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
It just seems very

4213
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I've heard of that before

4214
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school too

4215
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
You'd seem like you'd have your own

4216
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Intranet or something that you do that on

4217
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Anyhow

4218
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
The moral of the story is

4219
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
People need to

4220
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Not do this to

4221
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Other people and I'm talking the whole

4222
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Harassment thing in the first place

4223
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
And that kind of bugs me

4224
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
That in the response it's very

4225
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Smoke and mirrors like

4226
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Well there was teasing and da da da

4227
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
But that doesn't give anybody the right to

4228
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

4229
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Here's what he's saying

4230
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
There's no excuse for what happened

4231
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
No he doesn't even

4232
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
He doesn't even apologize

4233
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Now you can argue that I was a jerk

4234
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And how I responded to her

4235
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
But it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and

4236
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Quitting without notice and using her network access

4237
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
To wipe out our marketing access

4238
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
How dare this person

4239
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Oh my god it's so infuriating

4240
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
How dare you try to blame her

4241
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
How dare you

4242
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
I'd love to see somebody do it to him

4243
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
That is an attitude

4244
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
That very very bad people have

4245
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Since my self showing restraint

4246
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Honestly

4247
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
His behavior is a sign of

4248
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Something fundamentally wrong with a person

4249
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Like I'm talking about mentally ill

4250
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
This shit in the industry

4251
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Needs to stop because

4252
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
It is making us all look bad

4253
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Knock it off

4254
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Thank you

4255
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
This is fucking psychotic

4256
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Behavior

4257
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Well I don't even know

4258
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
How to follow that up

4259
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
How about a story about Mega Man

4260
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Mega Man

4261
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Mega person

4262
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Capcom, you might be wondering

4263
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Why hasn't there been a new Mega Man game

4264
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Or what is with all this shit about Mega Man projects

4265
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Getting cancelled and da da da da

4266
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Well Senior Vice President of Capcom

4267
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
USA, Christian Svensson

4268
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Mentioned to members on Capcom

4269
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Unity's forum that the problem is

4270
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Mega Man had too many franchise

4271
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Or excuse me, too many competing

4272
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Sub series

4273
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Quote, thanks for the suggestion

4274
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I and probably I alone so please don't

4275
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Describe said belief to Capcom

4276
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Think one of the problems Mega Man has had

4277
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
As a brand is that we've had too many

4278
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Competing splinter sub brands within it

4279
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I'm not sure starting yet another

4280
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Is the way to get the franchise as a whole

4281
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Back on track more than creating

4282
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Greater brand confusion but will take it

4283
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Under advisement

4284
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
There's a bunch of shit right there because

4285
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
The different series that they have were on different

4286
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Platforms that they didn't have other Mega Man games

4287
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy

4288
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Advance then you're playing Mega Man

4289
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Power or something or other

4290
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I don't remember what it was but um

4291
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
It wasn't like oh hey you know we're gonna have

4292
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Mega Man this and Mega Man that and

4293
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
You know they're gonna compete against each other

4294
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I don't think they really had that it was just

4295
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Different games especially nowadays

4296
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
There are no Mega Man games

4297
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Like that are super old anymore

4298
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
You're not gonna be having people you know

4299
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Oh hey I'm confused because I played this one on the

4300
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Game Boy Advance or hey I'm confused because

4301
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I played ZX on the DS or something

4302
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Like that I mean those games came out years ago

4303
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Except for

4304
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
You know 9 and 10 those are pretty much

4305
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
The last new Mega Man games that

4306
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Came out Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?

4307
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Well yeah they kinda

4308
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Let him go where he walked Ah that never stops people

4309
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
In the industry Well I'm saying if he

4310
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Was the I mean he was a big wig

4311
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
If he was the one driving Mega Man

4312
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Development and he's like okay I'm out

4313
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
And everyone else is just like uh

4314
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
What the fuck do we do? Let's just go

4315
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And put that one away I

4316
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Kinda think this and now granted

4317
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I'm reading way too much into this but I kinda think

4318
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
This points towards there's gonna be some

4319
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Big reboot cause that's always

4320
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
The fucking answer to every problem reboot

4321
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Of the Mega Man franchise in the future

4322
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I bet you anything there's gonna be a new

4323
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Mega Man game that's just Mega Man

4324
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
And it's a reboot and there's

4325
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Some new creative person at the helm

4326
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And it's not Grin making it

4327
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Yeah it's not it lends

4328
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Itself perfectly to some type of reboot

4329
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Whether that be on the next consoles or

4330
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
You know maybe a 3DS game

4331
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Probably no or a Vita game I think there

4332
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Will be a Mega Man reboot

4333
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Just Mega Man

4334
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Speculation rampant whatever

4335
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Fanboy wank call it what you want

4336
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I just kinda think that's where all the signs point towards

4337
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Especially with that type of rebuttal

4338
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
There's too many franchises

4339
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
So they're gonna bring it back to one

4340
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
We'll see

4341
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I bet it's a reboot

4342
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Hey!

4343
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Let's go to the skype line

4344
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
1877 game OLR our username

4345
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
On skype is orange lounge radio we've had a heck of a show

4346
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
So far tonight let's see what you guys want to talk about

4347
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
The skype line is open

4348
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Again 1877 game OLR

4349
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Our username on skype is orange lounge radio

4350
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I'm gonna get to the tweets here in a moment

4351
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
But first let me ask Loki do you have any

4352
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Last minute stories or dark soccer of course

4353
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
If you have anything you want to throw out as well

4354
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I'm still in the middle of being disgusted

4355
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
There's some stupid stories you've probably heard all these before

4356
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Where you know some teenager

4357
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Drives cross country to meet her boyfriend

4358
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
So this uh

4359
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Girl Beth Robinson

4360
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Who was 13 met somebody

4361
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
On Xbox Live who was 12

4362
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Actually 12 not necessarily a 4 year old

4363
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Who came to be 12 and he lived in Houston

4364
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
And she lives in Kentucky

4365
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
And I guess she ended up chatting with him

4366
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
And then eventually stole her brother's car

4367
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Her mother's ATM card and then drove

4368
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
To his house

4369
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
And I guess she uh got as far as Nashville Tennessee

4370
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Before being stopped by police

4371
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
So

4372
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
And of course we must blame

4373
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Xbox Live for this not because

4374
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Her parents are retarded

4375
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Or you know

4376
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
She's stupid for

4377
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Driving across

4378
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I have a belated F.U.

4379
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Um sure

4380
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
To everyone taking a crap on

4381
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Mass Effect Paragon Lost

4382
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it

4383
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
So shut up

4384
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I'll reserve judgement until the first step's out

4385
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But I'm not gonna hate on it just cause

4386
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
It's Vega

4387
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Vega was pretty cool

4388
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Alright He's like the bro of the ship

4389
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Shall I do some tweets? Sure

4390
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
He's totally getting on with Cortez

4391
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Again 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype

4392
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Orange Launch Radio

4393
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says

4394
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
How might one acquire episode 169

4395
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
From the encore last week

4396
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
And recording it

4397
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
But since you asked nicely Dark Tetsuya

4398
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Uh talk to me offline and

4399
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
We'll talk yeah

4400
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Um

4401
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Let's see another tweet from Salacious Pop

4402
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I know who that is

4403
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Who tweets something I forgot to mention

4404
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Earlier on the show but it is definitely

4405
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Uh important it's going on

4406
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Rest in peace city of heroes

4407
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
That's right

4408
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Paragon Studios is closing

4409
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Taking city of heroes with it

4410
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
They cut down by the end of the year and they got blindsided

4411
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
They did not know it was coming cause one day

4412
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
There's a post about oh here's all the cool stuff coming

4413
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
At the end of the year and then the next day it's like

4414
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Bye

4415
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
No firm date yet sent for the closure

4416
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
But um that's kind of a

4417
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Bummer I know Allen played a lot

4418
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Of city of heroes he was into that game

4419
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I did not really get

4420
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Into it but I saw it and it was

4421
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It looked good

4422
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I guess maybe because

4423
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
I didn't play it as part of the reason it was closing

4424
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I don't know

4425
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
There's a lot of people like me

4426
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Let's go to the phones, hi you're on orange songs radio who's this?

4427
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I'm Zaku here

4428
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Hey Zaku long time no talk what's up buddy

4429
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Uh nothing much just

4430
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Chilling on this uh sleepy sunday

4431
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Yeah what's on your mind

4432
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Just like finishing off like a little bit of Skyrim

4433
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Not finishing the game

4434
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
But just like finish playing some of it

4435
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
You can never finish Skyrim

4436
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
That's that's pretty much the story of my life

4437
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Anyways um

4438
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Zero to the knee

4439
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Yeah that whole thing

4440
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Um I'm looking right now through Kotaku

4441
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
For a particular PAX

4442
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Incident that happened

4443
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Recently in uh in one of the

4444
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
The Minecraft party

4445
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Where basically this

4446
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Apparently this pervert

4447
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Exposed himself

4448
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
More importantly actually

4449
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Took the hand of a thumbnail

4450
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
And actually placed it on his jump

4451
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
And blogged

4452
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I don't know if you heard this

4453
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
This is like a big deal

4454
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
For the past couple of days that I was

4455
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
You know that I was uh catching up on

4456
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Hold on

4457
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I'm gonna say before I let him finish the story

4458
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
If that last thing made you mad

4459
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
This will set you on fire

4460
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
This is so fucked up

4461
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
This story go ahead Zaku

4462
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Go ahead and tell us and

4463
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Brace yourselves this is bad

4464
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Okay let me see

4465
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Uh it was in

4466
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
The V.I.P. section

4467
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
For Minecraft and

4468
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
This blogger

4469
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry

4470
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Long story short

4471
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
She was in the V.I.P. section

4472
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
When a guy right there

4473
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
She was just minding her own business

4474
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
And all of a sudden

4475
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
A guy started off like showing her

4476
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Showing her pictures of

4477
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
You know of chicks

4478
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Of girls that he actually took

4479
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
You know of their breasts

4480
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
This guy actually took pictures of women's

4481
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Breasts throughout the party

4482
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
So I mean at first it was a bit creepy

4483
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
But then it got

4484
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Then he really ratcheted up when

4485
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
He basically exposed his penis

4486
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
And he grabbed her

4487
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
He grabbed her hand and placed it in his

4488
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Right there in his crotch

4489
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
With the penis exposed

4490
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
And she just like

4491
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Freaked out in the sense that

4492
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
You know she panicked later on

4493
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
To the point where she was like

4494
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Suffering from stress

4495
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
She didn't even call like

4496
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
The police or security

4497
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Okay I'm gonna stop you there

4498
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I'm gonna stop you there

4499
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Cause there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here

4500
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
If you go to the source and read the original story

4501
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Cause this is the part that infuriated me

4502
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
She went to the security at the club

4503
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
And she told her friends about what was going on

4504
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Cause you can read this at the source

4505
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
She talked to the security guards

4506
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
And the security guards the answer was basically like

4507
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Well what are we supposed to do about it

4508
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
That infuriated me

4509
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
This has nothing

4510
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
The problem is at the end of the day

4511
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
This really doesn't have anything to do with

4512
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Video games or what have you

4513
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name

4514
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
It gives

4515
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Male gamers like myself a bad rep

4516
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I mean I have a

4517
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Girl gamer girlfriend of mine

4518
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
She's an awesome gamer

4519
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Just as hardcore as I am

4520
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
But more but

4521
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
The bottom line is that

4522
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Every time any other like

4523
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Woman would

4524
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Picture a gamer or even look at me

4525
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
As a gamer

4526
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I don't want them to think that I'm some

4527
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Perv that just like

4528
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Flashes himself in front of everyone

4529
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Because that adds like

4530
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Negative connotations to the whole

4531
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
To our whole culture

4532
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
See

4533
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I have to say this cause I'm thinking back to

4534
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
My uh

4535
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Before I hurt my ankle I used to

4536
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Take a couple different

4537
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Styles of martial arts

4538
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself

4539
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
You punch him in the dick

4540
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Seriously

4541
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
But that would be assault

4542
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
That would be assault

4543
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
I do not

4544
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I don't condone that but I don't

4545
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
If it's somebody you know

4546
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Putting you in a situation

4547
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Cause technically he grabbed her that could be assault

4548
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Let us all agree

4549
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
It's battery if you grab somebody

4550
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Without I mean battery is like

4551
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
If you like hurt them and they don't

4552
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
You know if you touch them without necessarily

4553
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Hurting them that is battery

4554
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
He touched her first

4555
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Yeah and it's sexual battery if it

4556
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Here's the deal you guys are going into this crazy

4557
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
What if whatever because obviously

4558
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
In the moment hold on hold on

4559
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
In the moment she didn't know

4560
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
If security guards called the cops

4561
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Then it would be his word it would be her word

4562
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Against his and trying to sort out that mess

4563
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Unless they have

4564
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
There's no way they can press charges

4565
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
They can get like

4566
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
They can convict him

4567
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Or at least you know put him behind

4568
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Put him in cuffs

4569
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
If there were actual witnesses

4570
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
That can attest to her story

4571
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Then she could easily press charges

4572
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Otherwise a cop would just leave

4573
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
So they're going to believe him over her

4574
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
You're basically saying that they're all sexist

4575
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
And they're going to take his word immediately

4576
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
It's basically he said she said

4577
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Even when he's got photos of people

4578
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
From the post

4579
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
He's got the photos on his phone

4580
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Don't tell me there's not going to be

4581
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Cameras at the club that could see what's going on

4582
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
But the incident

4583
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
It's at the heart of the matter where

4584
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
He basically grabbed

4585
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Her hand into his crotch

4586
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Unless he has someone actually seeing

4587
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
That then you can't

4588
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
The cops can't really do anything

4589
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
But there is other evidence

4590
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
For stuff that is just like

4591
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Substantial at best

4592
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
That doesn't mean you ignore it

4593
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
It was totally wrong

4594
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
What the security guard did

4595
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
If he did it to her

4596
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
That's likely not the first time he's done this

4597
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Probably in the same night

4598
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
They would

4599
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Separate everybody and question

4600
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
All the witnesses

4601
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal

4602
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I'm not talking about security guards

4603
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I'm saying if the police were called in

4604
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Yes

4605
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
They would have to actually

4606
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Step the party down

4607
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
And detain everyone and investigate

4608
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
So why are you defending them?

4609
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I'm not trying to defend them

4610
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
I'm just saying that given the circumstances

4611
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
That it's really hard

4612
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
It's kind of like a no win scenario

4613
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
You either call the police

4614
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
And see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds

4615
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
To arrest him

4616
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
On that particular charge

4617
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Or you do nothing

4618
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
And you basically

4619
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Get chided for inaction

4620
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Him grabbing her hand

4621
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
If you don't

4622
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Him grabbing her hand and putting it on his junk

4623
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Is sexual assault, end of story

4624
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Right, of course

4625
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
But the security guard

4626
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
He would still suffer consequences

4627
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Regardless of his actions

4628
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Even if he did call the police

4629
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
As well he should

4630
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Yeah of course

4631
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
No doubt

4632
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
There was not that much he could have done

4633
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
No it's the victim's responsibility

4634
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
If she wants to get the police to call the police

4635
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
The security guard is there to maintain the security

4636
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
In the club, he's not there to enforce the law

4637
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
He's there to keep people alive

4638
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
And to keep the business running

4639
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer

4640
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
You know

4641
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
He can only ask them to leave

4642
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
And if he assaults

4643
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
If the patron in question

4644
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Assaults the security guard

4645
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Then yeah he has a right to defend himself

4646
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Other than that he can't really

4647
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Physically detain them

4648
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
He can only ask them to leave

4649
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
And only after that point

4650
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
If they resist

4651
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
And they start being aggressive

4652
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Then the guard has the right

4653
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
To defend himself

4654
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
The security guard is not a cop

4655
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls

4656
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
But thank you very much for calling in

4657
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
And sharing this unfortunate story with us

4658
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Alright, take care

4659
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Bye

4660
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I just

4661
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
I don't know

4662
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
What does it say about our culture?

4663
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I don't want to live on this planet anymore

4664
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I don't

4665
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
There are so many people

4666
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
How much

4667
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Can we all agree

4668
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
How much of this fault is hers?

4669
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Zero

4670
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Zero

4671
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
The behavior has to be addressed

4672
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
The guy's a sociopath

4673
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I just

4674
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Something that went back and said

4675
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
In the chat room is like

4676
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
We have this environment here where they're telling women

4677
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Oh well don't dress

4678
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Provocatively you could get raped

4679
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Or you know

4680
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself

4681
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
You could get raped

4682
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
It shouldn't be don't get raped

4683
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
It should be don't rape

4684
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Don't assault

4685
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
To Zaku's credit

4686
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
And in the interest of fairness

4687
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I get where he's going

4688
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
When you're innocent until proven guilty

4689
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
But all I'm saying

4690
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Is that an investigation

4691
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Needed to be done

4692
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
An investigation needed to be done

4693
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
And I do think it's on the onus of the club

4694
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
And the people that knew about it

4695
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
To make sure that investigation

4696
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Takes place

4697
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet

4698
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
The job of the security guard

4699
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Is to protect the interest of the club

4700
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Protecting the interest of the club

4701
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Also includes protecting the safety

4702
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Of those who were there

4703
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Yeah you're right in protecting the interest of the club

4704
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Because if I were a game company or whatever

4705
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
If I was Mojang I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club

4706
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
For any future event after this story

4707
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Or nor would anybody

4708
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
If I was the owner of the club I would have

4709
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Basically ended my contract with that security firm

4710
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And gotten one with a better reputation

4711
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
But the victim needs to contact the authority

4712
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
The victim does need to contact the authority

4713
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
As Dan just said

4714
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I hope

4715
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I hope the internet

4716
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Made her feel like she can do that

4717
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
I don't know what else to say

4718
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
One thing that I think men need to understand

4719
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Is that we still live in an environment

4720
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Where women are basically still treated

4721
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
As second class citizens

4722
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
A man is

4723
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Dan's saying that's bullshit but it happens

4724
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
It's happened to me

4725
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
You don't get it because you're a guy

4726
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
And just because you see it in the pornos

4727
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Where a woman catches sight of a penis

4728
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis

4729
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
It doesn't happen in reality

4730
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Guys don't see it

4731
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class

4732
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
And you allow yourself to be treated second class

4733
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not

4734
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
You believe that it's happening

4735
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
That's why you feel like it's happening

4736
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
No

4737
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
That's exactly the problem

4738
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Let's cut this shit off, we'll talk about this later

4739
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
What was that last story

4740
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
We just talked about then

4741
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
It's happening

4742
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
What was that last story in the game industry

4743
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I'm not even saying woman

4744
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I'm saying person person

4745
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
A person has

4746
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I said that in the last story too

4747
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
What if it was a guy

4748
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Whips it up from another guy

4749
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Same story

4750
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I would say the exact same thing

4751
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Or a woman doing it to another woman

4752
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It's inappropriate

4753
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Or a woman doing it to a guy

4754
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Yeah absolutely

4755
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Absolutely still inappropriate

4756
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Just because

4757
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Somebody doesn't tell

4758
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Doesn't mean there wasn't a crime

4759
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
That's not the point

4760
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
The point is

4761
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
No one can hear what you're saying

4762
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Hold on

4763
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
That's not the point

4764
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
The point is she needs to stand up for herself

4765
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
That's

4766
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
How the citrus is going to get fixed

4767
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
That's how the slimeball is going to get his fucking comeuppance

4768
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
If he victimizes somebody

4769
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
And that victim steps up

4770
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
And fucking puts him down

4771
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
There is a degree of

4772
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Having to choose not to be a victim

4773
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Which I don't understand why anyone would choose

4774
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
To keep a victim's mentality

4775
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I don't think it's a choice

4776
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
But you have to be able to go ahead

4777
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
And say look

4778
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
This happened to me

4779
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I accepted this happened to me

4780
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
And this is the action I'm going to take

4781
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
To rectify that

4782
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Okay

4783
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
And also pointing and laughing at his penis

4784
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Would have been funny too

4785
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Pretty quick

4786
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Yeah tiny penis

4787
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
But again hindsight

4788
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Is 20

4789
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Hindsight is 20 20

4790
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Hindsight is 20 20

4791
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
You know it's easy to sit here and say

4792
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I would have done this

4793
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Someone should have done this

4794
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
It's easy to sit here and do that

4795
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
But when it's happening to you in that moment

4796
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
You don't have that luxury

4797
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And that doesn't make what she did

4798
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Wrong by any means

4799
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
And we need to have a society that still

4800
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Protects people

4801
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
From having this happen to them

4802
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Anyhow

4803
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Let's move on

4804
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Do we have a gaming story or something? Let me go to Twitter

4805
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Because the tweets were sent in a long time ago

4806
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
So we might have some gaming tweets

4807
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate

4808
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully

4809
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Just saying

4810
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Moving on

4811
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Ossifer on Twitter

4812
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
With Mass Effect content

4813
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Ooh, Garris

4814
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Ossifer says

4815
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Just started Final Fantasy 13-2

4816
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
And I freaked out a little

4817
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
When I saw DLC for N7 armor

4818
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
For the main characters

4819
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
That's true

4820
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
There was some really awesome DLC

4821
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
In Final Fantasy 13-2 that incorporated the games

4822
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?

4823
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
I think so

4824
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Let's see

4825
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Other tweets

4826
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
A couple from Tigerclaw

4827
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
We do an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to

4828
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
On Twitter

4829
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
At Twitter.com slash OLR

4830
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
It's not loading for me right now

4831
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
But I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week

4832
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
That basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline

4833
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
For Wii U

4834
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
I don't think that necessarily means

4835
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
They don't think they really have anything in the pipeline

4836
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Beyond

4837
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
I don't know, they just released

4838
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Surely there's something we just don't know about

4839
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
But nothing that they've announced

4840
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced

4841
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
That have

4842
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
You know, have yet to come out

4843
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I mean they have Dishonored coming out

4844
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
But that's pretty much it

4845
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
I guess if you count Zenimax

4846
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition

4847
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
But aside from stuff beyond

4848
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
2012

4849
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
There really isn't anything that's been announced yet

4850
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
So

4851
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Yeah, I guess that's a true statement

4852
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Alright, another tweet from Tigerclaw

4853
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
About Double Fine

4854
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test

4855
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
He links us to a clip on

4856
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Gamasutra

4857
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
This is not the big Kickstarter thing

4858
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
It's a free-to-play superhero

4859
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Management game called Middle Manager of Justice

4860
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Okay, you have to admit

4861
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
That's kind of funny

4862
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine

4863
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Obviously, because it's on iOS

4864
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Here's the thing, the game was not supposed to be out

4865
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
For several weeks

4866
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
So they pulled it from the iOS store

4867
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
But a lot of people were able to download it anyway

4868
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
So they're just considering it, eh, beta test

4869
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And you know what, they're owning up to it

4870
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Which I think is very interesting

4871
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
One of the folks here, Ki Chi

4872
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Who is the project lead

4873
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Yep, it was totally my fault

4874
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
With the way you submit things on the app store

4875
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
You have to specify what the release date is

4876
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
And a while back we had set the date to September

4877
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
But at the time, we didn't know if that would be final or not

4878
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Once we submitted the game, we realized

4879
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
We had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix

4880
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
But at the same time, we didn't want to remove it

4881
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
From the submission process in case Apple catches

4882
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Other things we need to take care of

4883
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Is to do a double submission

4884
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
So, at least they're trying to

4885
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
You know, make lemonade out of lemons

4886
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
On getting the stuff released early

4887
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
That's it for Twitter tonight

4888
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
One last call for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR

4889
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4890
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Although I can't fault people

4891
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
For not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion

4892
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
If you, obviously

4893
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
There's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight

4894
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4895
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Is a great place, you know

4896
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice

4897
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio

4898
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
And those of you in the chat room

4899
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
And so forth, we want everybody to be able to have

4900
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Their say, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4901
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
If you would like to get your two cents in

4902
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Of course there's always Facebook

4903
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
And Twitter as well

4904
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Google Plus and what have you

4905
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Skype line ain't lighting up

4906
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
I guess that means I'm gonna go ahead and close it

4907
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
We'll try again next week

4908
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight

4909
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
We did all last minute stories, do we have any more?

4910
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Loki?

4911
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Anything? I mean

4912
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
This week will be interesting

4913
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Yeah, this coming week is gonna be very interesting

4914
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Between the iPhone 5 and the

4915
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Possible iPad mini

4916
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Nintendo

4917
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
I don't know if we'll see that, but

4918
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
What do you think of the new Kindles

4919
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
That they have coming out?

4920
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
I didn't really read up on them enough

4921
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Because we already have a Kindle

4922
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I'm not really in the market for a new one

4923
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
The other one that sounded interesting was

4924
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
I'm not in the market for tablet at all

4925
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
It's the

4926
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Kindle Fire HD

4927
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
The one that has the 9 inch screen

4928
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Or whatever

4929
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
The 4G one has

4930
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
A $50 a year data plan

4931
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
250 megabytes a month

4932
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Data

4933
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
You get with that

4934
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
For 50 bucks a year, that's not bad

4935
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
If you're not using a ton of data

4936
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
For me, I normally wouldn't use

4937
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
That much data, but I do stream

4938
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Pandora, so I've used up like

4939
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
600-700 megabytes

4940
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
This month, but

4941
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
That's like the most I've ever

4942
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Used

4943
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
I don't know, it looked interesting

4944
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
But, you know

4945
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
We'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff

4946
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Being the same, you know, the $199

4947
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
They did drop the original Kindle Fire down

4948
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
The $160 though, to try to

4949
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Undercut Google a little bit, but

4950
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199

4951
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Can't you flash those or something?

4952
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
You can flash any Android system

4953
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Any of those can be jailbroken

4954
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Yeah, my wife's Nook's

4955
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Jailbroken

4956
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
It's kind of fun, you can do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to

4957
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Oh yeah, like what?

4958
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on

4959
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
The Nook, so I added

4960
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
That with an optional bootloader

4961
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
And stuff on there, and so she can do that

4962
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Plus, if she wanted

4963
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
To, she could pirate apps for it

4964
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I didn't do that

4965
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
But I mainly

4966
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Went with Windows 4 to the other app store

4967
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps

4968
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
And she's like, I don't want to get other apps

4969
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Fine, I did that all for nothing then

4970
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
So

4971
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Alright

4972
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
I guess that's it for

4973
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Someone call, please

4974
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
No, I shut the Skype line, it's done

4975
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Oh, dang it, I want something happy

4976
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Well, we're after 9 o'clock

4977
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Dan's gonna take me to Pinkberry

4978
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
That's a happy subject, Pinkberry's always a good thing

4979
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
I was very sad though, they did not respond to our tweet

4980
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
We celebrated the show by going shopping

4981
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
For candles in the mall at Yankee Candle

4982
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
And then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful

4983
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
And Dan had made some type of comment like

4984
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out

4985
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
You're hanging out

4986
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Yep

4987
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Well

4988
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
He didn't call, so I gotta put this out there

4989
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Don't know if he's listening

4990
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
But if he is, Ronma, stay black

4991
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
I think

4992
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
He just joined us not that long ago, so there you go

4993
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I was just talking to him in private message, so

4994
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
About private things

4995
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I know, right

4996
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show

4997
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Dan, thank you very much for being here tonight

4998
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
And bringing your always controversial opinions

4999
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
I mean that in a great way

5000
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
To the program, and best of all, the fights

5001
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
We all love it

5002
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
You don't fight

5003
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Dan, do you have any last words for our listeners tonight? Final thoughts?

5004
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Stay black, everyone

5005
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Will do

5006
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
DarkSakura, you're his wife, why don't you go next?

5007
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Your final thought tonight

5008
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Fuck bitches

5009
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I'm kidding

5010
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Because dudes can be bitches too

5011
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
You know what?

5012
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Sociopaths need to be locked up, end of story

5013
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
My final thought is

5014
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
I wanna thank Alan

5015
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
For getting me Clue on Blu-ray

5016
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Because it's about time I have such an amazing movie

5017
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
On Blu-ray

5018
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980's

5019
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
You're doing yourself a disservice

5020
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
They rerun it on TV all the time

5021
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
And it's a cult classic

5022
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Please, there are ladies present

5023
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

5024
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Go play Minecraft

5025
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Buy it for me

5026
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Join the VoG server

5027
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
See, here's the thing

5028
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Technically I could set up the server in a way that you don't need to buy it

5029
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
But

5030
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
There is a way

5031
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Through a website called Mine Shafter

5032
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
We wanna support Mojang

5033
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
But there is a way through Mine Shafter

5034
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
It's www.mineshafter.com

5035
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Where you can

5036
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Basically log in with that

5037
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Instead of

5038
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
It's a patched

5039
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Proxy server or something like that

5040
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
You run

5041
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
The client through

5042
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers

5043
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Cracked servers are

5044
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Where they have the mode online toggled to false

5045
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Instead of true

5046
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I have mine on true right now

5047
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
However, yesterday when their authentication server went down

5048
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I had it toggled to false

5049
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
So I could log in still

5050
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
And authenticate it

5051
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Technically there's some security holes if you leave it to false

5052
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
People can spoof stuff

5053
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
But being that we're a close-knit group

5054
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I could

5055
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Set it to false

5056
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
But I'm gonna stick with the true right now

5057
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Alright

5058
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
We wanna thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio

5059
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
And showing us your support

5060
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
We are an indie podcast

5061
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
We don't have a giant website

5062
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Or commercial backing or what have you

5063
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
So all we have is word of mouth

5064
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Please tell people about the show

5065
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
And you know what, spread the word of other indie podcasts

5066
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
You know, at vognetwork.com

5067
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
There's a lot of great indie podcasts

5068
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
And there's a lot of great indie podcasts all over the internet

5069
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Help spread the word guys, it's all we got

5070
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Hey Rob

5071
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it

5072
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
We want oral love

5073
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
A-U-R-A-L right?

5074
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
No, oral with mouth

5075
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Right, alright, whatever

5076
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Spread the love

5077
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
That's something I can get behind

5078
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
In front of

5079
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
We'll talk to you guys next week

5080
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Thank you guys for staying up late with us

5081
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
And participating with the show

5082
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
We'll see you next time

5083
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Big week next week with the Nintendo Conference

5084
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Be ready for it

5085
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I'm sure Loki's gonna have a lot to say

5086
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
I'm ready to be underwhelmed

5087
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Is your body ready?

5088
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Oh my body's ready

5089
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
What time is it at?

5090
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Is it in the morning?

5091
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit

5092
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Another live blog

5093
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
I can't wait

5094
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
What the hell is this shit?

5095
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
We need to talk to Bobby real quick

5096
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
And see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network

5097
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
There's all these live streaming

5098
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Live blogging software things

5099
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
I'm at work at that time

5100
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
So we'll see

5101
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Excuse me

5102
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
So your body is ready for the press conference

5103
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
My body's ready for disappointment

5104
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Seriously

5105
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
And the iOS conference as well

5106
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
The iPhone and the iPad is gaming

5107
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
So I'm curious to see what the next thing is

5108
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
So we'll see them next week

5109
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Have a good week everybody

5110
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Are they gonna call it the new iPad or the new iPod

5111
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Or the new iPhone

5112
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Because that would be hilarious

5113
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Lastly

5114
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Oh my god

5115
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Act Def reminded us

5116
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
We didn't even talk about it

5117
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
You finally dressed as Tingle

5118
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show

5119
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Because it was like a week ago at this point

5120
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Tell us about the Tingle thing

5121
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
I finally won that contest

5122
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
The retweet thing

5123
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
So she drew me as Tingle

5124
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
That's the closest you're gonna get

5125
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
And they did hit their goal

5126
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:18,000
So Evilot is gonna get their orchestra soundtrack now

5127
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
So that's pretty awesome

5128
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
But yeah

5129
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
She's awesome

5130
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Beatrix is awesome

5131
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
And she drew a wonderful picture of me

5132
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
My wife said

5133
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
I drew a picture of Josh

5134
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I'm like crap

5135
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
But you know whatever

5136
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Nah the one he used funnier

5137
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
You know what first of all how old is your son now 2

5138
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
He'll look different

5139
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
He wouldn't appreciate it

5140
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Like for 5 seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else

5141
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Make it your twitter picture or something so we can see it

5142
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Alright

5143
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Have a great week everybody

5144
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
