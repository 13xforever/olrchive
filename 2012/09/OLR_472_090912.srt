00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:25,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, September 9th, 2012, rumors return about Valve creating a new console, the homebrew scene may have cracked the Vita, and one company finally decides to end their controversial DRM method.

2
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:36,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:41,155
[SPEAKER_12]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 9th of 2012.

4
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:45,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's September 9th, you know what that means.

5
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:54,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Dreamcast, happy birthday to you.

6
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:54,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, speed mix.

7
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:56,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, it's a little early for my birthday.

8
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,927
[SPEAKER_12]: We're almost to your birthday, though.

9
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:00,808
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

10
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Your birthday's just two days away, Tech Master Loki.

11
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:05,629
[SPEAKER_12]: We've gone and screwed up the intro.

12
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything is all amiss.

13
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:08,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I can't talk yet.

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,690
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been shunned.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,530
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki.

17
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Please say hello, everybody, to Tech Master Loki joining us tonight.

18
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:15,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

19
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,292
[SPEAKER_11]: You can introduce Jamie first.

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I've decided to do things different tonight.

21
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:20,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Differently.

22
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:26,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Also say hello to Grammar Master DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

23
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,144
[SPEAKER_12]: She'll cut a bitch.

24
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:29,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I will cut a bitch.

25
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:31,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even care.

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,891
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing?

27
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:33,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

30
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:46,514
[SPEAKER_12]: We are live, of course, at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

31
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to say, props to Bobby.

32
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:53,836
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like six, seven years now?

33
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:55,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Had our shows back to back.

34
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:56,637
[SPEAKER_12]: He had an A-plus show tonight.

35
00:01:56,957 --> 00:02:00,898
[SPEAKER_12]: He had an interview with Gearbox Software and some of the guys over there.

36
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,839
[SPEAKER_12]: It addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy.

37
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:08,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place.

38
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:09,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Must listen episode.

39
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:10,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Loved it.

40
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:12,665
[SPEAKER_12]: So check that out at vognetwork.com.

41
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:13,986
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be posted later tonight.

42
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:15,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when Bobby rants.

43
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,468
[SPEAKER_12]: But hopefully you'll listen to our show.

44
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:26,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I know usually he's so nice and inviting and, you know, oh, we're going to have the listeners on the show and he doesn't get angry very often, but that was... I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley.

45
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:29,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Bang, bang.

46
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:30,974
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit, a little bit.

47
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:31,234
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

48
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:34,576
[SPEAKER_11]: He needs more flannel vests in order to pull that off.

49
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:38,299
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers.

50
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:52,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview with the game developer this week, but we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio, the OL Army, have been asking for for quite some time.

51
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the return, surprise, of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio.

52
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Say hello, everybody, to...

53
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:00,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan.

54
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:01,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan is back tonight.

55
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:02,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, what up?

56
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:03,958
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing, Dan?

57
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:04,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing good.

58
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,801
[SPEAKER_12]: For those that don't know Dan, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,824
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky.

60
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan is DarkSakura's husband.

61
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:14,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

62
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:15,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Or me.

63
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

64
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,571
[SPEAKER_12]: See?

65
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,754
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be one of those shows tonight.

66
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:23,336
[SPEAKER_12]: They are just going to fight all night long.

67
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:24,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

68
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan, how long has it been since you've been on the show?

69
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:29,147
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a good at least six months, right?

70
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:30,028
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

71
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:30,568
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a while.

72
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:30,948
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

73
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners between six months ago and now.

74
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So tell us a little bit about your gaming history.

75
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you love video games?

76
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:40,313
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know you love video games.

77
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't even try to lie.

78
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to keep it special.

79
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:44,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I show up once in a while.

80
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:45,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at random.

81
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:46,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody knows when I'm coming.

82
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:48,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But the games, the games.

83
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like a ninja.

84
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:50,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you like video games?

85
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:52,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

86
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:54,326
[SPEAKER_12]: He's really having to think about this one.

87
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:55,306
[SPEAKER_07]: They've just always been there.

88
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:56,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Video games have always been there?

89
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:57,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

90
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when Jamie's yelling at you?

91
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,029
[SPEAKER_12]: You can turn to video games?

92
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,350
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I mean like in the past.

93
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of how we met, kind of.

94
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: That and anime.

95
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:09,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_04]: Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fanfiction.

97
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:12,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of more anime.

98
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,858
[SPEAKER_12]: What is your favorite video game of all time?

99
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:38,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I always like to ask guests on the show this It's a tough question It's supposed to be a tough question Symphony of the Night Castlevania That's a damn good game Metal Gear Solid You can go back a little bit further There's a couple other good ones Super Metroid Gunstar Heroes How do you feel about that?

[SPEAKER_12]: I like Gunstar Heroes a lot

101
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:42,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we were off last week.

102
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,073
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't have a show last week.

103
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:48,575
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day at the various conventions going on everywhere and what have you.

104
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:51,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were gone last week, so we missed some of last week's news.

105
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,857
[SPEAKER_12]: You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan, how do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?

106
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm feeling pretty good.

00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:57,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah?

108
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:00,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching the trailer and I'm just like, oh my god.

109
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so long.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: He changed his wallpaper.

111
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And they keep introducing all these people.

112
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, whatever.

113
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's Solid Snake!

114
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Naked Snake.

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I put my Snake wallpaper back up.

119
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the Big Boss wallpaper.

120
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

121
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Big Boss is a fucking gangster!

122
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her.

123
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't.

124
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this big intense face and he's like looking out of the screen like I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error blue screen of death that you had before.

125
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is awesome.

126
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's old.

127
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it's awesome.

128
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:38,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's old.

129
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:39,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's awesome.

130
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,239
[SPEAKER_04]: My wallpaper is far better than yours.

131
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:41,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

132
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

133
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,244
[SPEAKER_12]: So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced while we were off on break was Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns.

134
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:52,647
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

135
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:55,048
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.

136
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me!

137
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me!

138
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,031
[SPEAKER_12]: How dare I?

139
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:01,952
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not worthy.

140
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:03,752
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Final Fantasy XIII 3.

141
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:04,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's be real.

142
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:05,473
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it is.

143
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:09,655
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's one of those weird Square Enix games where they're like, hey, you know what?

144
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,856
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to put that subtitle first.

145
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,477
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be a sub anymore.

146
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:14,417
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a title.

147
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy, we'll take the back end.

148
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,419
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just step down for a second.

149
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,403
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take the back end this time.

150
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,486
[SPEAKER_11]: We're giving them the money shot.

151
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:25,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Lightning's going to explore the back door.

152
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,291
[SPEAKER_04]: They like to savor the last shot before popping the heat sink.

153
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:34,471
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

154
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,374
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to start off the show tonight.

155
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:42,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit, but I have a little bit something – I have something special to get into at the top of the show tonight here.

156
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,105
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to play something for you guys, and unfortunately, you only get to see the audio – or you only get to hear the audio of this because it is a podcast.

157
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,488
[SPEAKER_12]: But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes.

158
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to give you guys the premiere –

159
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:01,354
[SPEAKER_12]: of the new Xbox Live indie game, Bungie Ferret Tossing.

160
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,115
[SPEAKER_12]: It is coming out very soon.

161
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:08,699
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, the designer is going to be on the line with us in just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys to talk a little more about this game.

162
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, it is an OLR-inspired game.

163
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:16,144
[SPEAKER_12]: You might remember we used to come up with these little dream games, things we wanted to see.

164
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:17,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, what was the one we had?

165
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:23,949
[SPEAKER_12]: The WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, which is like Pokemon Snap, but it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head shouting, "'Fuck.'"

166
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,530
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a really old reference to a news article from like 2008.

167
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Like right now you probably just think that's insanity and it is.

168
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:30,571
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a fun thing.

169
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,751
[SPEAKER_12]: What on the show is it saying?

170
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:45,795
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even remember what inspired it but we added the game Bungie Ferret Tossing to the list and Aaron went and he actually made a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing and it looks awesome.

171
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:48,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the debut trailer here on Orange Lounge Radio.

172
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you love flying a helicopter?

173
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:51,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

174
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:53,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?

175
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:54,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

176
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you love blowing stuff up?

177
00:07:56,865 --> 00:07:57,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

178
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you love terrorists?

179
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:03,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Awkward... Do you love blowing up terrorists?

180
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:04,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

181
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:10,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you love flying a helicopter, swinging from a bungee cord, and blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?

182
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:14,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what you do in Bungie Ferret Tossing!

183
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,634
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, Bungie Ferret Tossing!

184
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:24,700
[SPEAKER_09]: The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona, which is good because now there's something in Arizona, but it's bad because it's a terrorist base.

185
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:30,365
[SPEAKER_09]: So armed only with the most advanced ferro-weapons technology, you must attempt to storm their desert base.

186
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:38,011
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll come at you with guns, rockets, high-powered rifles, hired ninjas, and even insane laughter.

187
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:47,889
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets, proximity ferrets, homing ferrets, and even cluster ferrets.

188
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Will it be enough?

189
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games.

190
00:08:52,130 --> 00:09:00,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Bunch of ferret tossing also features two-legged cone, three difficult floors, bonus survival and time attack modes, and a great soundtrack.

191
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:07,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Intense action, bullet-dodging thrills, and the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else.

192
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Bungie Ferret Tossing on Xbox Live Indie Game

193
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:17,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Love, love, love.

194
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:21,647
[SPEAKER_12]: YYRgames.com for more information on that.

195
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:22,907
[SPEAKER_12]: What'd you think, DarkSakura?

196
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:23,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I am pleased.

197
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that might have been your idea.

198
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you happy with how that turned out?

199
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite.

200
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I named the dude, the last name.

201
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

202
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:31,332
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

203
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:32,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what I named him.

204
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get Aaron or YYR on the line right now to talk a little more about bungee ferret tossing.

205
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:43,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys are probably thinking there at home, like, God, Orange Laundry, are you really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top of your show?

206
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we are.

207
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:44,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck yes, we are.

208
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Heck, I'm thinking that and I'm at the show.

209
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,082
[SPEAKER_12]: When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas.

210
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:51,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Aaron, you there?

211
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:55,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yes.

212
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:55,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I am.

213
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:58,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just start by saying, I love you, man.

214
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:01,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I love you, man.

215
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:01,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

216
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you guys, too.

217
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,131
[SPEAKER_12]: You're making our dream come true, and I love it.

218
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, I figured I'd take the ball and run with it.

219
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:16,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it sat on my plate for a while, but hey, you guys told me to get on that.

220
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, eventually, I did.

221
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we are happy that you did.

222
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,723
[SPEAKER_12]: So how long of a process did it take to grow?

223
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:30,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, let me back up a little bit because Bungie Veritas-ing, it's almost done, right?

224
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?

225
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:51,280
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now where other game creators basically try it out, make sure it doesn't crash, make sure there's nothing objectionable, make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially, and nudity and other things are accurate.

226
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:11,693
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you know once they find that there's nothing wrong with it they pass it and once enough people pass it it's approved and then once it's approved I click a button and it's out so I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend let me tell you something there is some stuff up there right now I would not wish on any of you

227
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I play the game, so you don't have to.

228
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,040
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to happen very soon.

229
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days.

230
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:35,063
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'm saying.

231
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:37,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

232
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:41,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it.

233
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:46,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card.

234
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:50,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with.

235
00:11:51,176 --> 00:12:07,763
[SPEAKER_10]: so I'm just basically going to email everybody be like hey guess what's happening like right now this game it's coming out here's the trailer here's a press kit do you want to review code and I'd like to do that before the game comes out so basically it means I'll probably be doing this like pretty soon alright I understand yeah

236
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, then I'm going to push the button.

237
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:13,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest.

238
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway.

239
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,228
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, this is kind of interesting.

240
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?

241
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I have.

242
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,092
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of the answer to the summer games arcade and...

243
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:34,477
[SPEAKER_12]: All the other promotions they do for the big boy games from the big companies, right?

244
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:40,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow.

245
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:48,089
[SPEAKER_10]: And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe.

246
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to be right there with them.

247
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:55,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's actually kind of exciting because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way.

248
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:59,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the fact that it's a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing.

249
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:03,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat because this is too good.

250
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

251
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:16,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we understand that Bungie Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter, but we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity.

252
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:19,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Will there be nudity in Bungie Ferret Tossing?

253
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:30,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere, and of course it's very fake and cartoony looking, no, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity.

254
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:37,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment, but it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once.

255
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,217
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right, I'll tell you what you need to know.

256
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel.

257
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know.

258
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you something.

259
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous.

260
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:52,524
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes.

261
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

262
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:54,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's put boobs on the list.

263
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,067
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry.

264
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to draw the line somewhere.

265
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to be as family friendly as possible.

266
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,831
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have darkly colored chickens.

267
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge, dark chickens.

268
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:10,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark chickens?

269
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from another old joke, Big Black Cock.

270
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, stop.

271
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,676
[SPEAKER_12]: We do Dark Chickens.

272
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:17,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll put that on the list.

273
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:18,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, that'll work.

274
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me say this real quick.

275
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:31,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Jessica Harper from our good pals at Under Station Live Saturday nights here at VOG says, The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me.

276
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god.

277
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you even think of that?

278
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:36,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not.

279
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,133
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to be careful because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation.

280
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:49,176
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this.

281
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Like floating ferrets.

282
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,960
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a fantastic idea.

283
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:59,722
[SPEAKER_12]: At least now there will be something in Arizona.

284
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:00,263
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

285
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, everyone I've ever talked to,

286
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:09,797
[SPEAKER_10]: who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona has basically said the same thing to me.

287
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:10,958
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing there.

288
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:14,499
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is the whole reason why I put that in there.

289
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, I'm acknowledging what they said.

290
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:17,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice.

291
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:18,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice.

292
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:18,601
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

293
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:19,982
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me think.

294
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:24,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight.

295
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:28,266
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wanted to bring you on because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here.

296
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And even though you're the one that's ultimately going to profit from it,

297
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,208
[SPEAKER_12]: I still think it's great.

298
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It has my full blessing.

299
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:41,693
[SPEAKER_10]: If this game does really well, I am totally going to fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff.

300
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:43,974
[SPEAKER_12]: That is going to be... Beer works.

301
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,495
[SPEAKER_10]: You can pay us in beer, sir.

302
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:48,677
[SPEAKER_12]: You got it.

303
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:49,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing.

304
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,258
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway.

305
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:53,239
[SPEAKER_12]: We're fun.

306
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,220
[SPEAKER_12]: We promise.

307
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,361
[SPEAKER_12]: No exploding ferrets in person, though.

308
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:57,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's stay away from that.

309
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we can put a firecracker in one of the little...

310
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:02,044
[SPEAKER_12]: A little more about the game.

311
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:06,045
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet.

312
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you.

313
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:16,090
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can tell it has a great old arcade-style look and feel to it, as all your previous games really have.

314
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,391
[SPEAKER_12]: You're very inspired by old-school 80s arcade games, aren't you?

315
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Just arcade games and intense action-packed games in general.

316
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:26,114
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only kind of game I'm ever going to make because that's what I'm most into.

317
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:36,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I don't know if it has an old-looking vibe or what, but it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe, because I'm not very good at it.

318
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:45,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't say it's old-looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like if an Atari 2600 game was modern, and that's certainly not a bad thing.

319
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,725
[SPEAKER_12]: We killed hours and hours and hours with the boom and stuff, you know what I mean?

320
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,227
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a Defender-ish look to it.

321
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you're not the first person that compares it to Defender.

322
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, you're not saving people.

323
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,852
[SPEAKER_10]: You're destroying them with ferrets.

324
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:00,953
[SPEAKER_10]: As you should.

325
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:06,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, it has been compared to Defender before.

326
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:07,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

327
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,190
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a whole new... It's not a Defender clone at all.

328
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,172
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a whole new... There's bungee cords and everything.

329
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Defender meets Bionic Commando.

330
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.

331
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,497
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... Exploding ferrets.

332
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: With ferrets.

333
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,420
[SPEAKER_12]: It's new while feeling retro.

334
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,241
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's cool.

335
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,202
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's true in all your games.

336
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just awesome.

337
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:24,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So... Boom.

338
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:25,725
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

339
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:31,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Erin, before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR and what's going on in the gaming world this week, is there anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?

340
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:33,626
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

341
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,627
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a very long process.

342
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually started this project last May.

343
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been in the works for a very long time.

344
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:50,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless, I've had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it, and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

345
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:52,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be a dollar.

346
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:53,878
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be free to try.

347
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it.

348
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to hear very quickly the wish list for the sequel?

349
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:01,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

350
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:02,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

351
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:04,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this.

352
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:16,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking, alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers, elemental ferrets, fire, ice, and lightning, strife amethysts,

353
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, not Chaos Emeralds because we can't rip off anybody.

354
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:22,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Credits will contain a rhythm game.

355
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:26,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Other vehicles besides helicopter, like Bungie from a motorboat, yes.

356
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Dedicated sound for missile launch.

357
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Screen clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered at any time.

358
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Ferrets equipped with milk tea.

359
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Money should be used to buy stuff.

360
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

361
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:38,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club.

362
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:42,362
[SPEAKER_10]: These trained ferrets will then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game.

363
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:53,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Deformable landscapes Summon killer train to attack enemies An eagle operating a crane Needs to be a stage boss Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city

364
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:54,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to bring that to you guys.

365
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a quick question.

366
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:55,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Dan.

367
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:56,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any zombies in it?

368
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

369
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,913
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no indie games without zombies.

370
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,075
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of indie games.

371
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So you gotta put some zombies in.

372
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Every indie game has zombies.

373
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:33,482
[SPEAKER_10]: There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games.

374
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm saying every indie game has zombies.

375
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,746
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need some zombie ferrets.

376
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,228
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what there is in the game though?

377
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:41,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope I'm not spoiling anything.

378
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,691
[SPEAKER_12]: There are kittens in the game.

379
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they zombies?

380
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:46,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

381
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:48,695
[SPEAKER_05]: You are fucking this up for me, Rob.

382
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:52,958
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a screen when you run the game that says please don't throw animals in real life.

383
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can't do that with my cat.

384
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:56,842
[SPEAKER_04]: She's too huge.

385
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:59,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I could.

386
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:05,109
[SPEAKER_12]: There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens, but we'll see.

387
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, okay, Aaron, I gotta wrap up and let you go, but everybody, be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing.

388
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be out in the coming days.

389
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:16,258
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process, but it will be out very soon.

390
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:40,437
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's a dollar for heaven's sake we never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio but we're gonna say buy this because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games that are having a lot of spotlight this week we really want Aaron to be able to do well so when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar you probably already have it in your leftover points anyway and go buy this game

391
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:41,618
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have fun.

392
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: If you follow YYR Games on Twitter, you'll know exactly when it comes out.

393
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tweet the moment it releases.

394
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,962
[SPEAKER_12]: And check out the website, of course, yyrgames.com where you have other games.

395
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:58,665
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight, but you have other games on the marketplace like Snake 360 and Falling that are worth checking out.

396
00:20:58,805 --> 00:20:59,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

397
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

398
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

399
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:02,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Old arcade game style stuff.

400
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:03,307
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

401
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Aaron, have a good one, buddy.

402
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:05,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you again.

403
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you too.

404
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:08,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for having me on.

405
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:08,750
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

406
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

407
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Anytime.

408
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:09,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

409
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:10,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

410
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:11,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

411
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,893
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and if you're going to make a game inspired by an Orange Lounge Radio idea, I'll bring you on at the top of the show too.

412
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:18,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's be real.

413
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I am super excited.

414
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:21,795
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I can't wait to play it.

415
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:25,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not just saying that because we're involved.

416
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,417
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like fun.

417
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Ionotropic said Ferret Returns, Bungie Ferret Tossing 13.

418
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:35,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels, but we gotta make this one a success first.

419
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if this is a flop, then Aaron's gonna be like, maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money.

420
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:45,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies are overrated.

421
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:46,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, alright.

422
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:49,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move into how was your gaming week?

423
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,306
[SPEAKER_12]: What types of video games?

424
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:54,748
[SPEAKER_12]: You obviously haven't been playing Bungie Veritas and it's not out yet, but what have you been playing this week?

425
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:55,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start with DarkSakura.

426
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW and Mass Effect.

427
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Three.

428
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,910
[SPEAKER_07]: For a change.

429
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And two.

430
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:01,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

431
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night.

432
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the zombie one.

433
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:09,575
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

434
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:10,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies.

435
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:10,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Overrated.

436
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hadn't played through it yet.

437
00:22:12,856 --> 00:22:15,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So... What the fuck, man?

438
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I have also been doing school stuff this week and writing.

439
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:23,589
[SPEAKER_07]: That has nothing to do with gaming.

440
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:24,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And writing.

441
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a life.

442
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week.

443
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:29,413
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you bite me?

444
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:32,635
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you bite me?

445
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:34,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That has nothing to do with gaming either.

446
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,418
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me?

447
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:44,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio where every gamer has a voice and they might use it to fight with their spouse live on air.

448
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:50,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?

449
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I shot my husband in the face.

450
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Mass Effect and World of Warcraft.

451
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan.

452
00:22:58,562 --> 00:22:59,442
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

453
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:03,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption on Dead Nightmare.

454
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:04,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

455
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,490
[SPEAKER_07]: But zombies!

456
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:09,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty good.

457
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:09,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

458
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:15,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out, and it just sort of sat on the shelf, and then for whatever reason this week, I was like, you know what?

459
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:17,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies.

460
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:18,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I did.

461
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:22,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you like to do a lot of- Oh, and he cursed a lot, too.

462
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah!

463
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:27,864
[SPEAKER_12]: You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs, too.

464
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:32,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV, so you can kind of like watch people play games and stuff, right?

465
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:36,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube.

466
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you think that's a weird thing?

467
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And wrestling.

468
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's a weird thing.

469
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:40,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, to an extent.

470
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:41,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling.

471
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:42,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I will say this.

472
00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:45,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week?

473
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,632
[SPEAKER_12]: It was something on the Game Boy.

474
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,652
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, was it DuckTales on the game?

475
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:49,933
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was something even more obscure than that.

476
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:50,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Mega Man?

477
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,313
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was even more obscure than that.

478
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:53,393
[SPEAKER_12]: It was some licensed game.

479
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:54,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, The Simpsons.

480
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,214
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy.

481
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:58,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch.

482
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it was Bart vs. the Juggernauts.

483
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:31,669
[SPEAKER_07]: well because a lot of these games are stuff that like I've known existed but I was always just like what the fuck is this about and there's like this world of long plays channel on YouTube and they do just these really good high definition long plays of games and to an extent it's like I'd like to check this game out but God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it so that's kind of the best way to go it's a good way to sample stuff too a lot of the new stuff yeah well you know a lot of these games suck so it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them

484
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:34,842
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, fair enough, fair enough.

485
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:36,922
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, anything else you want to say about your game of the week, Dan?

486
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:38,543
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

487
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:40,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's go to Loki.

488
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:40,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Zombies.

489
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, how was your game of the week?

490
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:47,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, a little bit of that.

491
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:54,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also played McPixel because I bought that on my Android phone.

492
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's pretty fun.

493
00:24:56,311 --> 00:25:01,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a cross between the old LucasArts point-and-click adventure games

494
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,668
[SPEAKER_11]: and MacGyver, but really dirty.

495
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Dirty MacGyver?

496
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:11,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Dirty MacGyver.

497
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:20,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, every single puzzle in the game is you have 20 seconds to defuse a bomb.

498
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,691
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know where the bomb is.

499
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:23,632
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know how you have to defuse it.

500
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:27,133
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to figure out how to interact with stuff and what you need to do.

501
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,995
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the puzzles involve kicking someone in the nuts.

502
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:33,096
[SPEAKER_11]: To defuse a bomb?

503
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:34,517
[SPEAKER_11]: To defuse a bomb.

504
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:37,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I play Scribblenauts.

505
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the bomb in their pants?

506
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes, yeah.

507
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:46,286
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a weird game, and it's awesome, though.

508
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:52,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why, but I'm suddenly reminded of the game Don't Shit Your Pants, which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?

509
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

510
00:25:54,972 --> 00:26:00,336
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it gets really strange, but it's definitely worth checking out.

511
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:02,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's also on PC as well, but...

512
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:06,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us more about this because we need more people on it.

513
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:22,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's a server.

514
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:23,977
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a whitelisted server.

515
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:34,385
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically you go to the forum thread on the VOG Network forums and you say, hey, I want to be let in and I add your name to the whitelist and you can go in and build.

516
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:39,590
[SPEAKER_11]: And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome and up on a hill is the clubhouse.

517
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:47,156
[SPEAKER_11]: You go in there, take a set of tools, you know, or, you know, use that as a home base for a while until you figure out what you're going to do and then go off and build.

518
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,677
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just a survival thing.

519
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:49,558
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of fun.

520
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR Village

521
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:35,947
[SPEAKER_12]: in retrospect though I think I might have built my set actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing which I don't I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that so maybe we can get something on YouTube but anyway we'll work on that later but I was playing that this week on the server and I built a sad little house but I just I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode you do have limited mobs you're on like the easy mode but you gotta have you gotta have some mobs to give some challenge right

522
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:39,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, easy mode still has all the mobs, they just don't do all the damage.

523
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:45,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode, and the other day we were just fucking around.

524
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:49,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, see, since I'm the admin, I can switch shit all the time.

525
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:55,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have right now, I'm basically playing, or I was playing in creative mode because I was...

526
00:27:56,895 --> 00:27:57,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's put it this way.

527
00:27:57,536 --> 00:28:02,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, when we first started the server, I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff.

528
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:06,359
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I had Bobby telling me, hey, I can't go into the clubhouse.

529
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?

530
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the door doesn't work.

531
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:11,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

532
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:12,422
[SPEAKER_11]: That's weird.

533
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:13,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, whatever.

534
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Rob's like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse.

535
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,921
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

536
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Why couldn't you go in the clubhouse?

537
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:21,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, apparently, I built it too close to the spawn point.

538
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:25,428
[SPEAKER_11]: See, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point and build stuff and stuff like that.

539
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Other players cannot.

540
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through because it wasn't updating the block that was there.

541
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:34,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had to tear it all down and build it up on a hill, which is kind of funny.

542
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,559
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks great, though, because now you have that waterfall and everything.

543
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so we were doing that.

544
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,503
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, so like I said, I was fucking around because I was in creative mode.

545
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:47,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you can spawn whatever you want, including monster eggs that spawn monsters.

546
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So my friend's like, you know, I was talking about the Enderman.

547
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,929
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those.

548
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, all right.

549
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:57,656
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I spawned one and he fought it and he killed it pretty easily.

550
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy.

551
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, okay.

552
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I spawned 20 of them.

553
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,869
[SPEAKER_12]: But you will not make a habit out of spawning random enemies.

554
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:07,310
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

555
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,474
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch.

556
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:12,056
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

557
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:32,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's stuff around.

558
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:42,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to figure out a way to, like, maybe we'll put up a sign on our house that's like, hey, property of... You know, so you don't, like, accidentally... I mean, because someone can go to my mine, and that's fine.

559
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:43,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really give a crap.

560
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, there's a ton of... Go ahead.

561
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:51,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game, I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in The Sims and build underground.

562
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:52,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Live in a cave.

563
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:53,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Which you can do.

564
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:54,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

565
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:54,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's easy.

566
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,291
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people kind of do that.

567
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:59,513
[SPEAKER_12]: They have their main house, and they build little outposts as they're in the mine.

568
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:00,533
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a very common thing to do.

569
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Living Underground.

570
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I did see a cool video where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf area was in Lord of the Rings.

571
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

572
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool.

573
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:12,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

574
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that.

575
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:20,106
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more like just creative mode, which we can, you know, if no one wants to play survival mode, we can do that.

576
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:26,891
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't want to do creative mode because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything because it's like, eh, who cares?

577
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:28,192
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all the objects.

578
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:29,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't need to go find whatever.

579
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:30,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's fine.

580
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:31,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't died yet.

581
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:31,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

582
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I've come close, but I haven't died yet.

583
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:36,116
[SPEAKER_11]: This is still how I play The Sims.

584
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:41,799
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm not building that clubhouse, I am actually playing survival mode and I'm not actually cheating.

585
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have diamond armor or anything.

586
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just playing legit, but aside from building the start area, that obviously is doing creative.

587
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:53,155
[SPEAKER_12]: So VOGnetwork.com forums if you want to join us and please do.

588
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:55,776
[SPEAKER_12]: But don't destroy my house or I will find you and I will kill you.

589
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:57,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got plenty of server space.

590
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:03,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I can host up to 35 people at a time and I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once.

591
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

592
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So please join.

593
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:06,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

594
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:07,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

595
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else for your gaming week?

596
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:11,424
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's it.

597
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already.

598
00:31:13,794 --> 00:31:17,817
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought Minecraft PC this week solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server.

599
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,220
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there that are not in the Xbox One.

600
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it worth the $20?

601
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,863
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really fun.

602
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:25,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

603
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:31,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought the 360 version I thought is pretty slick, and I started to get bored of it, and the PC version is so much better.

604
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the PC one you can mod and do all that stuff to as well.

605
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:37,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan's helping me get a map mod, which I think would be very useful.

606
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:37,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

607
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:42,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of that stuff's okay, as long as it's not like, hey, mod 2, you know, x-ray mod and stuff like that.

608
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:51,930
[SPEAKER_12]: And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin, so I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now, walking around in armor, so, you know.

609
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like in real life!

610
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:38,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I said fuck that so I actually have and I even linked it in there there's a program you can use with XPatter to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller and that's actually how it plays with an Xbox 360 controller and it's awesome it's great if you play the 360 version sweet alright the rest of my gaming week I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news because we've been pretty lengthy so far I'm just going to say more World of Warcraft surprise but I got my 6th level 85 cue the womp womp whatever don't judge me

611
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:43,369
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3 because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now.

612
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:49,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you are a PlayStation Plus person you can get Borderlands for free which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel.

613
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:57,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus but I am not one to turn down a free game especially one that I was enjoying on the PC.

614
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:03,047
[SPEAKER_12]: The only problem I'm having is that it was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse than it is with PlayStation 3 controller.

615
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:03,728
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only bummer.

616
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,029
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game looks good, and it runs really smooth.

617
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,290
[SPEAKER_12]: You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3.

618
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:13,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Couple little graphical glitches here and there, but nothing that's a game-ruining experience.

619
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:19,478
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands, and I really like the whole fusion of a role-playing game and a first-person shooter.

620
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,740
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes the first-person shooters very accessible.

621
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,161
[SPEAKER_12]: So, love it.

622
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:28,945
[SPEAKER_12]: That's mostly it for this week that I can think of.

623
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:34,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do some housekeeping and then we're going to get into some big news tonight right at the top, right Loki?

624
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:38,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to join us on Facebook.

625
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:49,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to join us on Twitter and you can always follow us there and keep on top of what's new with the show and when we're going to have weeks off or what have you.

626
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:54,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of weeks off, DarkSakura will not be here next week but we will still be doing a show.

627
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:56,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we can get Dan to come back.

628
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:57,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

629
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:57,914
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

630
00:33:58,714 --> 00:33:59,234
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a holiday.

631
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:01,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

632
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:02,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on.

633
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:02,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting off.

634
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:04,278
[SPEAKER_11]: News.

635
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:04,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight.

636
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:05,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

637
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:09,641
[SPEAKER_11]: So apparently there's a thing that went around the internet.

638
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,863
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny because I get to watch it happen.

639
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:17,026
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a distributor that leaked the Wii U pricing and the release date.

640
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:18,067
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just so weird.

641
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:22,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And they listed three SKUs and the price is anywhere from $249.99 to $349.99 and

642
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:26,938
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

643
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was the funny thing.

644
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:46,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't me.

645
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:52,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It was some dude that goes by Hound Dog on YouTube, which we tracked down.

646
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:55,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a hilarious story about that, which I'll get into in just a second here.

647
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:57,946
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, it was a little weird.

648
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to talk about where I work because, you know...

649
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:02,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

650
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:21,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's funny though.

651
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:47,277
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not necessarily a story about information I pretty much already told you guys based off of this information that I've known for a while now and also other information pointing to the release date of the 18th which is PDP leak and of course some other games that are going to be announced probably this week that are going to be launching on the 18th that kind of point to that.

652
00:35:48,197 --> 00:36:12,455
[SPEAKER_11]: but here's the funny thing is how the gaming media works and watching how it works is really interesting how there's literally copy pasted stories no research done and then it starts playing the telephone game where it gets even more ridiculous and I kind of I don't know if anyone's followed my Twitter you kind of saw a little bit of that because I kept posting articles like lol did they really just do that you know

653
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:15,215
[SPEAKER_11]: So it started off in GamesFAQs.

654
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It went to GoNintendo.

655
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:20,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Then all these other Nintendo kind of websites started running it.

656
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:38,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things that kind of got back to the higher-ups at our company, because we started getting calls from our customers, was the fact that they go, oh, this distributor supplies Amazon overstock and blah, blah, blah.

657
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, yeah, true.

658
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,580
[SPEAKER_11]: We work...

659
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

660
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

661
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:29,635
[SPEAKER_11]: But, like, CNET, I think out of all the stories I saw from the different blogs, CNET's probably the funniest one.

662
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:36,659
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know who this guy is, but he first, he put the text, you know, that was the text information.

663
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,800
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, yeah, okay, so it was the Wii U system, 11.11, 249, 299, 349, three Cs.

664
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,221
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I got this additional information.

665
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:48,485
[SPEAKER_11]: A screenshot of the website.

666
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:49,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that backs up the information.

667
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, I got another source.

668
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:53,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a video.

669
00:37:53,468 --> 00:37:54,569
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you're a fucking idiot.

670
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,230
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all the same goddamn thing.

671
00:37:57,111 --> 00:38:03,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same goddamn source, and you're sourcing two other things to make it sound like it's more legit.

672
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:07,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

673
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,799
[SPEAKER_12]: DungeonBuster says, copy pasta journalism.

674
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Frisbee says, control C, control V. That's how the stories go from you to me.

675
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:18,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

676
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,379
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like a little song about that.

677
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:26,020
[SPEAKER_12]: WhatUpG says it would be cool if it was November 11th, but November 18th makes sense, at least historically, for Nintendo.

678
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,382
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the exact same day they released the Wii?

679
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:30,422
[SPEAKER_12]: The GameCube?

680
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,242
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the other systems was the exact same day.

681
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. Dan.

682
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:39,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a background in video games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense as a release date.

683
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:42,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays.

684
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:44,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really irritating.

685
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does also make sense about the 11th that...

686
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:51,796
[SPEAKER_07]: They will be sending them out early because the stores don't get it.

687
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:54,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't just magically spawn in the store Sunday morning.

688
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,181
[SPEAKER_07]: We have it hidden away somewhere so that you can't get it.

689
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't steal it.

690
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:00,684
[SPEAKER_07]: You could steal it.

691
00:39:00,824 --> 00:39:03,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it and post it on the internet.

692
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:04,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I never did that.

693
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,609
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you never did that, but other people did.

694
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,331
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the funny part.

695
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:14,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said before, there is this guy, this anonymous guy, Hound Dog, who leaked it.

696
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:22,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, first rule of the internet, anything that you post on the internet always stays on the internet.

697
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:31,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you post a video or whatever, and then you think that we're not going to figure it out.

698
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:35,127
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, his video basically was a video of a screenshot.

699
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:38,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Had a time and date in the bottom corner.

700
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:39,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Stupid.

701
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:42,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know what we could do?

702
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,070
[SPEAKER_11]: We went back.

703
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the web access logs.

704
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:46,333
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked at our web access logs, and guess what?

705
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:49,776
[SPEAKER_11]: We query every single search on there.

706
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:57,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U. And during that time frame, there was only two.

707
00:39:57,342 --> 00:40:00,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it was basically two different customers.

708
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs.

709
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,710
[SPEAKER_11]: and then, oh, guess what?

710
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:16,222
[SPEAKER_11]: You do a Google Cash search on Hound Dog and, oh, he has a trailer, an advertisement for a certain store that happens to be one of the two customers.

711
00:40:16,662 --> 00:40:17,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

712
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh, Guerrilla Games and St.

713
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:19,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Cloud.

714
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't hold back now.

715
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:26,118
[SPEAKER_12]: So what happened?

716
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:28,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Did anybody go to the guy and say, why'd you do it?

717
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I don't know.

718
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:35,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this was stuff that was to be handled by managers and upper management and stuff like that.

719
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:38,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, funny enough, like I said, this had nothing to do with me.

720
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:47,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I do item setup sometimes for a lot of games, but I don't do first party because our buyer, for some goddamn reason, wants to hold on to first party even though she fucks everything up.

721
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:48,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

722
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So she set that up.

723
00:40:52,307 --> 00:40:56,750
[SPEAKER_11]: She didn't flag it to not show up on our website, even though maybe she should have.

724
00:40:57,431 --> 00:41:00,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And it wasn't any of my customers that leaked the information.

725
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:03,916
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just sat back and kind of let, lol.

726
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:07,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee said she should have used the free Wi-Fi at Starbucks.

727
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:08,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

728
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too, is IP pointed back to St.

729
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:11,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Cloud as well.

730
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:16,495
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, whatever, anyway, this is all a moot point come Thursday.

731
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:17,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It is, exactly.

732
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,496
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all a moot point, and the whole thing blew over pretty fast.

733
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:25,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, except for the fact that Amazon's like, we need an apology from you, we need you to blah, blah, blah.

734
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo, of course, on people's asses about, hey, this is not supposed to be...

735
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Which only leads credit to the fact that it's probably true.

736
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:36,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, except that the date's not right.

737
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:40,098
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I mean, some information's obviously accurate, like the pricing.

738
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,963
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, and like I said...

739
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:50,576
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've been listening to the show for the last few months, this is not news to you.

740
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:51,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, put it that way.

741
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:59,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I just find it funny, though, how seriously copy-paste all these articles are.

742
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:02,720
[SPEAKER_11]: IGN, what the fuck?

743
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, let's step aside here.

744
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,822
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck is it with IGN and GameSpot where you have an article...

745
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,443
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

746
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it some British guy?

747
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a British guy.

748
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,300
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't like to read.

749
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,981
[SPEAKER_11]: They're having some intern guy read this.

750
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:44,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, and there's this distributor, but we can't get into their website because you need to log in and password, but this guy got in and he got this exclusive information and blah, blah, blah.

751
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:45,744
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't like to read.

752
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:47,406
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous.

753
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:50,427
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't spell ignorant without IGN.

754
00:42:50,787 --> 00:43:06,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's funny you say that because people can't read, but there is somewhat truth to that because this makes a very interesting companion piece to Bobby's show before us tonight and the whole girlfriend mode thing and how that kind of got carried away and all that as well.

755
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:08,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's because people didn't really want to read the entire article.

756
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:14,435
[SPEAKER_12]: They just wanted to read the part where, oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode because he clearly hates women.

757
00:43:15,155 --> 00:43:15,395
Yes.

758
00:43:16,044 --> 00:43:16,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Schmo I mean like

759
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:45,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, MTV, it went everywhere.

760
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:48,568
[SPEAKER_11]: It went to MTV's website, their gaming blog.

761
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:50,669
[SPEAKER_11]: It went to IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET.

762
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:54,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, CNET takes stuff from Yahoo, or vice versa.

763
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's just saying that people want to know the Wii U date already.

764
00:43:57,791 --> 00:44:05,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that, but it's just so ridiculous how I literally got one email from an independent site asking to follow up on that.

765
00:44:06,374 --> 00:44:07,595
[SPEAKER_11]: One person.

766
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:10,190
[SPEAKER_12]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

767
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:35,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

768
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:36,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

769
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:38,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That is your fucking, like, proof?

770
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,334
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy just says, yeah, that sounds like feasible information.

771
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:45,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a millionaire?

772
00:44:45,698 --> 00:44:46,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Ask the expert.

773
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:48,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you on a game show?

774
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:49,922
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, yeah, I...

775
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that seems feasible.

776
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:58,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Joe Schmoe, who plays some video games that delivers our mail, do you think that this release date sounds like it could be real?

777
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:00,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds right.

778
00:45:01,752 --> 00:45:02,913
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the release date.

779
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the information to back that up, but it sounds like a date to me.

780
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:12,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it is a date, and it hasn't happened yet, so I guess it could happen.

781
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:17,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, let me just stop right here and reiterate what I've said in the past.

782
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:42,608
[SPEAKER_11]: 3 SKUs, 249, 299, 349, 299 SKU I speculate Wii U system, tablet that's it, it's in case you already have a Wii system speculate because I don't know any information other than 3 prices oh and November 18th release date but that's also speculation based on information but whatever not information I have from Nintendo nothing from Nintendo

783
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:50,290
[SPEAKER_11]: 299 SKU, System, Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck.

784
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,013
[SPEAKER_11]: In case you don't own a Wii system.

785
00:45:55,875 --> 00:46:01,580
[SPEAKER_11]: 349 SKU, System, Gamepad, Nunchuck, Remote Plus, Nintendo Land.

786
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my guess, so we'll see you in a few days if I'm right.

787
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:05,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, we'll find out on Thursday.

788
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:11,530
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be a busy week between the iPhone 5 on Wednesday and then Nintendo on Thursday.

789
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:17,655
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Tech Christmas in some ways, so the blogs will be busy this week copy-pasting from each other.

790
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:22,039
[SPEAKER_12]: When they're not live blogging, because that's the other big thing.

791
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:22,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Live blogging.

792
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, I think I just gave Loki an aneurysm.

793
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:29,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on to something a little more indie, shall we?

794
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:31,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Something a little more under the radar.

795
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:33,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to.

796
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:34,549
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Steam Greenlight.

797
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:35,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?

798
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:44,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a chance for you to basically help... I don't want to say it's Kickstarter because it's not, but it's helped generate buzz for indie games.

799
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:50,983
[SPEAKER_12]: People that want to get their ideas out there to be approved by the community to be sold on Steam.

800
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:51,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

801
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:56,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, when this first went live, a lot of people were putting a lot of crap on there.

802
00:46:56,305 --> 00:47:01,866
[SPEAKER_12]: And things like Half-Life 3 showed up on Steam Greenlight and things of that sort.

803
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:09,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to kind of curb this, Valve decided to set a $100 fee to get your project listed on Steam Greenlight.

804
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,390
[SPEAKER_12]: This fee goes to Child's Play.

805
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:16,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty interesting solution, a pretty ingenious way to figure it out.

806
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:22,852
[SPEAKER_12]: The Valve UI designer Alden Kroll said, quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play.

807
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:27,893
[SPEAKER_12]: We have no interest in making money from this, but we do need to cut down the noise in the system.

808
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:36,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, this is causing a little bit of controversy because some people think, you know, well, for a true indie, $100 is a lot of money, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

809
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:37,215
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you guys think?

810
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:37,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this fair?

811
00:47:38,855 --> 00:48:06,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a good way to make sure people are serious about it I think it's fair And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing So, very cool Also, some other changes to the system Now when you log in and look at Steam Greenlight You're going to see a smaller list You're not going to get thrown everything at you Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see Popular games and new games on Steam Greenlight

812
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:09,224
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna.

813
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that have anything to do with Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?

814
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:13,105
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a sequel.

815
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:13,645
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing.

816
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,886
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the one that was on Kickstarter that I kept talking about.

817
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go upvote that right after the show.

818
00:48:17,466 --> 00:48:18,286
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a demo you can play.

819
00:48:19,387 --> 00:48:19,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

820
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:20,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Already?

821
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:21,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

822
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:24,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Over 700 submissions already since August 30th.

823
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:30,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, one thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight, just for the record, sex games.

824
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:36,314
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a game called Seduce Me that was on Project Greenlight and yes, it was removed.

825
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:40,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve, said, quote,

826
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,860
[SPEAKER_12]: and what a shame.

827
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,961
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I guess we can understand why they don't want that stuff associated.

828
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:53,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex is overrated.

829
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:56,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because of the media sensation that would occur.

830
00:48:57,182 --> 00:48:57,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about it.

831
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:06,503
[SPEAKER_12]: If they were to sell Booby Game, then suddenly it's going to be on CNN and there would be the commentators on Fox News.

832
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:11,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God, can you believe on Steam the Booby Games that are corrupting our children?

833
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:13,945
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't let your dirty money.

834
00:49:14,045 --> 00:49:15,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Booby Steam.

835
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:23,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that, but I wish people weren't so freaking...

836
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:25,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Up tight.

837
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick up their ass.

838
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes have their game, damn it.

839
00:49:33,256 --> 00:49:33,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Boobs.

840
00:49:34,476 --> 00:49:38,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing when you tell a little kid they can't do something, what's the first thing they want to do?

841
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Is go out and do it.

842
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:51,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things, you know, like foul language or fucking, people are just going to want to, you know, see it more.

843
00:49:52,755 --> 00:50:16,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Miss World Nude 13 for Greenlight Excellent suggestion Sague, who knows a thing or two about developing games, is in our chatroom saying The Greenlight stuff is cheaper than any other commercial game seller Steam is $100 for one time, iOS is $99 a year, Mac is another $99 a year, Xbox Creator Club $99 a year

844
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:28,262
[SPEAKER_12]: So, very interesting perspective on what that $100, if that really is too much money or what, is that, you know, that's the same price you're going to pay for iOS, which is seen as a huge indie boom.

845
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:34,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, it's the same amount for one year, and then you have to renew on iOS where you don't with Steam.

846
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:40,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically like the free-to-play model, if you think about it.

847
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:44,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy the game, or you pay your hundred bucks, and you're done.

848
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:53,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says, yeah, like unbaptized babies lactating out of Cleopatra's nipple.

849
00:50:54,237 --> 00:50:55,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Oops, that was Dante's Inferno.

850
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Good point.

851
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:00,882
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's move on.

852
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:03,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome, DarkSakura.

853
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how clean it is, but it's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill about the whole Steam Box thing that we've talked about before.

854
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:20,933
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a job listing for an industrial designer on Valve's website, and I'll read the quote on here.

855
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:26,016
[SPEAKER_04]: We're frustrated by the lack of innovation in the computer hardware space, so we're jumping in.

856
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Even basic input, keyboard and mouse, hasn't really changed in any meaningful way over the years.

857
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:37,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, they're trying to, I guess, expand further, but they're still kind of denying the whole Steambox thing.

858
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do these rumors keep perpetuating everywhere?

859
00:51:41,775 --> 00:51:42,736
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting.

860
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:46,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Although it does have me thinking, you know, if Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time.

861
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,440
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because they keep hiring for people for that.

862
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:51,881
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why.

863
00:51:52,301 --> 00:51:55,523
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have someone that's being hired for, like, hardware design, it's like,

864
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:58,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Steam Software.

865
00:51:58,373 --> 00:52:01,434
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year or anytime soon.

866
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:06,855
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, they hired console developers for Diablo 3 at Blizzard.

867
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:10,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Doesn't mean that we've seen Diablo 3 on consoles yet.

868
00:52:10,496 --> 00:52:12,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it'll happen next year, or maybe not.

869
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even see it being its own sort of system.

870
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:22,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I see maybe the potential of having something as a computer add-on.

871
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a combination storage device, maybe graphics boosting...

872
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:33,075
[SPEAKER_12]: It would seem so easy, though, to just do a little PC in a box that plays very basic Steam games.

873
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:34,576
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, what the hell's Anuja?

874
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:36,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like that.

875
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:40,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a very, very, very bare-bones type of system that just plugs in your TV.

876
00:52:41,582 --> 00:52:46,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe Valve could pump another couple hundred dollars worth of tech into it and have something that could play Portal.

877
00:52:47,187 --> 00:52:48,088
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I could do that.

878
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:49,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called my computer.

879
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they could sell it as a PC.

880
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That I already have.

881
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:54,394
[SPEAKER_02]: That I play Mass Effect on.

882
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:55,490
[SPEAKER_12]: VALVE

883
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3 I have Half-Life News

884
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:45,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in June 2004, to show off the, at the time, brand new Source engine that Half-Life 2 was going to come out on in November of that year, Valve put out Half-Life Source.

885
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:52,817
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically piped the original Half-Life game into the Source engine, and it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done.

886
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:57,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, okay, it has better lights and physics, but otherwise...

887
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Half-Life 1998 game.

888
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:02,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fans were really kind of ticked off about it.

889
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source Project.

890
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:07,488
[SPEAKER_06]: They are just amateur programmers.

891
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not professionals.

892
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Not getting paid to do this.

893
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:19,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, we are going to take Half-Life and literally redesign it and program it from the ground up into the Half-Life 2 engine.

894
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,599
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a fiasco in 2009 where they released a really awesome trailer.

895
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:48,814
[SPEAKER_06]: and eventually ultimately the game didn't come out because they're like this isn't done so they kind of shot themselves in the foot they went out on a on a media blackout for last three years and it's coming September 14th they finally announced that's very interesting so because they kind of got burned the first time they started saying it was entirely their their fault but yeah but they went just underground with it yeah but they didn't update the twitter they didn't put the youtube no leak screenshots they're like we are off the grid we're still working on it well

896
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:51,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan just said, sounds like Valve to me.

897
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:53,380
[SPEAKER_12]: But this isn't Valve.

898
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:53,700
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

899
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:55,203
[SPEAKER_12]: But Valve's kind of embracing it, right?

900
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:55,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

901
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:56,905
[SPEAKER_12]: They're very supportive of it.

902
00:54:56,985 --> 00:55:02,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Some companies would cease and desist the shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger remake and Square Enix, right?

903
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:02,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

904
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:05,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there.

905
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:06,879
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

906
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:25,975
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your thing.

907
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:30,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's already got its clearance on Steam Greenlight.

908
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Shock.

909
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:35,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam's probably going to host it.

910
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:38,398
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life, if anything?

911
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:50,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Get people interested in the franchise again considering that it's been eight years since Half-Life 2 proper came out and a good five years since Episode 2 came out.

912
00:55:51,841 --> 00:56:19,330
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're still not a peep about Half-Life 3 so they also said for this remake that they added some dialogue they did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it more interesting but otherwise it's a shot for shot remake the trailer is still on YouTube from three years ago if you haven't seen the trailer you should watch it it's really awesome and so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out it's free why wouldn't I and you'll be playing through it so I'll see you in a week alright

913
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else you want to say, Alan, before we say goodbye for now?

914
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:23,754
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

915
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:24,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the update.

916
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:25,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

917
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:28,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I, unfortunately, am very ignorant when it comes to Half-Life.

918
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,680
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have time to play every single game.

919
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:33,563
[SPEAKER_12]: But Alan will make me play it at some point, I'm sure.

920
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:36,426
[SPEAKER_12]: And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it.

921
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:42,909
[SPEAKER_12]: So, TigerClaw in our chatroom says, It's better they continue working on it and when they feel it's ready to release it.

922
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,671
[SPEAKER_12]: No reason to release a buggy game.

923
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:48,233
[SPEAKER_12]: If Half-Life 3 ever comes out, it'll probably go multi-platform.

924
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:53,436
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I've been teasing Alan with that idea is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles.

925
00:56:53,616 --> 00:56:57,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it'll be a PC and PlayStation 4 exclusive or something like that.

926
00:56:57,778 --> 00:57:01,901
[SPEAKER_12]: That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy about the game.

927
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:03,982
[SPEAKER_12]: We shall see, however.

928
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:06,964
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's move on with some other news.

929
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:07,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

930
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:16,112
[SPEAKER_12]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, thumb.

931
00:57:16,752 --> 00:57:18,414
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so this is kind of interesting.

932
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:21,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked about a game I played during the week, which is called McPixel.

933
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:27,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And this weekend, they actually went about a unique way to advertise the game.

934
00:57:27,121 --> 00:57:27,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

935
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:30,744
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the front page of the Pirate Bay.

936
00:57:31,265 --> 00:57:35,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Pirate Bay being a very notorious website for piracy.

937
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:41,795
[SPEAKER_11]: McPixel, they have basically a little bit of a letter to people.

938
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, hi, I'm SOS.

939
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:47,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I make video games, but not in a big company.

940
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I make games I want to make.

941
00:57:49,422 --> 00:58:06,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that not everyone can afford entertainment but everyone needs it and even though I make games for a living I am most happy to just see people enjoy them so today you can download a torrent of my game and if you like throw some coins in my general direction

942
00:58:07,576 --> 00:58:09,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they actually have that on there.

943
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:13,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You can download a torrent for it and download it for free.

944
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:19,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Or once you've done that and you play it, you can decide to donate money to them.

945
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:23,517
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is what Radiohead did for one of their albums like five years ago.

946
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:38,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember, but I know that this is what also like, oh, the Riff Trax guys do because they're like, listen, we know that not everybody downloads these from us, but if you like them, maybe kick us some money.

947
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:47,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Riff Trax is in a little bit of a stickier situation, though, because they are doing parody art of movies that you kind of already have to own.

948
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,194
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't put it out there, attaching it to the movie.

949
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:56,161
[SPEAKER_12]: So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff for them to get that, but they're in a weirder place.

950
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,924
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also a lot more convenient to try to have to sync that stuff up, because...

951
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:16,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I've synced that stuff up before like I'll have we watch all the Twilight movies with the riff track stuff on there and I had the DVD for Twilight but man downloading the the already pre-synced stuff's way easier than having to have a second source to play the mp3 at the same time as auto because it gets off sync pretty easy

952
00:59:18,562 --> 00:59:18,862
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

953
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:21,505
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think?

954
00:59:22,466 --> 00:59:28,331
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know if there's a lot to think about this because clearly no big publisher is ever going to do anything like this.

955
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:30,593
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you think the guy will actually make some money?

956
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:31,714
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll probably make some money.

957
00:59:31,754 --> 00:59:33,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the game is not that expensive.

958
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably didn't spend that much money on it.

959
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:49,768
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, it's exposure to him, and if he figures that people are going to pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces and saying, hey, you know what, at least donate some money if you like it, donate a dollar, five dollars, whatever.

960
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:57,833
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity about a game that, let's be real, people probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway.

961
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, it's really hard for indie games to get press.

962
01:00:01,216 --> 01:00:03,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere.

963
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:03,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

964
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:10,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing, too, is you look at some of the people, it's much like the Humble Bundle, where some people just pay a penny or whatever to get it.

965
01:00:11,012 --> 01:00:15,015
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's people that donated $141 for this game.

966
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:20,700
[SPEAKER_12]: The Brony Bundle group on Twitter or whatever, I get a kick out of that.

967
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,042
[SPEAKER_12]: People that band together to donate lots of money.

968
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:24,243
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is a good cause.

969
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:25,604
[SPEAKER_12]: I love those Humble Bundles.

970
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are always a good time.

971
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:28,787
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, let's see here.

972
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,329
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to see the...

973
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:35,930
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a couple of people that did $140, $133, $67.

974
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,531
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a bunch in the 50s.

975
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:42,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And the average right now, this is the average price that people are paying for is $2.58.

976
01:00:43,452 --> 01:00:45,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment?

977
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:53,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Nish said Radiohead did this for their In Rainbows album and said it brought more money to them than all their other albums combined.

978
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:54,334
[SPEAKER_12]: You know why?

979
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:56,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they cut out the record label by doing that.

980
01:00:57,555 --> 01:00:58,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but still.

981
01:01:00,447 --> 01:01:05,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you are, I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners because this is only going for about another four hours.

982
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,240
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend go downloading the torrent.

983
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:11,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Why you still can.

984
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:19,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can do that guilt-free, and you are totally a law-abiding citizen, because the creator has given his blessing.

985
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,711
[SPEAKER_12]: He wants this to happen, to get the word out.

986
01:01:22,392 --> 01:01:38,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, one little problem with that is that he says that you download the torrent, and it's only available for four hours, but once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and there's going to be someone always hosting that game, or hosting, seeding it, so...

987
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:58,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, alright, well from one controversial viewpoint on piracy to another, Ubisoft, you know they're always on DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap over the years, or I should say over the years, it's only really been about a couple years, but Ubisoft is now changing their policy

988
01:01:58,803 --> 01:02:00,165
[SPEAKER_12]: on this always-on DRM.

989
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:02,087
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's just been too much headache and so forth.

990
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:09,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I think some of us saw this coming, but here's the new DRM policy according to Stephanie Perotti, who is the company's worldwide director for online games.

991
01:02:10,236 --> 01:02:18,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Ubisoft PC games are now going to require a one-time online activation when you first install the game, then you are free to play the game offline.

992
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:31,174
[SPEAKER_12]: and they claim this has been Ubisoft's policy since June of 2011 but it's been noticed that maybe there's been some games that didn't get that memo because the always on we've seen in some more recent releases.

993
01:02:31,655 --> 01:02:35,418
[SPEAKER_12]: However, this is going to be their new policy moving forward.

994
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:36,839
[SPEAKER_12]: A fair compromise?

995
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:37,499
[SPEAKER_12]: What do y'all think?

996
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:38,980
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fair.

997
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:48,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think it's fair, but I always have concern for people that can't get that online connection.

998
01:02:49,064 --> 01:02:53,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are still some people in the world that can't get that online connection.

999
01:02:53,225 --> 01:02:57,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not just talking about people that live in the sticks, but I'm talking about military service people overseas.

1000
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:02,188
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, sometimes I want to play some games to, you know, blow off steam a little bit.

1001
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:09,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I do realize they can use the satellite connections and some of these things, but that's not always a reality or it's expensive or what have you.

1002
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:17,392
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just hope there might be some workarounds, some considerations made for people who really are trying to do the right thing.

1003
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:22,773
[SPEAKER_11]: They usually do that with a lot of software that phones home is they'll have, you know, the...

1004
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:30,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Alternate means of, you know, it usually involves, you know, calling up a number and you give them, you know, whatever and they give you authentication code or something.

1005
01:03:30,856 --> 01:03:31,496
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be fair.

1006
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:40,540
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope there is some type of little plan B in the small print for people that truly can't, you know... Which is how they create a lot of those cracks out there for software.

1007
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,961
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just saying, you know, it's...

1008
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:50,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they were expected to be having 93% of their software pirated, so... Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85%.

1009
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:52,104
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1010
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:53,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1011
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,885
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running long this segment, of course, but we knew we would.

1012
01:03:55,925 --> 01:03:56,405
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

1013
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:57,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to keep this one short then.

1014
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:08,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being developed by... It looks like Straight Right, who is out of Australia.

1015
01:04:08,748 --> 01:04:08,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1016
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up.

1017
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically saying that they've been putting a lot of work into this.

1018
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be a rushed deal.

1019
01:04:17,093 --> 01:04:21,235
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's launch and that it's supposed to be amazing.

1020
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:25,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank God they didn't come out and say, you know what, we're going to half-ass it.

1021
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:30,661
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out and say, eh, whatever.

1022
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,742
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you'll like what you get.

1023
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:33,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Deal with it.

1024
01:04:33,943 --> 01:04:34,604
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1025
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:54,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, wouldn't you think with a new console coming out, you'd want to say better?

1026
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:56,031
[SPEAKER_04]: A new console using old technology?

1027
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:59,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... How can it be any better?

1028
01:04:59,693 --> 01:05:03,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying it's not helping the case of the Wii U. It's using old tech.

1029
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:04,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It's using the Wii.

1030
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:05,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

1031
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:08,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would expect it to look as good as a Wii.

1032
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:12,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm being sensationalist and latching on to that one quote.

1033
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:14,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's my headline, my pull quote.

1034
01:05:14,548 --> 01:05:21,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Mass Effect 3 will look about as good as it does on the other consoles on the Wii U. There's my pull quote.

1035
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

1036
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

1037
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:25,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes?

1038
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:29,430
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a quote here.

1039
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time.

1040
01:05:33,032 --> 01:05:40,638
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a significant technical challenge bringing the game from its original format to the Wii U. It's new, different, and sophisticated piece of hardware.

1041
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:42,019
[SPEAKER_04]: As of.

1042
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a good deal of technical energy that's being expended to make that happen.

1043
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:54,957
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to see the size of the shoehorn we need to have in order to get that tablet to work.

1044
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:59,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, it's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns of that size.

1045
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:01,062
[SPEAKER_12]: We used a hammer.

1046
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:08,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, I will say, because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy, I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version, at least for multiplayer.

1047
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:11,490
[SPEAKER_12]: I really kind of wanted to see how it works with the screen and everything.

1048
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:12,651
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very curious.

1049
01:06:12,711 --> 01:06:13,432
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be interesting.

1050
01:06:13,857 --> 01:06:16,558
[SPEAKER_04]: This is me with no fucks left to give.

1051
01:06:17,678 --> 01:06:18,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop.

1052
01:06:18,238 --> 01:06:19,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to play it on PC.

1053
01:06:19,718 --> 01:06:20,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already fun.

1054
01:06:20,918 --> 01:06:26,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen or something, but I don't care.

1055
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:33,301
[SPEAKER_12]: If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there and a copy of Mass Effect 3, you know when you come over you'd be like, I want to kind of see it.

1056
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:34,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd watch you play it.

1057
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:41,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd be curious, but it's not enough to make me buy a Wii U. What would be enough to make you buy a Wii U?

1058
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:42,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck if I know.

1059
01:06:44,716 --> 01:06:45,797
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a good system?

1060
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:47,238
[SPEAKER_04]: How about it being good?

1061
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:49,700
[SPEAKER_12]: How about it having good games?

1062
01:06:51,322 --> 01:06:52,583
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying it doesn't have good games.

1063
01:06:52,603 --> 01:06:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know yet.

1064
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:55,205
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the problem with Mass Effect 3.

1065
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have Mass Effect 3.

1066
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1067
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1068
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan's got something to say.

1069
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanted a Wii, too.

1070
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is from the woman who wanted a Wii to start with.

1071
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:10,496
[SPEAKER_07]: She waited in line overnight.

1072
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:11,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, fuck the Wii.

1073
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:13,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It's last gen.

1074
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:14,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no!

1075
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:18,101
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the man who played Twilight Princess for hours.

1076
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:18,661
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

1077
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours.

1078
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I played through Twilight Princess.

1079
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The Zelda games were good.

1080
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:26,606
[SPEAKER_07]: The Zelda games are good, but at the same time it's, you know.

1081
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:27,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to do surgery.

1082
01:07:27,887 --> 01:07:29,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the Wii U is that bad.

1083
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:30,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just think it's a stupid idea.

1084
01:07:31,169 --> 01:07:32,810
[SPEAKER_04]: He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying.

1085
01:07:34,071 --> 01:07:35,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have Mass Effect.

1086
01:07:36,596 --> 01:07:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect Mass Effect is out Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it Okay, goody goody gumdrops Oh Mass Effect, oh it's so good

1087
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:55,923
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1088
01:07:57,144 --> 01:08:01,045
[SPEAKER_12]: To be fair, Dan's making a point we've made on this show before.

1089
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:06,287
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard to get excited about, you know, Arkham City redone, Mass Effect 3 redone.

1090
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:07,668
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even that redone.

1091
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:12,810
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, some of the... You can tilt the Wii U tablet to move the, you know, the Batarang around.

1092
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:16,731
[SPEAKER_11]: You could do that also with the 6-axis controller on the PS3 version.

1093
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:18,532
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love... Please.

1094
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Please, Nintendo.

1095
01:08:20,853 --> 01:08:24,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday and be like, here's what's coming...

1096
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It better have like... Shut up, Dan.

1097
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:29,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It better have Turian porn mode to make me buy it, okay?

1098
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:38,928
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, seriously, they could come out Thursday and say, you know, we've got this Zelda or this F-Zero or this new IP that looks really cute.

1099
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like for that to happen.

1100
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,852
[SPEAKER_12]: That would make me very happy and a little less skeptical.

1101
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:46,233
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I fear is that there's a new Excite truck.

1102
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:48,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the bite if it's a new Excite truck.

1103
01:08:48,455 --> 01:08:49,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan says Metroid Prime 4.

1104
01:08:49,215 --> 01:08:51,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet.

1105
01:08:51,157 --> 01:08:51,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you kidding?

1106
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,071
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be absolutely amazing.

1107
01:08:57,452 --> 01:08:58,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a mic.

1108
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:00,694
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1109
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:02,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on.

1110
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:04,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still... Oh, I'm sorry.

1111
01:09:04,396 --> 01:09:04,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1112
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:05,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1113
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:08,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1114
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

1115
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to let him win?

1116
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get him later.

1117
01:09:18,746 --> 01:09:19,066
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1118
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:19,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

1119
01:09:20,307 --> 01:09:27,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that are coming out a little sooner than a Wii U. There's actually some stuff coming out this week.

1120
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:34,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Finding Nemo, Escape to Big Blue, the special edition being re-released now by Disney Interactive as opposed to THQ because guess what?

1121
01:09:34,695 --> 01:09:38,337
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo that they're re-releasing into theaters.

1122
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:39,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of appropriate.

1123
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:46,062
[SPEAKER_11]: But it also is coming out on the 3DS as well, so it's not just the DS this time because, you know, I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements.

1124
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:47,302
[SPEAKER_12]: What happened to movies on the 3DS?

1125
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:47,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1126
01:09:48,527 --> 01:09:49,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Weren't that supposed to be a thing?

1127
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:20,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let me put it this way.

1128
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:25,035
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises never comes to fruition, like online.

1129
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:31,088
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a dig at the Wii U. I'm telling you the online is going to suck.

1130
01:10:32,568 --> 01:10:34,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Battlefield 3, the premium edition for $60.

1131
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:36,689
[SPEAKER_11]: You get all the DLC.

1132
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:39,949
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 this week.

1133
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,990
[SPEAKER_11]: NHL 13 on PS3 and 360.

1134
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:45,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for PS3 and 360.

1135
01:10:46,931 --> 01:10:52,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Also NHL, the Stanley Cup Collector's Edition, which is probably a complete waste of money unless you like DLC.

1136
01:10:52,792 --> 01:10:54,852
[SPEAKER_11]: That is coming out for $80 on PS3 and 360.

1137
01:10:54,912 --> 01:10:54,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And

1138
01:10:59,082 --> 01:11:25,767
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game for 2012 and probably 2013 NBA Baller Beats for Xbox 360 and Kinect The game where you have to dribble a basketball to the beat of the music On my carpet On your carpet in front of Kinect Because that's going to fucking work That is coming out this week This game is going to scare the shit out of the cats, I can't wait

1139
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:31,928
[SPEAKER_11]: One week from today, Kirby's Dreamland, I guess, Collector's Special Edition.

1140
01:11:32,228 --> 01:11:34,209
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too many fucking adjectives.

1141
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:37,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Collector's Special Edition is too much.

1142
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Just call it a Special Edition or Collector's Edition.

1143
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,611
[SPEAKER_11]: It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition.

1144
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:44,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Limited.

1145
01:11:44,811 --> 01:11:45,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Mega.

1146
01:11:45,491 --> 01:11:47,752
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 years anniversary edition.

1147
01:11:48,424 --> 01:11:57,622
[SPEAKER_11]: just call it virtual console games we could have released but we decided to put them on a fucking cart or I'm sorry CD DVD whatever disc that has a cart painted on it

1148
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you know what though?

1149
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:00,601
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be in insert format.

1150
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:04,124
[SPEAKER_12]: And it comes with a special gold cartridge that has absolutely nothing inside it.

1151
01:12:04,224 --> 01:12:15,633
[SPEAKER_11]: At the very least, at least there is more than one ROM on this fucking disc as opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars as a limited edition and then having people buy it for $80.

1152
01:12:15,673 --> 01:12:19,335
[SPEAKER_12]: It has that little retrospective hallway new thing in it.

1153
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:21,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that.

1154
01:12:21,874 --> 01:12:27,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, bravo for Nintendo for putting a minute bit of effort into it.

1155
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:31,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Fuck you, Loki.

1156
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants.

1157
01:12:35,943 --> 01:12:39,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Rite says, Super Hyper Kirby EX plus Alpha Zero Turbo.

1158
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I added, for matching service.

1159
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:41,786
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1160
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:42,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby sucks.

1161
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:44,888
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Kirby doesn't suck.

1162
01:12:45,348 --> 01:12:46,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, he does suck.

1163
01:12:46,389 --> 01:12:46,969
[SPEAKER_04]: He does suck.

1164
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:47,830
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the truth.

1165
01:12:49,617 --> 01:12:51,039
[SPEAKER_04]: He also blows.

1166
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:51,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby blows.

1167
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:55,343
[SPEAKER_12]: He's gone from suck to blow.

1168
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on.

1169
01:12:58,101 --> 01:12:59,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Japanese releases.

1170
01:12:59,202 --> 01:13:00,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

1171
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:02,165
[SPEAKER_12]: They get in on the fun this week as well.

1172
01:13:02,225 --> 01:13:05,147
[SPEAKER_12]: September 13th is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360.

1173
01:13:05,588 --> 01:13:07,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Going to the PlayStation 3, of course.

1174
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:08,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Same game there as well.

1175
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And a game called Excel World.

1176
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:13,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Ginyoku no Kakusei comes out.

1177
01:13:13,895 --> 01:13:18,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Limited and regular editions from also... That sounds terribly boring.

1178
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:20,240
[SPEAKER_12]: A whole world based on a database program?

1179
01:13:21,301 --> 01:13:22,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Not looking forward to that.

1180
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:22,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop.

1181
01:13:24,063 --> 01:13:28,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing on the Vita, though LittleBigPlanet is just a couple weeks away at this point in Japan.

1182
01:13:29,245 --> 01:13:31,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week.

1183
01:13:32,046 --> 01:13:35,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Metarot 7, Kabuto, and Kuwagata versions.

1184
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:42,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what game this... It's two separate editions, so it looks like little... Oh, this looks like fighting MechRobots type of game.

1185
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like you collect little MechRobots and fight them to the death.

1186
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:49,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shoot, I know what this is.

1187
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:54,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell me that's not a total Pokemon-inspired screenshot right there.

1188
01:13:54,073 --> 01:14:09,737
[SPEAKER_04]: This was, I watched some of this, where the guy gets these little robots, and it turned out that his dad played these two or something, and they all try to beat up his little robot, but his robot wins, and tears up his house in the meantime.

1189
01:14:10,438 --> 01:14:12,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots.

1190
01:14:12,998 --> 01:14:14,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember, I only just saw it once.

1191
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:16,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Robots tear up a house?

1192
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?

1193
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,164
[SPEAKER_04]: No, a little teeny robot.

1194
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:25,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Sengoku Musou Chronicles 2nd on the 3DS as well.

1195
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:26,949
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys know what that is, right?

1196
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:27,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Devil Kings.

1197
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:28,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Once again.

1198
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:36,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And lastly but not leastly, Shin Igokoro Kaioshitsu comes out from Nintendo on the 3DS this week.

1199
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,541
[SPEAKER_12]: This game is not something that looks... It's an artist program.

1200
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:43,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, this was one of the crazy, wacky games.

1201
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:44,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Art Academy.

1202
01:14:44,582 --> 01:14:47,223
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something... I can't remember what it's coming out as.

1203
01:14:47,643 --> 01:14:50,864
[SPEAKER_12]: It's art drawing things, like still life art.

1204
01:14:50,924 --> 01:14:54,045
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences, and we're like, what the hell is this?

1205
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:55,565
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out in October over here.

1206
01:14:56,866 --> 01:14:58,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that painting of the doggy that they did.

1207
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:00,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Not bad.

1208
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:01,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, there you go.

1209
01:15:01,618 --> 01:15:02,718
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Japanese releases.

1210
01:15:02,738 --> 01:15:03,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's like Art Academy.

1211
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:06,499
[SPEAKER_11]: You can draw everything, I think is what it's called or something.

1212
01:15:06,519 --> 01:15:08,139
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1213
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,739
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an art game.

1214
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:09,440
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll figure it out.

1215
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Go into the UK.

1216
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1217
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still looking at this funny screenshot.

1218
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1219
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the UK, on the 11th, we have Battlefield 3, Armored Kill.

1220
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 14th, Joe Danger 2, the movie, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and Chaos of Deponia.

1221
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1222
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:31,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1223
01:15:31,647 --> 01:15:32,709
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, Loki.

1224
01:15:33,349 --> 01:15:34,931
[SPEAKER_11]: So, more Vita hacking.

1225
01:15:37,014 --> 01:15:44,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Independent developer Yifan Liu has found an exploit that allows retail systems to run native homebrew Vita code.

1226
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:46,645
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1227
01:16:04,403 --> 01:16:12,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, he's basically saying, I'm going to not make anything that will benefit piracy.

1228
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:21,676
[SPEAKER_11]: This tool, in fact, cannot be used for loading backups or pirated content even if I wanted to because of the physical limitations of the exploit.

1229
01:16:22,276 --> 01:16:38,913
[SPEAKER_11]: However, he says that, you know, this kind of stuff could lead to people developing a better method that could lead to that stuff, but as of right now, he is in no way endorsing piracy, even though everyone thinks that homebrew equals piracy, but that's...

1230
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:56,854
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of the situation that we're in right now of course he hasn't released any information on it yet because like before whenever they would release an exploit they would patch whatever game was involved with it so hopefully this one isn't game reliant like the last few have been

1231
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:02,394
[SPEAKER_12]: How quick do you think Sony will patch this up?

1232
01:17:02,454 --> 01:17:03,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, here we go again.

1233
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,336
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's game-reliant, pretty quick.

1234
01:17:05,516 --> 01:17:07,357
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not, it might take a little bit.

1235
01:17:07,637 --> 01:17:12,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if it's even something they can patch, I mean, they should be able to patch it pretty quick.

1236
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:15,961
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we don't know how they're doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to get the jump on patching it.

1237
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:28,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Because before it used to be like, even before they released something, hey, this is the game that you need to have in order to run this modified save that loads the bootloader for some PSP homebrew.

1238
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:55,861
[SPEAKER_11]: before that would run in PSP mode but now that it's in Vita mode you have more access to memory and processing power and that kind of stuff it's not throttled like it was before so hopefully I mean I understand he's hoping that by saying oh yeah it's not going to really run any you know sort of exploit that will allow you the pirate games that he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer but I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that shit as soon as they can

1239
01:17:57,927 --> 01:17:59,187
[SPEAKER_12]: X-Play and Attack of the Show sometimes.

1240
01:18:22,075 --> 01:18:27,302
[SPEAKER_11]: X-Play now doesn't have Adam Sessler, obviously, because he's gone.

1241
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:28,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Morgan Webb still there?

1242
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Morgan Webb's still there.

1243
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:36,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Even Attack of the Shows lost a lot of their cast that people would watch it for.

1244
01:18:37,533 --> 01:18:42,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Variety published an article this week that G4 is going geek and more chic.

1245
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:54,445
[SPEAKER_12]: This is rumor right now, but because G4 is owned by NBCUniversal, Comcast, they want to change G4 into a direction that's more like GQ, the modern male magazine.

1246
01:18:55,846 --> 01:19:00,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how it's more modern male, more refined, I guess.

1247
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what kind of programming that would entail.

1248
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:03,751
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically Spike...

1249
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:04,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1250
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:24,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Me neither because Logo still has RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing on cable worth watching.

1251
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:31,054
[SPEAKER_11]: So Highbrow, are they talking about more like GQ so they're going to start re-running episodes of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that?

1252
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:31,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that how they're going?

1253
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:34,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be like the Metrosexual channel or something?

1254
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:34,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1255
01:19:35,696 --> 01:19:36,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1256
01:19:37,157 --> 01:19:39,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the guys who flip the million dollar homes.

1257
01:19:40,201 --> 01:19:41,402
[SPEAKER_12]: One of those type of shows.

1258
01:19:41,462 --> 01:19:42,383
[SPEAKER_12]: The real estate shows.

1259
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:42,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1260
01:19:42,724 --> 01:19:44,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be garbage, whatever it is.

1261
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:45,187
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1262
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:45,607
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1263
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:52,796
[SPEAKER_12]: But regardless, any video game ties you might have to this network are looking to be severed pretty soon.

1264
01:19:52,836 --> 01:19:53,536
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not surprising.

1265
01:19:53,557 --> 01:19:56,840
[SPEAKER_12]: It hasn't been dumped from satellite providers at this point.

1266
01:19:57,821 --> 01:19:58,962
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not doing too well.

1267
01:19:58,982 --> 01:20:02,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you said, there's been a huge turnover and so forth.

1268
01:20:02,985 --> 01:20:06,208
[SPEAKER_12]: American Ninja Warrior may not have a place on the new G4.

1269
01:20:06,228 --> 01:20:06,688
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

1270
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:07,789
[SPEAKER_11]: That actually was a pretty good show.

1271
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,992
[SPEAKER_12]: The other important thing to say about this, it's probably going to get a new name.

1272
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:15,615
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the other reason that makes this a big deal is because G4 will probably become something else.

1273
01:20:15,635 --> 01:20:18,317
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you right now, American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike.

1274
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,439
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm sure that won't be gone for long.

1275
01:20:23,146 --> 01:20:24,348
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1276
01:20:43,115 --> 01:20:43,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Outro Music

1277
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,055
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1278
01:21:25,476 --> 01:21:35,848
[SPEAKER_04]: In Japan, it was called Chou Wakusei Senki Metaphyte, which translates to Super Planetary War Record Metaphyte, which honestly is a really freaking cool name.

1279
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in the U.S.

1280
01:21:38,612 --> 01:21:39,853
[SPEAKER_04]: in November 1988 and in Europe on April 25, 1991.

1281
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:44,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they had to wait a long ass time to get this.

1282
01:21:45,219 --> 01:21:46,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had to wait a few months after Japan.

1283
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:56,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, this game went from having a killer story in Japan to having the dumbest story ever in the U.S.

1284
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:00,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that doesn't affect how awesome the game itself was.

1285
01:22:00,595 --> 01:22:01,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, get this.

1286
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:03,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The Japanese version.

1287
01:22:03,857 --> 01:22:07,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like an explorer landing on Sophia the Third, the planet.

1288
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:16,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to explore where this ancient civilization was and stop this evil emperor and go through the whole planet.

1289
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, shut up.

1290
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:20,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'm getting Dan to comment.

1291
01:22:22,307 --> 01:22:23,208
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1292
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:43,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Second of all, it's tough as fucking nails.

1293
01:22:43,765 --> 01:22:47,266
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is really, really hard, even for a NES game.

1294
01:22:47,326 --> 01:22:48,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is Nintendo hard.

1295
01:22:48,967 --> 01:22:55,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's no save function, which is pretty brutal, because it's not a short game, and you upgrade the tank.

1296
01:22:56,050 --> 01:23:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you die, and the tank is called Sophia in the NES version, Sophia III, which I always thought was really kind of weird, but it's cute in a way.

1297
01:23:04,207 --> 01:23:22,478
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can make it fly you can drive on walls you can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls you can jump out of the tank and your little dude runs around or you can go into like caves and you run around like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons independently of the character who's named Jason and the tank which once again is named Sophia

1298
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:29,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline, because who fucking cares?

1299
01:23:29,285 --> 01:23:31,588
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese version was a failure.

1300
01:23:32,248 --> 01:23:35,432
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo version is a classic.

1301
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Both Nintendo?

1302
01:23:38,415 --> 01:23:38,996
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

1303
01:23:39,216 --> 01:23:39,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The NES version.

1304
01:23:42,094 --> 01:23:44,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, you completely didn't listen to anything that I said.

1305
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, take the mic, please.

1306
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:53,779
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo version, you drive a tank to save a frog.

1307
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,060
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

1308
01:23:56,461 --> 01:23:57,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Saves you a frog.

1309
01:23:58,462 --> 01:24:00,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can use the pause trick and kill the boss, it's real easy.

1310
01:24:01,663 --> 01:24:04,484
[SPEAKER_04]: The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it, and then they die.

1311
01:24:10,808 --> 01:24:19,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, to be fair, we might have somebody who's like 14 listening to this program with their parents' permission, of course, who maybe didn't... Alright, Jamie, please.

1312
01:24:19,753 --> 01:24:22,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's continue telling the listeners about Blaster Master.

1313
01:24:22,935 --> 01:24:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as Dan said, there is no save feature.

1314
01:24:26,037 --> 01:24:26,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1315
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:29,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

1316
01:24:32,521 --> 01:24:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason and Sophia have different power meters, so they can... They take...

1317
01:24:40,546 --> 01:24:41,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan, you're flustering her.

1318
01:24:41,727 --> 01:24:44,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Let her get through this segment and then fluster her while we're on break.

1319
01:24:44,568 --> 01:24:45,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to cut a bitch.

1320
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:51,752
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, you've got different power meters you can power up separately.

1321
01:24:51,812 --> 01:24:54,113
[SPEAKER_04]: You get five continues, which he didn't say.

1322
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:12,605
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can restart the game at the same level in which you lost all of your lives you have a hover gauge that controls how much thrust is left in your tank I don't believe you brought up that the tank flies I don't believe you did bring that up he did oh my bad

1323
01:25:18,715 --> 01:25:20,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you the king of Blaster Master?

1324
01:25:21,676 --> 01:25:22,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the Blaster Master.

1325
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: James is like, I play Blaster Master.

1326
01:25:26,738 --> 01:25:28,199
[SPEAKER_07]: We could turn on the desk right now.

1327
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:32,820
[SPEAKER_07]: We could actually turn on two nests and we could have a Blaster Master race and I will fuck her shit up.

1328
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,942
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we played Mass Effect, yeah, that wouldn't even be a good race.

1329
01:25:39,783 --> 01:25:40,804
[SPEAKER_07]: She'd murder the shit out of me.

1330
01:25:40,864 --> 01:25:42,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be kind of sad.

1331
01:25:42,124 --> 01:25:44,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me the mic.

1332
01:25:47,526 --> 01:25:55,913
[SPEAKER_04]: For other releases that came out, there was a re-release on the PlayStation for Blaster Master itself.

1333
01:25:56,393 --> 01:25:59,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, my apologies for Metafight.

1334
01:25:59,716 --> 01:26:06,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ripple Island came out on PlayStation in the Volume 4 of Sunsoft's Memorial Series in 2002.

1335
01:26:07,222 --> 01:26:10,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it came out on the Wii Virtual Console on December 14, 2009.

1336
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:10,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1337
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:19,134
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, um, Metafight was re-released for the Virtual Console on June 29, 2010.

1338
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:28,424
[SPEAKER_04]: There was Blaster Master Overdrive that, um, honestly I didn't give a crap about, so I'm not gonna talk about it.

1339
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:29,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1340
01:26:29,646 --> 01:26:29,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1341
01:26:31,434 --> 01:26:35,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually played the Wii, believe it or not, I played the Wii remake, I have it.

1342
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:39,318
[SPEAKER_12]: It just didn't have the charm of the original for me.

1343
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:41,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the controls bugged me.

1344
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:45,740
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a few years ago, but I remember the controls really bothered me.

1345
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,341
[SPEAKER_12]: That was an issue.

1346
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:49,002
[SPEAKER_07]: That was released by Victor Ireland.

1347
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,008
[SPEAKER_07]: from Working Design.

1348
01:26:51,929 --> 01:26:52,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And rest in peace.

1349
01:26:54,029 --> 01:26:55,010
[SPEAKER_07]: New company, Gaijin Works.

1350
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:55,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Gaijin Works.

1351
01:26:55,710 --> 01:27:01,352
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also a sequel on the Genesis, which was not produced by the original creator, which was not so good.

1352
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:06,454
[SPEAKER_07]: There was kind of a pseudo-remake for the Game Boy Advance called Enemy Within.

1353
01:27:06,474 --> 01:27:09,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, it was for Game Boy Color, which was also not as good.

1354
01:27:09,675 --> 01:27:15,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a punishment from God sequel on the PlayStation called Blaster Master Blasting Again.

1355
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:18,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So really, there's only one good Blaster Master game.

1356
01:27:20,163 --> 01:27:29,101
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole reason why the story was changed is because You have to give them credit.

1357
01:27:29,162 --> 01:27:30,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Frogs are pretty awesome.

1358
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're slimy and stupid.

1359
01:27:32,977 --> 01:27:33,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And they make you hallucinate.

1360
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:43,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, they changed it because they didn't think that the space exploration would be popular in the US.

1361
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:46,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole genre of anime hadn't really made it over.

1362
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they changed it to Jason and His Frog.

1363
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:52,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And used the name of the planet, Sophia the Third.

1364
01:27:52,902 --> 01:27:56,783
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a portion of the map in the fourth level...

1365
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:05,385
[SPEAKER_04]: that did not map over, so actually you have to make this huge jump off a ladder, suspended in midair.

1366
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna say any more

1367
01:28:34,338 --> 01:28:35,819
[SPEAKER_12]: How'd that Kickstarter go for them?

1368
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:37,480
[SPEAKER_12]: They made it, right?

1369
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,721
[SPEAKER_12]: They made more than initial... I figured they would.

1370
01:28:41,922 --> 01:28:42,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

1371
01:28:43,282 --> 01:28:43,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1372
01:28:44,263 --> 01:28:45,483
[SPEAKER_12]: This game is hard as hell.

1373
01:28:46,964 --> 01:28:47,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, there it is.

1374
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:48,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Blast off.

1375
01:28:48,225 --> 01:28:51,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just watching the YouTube in the background, remembering having horrible, horrible nightmares of the game.

1376
01:28:52,367 --> 01:28:57,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that that particular playthrough was interesting because it was a non-machine-assisted speedrun.

1377
01:28:58,957 --> 01:29:06,801
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks like you can kind of tell when it's an emulator and when it's that dirty connection to the TV through an RCA cable.

1378
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:10,844
[SPEAKER_12]: You can kind of tell the difference on YouTube, and that was definitely the TV being plugged in there.

1379
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:14,646
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Blaster Master.

1380
01:29:15,326 --> 01:29:17,088
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere.

1381
01:29:17,548 --> 01:29:19,029
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got plenty more of show to come.

1382
01:29:19,089 --> 01:29:20,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there's more.

1383
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:26,875
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to talk a little bit about the OUYA in Part B tonight, as well as some Final Fantasy collections and, of course, Rapid Fire News.

1384
01:29:27,235 --> 01:29:28,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Your phone calls as well.

1385
01:29:28,776 --> 01:29:29,457
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to call in?

1386
01:29:29,717 --> 01:29:32,239
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to get involved in Dan and Jamie's discussions?

1387
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:35,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's your chance during the Skype line.

1388
01:29:35,261 --> 01:29:36,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be involved in our discussions.

1389
01:29:36,923 --> 01:29:38,244
[SPEAKER_12]: In Part B tonight.

1390
01:29:39,224 --> 01:29:40,645
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, a break.

1391
01:29:40,686 --> 01:29:43,668
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1392
01:29:49,944 --> 01:29:59,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on September the 9th, 2012, Dreamcast Day at vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network.

1393
01:29:59,469 --> 01:30:02,591
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a pretty exciting show so far tonight.

1394
01:30:02,991 --> 01:30:05,673
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, I think they hugged it out during the break, yes?

1395
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1396
01:30:36,154 --> 01:30:38,676
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1397
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:07,264
[SPEAKER_04]: In January, coming up next year, we will have been together for 15 years, but we've been married for 7.

1398
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:10,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1399
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You are such a dork.

1400
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:14,688
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I supposed to say?

1401
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm leaving you.

1402
01:31:18,527 --> 01:31:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is funny because Rob's cutting his quesadilla with scissors.

1403
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You use a pizza cutter.

1404
01:31:28,272 --> 01:31:30,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob doesn't have mics, he can't hear any of this.

1405
01:31:30,653 --> 01:31:31,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so yeah.

1406
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:45,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I found them on the work message boards and told you about it.

1407
01:31:45,048 --> 01:31:46,749
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I found them on the work message boards.

1408
01:31:46,789 --> 01:31:47,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a liar!

1409
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:47,470
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

1410
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:47,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1411
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:08,917
[SPEAKER_04]: You are such a liar.

1412
01:32:08,977 --> 01:32:11,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely married for seven years, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie and Dan.

1413
01:32:11,998 --> 01:32:12,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

1414
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:13,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1415
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:14,960
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1416
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,241
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple quick, quick things.

1417
01:32:18,162 --> 01:32:20,143
[SPEAKER_12]: We are just a couple weeks away from episode 475.

1418
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:22,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, one more thing.

1419
01:32:22,965 --> 01:32:23,145
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1420
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:26,727
[SPEAKER_04]: The day after, on September 2nd, I converted.

1421
01:32:27,407 --> 01:32:27,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I became Jewish.

1422
01:32:27,908 --> 01:32:28,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that your fool?

1423
01:32:28,988 --> 01:32:29,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my conversion day.

1424
01:32:29,589 --> 01:32:30,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you'd already had that.

1425
01:32:30,949 --> 01:32:32,110
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not this last one.

1426
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:32,690
[SPEAKER_04]: That was two years.

1427
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It meant two years past my conversion.

1428
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:35,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, it was the anniversary, I see.

1429
01:32:36,453 --> 01:32:38,294
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why you're not here next week, because there's a holiday.

1430
01:32:38,494 --> 01:32:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because Rosh Hashanah starts.

1431
01:32:39,895 --> 01:32:41,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So Happy New Year, all the Jews out there!

1432
01:32:41,876 --> 01:32:42,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Understandable.

1433
01:32:42,717 --> 01:32:43,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good week off.

1434
01:32:43,878 --> 01:32:45,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you listen to the podcast during the week.

1435
01:32:45,919 --> 01:32:46,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1436
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:49,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, episode 475 is coming up.

1437
01:32:50,542 --> 01:32:53,464
[SPEAKER_12]: We might have some surprises in store, so be sure you're here that night.

1438
01:32:53,724 --> 01:32:57,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm talking mostly for the longtime OLR fans.

1439
01:32:57,427 --> 01:33:01,930
[SPEAKER_12]: There's something brewing where you longtime OLR fans are going to be like...

1440
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:02,910
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1441
01:33:03,991 --> 01:33:04,791
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'm going to say.

1442
01:33:05,391 --> 01:33:06,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Episode 475, be here.

1443
01:33:07,572 --> 01:33:07,872
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1444
01:33:09,633 --> 01:33:10,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Because reasons.

1445
01:33:11,974 --> 01:33:13,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Rapid Fire News is up next.

1446
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:18,437
[SPEAKER_12]: While I finish cutting my quesadilla, which by the way, smells delicious.

1447
01:33:18,897 --> 01:33:25,580
[SPEAKER_12]: You take all the pictures you want of my delicious quesadilla from the work-provided quesadilla maker that I won.

1448
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1449
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:28,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Picture with scissors.

1450
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:32,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a new free Vita game that you can download.

1451
01:33:33,128 --> 01:33:42,855
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Treasure Park, and basically it's a game that allows you to create your own grid-based puzzles with hidden objects and bombs and stuff, and you can share them with your friends in your app.

1452
01:33:44,056 --> 01:33:48,599
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be a reason for me to play my Vita that I haven't played.

1453
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet.

1454
01:33:50,881 --> 01:33:52,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I heard it was really short, though.

1455
01:33:52,762 --> 01:33:54,323
[SPEAKER_12]: It is, but they have all the online levels.

1456
01:33:54,383 --> 01:33:55,204
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good game.

1457
01:33:57,657 --> 01:34:20,934
[SPEAKER_11]: and that pinball, that pinball now that I haven't really played but I hear it's good I played it on Xbox the Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection as well as the God of War PS3 collections those have been given an update to allow for remote play on the Vita so now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix on the go which is pretty sweet

1458
01:34:22,794 --> 01:34:27,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, those include the first two God of War games, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus.

1459
01:34:28,476 --> 01:34:29,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

1460
01:34:29,856 --> 01:34:44,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And last but not least, Angry Birds is getting yet another spin-off, this time in the form of Bad Piggies, where you're going to take the villains, I guess, of the game and play as them in puzzle-like fashion, I'm sure.

1461
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac.

1462
01:34:48,201 --> 01:34:56,326
[SPEAKER_11]: September 27th with other versions Windows Phone, Windows 8 and PC later on I guess.

1463
01:34:59,348 --> 01:35:02,890
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't sound very exciting but I'm not a big Angry Birds fan.

1464
01:35:05,892 --> 01:35:08,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did.

1465
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:09,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

1466
01:35:09,914 --> 01:35:10,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Metroid

1467
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:17,620
[SPEAKER_12]: On the Wii U. Do I have your attention?

1468
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:19,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well here's the unfortunate part.

1469
01:35:19,981 --> 01:35:21,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just part of Nintendo Land.

1470
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:23,943
[SPEAKER_12]: But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat.

1471
01:35:24,904 --> 01:35:28,426
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version of the Battle.me prototype.

1472
01:35:28,446 --> 01:35:29,866
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ever saw that during the trade shows.

1473
01:35:29,886 --> 01:35:30,547
[SPEAKER_12]: They showed this.

1474
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:32,329
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya, listen up.

1475
01:35:55,478 --> 01:35:57,840
[SPEAKER_12]: La Mulana, finally on WiiWare.

1476
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:59,881
[SPEAKER_12]: September 20th is the big day.

1477
01:36:00,482 --> 01:36:02,463
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a big sordid story here.

1478
01:36:02,483 --> 01:36:05,765
[SPEAKER_12]: It was going to come out and then it wasn't because they didn't think it would make money.

1479
01:36:06,706 --> 01:36:08,227
[SPEAKER_12]: They said it was going to be canceled.

1480
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:09,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the internet got mad.

1481
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:09,868
[SPEAKER_12]: So here it is.

1482
01:36:10,108 --> 01:36:10,769
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of QQ.

1483
01:36:11,469 --> 01:36:16,172
[SPEAKER_12]: The most complete archaeology action and exploration game ever created.

1484
01:36:16,252 --> 01:36:27,919
[SPEAKER_12]: So that Indiana Jones game that was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game, I guess that can suck it because this is the most complete archaeology action and exploration game ever created.

1485
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:28,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Over 40 hours of play.

1486
01:36:29,219 --> 01:36:32,881
[SPEAKER_12]: No, for real, for like retro looking games, it looks awesome.

1487
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:37,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight because here, okay, I got to admit,

1488
01:36:38,755 --> 01:36:40,897
[SPEAKER_12]: The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs.

1489
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:43,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world.

1490
01:36:43,459 --> 01:36:47,402
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game blogs are saying, Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?

1491
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:49,644
[SPEAKER_12]: No shit.

1492
01:36:49,944 --> 01:36:54,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U is like saying the sun is going to rise in the morning.

1493
01:36:55,008 --> 01:36:56,289
[SPEAKER_12]: That bears shit in the woods.

1494
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,852
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you call a safe bet.

1495
01:36:59,672 --> 01:37:02,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And also what you call a headline that will get people to go, almost!

1496
01:37:03,655 --> 01:37:04,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god!

1497
01:37:04,076 --> 01:37:05,216
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Zelda game coming!

1498
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:06,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to reblog this everywhere!

1499
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So your site gets, you know, hits.

1500
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about the hits, folks.

1501
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:12,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though.

1502
01:37:13,502 --> 01:37:14,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would it be 2014?

1503
01:37:15,143 --> 01:37:15,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not next year?

1504
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:20,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they haven't announced one yet, and people think that, oh, they've already announced everything that they've got coming.

1505
01:37:21,067 --> 01:37:22,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going to be their big thing next year?

1506
01:37:22,608 --> 01:37:24,670
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got to have something big, big, big next year.

1507
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:27,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Next year... The Donkey Kong poop-throwing edition?

1508
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:28,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, unless it's a 3D Mario.

1509
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:30,775
[SPEAKER_12]: A Donkey Kong poop-throwing game?

1510
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:31,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

1511
01:37:31,696 --> 01:37:34,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Smash Brothers, they're thinking, remember?

1512
01:37:34,758 --> 01:37:35,179
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2013?

1513
01:37:35,879 --> 01:37:37,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Those Smash Brothers games always take forever.

1514
01:37:38,582 --> 01:37:38,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1515
01:37:39,397 --> 01:37:40,958
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1516
01:38:01,186 --> 01:38:02,747
[SPEAKER_12]: No news yet on Circle of Evermore?

1517
01:38:03,508 --> 01:38:03,808
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1518
01:38:05,069 --> 01:38:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Ace Attorney 5 will be coming out

1519
01:38:11,153 --> 01:38:11,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Emma?

1520
01:38:11,694 --> 01:38:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Emma?

1521
01:38:12,194 --> 01:38:12,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Emma?

1522
01:38:35,831 --> 01:38:41,494
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Rhythm Thief is supposed to be coming to the IOS this winter.

1523
01:38:42,694 --> 01:38:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one is just going to be one player and I think should have leaderboard options.

1524
01:38:50,998 --> 01:38:51,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

1525
01:38:53,959 --> 01:38:55,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, my mouth is full of quesadilla.

1526
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:58,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Rhythm Thief, I want to play that though.

1527
01:38:58,281 --> 01:38:59,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1528
01:38:59,262 --> 01:38:59,382
Okay.

1529
01:39:00,245 --> 01:39:01,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not stopping you.

1530
01:39:01,426 --> 01:39:02,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not stopping you.

1531
01:39:24,554 --> 01:39:27,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Facebook, Google, put them together, you get Fugle.

1532
01:39:28,556 --> 01:39:32,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And we ask a question every week and we read some of the answers.

1533
01:39:32,517 --> 01:39:35,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset that I don't read their answers.

1534
01:39:36,019 --> 01:39:39,080
[SPEAKER_12]: But like, if I read all the answers, it would be a five hour show.

1535
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,322
[SPEAKER_12]: So we pick some of the answers to read from Google Plus and Facebook about the question.

1536
01:39:44,822 --> 01:39:50,066
[SPEAKER_12]: The question ties into a story from Part A. There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through some changes.

1537
01:39:50,587 --> 01:39:55,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech some time ago, we want to ask you about video game television.

1538
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:59,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think a dedicated video game television station could work in today's world?

1539
01:40:00,535 --> 01:40:02,977
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do, what kind of shows would you want to see on it?

1540
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:05,279
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't think it would work, why not?

1541
01:40:06,474 --> 01:40:08,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment on Google Plus starts.

1542
01:40:08,895 --> 01:40:09,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1543
01:40:29,066 --> 01:40:29,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1544
01:40:29,847 --> 01:40:30,248
[SPEAKER_12]: But true.

1545
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:35,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually equivalent the Nielsen system with using BMI to track health.

1546
01:40:35,834 --> 01:40:38,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them are inherently flawed and useless.

1547
01:40:39,278 --> 01:40:43,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Technus replied on Google Plus and said, I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is long gone.

1548
01:40:44,344 --> 01:40:48,207
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns so much it was nuts.

1549
01:40:48,707 --> 01:40:53,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember getting the channel as a preview channel and they would air the same old episodes that I saw a few months ago.

1550
01:40:54,371 --> 01:41:01,957
[SPEAKER_12]: When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist pretty well with finally cutting out the excess of reruns and shows that nobody really watched from both networks.

1551
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:07,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV and then they flushed it down the drain and so forth.

1552
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:26,893
[SPEAKER_12]: he says at the end though it's all about video on demand and IPTV services these days and I think that's where a video game network can thrive so he thinks in the traditional sense it's done and Jim replies and says it would never work the channel wouldn't be able to be very critical of games or the industry in general because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars would have to come from

1553
01:41:28,334 --> 01:41:31,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting, because he thinks that the conflict, it would never work.

1554
01:41:32,556 --> 01:41:33,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's some truth in that.

1555
01:41:34,877 --> 01:41:36,258
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be pretty mean sometimes.

1556
01:41:37,338 --> 01:41:43,961
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, going over to Facebook and checking out some of the answers on Facebook, which there's a lot, and I'm never going to be able to get through some of these.

1557
01:41:45,921 --> 01:42:13,168
[SPEAKER_12]: another comment from DarkCharger about IPTV becoming the norm Nutman says I think a video game channel could work but TV executives need to step out of the way G4 like many other TV endeavors failed because guys in suits thought they knew better than the people they hired Scott Rubin and others behind G4 were met with opposition on everything and eventually just gave up entirely executives set it up for failure and then asked everybody why it failed so they need to get rid of the management

1558
01:42:14,468 --> 01:42:15,449
[SPEAKER_12]: RedTheHaze says, Nope.

1559
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Every now and then I remember Tech TV and G4.

1560
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:20,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss those channels, but then I remember we have the internet now.

1561
01:42:21,774 --> 01:42:23,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Ronnie says, Yes, it would work.

1562
01:42:23,615 --> 01:42:27,158
[SPEAKER_12]: There will always be the casual market that doesn't know as much as we do on the internet.

1563
01:42:27,498 --> 01:42:29,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4.

1564
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I imagine it would be extremely casual.

1565
01:42:32,722 --> 01:42:40,228
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerClaw says the problem with having a cable network dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal to a certain demographic, which is relatively small to a mass audience.

1566
01:42:40,528 --> 01:42:45,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Who needs a 24-hour cable network devoted to video games when you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online?

1567
01:42:47,869 --> 01:43:05,243
[SPEAKER_12]: um looking at some of the other answers Degenerate Johnny says honestly with the YouTube channels and internet shows being dedicated to video games I think that a cable network channel would not work for long so many of these e-shows and podcasts such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content to satisfy gamers of all ages

1568
01:43:05,723 --> 01:43:09,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Such features include up-to-date news, the latest reviews of games and DLC, etc.

1569
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:12,931
[SPEAKER_12]: These features are all that the average video gamer requires.

1570
01:43:12,951 --> 01:43:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV for something that could easily be accessed on the internet in an entertaining fashion.

1571
01:43:18,197 --> 01:43:19,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We killed G4.

1572
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:19,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Confirmed.

1573
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:21,801
[SPEAKER_12]: According to Degenerate Johnny.

1574
01:43:23,143 --> 01:43:23,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1575
01:43:24,304 --> 01:43:25,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike simply says, yes, it would work.

1576
01:43:26,346 --> 01:43:30,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how-to, achievement type shows.

1577
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:35,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Wicked says, I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market.

1578
01:43:35,453 --> 01:43:42,559
[SPEAKER_12]: With how diverse and expansive the internet is, gaming content that would be on a television network is numerous, but too far and wide for some.

1579
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,146
[SPEAKER_12]: A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses would concentrate a lot of good shows, topics, and games in one location for easy digestion.

1580
01:43:50,706 --> 01:43:52,948
[SPEAKER_12]: As for what should be on the network, that simple.

1581
01:43:53,308 --> 01:43:56,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at G4 Tech TV, both separate entities, and during the merger.

1582
01:43:56,971 --> 01:43:58,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And name some various shows there.

1583
01:43:59,112 --> 01:44:02,134
[SPEAKER_12]: It was easy to fill up the network with gaming, though a lot of it was tech.

1584
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:03,855
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, hey, they knew the demographic.

1585
01:44:04,276 --> 01:44:06,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, if done properly, it could thrive again.

1586
01:44:06,537 --> 01:44:07,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Just not as G4.

1587
01:44:07,718 --> 01:44:08,419
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I hope not.

1588
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:12,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, Picaruno says, Charlie Brooker's Game Swipe.

1589
01:44:12,982 --> 01:44:13,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Watch it now.

1590
01:44:14,883 --> 01:44:16,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are some of the answers, but...

1591
01:44:16,226 --> 01:44:18,848
[SPEAKER_12]: from our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1592
01:44:18,888 --> 01:44:21,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Check that out if you want to see the complete list of the answers.

1593
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:23,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to everybody and Google Plus as well.

1594
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:26,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio Plus and you'll find that.

1595
01:44:27,254 --> 01:44:28,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to everybody who answered.

1596
01:44:28,635 --> 01:44:29,875
[SPEAKER_12]: How about you folks here in studio?

1597
01:44:30,756 --> 01:44:32,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Would it work or is it done?

1598
01:44:32,437 --> 01:44:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

1599
01:44:33,298 --> 01:44:33,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1600
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:39,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, really, everyone said, it goes back to what the other people said, the internet's taken over.

1601
01:44:40,683 --> 01:44:47,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And besides that, I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game on their TV than watch a show on their TV.

1602
01:44:48,146 --> 01:44:49,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, me, I don't even watch TV.

1603
01:44:50,267 --> 01:44:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I download my shows on the internet.

1604
01:44:52,127 --> 01:44:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who and that's it.

1605
01:44:54,488 --> 01:45:00,591
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was a dedicated video game station, or station, a channel on TV, I still wouldn't watch it.

1606
01:45:01,442 --> 01:45:05,064
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember there used to be a show on G4 that just showed nothing but gameplay footage.

1607
01:45:05,985 --> 01:45:08,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, little five-minute clips of gameplay footage.

1608
01:45:08,426 --> 01:45:09,907
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a way to sample all the new games.

1609
01:45:10,027 --> 01:45:10,607
[SPEAKER_12]: It was interesting.

1610
01:45:10,707 --> 01:45:11,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the internet for that.

1611
01:45:12,829 --> 01:45:22,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's plenty of times when, like Dan said, I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game and look up a particular path in a game that I want to do.

1612
01:45:24,215 --> 01:45:27,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, he watches playthroughs of stuff all the time.

1613
01:45:28,618 --> 01:45:29,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really just...

1614
01:45:31,099 --> 01:45:34,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that it would have to be one or the other.

1615
01:45:34,523 --> 01:45:38,286
[SPEAKER_04]: If TV was the only way to get the information, then yeah, then it would work.

1616
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:39,648
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so many other outlets.

1617
01:45:40,048 --> 01:45:45,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a lot more convenient and you don't have to wait for programming times or wait for it to record.

1618
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there when you want it.

1619
01:45:48,657 --> 01:45:49,678
[SPEAKER_12]: The chatters jumped in.

1620
01:45:49,758 --> 01:45:51,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Cinematheque was the show I was thinking of.

1621
01:45:52,441 --> 01:45:52,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1622
01:45:54,057 --> 01:45:55,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, it's gonna be hard for them.

1623
01:45:56,219 --> 01:45:56,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know.

1624
01:45:56,799 --> 01:46:06,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the problem would be is that they would, it's too niche for them to have enough revenues, revenue dollars from ads and stuff to warrant keeping the station.

1625
01:46:06,566 --> 01:46:14,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just too, I mean, that's why you see like G4 going away where it's so generic now that, you know, it gets more viewers, I guess.

1626
01:46:15,073 --> 01:46:17,895
[SPEAKER_11]: People like watching cops and stuff at weird hours at night.

1627
01:46:18,015 --> 01:46:19,256
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1628
01:46:37,145 --> 01:46:42,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you see a lot of it with tying into the Xbox style content.

1629
01:46:42,509 --> 01:46:49,393
[SPEAKER_12]: You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that, even Comcast getting in on that, and a lot more of that on-demand style stuff, Hulu, Netflix.

1630
01:46:50,314 --> 01:47:03,343
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if a gaming company could kind of build itself around that primary and be a cable network secondary, they'd be in a much better place than, say, somebody coming around and just trying to copy G4.

1631
01:47:03,703 --> 01:47:06,024
[SPEAKER_12]: If a station can't evolve, it's going to be doomed.

1632
01:47:06,405 --> 01:47:06,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan?

1633
01:47:07,865 --> 01:47:09,986
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have been doable.

1634
01:47:10,346 --> 01:47:13,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know if it still could be doable because, again, the money's hard.

1635
01:47:13,107 --> 01:47:15,808
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is that they never played it straight.

1636
01:47:17,168 --> 01:47:23,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, even the biggest names, you know, when they had the video game shows, like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag.

1637
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,411
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just such a fucking retard.

1638
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:28,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'd watch and you'd just be like, I don't want to be associated with this guy.

1639
01:47:29,423 --> 01:47:57,345
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they had the girl who wasn't really good looking but she was good looking enough to be kind of eye candy and people were just like well they're not really talking to gamers they're kind of just doing their thing and I believe that they were gamers I believe that they cared about what they were doing I just never thought that they were good I don't think that they played up real I think that if there was a show I don't think there could be a network but I think there could be a show that did the trick

1640
01:47:58,281 --> 01:48:00,482
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if it played it real and not douchey.

1641
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:02,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I get what you're saying.

1642
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:07,792
[SPEAKER_12]: I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows really felt like they were catered to 12-year-old boys and it gets old, you know?

1643
01:48:08,172 --> 01:48:10,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, talk up to me, not down to me, you know?

1644
01:48:12,033 --> 01:48:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in the chat room... JDR Dollar Bill agreed with you.

1645
01:48:15,334 --> 01:48:16,514
[SPEAKER_12]: He says Sessler was a tool.

1646
01:48:16,534 --> 01:48:17,655
[SPEAKER_12]: But Fifth Dream does not.

1647
01:48:17,715 --> 01:48:18,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Sessler really is pretty awesome.

1648
01:48:19,115 --> 01:48:28,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Sessler was pretty awesome, but Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV because that's all they really needed is one show dedicated to video games and the rest was pretty awesome as its own.

1649
01:48:29,498 --> 01:48:32,860
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the network you need to copy if you're going to try to copy a network.

1650
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:33,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't copy G4.

1651
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Copy Tech TV because that was awesome.

1652
01:48:36,642 --> 01:48:41,204
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a network I think that could have actually made it given a little bit more advertising.

1653
01:48:41,984 --> 01:48:42,264
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1654
01:48:42,585 --> 01:48:43,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, go ahead.

1655
01:48:43,805 --> 01:48:44,205
[SPEAKER_11]: One last thought.

1656
01:48:44,225 --> 01:48:50,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't really understand why TV is still big when you've got the internet.

1657
01:48:50,088 --> 01:48:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean like what Dan watches like one show on TV now, MasterChef.

1658
01:48:56,011 --> 01:48:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: and the rest of it we use the internet.

1659
01:48:59,774 --> 01:49:00,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Hulu.

1660
01:49:00,454 --> 01:49:01,615
[SPEAKER_04]: We have everything else.

1661
01:49:01,775 --> 01:49:02,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, me too.

1662
01:49:02,396 --> 01:49:04,437
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really paying an insane amount for cable.

1663
01:49:04,637 --> 01:49:05,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Cable's gonna go.

1664
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:05,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1665
01:49:06,259 --> 01:49:06,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not worth it.

1666
01:49:06,819 --> 01:49:09,501
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well.

1667
01:49:11,302 --> 01:49:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dan likes MasterChef.

1668
01:49:13,357 --> 01:49:13,557
[SPEAKER_12]: GameStop

1669
01:49:29,958 --> 01:49:30,619
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1670
01:49:57,864 --> 01:50:12,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, they're used to selling DLC, so assuming that this is kind of like Steam or Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network or something like that, they would probably have codes that could be redeemed for apps and stuff on there.

1671
01:50:12,195 --> 01:50:22,222
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, I don't think you can go to GameStop and buy an app that's on the Android Marketplace or something like that or Google Play.

1672
01:50:22,262 --> 01:50:23,343
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't just go, hey...

1673
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:26,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, no one can hear you when you don't have a mic.

1674
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:30,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1675
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:37,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know if people would really... They're kind of pointless when it comes to buying stuff online.

1676
01:50:37,728 --> 01:50:43,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something that I can purchase online without having to drive down to the store?

1677
01:50:43,852 --> 01:50:45,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from I'm trading in something.

1678
01:50:46,874 --> 01:50:49,056
[SPEAKER_11]: But that only works if you're trading in a console game.

1679
01:50:49,076 --> 01:50:52,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Because right now there's no trading on digital games.

1680
01:50:52,638 --> 01:50:59,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So if really you're playing on a system, let's say you only own an Ouya, you're probably not going to be going down to them for anything.

1681
01:51:01,524 --> 01:51:10,067
[SPEAKER_11]: except for maybe hardware and accessories assuming you need another Ouya controller or something if you didn't want to buy it online.

1682
01:51:11,907 --> 01:51:24,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is all kind of about evolving to match what people want because if Ouya is going to be this big deal, GameStop wants a piece of it because GameStop is another one of those companies where its digital distribution becomes more and more.

1683
01:51:24,932 --> 01:51:25,953
[SPEAKER_12]: They're getting a little worried.

1684
01:51:26,773 --> 01:51:26,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1685
01:51:27,193 --> 01:51:32,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another thing, there was a game that was on Kickstarter, Mercenary Kings.

1686
01:51:33,097 --> 01:51:40,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they've surpassed their goal that they had, but now they're saying they're going to be putting it on the OUYA as well.

1687
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:47,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now, they're allowing anybody that's ordered a digital copy of the game, which is $15 pledged,

1688
01:51:49,848 --> 01:51:59,094
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll get a copy of the Steam key and you'll get a copy of the OUYA key, which they believe that there's going to be a key system for that, although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet.

1689
01:51:59,154 --> 01:52:03,717
[SPEAKER_11]: But in some way they'll try to get it so that you can play that.

1690
01:52:04,097 --> 01:52:10,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those who are not aware, Mercenary Kings is a game that's kind of a cross between Metal Slug and Minecraft, I guess.

1691
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:14,344
[SPEAKER_11]: You craft things based on the components that are dropped.

1692
01:52:15,004 --> 01:52:31,188
[SPEAKER_11]: by the enemies and it's also animated by Paul Robinson who does really kick-ass 8-bit, 16-bit animated GIFs and he also did the animation in the Scott Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade so it is worth checking out.

1693
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:32,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I backed it.

1694
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:34,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Paul Robinson.

1695
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:37,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like something to check out.

1696
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:45,139
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got an awesome animated GIF with a dog with an eye patch and a robotic dog shooting bullets and glowing dogs.

1697
01:52:45,739 --> 01:52:45,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1698
01:52:47,096 --> 01:52:47,316
[SPEAKER_12]: PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6

1699
01:53:08,656 --> 01:53:09,636
[SPEAKER_12]: is not worth your time.

1700
01:53:09,696 --> 01:53:12,857
[SPEAKER_12]: But you might have heard of things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

1701
01:53:12,897 --> 01:53:13,418
[SPEAKER_12]: DC Universe.

1702
01:53:13,918 --> 01:53:14,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Derp.

1703
01:53:14,718 --> 01:53:15,198
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a big one.

1704
01:53:15,218 --> 01:53:15,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1705
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:17,999
[SPEAKER_12]: These are all big games.

1706
01:53:19,699 --> 01:53:24,861
[SPEAKER_12]: SOE is looking into something where you, the player, can create in-game items.

1707
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:30,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And if Sony Online Entertainment adds them to the shop, you would get a kickback.

1708
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:32,339
[SPEAKER_12]: S.O.E.

1709
01:53:54,056 --> 01:54:03,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Now before you get too excited or wonder how SOE would not drown under these requests, keep in mind, to create these items, you're going to have to know how to do 3D modeling.

1710
01:54:03,901 --> 01:54:08,683
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you don't know Maya or 3DS Max, you may not exactly get to get on this.

1711
01:54:09,523 --> 01:54:11,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, you don't get to pick stats.

1712
01:54:11,644 --> 01:54:13,785
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something Sony gets to do.

1713
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:22,506
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do the design, you can do the item and the lore behind it, but ultimately it will be up to Sony Online Entertainment.

1714
01:54:22,947 --> 01:54:29,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Very interesting sort of prospect, but maybe they're thinking word of mouth to help these games succeed.

1715
01:54:29,968 --> 01:54:32,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Because let's say I have an item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of.

1716
01:54:33,949 --> 01:54:37,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm likely to start advertising for the game and tell all these people, hey, go buy my item.

1717
01:54:38,031 --> 01:54:38,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1718
01:54:38,731 --> 01:54:49,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And it kind of helps the game get more exposure and possibly generate more sales, which, you know, Sony gets a cut of, not unlike the iOS marketplace or what have you.

1719
01:54:49,595 --> 01:54:52,876
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's definitely a neat idea.

1720
01:54:54,286 --> 01:54:59,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I think people will probably use it if they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash.

1721
01:54:59,307 --> 01:54:59,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1722
01:55:00,788 --> 01:55:02,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

1723
01:55:04,068 --> 01:55:05,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Next story, DarkSakura.

1724
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I had a little debate in the chat room.

1725
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:08,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, anything you want to share?

1726
01:55:08,729 --> 01:55:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Progress.

1727
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:15,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Why I think radio is going to go away and why TV is going to go away.

1728
01:55:17,332 --> 01:55:18,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but not tomorrow.

1729
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:24,461
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I didn't say that at all, but I'm saying that, I mean, it may not even happen in our lifetime, but those formats aren't going to be around anymore.

1730
01:55:25,137 --> 01:55:27,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta admit, I really like radio, though.

1731
01:55:27,218 --> 01:55:31,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously, we're a podcast, so there's a radio element to it.

1732
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:36,425
[SPEAKER_12]: But traditional radio is in trouble because of things like us and satellite and so forth.

1733
01:55:36,605 --> 01:55:39,006
[SPEAKER_04]: How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?

1734
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:41,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.

1735
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:45,491
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the car, I find myself listening to a lot of radio.

1736
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:46,972
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do a lot of driving sometimes.

1737
01:55:47,492 --> 01:55:48,653
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think a lot of us do.

1738
01:55:48,693 --> 01:55:52,916
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically at work while they're doing something.

1739
01:55:52,936 --> 01:55:54,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I feel sorry for them.

1740
01:55:55,277 --> 01:55:55,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Some type of job.

1741
01:55:55,757 --> 01:55:56,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they have headphones.

1742
01:55:56,378 --> 01:55:57,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to Horde House at work.

1743
01:55:57,578 --> 01:55:59,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I've listened to BBC podcasts on history.

1744
01:55:59,519 --> 01:55:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1745
01:56:00,379 --> 01:56:04,541
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean... But, I mean... So, I think there is still a demand for the audio only.

1746
01:56:04,981 --> 01:56:06,782
[SPEAKER_12]: It just might be the traditional radio.

1747
01:56:06,902 --> 01:56:11,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier where traditional TV is in trouble.

1748
01:56:11,684 --> 01:56:13,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow.

1749
01:56:13,045 --> 01:56:13,085
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1750
01:56:14,125 --> 01:56:15,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But eventually it is going to go away.

1751
01:56:15,526 --> 01:56:23,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can guarantee you that the TV set that I owned when I was in high school wouldn't work now.

1752
01:56:23,513 --> 01:56:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have any HD input.

1753
01:56:26,055 --> 01:56:28,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost all the stations have gone to an HD format.

1754
01:56:28,677 --> 01:56:31,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore.

1755
01:56:31,759 --> 01:56:35,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got video game systems that we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it.

1756
01:56:35,542 --> 01:56:37,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that Odyssey that we have, we can't play it.

1757
01:56:37,364 --> 01:56:38,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have anything it'll work on.

1758
01:56:39,886 --> 01:56:43,589
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time you saw a videotape new?

1759
01:56:45,014 --> 01:56:45,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio Shack

1760
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:10,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Guru in our chat room says, unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna, radio and TV won't disappear.

1761
01:57:10,545 --> 01:57:11,606
[SPEAKER_12]: You kind of can.

1762
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:12,466
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting really close.

1763
01:57:12,887 --> 01:57:13,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, think of it this way.

1764
01:57:14,829 --> 01:57:17,771
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago, we got to the internet on dial-up.

1765
01:57:18,192 --> 01:57:19,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, 20 years ago would have been 92.

1766
01:57:20,094 --> 01:57:22,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would say maybe we were at the stage where like,

1767
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:41,080
[SPEAKER_12]: 28.8k dial up was kind of the big thing about then you know that was how we were connecting online and all that so we progressed that much from dial up modem 28.8k to where we're at now so think where we're going to be in 20 years I think that whole internet off an antenna

1768
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,341
[SPEAKER_12]: is right around the corner.

1769
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:43,541
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not already kind of there.

1770
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:54,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about this earlier because there was actually a Cracked article talking about technology then and now and saying that half of a level of Angry Birds would not fit on a Duck Hunt cartridge or something.

1771
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:56,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1772
01:57:58,181 --> 01:57:59,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan says way less than that.

1773
01:57:59,622 --> 01:58:00,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of progress.

1774
01:58:01,162 --> 01:58:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to change.

1775
01:58:02,883 --> 01:58:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now doesn't exist today.

1776
01:58:06,925 --> 01:58:09,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside.

1777
01:58:09,886 --> 01:58:24,373
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the reasons that they were making everybody go digital anyways, the whole switchover, is the analog frequencies and stuff that are out there that was for terrestrial broadcast and stuff, that's all up in the air now.

1778
01:58:24,413 --> 01:58:27,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So now they can use that for broadcasting internet.

1779
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,444
[SPEAKER_04]: and Stanlearn InDesign if you're going to do print media.

1780
01:58:30,585 --> 01:58:33,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit too... You're crazy!

1781
01:58:35,695 --> 01:58:37,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe this is a little too heavy for our show.

1782
01:58:39,554 --> 01:58:44,939
[SPEAKER_12]: But what if maybe there comes a time... What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet?

1783
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:46,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not even going into that territory.

1784
01:58:47,661 --> 01:58:51,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what if society rejected that technology?

1785
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:53,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I'm not saying everybody goes Amish.

1786
01:58:54,086 --> 01:58:54,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Betamax?

1787
01:58:55,067 --> 01:58:56,669
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are Amish people in the world.

1788
01:58:57,069 --> 01:58:57,609
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a phone.

1789
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:01,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace technology.

1790
01:59:01,373 --> 01:59:02,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a neighborhood computer.

1791
01:59:03,234 --> 01:59:10,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's kind of my point, is that what if society doesn't want to keep going that direction?

1792
01:59:10,257 --> 01:59:12,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Or do you think... Do you really think that's going to happen?

1793
01:59:12,538 --> 01:59:13,239
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not going to happen.

1794
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:17,441
[SPEAKER_12]: If war broke out over it, it might happen.

1795
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:18,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

1796
01:59:18,961 --> 01:59:19,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Not even then.

1797
01:59:20,422 --> 01:59:24,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if war broke out over it, then that means that they really want it.

1798
01:59:24,924 --> 01:59:26,825
[SPEAKER_04]: If war broke out over it, it'd be who controls it.

1799
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:28,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Too heavy for the show.

1800
01:59:28,922 --> 01:59:29,182
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1801
01:59:29,222 --> 01:59:32,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the people that wouldn't want it, they would just die eventually.

1802
01:59:32,523 --> 01:59:34,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like what Technus said about it not going away.

1803
01:59:34,965 --> 01:59:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It will evolve.

1804
01:59:36,045 --> 01:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more what I'm thinking of.

1805
01:59:37,526 --> 01:59:45,510
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, you're going to look, say, 15 years down the line when we've all got pocket broadband radios.

1806
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:49,352
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have wireless FM radios anymore.

1807
01:59:49,392 --> 01:59:50,552
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't use radio waves.

1808
01:59:50,592 --> 01:59:51,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using broadband signals.

1809
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:55,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, technically, a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora is a broadband radio.

1810
01:59:56,836 --> 01:59:57,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1811
01:59:58,336 --> 01:59:58,796
[SPEAKER_11]: in my pocket.

1812
01:59:59,837 --> 02:00:05,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, older forms of the same idea are going to fall by the wayside.

1813
02:00:05,618 --> 02:00:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what progress is.

1814
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:07,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just how it happens.

1815
02:00:07,339 --> 02:00:09,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who uses a Victrola?

1816
02:00:09,919 --> 02:00:10,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a Victrola, Rob?

1817
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:11,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what one is?

1818
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:13,600
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that old wind-up radio.

1819
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,961
[SPEAKER_12]: A hand-cranked phonograph.

1820
02:00:14,981 --> 02:00:16,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, not radio, the record player.

1821
02:00:16,881 --> 02:00:18,802
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time you used a mimeograph?

1822
02:00:21,277 --> 02:00:24,539
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1823
02:00:42,588 --> 02:01:07,295
[SPEAKER_04]: and they think they added it on August 28th and on its Japanese support site they just said we're sorry for the inconvenience the reception of delivery is being addressed now please wait for a while yeah nothing else they just said that we're looking into it don't worry I'll receive this about the same time we decide to release a patch for the Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill HD Collection never

1824
02:01:08,669 --> 02:01:09,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the next DDR game.

1825
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:12,091
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to hope everyone forgets about it.

1826
02:01:12,151 --> 02:01:12,691
[SPEAKER_11]: On consoles.

1827
02:01:14,572 --> 02:01:15,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, if it did have a lot of problems.

1828
02:01:15,993 --> 02:01:17,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at the end of the day, how was it selling?

1829
02:01:17,554 --> 02:01:20,475
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was selling decent enough, they'll find a reason to put it back on there.

1830
02:01:20,535 --> 02:01:24,137
[SPEAKER_04]: But if not... Okay, Stan, your friend may have a Victrola, but tell me.

1831
02:01:24,757 --> 02:01:27,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?

1832
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:29,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the retro kitsch of it, right?

1833
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a kitsch collector's thing.

1834
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:33,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course people like to collect retro stuff.

1835
02:01:33,182 --> 02:01:34,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to have a Victrola.

1836
02:01:34,743 --> 02:01:35,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1837
02:01:35,883 --> 02:01:36,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I still have albums.

1838
02:01:36,883 --> 02:01:38,124
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have anything to play it on.

1839
02:01:38,264 --> 02:01:48,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to have this rockin' bitchin' record player when I was like five years old that I could play Sesame Street records on and it would light up like these really awesome red and green colors in tone with the audio.

1840
02:01:49,066 --> 02:01:50,646
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to have that shit again.

1841
02:01:50,826 --> 02:01:51,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I had?

1842
02:01:51,627 --> 02:01:52,547
[SPEAKER_04]: An 8-track player.

1843
02:01:52,687 --> 02:01:53,027
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1844
02:01:53,067 --> 02:01:54,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if I ever have again.

1845
02:01:55,067 --> 02:01:55,748
[SPEAKER_04]: An 8-track player.

1846
02:01:58,149 --> 02:02:00,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded my favorite song from my Muppets 8-track.

1847
02:02:01,412 --> 02:02:02,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Lydia the Tattooed Lady.

1848
02:02:03,774 --> 02:02:04,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Just saying.

1849
02:02:04,894 --> 02:02:05,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the Rainbow Connection?

1850
02:02:06,316 --> 02:02:07,757
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was Lydia the Tattooed Lady.

1851
02:02:07,817 --> 02:02:11,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday we'll find it.

1852
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in 1979.

1853
02:02:13,902 --> 02:02:14,982
[SPEAKER_04]: When did the Muppet movie come out?

1854
02:02:15,363 --> 02:02:16,043
[SPEAKER_12]: The original one?

1855
02:02:16,424 --> 02:02:16,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1856
02:02:16,724 --> 02:02:17,184
[SPEAKER_12]: 79 or 80.

1857
02:02:19,366 --> 02:02:23,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a Muppet show best of 8-track.

1858
02:02:23,108 --> 02:02:28,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It was yellow and I remember how many times I had to fish the damn tape out of the 8-track player and fix it.

1859
02:02:30,951 --> 02:02:32,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, the Muppet movie was 1979.

1860
02:02:32,972 --> 02:02:35,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was right around the same time.

1861
02:02:35,793 --> 02:02:36,413
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1862
02:02:37,967 --> 02:02:40,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, see, I would have been one year old when this movie came out.

1863
02:02:40,788 --> 02:02:45,411
[SPEAKER_12]: But I remember when I was a kid, the big deal was Sesame Street, Follow That Bird.

1864
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:50,553
[SPEAKER_12]: And that scarring scene of the blue big bird in the cage.

1865
02:02:50,673 --> 02:02:51,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that was awful.

1866
02:02:51,674 --> 02:02:54,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God, just kill me as a child.

1867
02:02:54,955 --> 02:02:55,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Return to Oz.

1868
02:02:56,276 --> 02:02:57,316
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of fucked up movies.

1869
02:02:57,336 --> 02:02:58,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Return to Oz was great.

1870
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:00,518
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80s.

1871
02:03:00,558 --> 02:03:02,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was closer to the books anyway, but yeah.

1872
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:05,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, gaming news.

1873
02:03:05,242 --> 02:03:05,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Loki.

1874
02:03:05,963 --> 02:03:08,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, he did start off as a blue bird.

1875
02:03:10,069 --> 02:03:11,271
[SPEAKER_11]: It was still... An homage.

1876
02:03:11,371 --> 02:03:13,054
[SPEAKER_11]: He was sad and it was hard to see.

1877
02:03:15,967 --> 02:03:18,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about TV.

1878
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:23,833
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a series of games that were out on the PSP called Invisibles.

1879
02:03:23,933 --> 02:03:26,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now it's supposed to be coming out on the Vita.

1880
02:03:26,995 --> 02:03:33,259
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to get a new game, apparently, and it's going to be tied into a TV show or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out.

1881
02:03:33,519 --> 02:03:42,886
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have a section of the show that's augmented reality where basically you'll take your Vita, point it at the screen, and something fancy will happen, unlocking new content in your game.

1882
02:03:44,827 --> 02:03:45,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

1883
02:03:46,508 --> 02:03:51,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm guessing that it's probably going to be some sort of AR code or QR code or something like that.

1884
02:03:54,793 --> 02:04:04,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship that interacted with the thing on TV and all it was doing, it was kind of like a light gun type technology.

1885
02:04:04,259 --> 02:04:08,382
[SPEAKER_12]: It just could see what was on the screen and light does its little things accordingly.

1886
02:04:08,982 --> 02:04:11,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, and you think you're interacting with the movie, but you're really not.

1887
02:04:12,967 --> 02:04:13,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Action Max Action Max

1888
02:04:25,524 --> 02:04:26,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1889
02:04:45,774 --> 02:04:47,797
[SPEAKER_03]: My cat used to sit on top of my Nintendo.

1890
02:04:47,837 --> 02:04:48,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you tried the iPad game?

1891
02:04:48,759 --> 02:04:49,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was warm.

1892
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:52,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't because I'm freaked out about the scratching thing.

1893
02:04:53,005 --> 02:04:54,086
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't scratch a screen.

1894
02:04:54,928 --> 02:04:56,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody says that, but I don't believe it.

1895
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:57,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Cut their claws.

1896
02:04:57,952 --> 02:04:58,052
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1897
02:04:58,193 --> 02:04:58,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1898
02:04:58,693 --> 02:04:59,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I cut Shermie's.

1899
02:04:59,254 --> 02:05:00,836
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's like cutting their little claws.

1900
02:05:01,637 --> 02:05:02,177
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

1901
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:23,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways, because, you know.

1902
02:05:23,912 --> 02:05:28,616
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, yeah, so if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just cut their claws.

1903
02:05:29,077 --> 02:05:31,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch glass.

1904
02:05:31,879 --> 02:05:40,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my cat used to paw at the TV, like my LCD TV all the time, and if that thing's not scratched up already by them, then it's no big deal.

1905
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:42,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I like what Infinel says in the chatroom.

1906
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Put little gloves on their paws.

1907
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:45,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Kitten mittens!

1908
02:05:46,332 --> 02:05:48,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your cat being too loud?

1909
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:52,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get the little cat claw cappers that look like nail polish.

1910
02:05:53,636 --> 02:05:54,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are awful.

1911
02:05:56,158 --> 02:05:57,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, not my cats, not my decision to make.

1912
02:05:57,999 --> 02:06:00,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her.

1913
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:04,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday.

1914
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:05,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1915
02:06:06,203 --> 02:06:09,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but it's cool.

1916
02:06:11,621 --> 02:06:13,302
[SPEAKER_12]: My Struggles With Cats goes back to my weekend.

1917
02:06:13,322 --> 02:06:15,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's the freaking... Play it, play it, play it.

1918
02:06:15,763 --> 02:06:17,104
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's not the actual commercial.

1919
02:06:17,144 --> 02:06:19,185
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the promo for the episode.

1920
02:06:19,645 --> 02:06:20,906
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's this one.

1921
02:06:23,267 --> 02:06:24,228
[SPEAKER_12]: My Struggles... No.

1922
02:06:25,228 --> 02:06:25,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that one.

1923
02:06:26,309 --> 02:06:27,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob keeps clicking the same link.

1924
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Great radio.

1925
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:29,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Great radio.

1926
02:06:30,051 --> 02:06:31,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it, I saw it.

1927
02:06:34,478 --> 02:06:36,419
[SPEAKER_08]: and Cat Enthusiast.

1928
02:06:36,879 --> 02:06:40,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your cat making too much noise all the time?

1929
02:06:41,043 --> 02:06:45,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your cat constantly stomping around, driving you crazy?

1930
02:06:49,549 --> 02:06:52,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your cat clawing at your furnitures?

1931
02:06:53,812 --> 02:06:55,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Think there's no answer?

1932
02:06:55,193 --> 02:06:56,795
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so stupid.

1933
02:06:57,195 --> 02:06:57,895
[SPEAKER_08]: There is.

1934
02:06:58,416 --> 02:06:59,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitten Mittens.

1935
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:05,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, there's an elegant, comfortable mitten for cats!

1936
02:07:11,318 --> 02:07:12,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't hear anything.

1937
02:07:13,139 --> 02:07:14,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your cat one-legged?

1938
02:07:14,861 --> 02:07:17,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your cat fat, skinny, or an in-between?

1939
02:07:17,622 --> 02:07:20,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't matter, because one size fits all.

1940
02:07:20,264 --> 02:07:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitten Mittens.

1941
02:07:21,525 --> 02:07:22,626
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be smitten.

1942
02:07:22,886 --> 02:07:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So come on down to Patty's Pub.

1943
02:07:25,288 --> 02:07:28,670
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the home of the original Kitten Mittens.

1944
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:31,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Meow.

1945
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:33,725
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell was that?

1946
02:07:33,985 --> 02:07:34,825
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

1947
02:07:34,965 --> 02:07:41,407
[SPEAKER_12]: An amazing fucking television show, which is why you should watch your TV once in a while because that show is fucking hilarious.

1948
02:07:41,427 --> 02:07:42,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And order a dick towel.

1949
02:07:43,967 --> 02:07:44,988
[SPEAKER_11]: The official dick towel.

1950
02:07:46,248 --> 02:07:46,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1951
02:07:47,788 --> 02:07:49,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Shermie would just shit.

1952
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:49,849
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all she'd do.

1953
02:07:52,089 --> 02:07:55,250
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite is when the cat's walking across the table.

1954
02:07:56,210 --> 02:08:00,231
[SPEAKER_12]: I surely PETA called in on that because I was borderline inhumane.

1955
02:08:00,271 --> 02:08:00,511
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1956
02:08:02,153 --> 02:08:02,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Serious Face.

1957
02:08:03,876 --> 02:08:04,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to gaming news.

1958
02:08:05,895 --> 02:08:06,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, it's my turn, hey.

1959
02:08:08,056 --> 02:08:09,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy!

1960
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:11,278
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no transition.

1961
02:08:12,339 --> 02:08:23,387
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if you have a lot of money and you've bought a lot of kitten mittens, maybe have some more disposable income, say $450, you could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation.

1962
02:08:23,447 --> 02:08:24,408
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out in Japan.

1963
02:08:25,068 --> 02:08:32,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Every game in the series up through Final Fantasy 13 in the Ultimate Compilation.

1964
02:08:32,233 --> 02:08:32,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have 11?

1965
02:08:32,734 --> 02:08:33,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1966
02:08:33,374 --> 02:08:33,955
[SPEAKER_12]: It even has 11.

1967
02:08:34,075 --> 02:08:34,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it have 14?

1968
02:08:35,076 --> 02:08:36,197
[SPEAKER_12]: The Vanadil Collection.

1969
02:08:36,297 --> 02:08:36,938
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it does not.

1970
02:08:36,998 --> 02:08:37,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it have Mystic Quest?

1971
02:08:37,958 --> 02:08:39,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Because 14 didn't happen.

1972
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have all of the four items?

1973
02:08:40,801 --> 02:08:42,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you shut up and let me talk about it?

1974
02:08:43,824 --> 02:08:45,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the numbered ones.

1975
02:08:45,305 --> 02:08:47,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it have Dirge of Cerberus?

1976
02:08:47,528 --> 02:08:51,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I know how you felt when Dan kept interrupting you during the Classic Game of the Week.

1977
02:08:51,251 --> 02:08:51,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Rob.

1978
02:08:51,932 --> 02:08:52,052
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1979
02:08:52,092 --> 02:08:52,272
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1980
02:08:52,292 --> 02:08:52,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't.

1981
02:08:57,085 --> 02:09:00,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy 1-13, no 10-2s, no 13-2s PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2

1982
02:09:06,297 --> 02:09:10,939
[SPEAKER_12]: The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3, because they're not going to bother to port it somewhere new, sorry.

1983
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,601
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6.

1984
02:09:15,021 --> 02:09:16,482
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9.

1985
02:09:17,723 --> 02:09:25,066
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation 2 version of 10, as well as 11, and 12, and PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3.

1986
02:09:25,346 --> 02:09:28,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?

1987
02:09:28,848 --> 02:09:29,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1988
02:09:32,571 --> 02:09:33,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a second here.

1989
02:09:34,312 --> 02:09:37,935
[SPEAKER_11]: But the problem is, though, you're going to need to have an old-style PlayStation 2 for that to work.

1990
02:09:37,975 --> 02:09:39,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see a hard drive attached there, too.

1991
02:09:39,636 --> 02:09:42,959
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it is kind of a little bit like, won't work, but whatever.

1992
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:45,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Why couldn't they just put a PC version?

1993
02:09:45,081 --> 02:09:49,004
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have an old-ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility, I believe there's a way to do it.

1994
02:09:49,324 --> 02:09:49,845
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be us.

1995
02:09:49,905 --> 02:09:51,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they patched it in at one point.

1996
02:09:51,847 --> 02:09:53,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, 35,000 yen.

1997
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:55,271
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about $450.

1998
02:09:56,012 --> 02:10:03,901
[SPEAKER_12]: There will also be a commemorative DVD, an art collection, and a two-disc soundtrack because there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan.

1999
02:10:04,842 --> 02:10:05,583
[SPEAKER_12]: There just haven't.

2000
02:10:06,144 --> 02:10:06,945
[SPEAKER_12]: There needs to be another.

2001
02:10:09,758 --> 02:10:11,460
[SPEAKER_12]: There it is, Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection.

2002
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Something I probably won't be buying.

2003
02:10:14,343 --> 02:10:16,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because I have all the ones I want already.

2004
02:10:17,507 --> 02:10:20,991
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have $450, but if I had $450, I'd like pay to go to DragonCon.

2005
02:10:21,031 --> 02:10:25,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI at this point?

2006
02:10:25,376 --> 02:10:27,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on, seriously.

2007
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:27,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the Xbox 360 version.

2008
02:10:29,617 --> 02:10:33,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, if you're going to buy a console version right now, the 360 version is probably the way to go.

2009
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:35,079
[SPEAKER_12]: But PC is pretty good.

2010
02:10:35,239 --> 02:10:35,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyhow.

2011
02:10:36,539 --> 02:10:36,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag.

2012
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:38,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, we haven't even done the mailbag yet.

2013
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:40,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 8.30, we haven't even done the mailbag.

2014
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:45,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails every week.

2015
02:10:46,622 --> 02:10:47,422
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the mailbag music.

2016
02:10:49,783 --> 02:10:51,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2017
02:10:51,823 --> 02:10:53,984
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura dives in, picks your favorites, reads them now.

2018
02:10:55,109 --> 02:10:58,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This comes from Sam.

2019
02:10:59,831 --> 02:11:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Sam.

2020
02:11:00,811 --> 02:11:01,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR crew.

2021
02:11:01,792 --> 02:11:02,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably love the show.

2022
02:11:03,292 --> 02:11:04,693
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a message sent.

2023
02:11:08,595 --> 02:11:10,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I might love the show.

2024
02:11:11,036 --> 02:11:17,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Do any of you think the Wii U will become the lead platform for development since it will be released before the next PlayStation and Xbox?

2025
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:18,239
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2026
02:11:18,919 --> 02:11:19,079
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

2027
02:11:19,099 --> 02:11:19,919
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not at all.

2028
02:11:19,939 --> 02:11:20,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at what's happening now.

2029
02:11:22,172 --> 02:11:47,861
[SPEAKER_11]: let's look to the Dreamcast possibly on a couple games maybe if there's going to be some stuff that's coming out during that time I can see them having slightly better looking games but maybe I don't know if they're going to necessarily be developing for Wii U first and then porting over it's hard to say it depends on when the next platforms are coming out I mean everyone assumes that's going to be the end of next year but it could be in a couple years in which case yeah you may have a few games that are like that

2030
02:11:48,209 --> 02:11:54,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I am dying to see if there is going to be a game that is Wii U and PS3, PS Vita.

2031
02:11:55,213 --> 02:11:56,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it could happen.

2032
02:11:57,194 --> 02:11:58,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm dying to see if that happens.

2033
02:12:00,476 --> 02:12:01,336
[SPEAKER_12]: A third party could do it.

2034
02:12:02,237 --> 02:12:04,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Xbox 360 and tablet.

2035
02:12:05,238 --> 02:12:08,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, that whole thingy thing they said at E3.

2036
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:09,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, smart glass.

2037
02:12:09,501 --> 02:12:10,701
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't heard anything on in a while.

2038
02:12:11,462 --> 02:12:11,862
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

2039
02:12:11,882 --> 02:12:13,123
[SPEAKER_04]: They should call it smart ass.

2040
02:12:14,483 --> 02:12:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, next email.

2041
02:12:15,864 --> 02:12:16,384
[SPEAKER_04]: This comes from...

2042
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:24,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing Rock Band Blitz the night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade and up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz.

2043
02:12:25,171 --> 02:12:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking that would be a great name to play with someone but there's no multiplayer.

2044
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:31,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I just remembered the game I forgot to review.

2045
02:12:33,781 --> 02:12:53,222
[SPEAKER_04]: then I saw then I saw score war mode and I thought surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list nope it just matches you up with any random guy 64 so no friends list competition either it's just the leaderboards like many games before it the game is meant for a social gaming crowd but it isolates you from your friends fantastic

2046
02:12:54,258 --> 02:13:21,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Robbo found this because after he sent the email because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app that's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz is there's a lot of enhanced things that are through Facebook which is good and it's bad and I'll leave it at that I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week and I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week I have played an awful lot of it the short answer it's good

2047
02:13:22,751 --> 02:13:25,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Bless them at Harmonix.

2048
02:13:26,454 --> 02:13:27,835
[SPEAKER_12]: They're standing by their guns.

2049
02:13:28,255 --> 02:13:30,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think there's some mistakes they made.

2050
02:13:32,578 --> 02:13:32,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Some?

2051
02:13:33,839 --> 02:13:35,780
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, to be fair, they make a lot of great games.

2052
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do like Rock Band Blitz.

2053
02:13:37,802 --> 02:13:40,884
[SPEAKER_12]: But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do.

2054
02:13:40,964 --> 02:13:42,865
[SPEAKER_12]: But bless them for trying and sticking to it.

2055
02:13:43,766 --> 02:13:44,487
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'll say for now.

2056
02:13:45,147 --> 02:13:45,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2057
02:13:46,248 --> 02:13:48,710
[SPEAKER_04]: This last email is from Nasty Canesta.

2058
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:50,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2059
02:13:52,102 --> 02:13:52,543
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2060
02:14:08,562 --> 02:14:09,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Bobby Grumpwolf.

2061
02:14:10,063 --> 02:14:12,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mr. Blackwolf, here is my response.

2062
02:14:12,985 --> 02:14:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I left in the email a Steam code for Depths of Peril, an action RPG with some strategy elements and random level generation.

2063
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it to the OLR crew to come up with a way to give this code away to a lucky listener.

2064
02:14:26,034 --> 02:14:30,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, have fun dealing with the brony fandom once again at the next DragonCon, Mr. Blackwolf.

2065
02:14:31,698 --> 02:14:38,262
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, if DarkSakuraSky or Loki is interested, I have one copy of Hybrid RTS FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on Steam.

2066
02:14:40,944 --> 02:14:46,869
[SPEAKER_04]: After you three fight to the death, Dance Battle, or whatever it is you three do to decide on things, please add me on Steam to get the game.

2067
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:48,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for not having a code.

2068
02:14:48,590 --> 02:14:55,075
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nuclear Dawn developers decided on gifting the option for those who have purchased the game as part of a promotion.

2069
02:14:55,636 --> 02:14:57,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise to keep things discreet and platonic.

2070
02:14:57,777 --> 02:14:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: No homo, maybe.

2071
02:14:59,864 --> 02:15:00,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe a little.

2072
02:15:00,865 --> 02:15:01,145
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2073
02:15:02,266 --> 02:15:03,466
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll make this very simple.

2074
02:15:03,667 --> 02:15:05,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2075
02:15:06,028 --> 02:15:06,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell us you want the code.

2076
02:15:07,009 --> 02:15:07,649
[SPEAKER_12]: What's it for again?

2077
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:09,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, by the way, for the code.

2078
02:15:09,811 --> 02:15:12,412
[SPEAKER_12]: For Depths of Peril.

2079
02:15:12,693 --> 02:15:13,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Depths of Peril.

2080
02:15:13,333 --> 02:15:16,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we'll give it away to one lucky listener.

2081
02:15:16,315 --> 02:15:16,675
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

2082
02:15:17,076 --> 02:15:18,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2083
02:15:20,238 --> 02:15:22,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just for not the live listeners.

2084
02:15:22,499 --> 02:15:23,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That was for podcast listeners.

2085
02:15:24,826 --> 02:15:51,668
[SPEAKER_12]: well you're not going to know if they're one or the other so it really ends up being for everybody okay how about this you can't email we won't take the emails until after the podcast airs oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely Black Wolf says and there are furries and bronies all over Dragon Con Tara Strong was a guest I barely saw them meaning they were all up on Tara lastly for Loki did you know there's an official sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D

2086
02:15:53,413 --> 02:15:56,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the problem is I don't really care too much about Chips Challenge.

2087
02:15:56,055 --> 02:15:59,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I cared about it back in the 90s, but now it's just like, eh, don't care.

2088
02:16:01,139 --> 02:16:06,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you said there was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded in April, and it's on Steam Greenlight.

2089
02:16:07,323 --> 02:16:07,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

2090
02:16:07,883 --> 02:16:08,484
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, yeah.

2091
02:16:08,504 --> 02:16:11,005
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what one I wish I did get in on?

2092
02:16:11,046 --> 02:16:12,026
[SPEAKER_11]: It was GunCraft.

2093
02:16:12,066 --> 02:16:14,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft, but with guns and stuff.

2094
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:16,129
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have been pretty cool.

2095
02:16:16,269 --> 02:16:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That does sound kind of neat.

2096
02:16:19,411 --> 02:16:19,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2097
02:16:19,792 --> 02:16:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for emails?

2098
02:16:20,953 --> 02:16:21,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

2099
02:16:21,213 --> 02:16:21,533
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2100
02:16:22,165 --> 02:16:25,874
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get to Twitter in a minute, so your last chance to get the tweets in, twitter.com.

2101
02:16:26,476 --> 02:16:30,506
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, it's time to get a little bit angsty in a segment we call FU.

2102
02:16:48,463 --> 02:17:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: um fuck this bad headache I've had for the last two days I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting and I want my whatever it is in my butt that's hurting and no it's not like that it's one of the muscles around my left hip has been really killing me I would like for it to stop done um I feel for no one being on when I'm on Minecraft all the time like I'm on a lot and there's no one there

2103
02:17:19,737 --> 02:17:21,958
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the first week you've been able to mention it on the podcast.

2104
02:17:21,978 --> 02:17:22,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's true, yeah.

2105
02:17:22,778 --> 02:17:23,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, literally, I started it.

2106
02:17:24,518 --> 02:17:29,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And a few myself for accidentally kicking Bobby off the server a few times back.

2107
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:30,700
[SPEAKER_11]: You did it on purpose.

2108
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just getting... Revenge is yours.

2109
02:17:33,481 --> 02:17:35,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured out how to... Take that, Bobby Grumple.

2110
02:17:36,162 --> 02:17:38,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I just figured out how to finally do things on the server.

2111
02:17:39,023 --> 02:17:42,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've never run a Minecraft server before, so it's a little tricky.

2112
02:17:43,364 --> 02:17:44,364
[SPEAKER_11]: But now I figured it out.

2113
02:17:44,804 --> 02:17:46,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Ignorance is no excuse, Rah.

2114
02:17:48,163 --> 02:17:50,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And just for that, Enderman will be spawning in my house later tonight.

2115
02:17:51,947 --> 02:17:52,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I can make a lot of them.

2116
02:17:53,028 --> 02:17:54,650
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I don't want that.

2117
02:17:54,810 --> 02:17:56,432
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually really easy to kill.

2118
02:17:56,632 --> 02:17:57,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're afraid of water.

2119
02:17:57,694 --> 02:17:57,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2120
02:17:58,054 --> 02:17:58,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Look.

2121
02:17:58,975 --> 02:18:00,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so it's like signs.

2122
02:18:00,897 --> 02:18:01,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2123
02:18:01,618 --> 02:18:02,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Water damages them.

2124
02:18:04,421 --> 02:18:04,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2125
02:18:05,823 --> 02:18:06,263
[SPEAKER_12]: My FU.

2126
02:18:06,363 --> 02:18:10,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I also give an FU to Headaches because I've been getting some killer ones lately and it's no fun.

2127
02:18:11,068 --> 02:18:16,732
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to kind of like stress, because I've taken on a lot of projects, and it's going to keep me very busy over the next month.

2128
02:18:16,792 --> 02:18:21,475
[SPEAKER_12]: It's already keeping me busy, and I'm starting to feel the pressures of a lot of that stress.

2129
02:18:22,315 --> 02:18:32,102
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have done it if I didn't want to, but kind of just F you to the fact that I haven't been hanging out enough with people I don't see enough, basically.

2130
02:18:32,662 --> 02:18:37,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So because I'm taking a lot on, it's a good thing, because it's allowing me to hang out with people I haven't seen enough.

2131
02:18:37,285 --> 02:18:39,267
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to their not being 48 hours in a day, basically.

2132
02:18:39,287 --> 02:18:41,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And FU to needing sleep, although sleep feels so good.

2133
02:18:41,429 --> 02:18:42,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Dan, do you have any FUs you wanna give?

2134
02:18:42,971 --> 02:18:43,751
[SPEAKER_12]: He's busy playing Game Boy Advance.

2135
02:19:00,066 --> 02:19:03,129
[SPEAKER_12]: He's lying out on the floor like a kid playing the Advance.

2136
02:19:03,449 --> 02:19:04,189
[SPEAKER_12]: It is kind of funny.

2137
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:05,130
[SPEAKER_12]: You gotta admit that.

2138
02:19:05,751 --> 02:19:06,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2139
02:19:06,151 --> 02:19:07,192
[SPEAKER_12]: My husband is adorable.

2140
02:19:08,522 --> 02:19:10,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't go that far, but all right.

2141
02:19:10,142 --> 02:19:15,064
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2142
02:19:15,104 --> 02:19:15,904
[SPEAKER_12]: But first, Loki.

2143
02:19:16,564 --> 02:19:21,965
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a little bit more information coming out now about the whole Stardock lawsuit.

2144
02:19:22,726 --> 02:19:35,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we talked about it a couple weeks ago where Stardock was accusing one of their employees who recently left the company of ruining a game because they claimed that she deleted stuff for it, and because of that,

2145
02:19:36,269 --> 02:19:36,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2146
02:20:02,344 --> 02:20:11,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the whole, you know, leaving the company thing, seeking, I guess, was it $25,000 in damage or something?

2147
02:20:14,347 --> 02:20:16,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, unspecified damages in excess of $25,000.

2148
02:20:17,107 --> 02:20:28,470
[SPEAKER_11]: And she, you know, had filed complaints with the EEOC and, you know, claiming basically that the, you know...

2149
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:49,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Head of the company had done a lot of lewd things including, you know, linking to a sexually explicit YouTube video, making comments like, you know, oh, you're not chosen to go to some place because you're not, just because you're hot or, you know, asking her to take a purity test question thing that had, you know, sexual taboo questions and stuff on there.

2150
02:20:49,534 --> 02:20:50,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff that's no one else's business then?

2151
02:20:50,595 --> 02:20:52,395
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, have you engaged in group sex?

2152
02:20:53,075 --> 02:20:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to know that, you know, because I think I've, you know...

2153
02:20:56,916 --> 02:20:57,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2154
02:20:57,317 --> 02:20:57,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2155
02:21:19,246 --> 02:21:39,958
[SPEAKER_11]: But like any court case or anything, there's people on both sides and her people or whatever made all those comments that she, of course, sent him a message basically saying, okay, I don't want you to touch me or any parts of my body, not even jokingly.

2156
02:21:39,998 --> 02:21:44,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want you to make comments about my boyfriend or future husband or anything like that.

2157
02:21:44,820 --> 02:21:47,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want you to make sexually charged jokes.

2158
02:21:47,742 --> 02:22:04,115
[SPEAKER_12]: which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent let's remind ourselves that email should not have had to have been sent praise this girl for having the amazing self-restraint to be professional at this point about it

2159
02:22:04,955 --> 02:22:19,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite whatever other allegations are out there, fucking A. But apparently, he responded though to this email saying, you know, I don't recall item one, but I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful.

2160
02:22:19,999 --> 02:22:22,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand number two, but I'll be more conscious.

2161
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:28,285
[SPEAKER_11]: 3.

2162
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:28,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I am an inappropriate, sexist, vulgar, and embarrassing person.

2163
02:22:28,906 --> 02:22:30,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not inclined to change my behavior.

2164
02:22:30,488 --> 02:22:32,670
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is a problem for you, you need to find another job.

2165
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:32,670
4.

2166
02:22:33,230 --> 02:22:37,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not willing to adapt my behavior to suit others.

2167
02:22:37,474 --> 02:22:42,058
[SPEAKER_11]: If you find my behavior problematic, I recommend finding another job.

2168
02:22:42,419 --> 02:22:44,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not some manager or co-worker of yours.

2169
02:22:44,421 --> 02:22:45,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I own the company.

2170
02:22:46,062 --> 02:22:49,705
[SPEAKER_11]: It and your job here exists to suit my purpose, not vice versa.

2171
02:22:50,605 --> 02:23:00,893
[SPEAKER_11]: The company is not an end unto itself and is a means to an end on which to further the objective of its shareholders, in this case, me.

2172
02:23:02,554 --> 02:23:03,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but there's still laws.

2173
02:23:03,755 --> 02:23:07,498
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at, that's a law.

2174
02:23:08,038 --> 02:23:09,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get around that.

2175
02:23:09,299 --> 02:23:11,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're a disgusting shithole like...

2176
02:23:13,823 --> 02:23:23,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I take it a little, you know, I mean, a man has no excuse to ever act that way to another, to a woman or any human being.

2177
02:23:23,407 --> 02:23:26,428
[SPEAKER_12]: A person has no right to act that way towards another person.

2178
02:23:26,468 --> 02:23:27,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Person, at all.

2179
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:34,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, he responded, you know, the whole thing, basically, to this website, Quarter of Three.

2180
02:23:35,792 --> 02:23:35,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2181
02:23:37,353 --> 02:23:40,538
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, saying, okay, I'm going to go ahead and respond to this.

2182
02:23:40,558 --> 02:23:41,800
[SPEAKER_11]: The incident happened back in 2010.

2183
02:23:42,521 --> 02:23:52,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself, Alexandria, and a few others were at a pub going to the QT3 dinner that Lloyd Case had set up.

2184
02:23:54,017 --> 02:23:57,300
[SPEAKER_11]: and while there, Alexandra got teased and got mad at the time.

2185
02:23:57,340 --> 02:24:00,703
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize she was so upset about it and blah, blah, blah.

2186
02:24:02,125 --> 02:24:04,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, she emailed me about the incident and stuff like that.

2187
02:24:04,347 --> 02:24:08,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, he plays it off saying, oh, this stuff didn't happen or wasn't as bad.

2188
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:09,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Smoke and mirrors.

2189
02:24:09,631 --> 02:24:10,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Smoke and mirrors.

2190
02:24:10,772 --> 02:24:25,514
[SPEAKER_11]: and basically saying this is retaliatory and or the charge that you know basically the whole thing was insinuating that the retaliatory or the alleged retaliatory lawsuit of her ruining their game was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place.

2191
02:24:27,179 --> 02:24:29,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's all going to come out.

2192
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:38,662
[SPEAKER_12]: They're accusing her of deleting all this stuff or whatever, but it doesn't like it's one of those things where like, you know, the old saying, if the shoe fits, wear it or if the shoe, whatever.

2193
02:24:39,602 --> 02:24:46,764
[SPEAKER_12]: My point is her incredible professionalism in that email and lack of restraint.

2194
02:24:47,504 --> 02:24:50,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, praise her for for being able to show that kind of restraint.

2195
02:24:51,505 --> 02:24:55,186
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't match that of somebody who would go in and delete everything.

2196
02:24:55,326 --> 02:24:55,786
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

2197
02:24:56,206 --> 02:24:58,286
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like you got this over here and then this over here.

2198
02:24:58,306 --> 02:24:59,387
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't line up.

2199
02:24:59,867 --> 02:25:00,947
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

2200
02:25:01,107 --> 02:25:01,647
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we know?

2201
02:25:01,807 --> 02:25:04,108
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case.

2202
02:25:04,268 --> 02:25:09,769
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm being a total couch jury right now, which is probably bad, but just throwing it out there.

2203
02:25:10,429 --> 02:25:18,831
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's the environment this person created at this company where it's like you deal with it because it's my company or what have you, how do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?

2204
02:25:20,819 --> 02:25:22,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe somebody else chose not to take the high road.

2205
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:23,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Just throwing it out there.

2206
02:25:24,461 --> 02:25:31,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the thing, too, is they're talking about how she knew where the files were and had access to relevant Google Docs.

2207
02:25:31,745 --> 02:25:33,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you using Google Docs?

2208
02:25:33,646 --> 02:25:35,967
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of businesses use Google Docs.

2209
02:25:36,147 --> 02:25:38,108
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard of that before.

2210
02:25:38,528 --> 02:25:41,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school, too.

2211
02:25:41,410 --> 02:25:45,752
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like you'd have your own intranet or something that you'd do that on.

2212
02:25:46,472 --> 02:26:09,337
[SPEAKER_12]: uh anyhow uh the moral of the story is um people need to like like not do this to other people and i'm talking the whole harassment thing in the first place like and and that kind of bugs me that in the response it's very smoke and mirrors like well there was teasing and da da da but that doesn't give anybody the right to delete whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

2213
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:16,641
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no excuse for what happened here.

2214
02:26:17,002 --> 02:26:19,382
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't even apologize for it.

2215
02:26:19,402 --> 02:26:27,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you can argue that I was a jerk in how I responded to her, but it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and quitting without notice and using her network access to wipe out our marketing access.

2216
02:26:28,106 --> 02:26:31,427
[SPEAKER_11]: How dare this person... Oh my god, it's so infuriating.

2217
02:26:31,467 --> 02:26:33,248
[SPEAKER_12]: How dare you try to blame her?

2218
02:26:33,868 --> 02:26:34,528
[SPEAKER_12]: How dare you?

2219
02:26:34,628 --> 02:26:34,909
[SPEAKER_12]: That is...

2220
02:26:36,489 --> 02:26:37,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to see somebody do it to him

2221
02:27:03,342 --> 02:27:06,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Fucking psychotic behavior

2222
02:27:08,905 --> 02:27:10,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't even know how to

2223
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:38,632
[SPEAKER_12]: had too many competing sub-series.

2224
02:27:39,252 --> 02:27:41,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Quote, Thanks for the suggestion.

2225
02:27:41,553 --> 02:27:51,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I, and probably I alone, so please don't ascribe said belief to Capcom, think one of the problems Mega Man has had as a brand is that we've had too many competing Splinter sub-brands within it.

2226
02:27:52,197 --> 02:28:00,341
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure starting yet another is the way to get the franchise as a whole back on track, more than creating greater brand confusion, but will take it under advisement.

2227
02:28:01,081 --> 02:28:05,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a bunch of shit right there because the different series that they have were on different platforms.

2228
02:28:06,043 --> 02:28:07,364
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have the other Mega Man games.

2229
02:28:07,684 --> 02:28:13,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy Advance, then you're playing Mega Man Power or something or other.

2230
02:28:13,367 --> 02:28:13,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what it was.

2231
02:28:14,407 --> 02:28:21,751
[SPEAKER_11]: But it wasn't like, oh, hey, we're going to have Mega Man this and Mega Man that, and they're going to compete against each other.

2232
02:28:21,771 --> 02:28:23,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they really had that.

2233
02:28:23,132 --> 02:28:23,512
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just...

2234
02:28:24,272 --> 02:28:25,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?

2235
02:28:48,581 --> 02:28:51,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, they kind of let him go where he walked.

2236
02:28:51,103 --> 02:28:52,945
[SPEAKER_12]: That never stops people in the industry.

2237
02:28:52,965 --> 02:28:55,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying, if he was, I mean, he was a big wig.

2238
02:28:56,148 --> 02:29:02,593
[SPEAKER_07]: If he was the one driving Mega Man development, and he's like, okay, I'm out, and everyone else is just like, uh, what the fuck do we do?

2239
02:29:03,574 --> 02:29:04,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just go ahead and put that one away.

2240
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:18,143
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think this points towards there's going to be some big reboot, because that's always the fucking answer to every problem, reboot of the Mega Man franchise in the future.

2241
02:29:18,163 --> 02:29:25,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you anything there's going to be a new Mega Man game that's just Mega Man, and it's a reboot, and there's some new creative person at the helm.

2242
02:29:26,245 --> 02:29:28,105
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not Grin making it.

2243
02:29:28,825 --> 02:29:56,170
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah it's not it lends itself perfectly to some type of reboot whether that be on the next consoles or you know maybe a 3DS game probably or a Vita game I think there will be a Mega Man reboot just Mega Man speculation rampant whatever fanboy wank call it what you want I just kind of think that's where all the signs point towards especially with that type of rebuttal there's too many franchises so they're going to bring it back to one we'll see

2244
02:29:57,679 --> 02:29:58,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet it's a reboot.

2245
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:02,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, let's go to the Skype line.

2246
02:30:02,740 --> 02:30:05,361
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2247
02:30:05,381 --> 02:30:06,802
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had a heck of a show so far tonight.

2248
02:30:06,882 --> 02:30:08,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what you guys want to talk about.

2249
02:30:08,762 --> 02:30:10,082
[SPEAKER_12]: The Skype line is open.

2250
02:30:10,122 --> 02:30:14,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2251
02:30:14,884 --> 02:30:19,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to get to the tweets here in a moment, but first let me ask Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2252
02:30:19,185 --> 02:30:21,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Or DarkSakura, of course, if you have anything you want to throw out as well.

2253
02:30:21,606 --> 02:30:23,006
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm still in the middle of being disgusted.

2254
02:30:23,322 --> 02:30:29,867
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some stupid stories, you've probably heard all these before, where, you know, some teenager drives cross-country to meet her boyfriend.

2255
02:30:30,768 --> 02:30:39,716
[SPEAKER_11]: So, this girl, Beth Robinson, who was 13, met somebody on Xbox Live who was 12, actually 12, not necessarily a 40-year-old pretending to be 12.

2256
02:30:40,516 --> 02:30:50,663
[SPEAKER_11]: and he lived in Houston and she lives in Kentucky and I guess she ended up chatting with him and then eventually stole her brother's car, her mother's ATM card and then drove to his house.

2257
02:30:51,443 --> 02:30:55,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess she got as far as Nashville, Tennessee before being stopped by police.

2258
02:30:59,048 --> 02:31:07,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, we must blame Xbox Live for this, not because her parents are retarded or she's stupid for

2259
02:31:09,319 --> 02:31:32,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a belated FU to everyone taking a crap on Mass Effect Paragon Lost I'm sorry it looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it so shut up I'll reserve judgment until the first ep's out but I'm not gonna hate on it just cause it's Vega Vega was pretty cool he's like the bro of the ship shall I do some tweets?

2260
02:31:33,336 --> 02:31:34,757
[SPEAKER_04]: he's totally getting on with Cortez

2261
02:31:35,186 --> 02:31:38,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2262
02:31:39,209 --> 02:31:44,572
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya tweets this and says, How might one acquire episode 169 from the Encore last week?

2263
02:31:44,933 --> 02:31:46,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought y'all would be recording it.

2264
02:31:47,174 --> 02:31:52,638
[SPEAKER_12]: But since you asked nicely, DarkTetsuya, talk to me offline and we'll talk.

2265
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:23,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, another tweet from Salacious Pop I know who that is Who tweets something I forgot to mention earlier on the show But it is definitely important, it's going on Rest in peace, City of Heroes That's right, Paragon Studios is closing Taking City of Heroes with it, it will be shut down by the end of the year And they got blindsided, they did not know it was coming Because one day there's a post about Oh, here's all the cool stuff coming at the end of the year And then the next day it's like, bye

2266
02:32:24,341 --> 02:32:28,403
[SPEAKER_12]: No firm date yet sent for the closure, but that's kind of a bummer.

2267
02:32:29,124 --> 02:32:31,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Alan played a lot of City of Heroes.

2268
02:32:31,365 --> 02:32:32,146
[SPEAKER_12]: He was into that game.

2269
02:32:33,006 --> 02:32:37,169
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not really get into it, but I saw it, and it looked good.

2270
02:32:39,070 --> 02:32:41,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess maybe because I didn't play it is part of the reason it's closing.

2271
02:32:41,972 --> 02:32:42,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2272
02:32:43,493 --> 02:32:44,514
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of people like me.

2273
02:32:45,595 --> 02:32:46,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones.

2274
02:32:46,315 --> 02:32:47,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2275
02:32:47,276 --> 02:32:47,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2276
02:32:48,437 --> 02:32:49,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Legend of Zaku here.

2277
02:32:49,757 --> 02:32:50,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Zaku.

2278
02:32:50,598 --> 02:32:51,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Long time no talk.

2279
02:32:51,319 --> 02:32:51,799
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, buddy?

2280
02:32:52,783 --> 02:32:55,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just chilling on this sleepy Sunday.

2281
02:32:56,245 --> 02:32:57,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what's on your mind?

2282
02:32:57,986 --> 02:33:00,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Just finishing off a little bit of Skyrim.

2283
02:33:01,048 --> 02:33:03,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Not finishing the game, but just finish playing.

2284
02:33:03,269 --> 02:33:04,890
[SPEAKER_12]: You can never finish Skyrim.

2285
02:33:06,511 --> 02:33:08,031
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the story of my life.

2286
02:33:08,172 --> 02:33:10,613
[SPEAKER_12]: One does not simply take an arrow to the knee.

2287
02:33:11,468 --> 02:33:12,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that whole thing.

2288
02:33:13,810 --> 02:33:28,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking right now through Kotaku for a particular PAX incident that happened recently in one of the Minecraft party where basically this, apparently this pervert

2289
02:33:29,338 --> 02:33:37,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Exposed himself, and more importantly, actually took the hand of a female and actually placed it on his junk.

2290
02:33:38,042 --> 02:33:39,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard this.

2291
02:33:39,062 --> 02:33:45,025
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a big deal for the past couple of days that I was catching up on.

2292
02:33:45,345 --> 02:33:45,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on, hold on.

2293
02:33:46,386 --> 02:33:47,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't hear what he said.

2294
02:33:47,106 --> 02:33:47,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

2295
02:33:47,726 --> 02:33:53,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to say, before I let him finish the story, if that last thing made you mad, this will set you on fire.

2296
02:33:53,529 --> 02:33:56,290
[SPEAKER_12]: This is so fucked up, this story.

2297
02:33:56,410 --> 02:33:57,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Zaku.

2298
02:33:57,690 --> 02:33:58,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead and tell us.

2299
02:33:58,651 --> 02:33:59,691
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it.

2300
02:33:59,711 --> 02:34:00,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the link.

2301
02:34:00,332 --> 02:34:00,932
[SPEAKER_12]: This is bad.

2302
02:34:01,792 --> 02:34:02,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2303
02:34:03,093 --> 02:34:03,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.

2304
02:34:04,313 --> 02:34:07,915
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Mojang, obviously, for Minecraft.

2305
02:34:08,255 --> 02:34:09,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And this vlogger...

2306
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:15,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry, long story short.

2307
02:34:15,668 --> 02:34:21,513
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in the VIP section when a guy right there, she was just minding her own business.

2308
02:34:22,333 --> 02:34:26,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, a guy started off showing her pictures of...

2309
02:34:28,638 --> 02:34:32,581
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of chicks, of girls they actually took, you know, of their breasts.

2310
02:34:32,841 --> 02:34:37,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, he actually, this guy actually took pictures of women's breasts throughout the party.

2311
02:34:37,664 --> 02:34:52,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, at first it was a bit creepy, but then it got, then he really ratcheted up when he basically exposed his penis and he grabbed her hand and placed it in his, right there, in his crotch.

2312
02:34:52,930 --> 02:34:53,912
[SPEAKER_00]: The Penis Exposed

2313
02:35:05,509 --> 02:35:27,256
[SPEAKER_12]: The police, your security Okay, I'm going to stop you there I'm going to stop you there Because there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here If you go to the source and read the original story Because this is the part that infuriated me She went to the security at the club And she told her friends about what was going on Because you can read this at the source She talked to the security guards And the security guards, the answer was basically like Well, what are we supposed to do about it?

2314
02:35:27,636 --> 02:35:30,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Throw the fucker in jail That's what you're supposed to do

2315
02:35:33,838 --> 02:35:40,360
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem is, at the end of the day, this really doesn't have anything to do with video games or what have you.

2316
02:35:41,261 --> 02:35:43,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name.

2317
02:35:43,342 --> 02:35:47,183
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives male gamers like myself a bad rep.

2318
02:35:48,243 --> 02:35:50,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a girlfriend of mine.

2319
02:35:51,064 --> 02:35:52,685
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an awesome gamer.

2320
02:35:52,985 --> 02:35:54,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as hardcore as I am.

2321
02:35:55,526 --> 02:35:57,107
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that

2322
02:35:57,907 --> 02:35:58,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

2323
02:36:18,566 --> 02:36:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and this is just what I have to say this because I'm thinking back to my, before I hurt my ankle, I used to take a couple different styles of martial arts.

2324
02:36:29,690 --> 02:36:32,531
[SPEAKER_04]: First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself, you punch him in the dick.

2325
02:36:33,571 --> 02:36:36,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

2326
02:36:36,774 --> 02:36:39,316
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be assault.

2327
02:36:41,197 --> 02:36:43,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't condone that.

2328
02:36:43,379 --> 02:36:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's somebody putting you in a situation, because technically he grabbed her, that could be assault.

2329
02:36:49,503 --> 02:36:51,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us all agree.

2330
02:36:52,186 --> 02:36:53,266
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grab somebody...

2331
02:36:54,227 --> 02:37:01,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Without, I mean, batteries, like, if you, like, hurt them and they don't, you know, if you touch them without necessarily hurting them, that is battery.

2332
02:37:01,372 --> 02:37:02,093
[SPEAKER_03]: He touched her first.

2333
02:37:02,693 --> 02:37:02,914
[SPEAKER_00]: This?

2334
02:37:02,954 --> 02:37:06,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's sexual battery if it... Here's the deal.

2335
02:37:06,236 --> 02:37:11,820
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are going into this crazy what if, whatever, because obviously in the moment... But part of the problem is that the police couldn't do anything.

2336
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:18,325
[SPEAKER_00]: In the moment, she didn't know... If the security guards called the cops, then it would be her word against his.

2337
02:37:18,805 --> 02:37:21,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to sort out that mess, unless they have witnesses...

2338
02:37:22,588 --> 02:37:31,016
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way they can convict him, or at least put him in cuffs.

2339
02:37:32,137 --> 02:37:38,163
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were actual witnesses that can attest to her story, then she could easily press charges.

2340
02:37:38,243 --> 02:37:39,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, a cop would just leave.

2341
02:37:42,270 --> 02:37:43,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to believe him over her.

2342
02:37:44,452 --> 02:37:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You're basically saying that they're all sexist and they're going to take his word immediately.

2343
02:37:48,256 --> 02:37:52,840
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, she said, which is... Even when he's got photos of people from the post.

2344
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:53,601
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

2345
02:37:53,721 --> 02:37:56,463
[SPEAKER_12]: He's got photos on his phone.

2346
02:37:56,584 --> 02:38:00,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't tell me there's not going to be cameras at the club that could see what's going on.

2347
02:38:00,427 --> 02:38:00,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2348
02:38:01,028 --> 02:38:03,910
[SPEAKER_00]: But the incident, it's at the heart of the matter where...

2349
02:38:05,011 --> 02:38:07,832
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically grabbed her hand into his crotch.

2350
02:38:08,512 --> 02:38:13,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have someone actually seeing that, then you can't, then the cops can't really do anything.

2351
02:38:13,294 --> 02:38:15,014
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is other evidence.

2352
02:38:15,074 --> 02:38:18,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Phone for stuff that is just like circumstantial at best.

2353
02:38:19,156 --> 02:38:20,896
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't mean you ignore it.

2354
02:38:21,056 --> 02:38:21,717
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to.

2355
02:38:21,737 --> 02:38:22,417
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.

2356
02:38:22,637 --> 02:38:24,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It was totally wrong what the security guard did.

2357
02:38:24,958 --> 02:38:26,298
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not going to convince me otherwise.

2358
02:38:26,318 --> 02:38:29,779
[SPEAKER_04]: If he did it to her, that's likely not the first time he's done this.

2359
02:38:29,859 --> 02:38:31,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably in the same night.

2360
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:31,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge problem.

2361
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:36,542
[SPEAKER_04]: They would separate everybody and question all the witnesses.

2362
02:38:37,042 --> 02:38:39,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal.

2363
02:38:40,783 --> 02:38:44,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about security guards, I'm saying if police were called in.

2364
02:38:45,004 --> 02:38:45,785
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legal procedure.

2365
02:38:45,805 --> 02:38:47,985
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you're saying it would be, it's acceptable.

2366
02:38:48,285 --> 02:38:49,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are you defending them?

2367
02:38:54,506 --> 02:38:55,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to defend them.

2368
02:38:55,466 --> 02:38:59,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that given the circumstances that it's really hard.

2369
02:38:59,368 --> 02:39:00,868
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a no-win scenario.

2370
02:39:00,928 --> 02:39:09,510
[SPEAKER_00]: You either call the police and see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds to arrest him on that particular charge.

2371
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:16,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you do nothing and you basically get chided for inaction.

2372
02:39:16,512 --> 02:39:19,573
[SPEAKER_00]: It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.

2373
02:39:19,853 --> 02:39:20,653
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2374
02:39:35,851 --> 02:39:36,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.

2375
02:39:37,152 --> 02:39:37,553
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.

2376
02:39:37,633 --> 02:39:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but there was not that much he could have done.

2377
02:39:41,596 --> 02:39:42,597
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have called the cops.

2378
02:39:42,737 --> 02:39:46,220
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's the victim's responsibility if she wants to get the police to call the police.

2379
02:39:46,621 --> 02:39:48,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The security guard is there to maintain the security in the club.

2380
02:39:48,963 --> 02:39:50,684
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not there to enforce the law.

2381
02:39:50,724 --> 02:39:51,345
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.

2382
02:39:51,365 --> 02:39:53,407
[SPEAKER_07]: He's private.

2383
02:39:53,587 --> 02:39:56,550
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer.

2384
02:39:57,170 --> 02:40:00,533
[SPEAKER_00]: He can only ask them to leave, and if he assaults,

2385
02:40:02,865 --> 02:40:07,446
[SPEAKER_00]: If the patron in question assaults the security guard, then yeah, he has a right to defend himself.

2386
02:40:07,967 --> 02:40:11,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, he can't really physically detain them.

2387
02:40:11,848 --> 02:40:20,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only ask them to leave, and only after that point, if they resist, and they start being aggressive, then the guard has like...

2388
02:40:21,365 --> 02:40:22,806
[SPEAKER_00]: has the right to defend himself.

2389
02:40:23,226 --> 02:40:25,068
[SPEAKER_00]: The security guard is not a cop.

2390
02:40:25,248 --> 02:40:27,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls.

2391
02:40:27,029 --> 02:40:31,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for calling in and sharing this unfortunate story with us.

2392
02:40:32,033 --> 02:40:32,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

2393
02:40:36,296 --> 02:40:38,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I just... I don't know.

2394
02:40:39,158 --> 02:40:40,719
[SPEAKER_12]: What does it say about our culture?

2395
02:40:40,779 --> 02:40:42,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

2396
02:40:46,002 --> 02:40:54,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think, I mean, there's so many people that I just, how much of the, can we all agree, how much of this fault is hers?

2397
02:40:54,791 --> 02:40:55,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Zero.

2398
02:40:55,972 --> 02:40:56,193
[SPEAKER_12]: None.

2399
02:40:56,393 --> 02:40:57,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Zero.

2400
02:40:58,535 --> 02:41:01,919
[SPEAKER_12]: People, you don't, the behavior has to be addressed.

2401
02:41:01,939 --> 02:41:02,759
[SPEAKER_12]: The guy's a sociopath.

2402
02:41:03,881 --> 02:41:04,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I just,

2403
02:41:06,762 --> 02:41:09,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that went back and said in the chat room.

2404
02:41:09,265 --> 02:41:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, we have this environment here where they're telling women, oh, well, don't dress provocatively.

2405
02:41:14,872 --> 02:41:15,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get raped.

2406
02:41:15,873 --> 02:41:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself.

2407
02:41:19,618 --> 02:41:20,259
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get raped.

2408
02:41:20,559 --> 02:41:22,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be don't get raped.

2409
02:41:22,501 --> 02:41:23,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be don't rape.

2410
02:41:23,923 --> 02:41:24,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't assault.

2411
02:41:27,176 --> 02:41:36,219
[SPEAKER_12]: To Zaku's credit, and in the interest of fairness, I get where he's going kind of down this line of, you know, well, in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and da-da-da-da-da.

2412
02:41:37,379 --> 02:41:40,980
[SPEAKER_12]: But all I'm saying is that an investigation needed to be done.

2413
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,681
[SPEAKER_12]: An investigation needed to be done.

2414
02:41:42,761 --> 02:41:50,483
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do think it's on the onus of the club and, you know, the people that knew about it to make sure that investigation takes place.

2415
02:41:50,643 --> 02:41:54,004
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet.

2416
02:41:54,654 --> 02:41:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: The job of the security guard is to protect the interest of the club.

2417
02:41:57,997 --> 02:42:02,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Protecting the interest of the club also includes protecting the safety of those who are there.

2418
02:42:02,661 --> 02:42:03,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you're right.

2419
02:42:03,622 --> 02:42:04,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And protecting the interest of the club.

2420
02:42:04,723 --> 02:42:10,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if I were a game company or whatever, if I was Mojang, I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club for any future event after this story.

2421
02:42:10,828 --> 02:42:11,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Or nor would anybody.

2422
02:42:11,729 --> 02:42:17,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I was the owner of the club, I would have basically ended my contract with that security firm and gotten one with a better reputation.

2423
02:42:17,594 --> 02:42:19,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

2424
02:42:22,463 --> 02:42:23,863
[SPEAKER_04]: The victim does need to contact the authorities.

2425
02:42:23,883 --> 02:42:24,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Dan just said.

2426
02:42:26,744 --> 02:42:31,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the internet has made her feel like she can do that.

2427
02:42:31,986 --> 02:42:33,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what else to say.

2428
02:42:33,426 --> 02:42:41,429
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I think men need to understand is that we still live in an environment where women are basically still treated as second class citizens.

2429
02:42:42,189 --> 02:42:45,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's saying that's bullshit, but it happens.

2430
02:42:45,590 --> 02:42:46,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happened to me.

2431
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:49,111
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get it because you're a guy.

2432
02:42:52,503 --> 02:42:59,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And just because you see it in the pornos where a woman catches sight of a penis and all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis, that doesn't happen in reality.

2433
02:42:59,908 --> 02:43:01,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, don't see it.

2434
02:43:01,569 --> 02:43:08,654
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class and you allow yourself to be treated second class... It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not.

2435
02:43:08,854 --> 02:43:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: You believe that it's happening.

2436
02:43:10,755 --> 02:43:12,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you feel like it's happening.

2437
02:43:12,617 --> 02:43:14,898
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's exactly the problem.

2438
02:43:14,978 --> 02:43:16,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's cut this shit off.

2439
02:43:16,179 --> 02:43:17,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about this later.

2440
02:43:19,326 --> 02:43:21,708
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that last story we just talked about then?

2441
02:43:22,309 --> 02:43:22,889
[SPEAKER_12]: It's happening.

2442
02:43:23,389 --> 02:43:25,091
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that last story in the game industry?

2443
02:43:25,711 --> 02:43:26,012
[SPEAKER_12]: It could.

2444
02:43:26,612 --> 02:43:28,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not even saying woman, man.

2445
02:43:28,694 --> 02:43:29,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm saying person, person.

2446
02:43:30,596 --> 02:43:32,777
[SPEAKER_12]: A person has... I said that in the last story too.

2447
02:43:32,957 --> 02:43:34,559
[SPEAKER_11]: What if it was a guy?

2448
02:43:34,579 --> 02:43:36,801
[SPEAKER_11]: A guy whips it out from another guy.

2449
02:43:36,921 --> 02:43:37,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Same story.

2450
02:43:38,642 --> 02:43:40,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say the exact same thing.

2451
02:43:40,764 --> 02:43:42,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a woman doing it to another woman.

2452
02:43:42,205 --> 02:43:43,046
[SPEAKER_12]: It's inappropriate.

2453
02:43:47,352 --> 02:43:48,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.

2454
02:43:48,553 --> 02:43:49,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely still inappropriate.

2455
02:43:53,854 --> 02:43:57,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because somebody doesn't tell doesn't mean there wasn't a crime.

2456
02:44:03,237 --> 02:44:04,117
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can hear what you're saying.

2457
02:44:05,017 --> 02:44:05,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

2458
02:44:07,678 --> 02:44:08,478
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the point.

2459
02:44:08,618 --> 02:44:10,559
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is she needs to stand up for herself.

2460
02:44:12,503 --> 02:44:14,143
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the citrus is going to get fixed.

2461
02:44:14,223 --> 02:44:16,624
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the slime ball is going to get his fucking comeuppance.

2462
02:44:17,004 --> 02:44:21,585
[SPEAKER_07]: If he victimizes somebody and that victim steps up and fucking puts him down.

2463
02:44:21,785 --> 02:44:24,946
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a degree of having to choose not to be a victim.

2464
02:44:25,326 --> 02:44:29,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I don't understand why anyone would choose to keep a victim's mentality.

2465
02:44:31,167 --> 02:44:32,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's a choice.

2466
02:44:32,447 --> 02:44:36,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to be able to go ahead and say, look, this happened to me.

2467
02:44:36,788 --> 02:44:38,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I accepted this happened to me.

2468
02:44:38,648 --> 02:44:41,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the action I'm going to take to rectify that.

2469
02:44:45,898 --> 02:44:48,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And also pointing and laughing at his penis would have been funny too.

2470
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:50,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would have probably got him to leave pretty quick.

2471
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:54,563
[SPEAKER_12]: He'd be like, tiny penis, tiny penis.

2472
02:44:54,643 --> 02:44:57,805
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, hindsight is 20, hindsight is 20-20.

2473
02:44:58,345 --> 02:45:01,747
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're the, hindsight is 20-20.

2474
02:45:02,127 --> 02:45:05,049
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's easy to sit here and say, I would have done this.

2475
02:45:05,909 --> 02:45:06,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone should have done this.

2476
02:45:07,371 --> 02:45:09,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's easy to sit here and do that.

2477
02:45:09,574 --> 02:45:13,138
[SPEAKER_12]: But when it's happening to you in that moment, you don't have that luxury.

2478
02:45:13,339 --> 02:45:17,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And that doesn't make what she did wrong by any means.

2479
02:45:18,265 --> 02:45:23,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need to have a society that still protects people from having this happen to them.

2480
02:45:23,795 --> 02:45:26,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, let's move on.

2481
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:28,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have a gaming story?

2482
02:45:28,641 --> 02:45:33,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me go to Twitter because the tweets were sent in a long time ago so we might have some gaming tweets.

2483
02:45:33,386 --> 02:45:37,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully.

2484
02:45:38,893 --> 02:45:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

2485
02:45:39,634 --> 02:45:40,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on.

2486
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:43,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Ossifer on Twitter with Mass Effect content.

2487
02:45:43,862 --> 02:45:47,123
[SPEAKER_12]: That's always a good thing to help bring us back to OLR.

2488
02:45:48,244 --> 02:45:50,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Ossifer says, just started Final Fantasy 13 too.

2489
02:45:51,666 --> 02:45:53,367
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, Final Fantasy 13 too.

2490
02:45:53,407 --> 02:45:57,089
[SPEAKER_12]: And I freaked out a little when I saw DLC for N7 armor for the main characters.

2491
02:45:58,430 --> 02:45:59,030
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

2492
02:45:59,070 --> 02:46:02,891
[SPEAKER_12]: There was some really awesome DLC in Final Fantasy XIII too that incorporated the games.

2493
02:46:03,171 --> 02:46:05,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?

2494
02:46:05,852 --> 02:46:06,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

2495
02:46:08,152 --> 02:46:08,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

2496
02:46:08,793 --> 02:46:09,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Other tweets.

2497
02:46:09,873 --> 02:46:10,933
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple from Tigerclaw.

2498
02:46:11,193 --> 02:46:19,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Bethesda currently has no plans for Wii U. According to an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

2499
02:46:20,215 --> 02:46:26,397
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not loading for me right now, but I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week that basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline for Wii U.

2500
02:46:27,057 --> 02:46:37,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that necessarily means... I don't think they really have anything in the pipeline beyond... I don't know, they just released... Surely there's something, we just don't know about it.

2501
02:46:37,205 --> 02:46:39,046
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's something being done, but nothing that they've announced.

2502
02:46:39,066 --> 02:46:45,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced that have yet to come out.

2503
02:46:45,250 --> 02:46:49,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they have Dishonored coming out, but that's pretty much it.

2504
02:46:49,513 --> 02:46:54,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess if you count ZeniMax releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition...

2505
02:46:54,698 --> 02:47:02,478
[SPEAKER_11]: but aside from stuff beyond 2012 there really isn't anything that's been announced yet so yeah I guess that's a true statement

2506
02:47:04,099 --> 02:47:06,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, another tweet from TigerClaw about Double Fine.

2507
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:10,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test.

2508
02:47:10,442 --> 02:47:16,385
[SPEAKER_12]: He links us to a clip on Gamasutra about... This is not the big Kickstarter thing.

2509
02:47:16,725 --> 02:47:20,347
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a free-to-play superhero management game called Middle Manager of Justice.

2510
02:47:21,667 --> 02:47:22,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you have to admit that's kind of funny.

2511
02:47:23,688 --> 02:47:27,410
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine, obviously, because it's on iOS.

2512
02:47:28,270 --> 02:47:28,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the thing.

2513
02:47:28,811 --> 02:47:31,132
[SPEAKER_12]: The game was not supposed to be out for several weeks...

2514
02:47:31,752 --> 02:47:33,313
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2515
02:47:55,610 --> 02:48:06,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we submitted the game, we realized we had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix, but at the same time, we didn't want to remove it from the submission process in case Apple catches other things we need to take care of, and we didn't want to do a double submission.

2516
02:48:08,923 --> 02:48:13,547
[SPEAKER_12]: At least they're trying to make lemonade out of lemons on getting the stuff released early.

2517
02:48:14,608 --> 02:48:15,568
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it for Twitter tonight.

2518
02:48:15,688 --> 02:48:16,769
[SPEAKER_12]: One last call for calls.

2519
02:48:16,789 --> 02:48:20,089
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2520
02:48:20,729 --> 02:48:23,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I can't fault people for not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion.

2521
02:48:25,871 --> 02:48:28,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, there's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight.

2522
02:48:29,131 --> 02:48:31,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a great place.

2523
02:48:31,992 --> 02:48:33,872
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2524
02:48:33,912 --> 02:48:38,634
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio and those of you in the chat room and so forth.

2525
02:48:38,674 --> 02:48:40,474
[SPEAKER_12]: We want everybody to be able to have their say.

2526
02:48:40,894 --> 02:48:44,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to get your two cents in.

2527
02:48:44,897 --> 02:48:49,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, there's always Facebook and Twitter as well, Google Plus and what have you.

2528
02:48:50,501 --> 02:48:51,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Skype line ain't lighting up.

2529
02:48:52,362 --> 02:48:53,864
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that means I'm going to go ahead and close it.

2530
02:48:54,404 --> 02:48:55,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll try again next week.

2531
02:48:56,425 --> 02:48:58,127
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight.

2532
02:48:58,627 --> 02:49:00,688
[SPEAKER_12]: We did all last-minute stories or do we have any more, Loki?

2533
02:49:01,549 --> 02:49:02,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really anything.

2534
02:49:02,410 --> 02:49:02,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

2535
02:49:04,795 --> 02:49:05,655
[SPEAKER_11]: This week will be interesting.

2536
02:49:05,896 --> 02:49:16,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this coming week is going to be very interesting between the iPhone 5 and the... A possible iPad mini or... I don't know if we'll see that, but before the holidays.

2537
02:49:16,700 --> 02:49:19,201
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think of the new Kindles that they have coming out?

2538
02:49:19,361 --> 02:49:20,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of those look interesting?

2539
02:49:20,302 --> 02:49:22,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really read up on them enough because we already have a Kindle.

2540
02:49:22,963 --> 02:49:24,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really in the market for a new one.

2541
02:49:24,183 --> 02:49:29,806
[SPEAKER_11]: The only one that sounded interesting was... I'm not in the market for a tablet at all, but I like how they're doing their data plan.

2542
02:49:30,426 --> 02:49:36,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Kindle Fire HD, the one that has a 9-inch screen or whatever.

2543
02:49:37,188 --> 02:49:46,852
[SPEAKER_11]: But the 4G one has a $50 a year data plan, 250 megabytes a month data you get with that.

2544
02:49:47,512 --> 02:49:48,593
[SPEAKER_11]: for $50 a year.

2545
02:49:48,693 --> 02:49:49,453
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not bad.

2546
02:49:49,593 --> 02:50:04,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you're not using a ton of data, unless you're streaming... For me, I normally wouldn't use that much data, but I do stream Pandora, so I've used up like 600, 700 megabytes this month, but that's like the most I've ever used.

2547
02:50:04,583 --> 02:50:07,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2548
02:50:07,264 --> 02:50:08,145
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked interesting.

2549
02:50:11,161 --> 02:50:15,602
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff being the same, you know, $199.

2550
02:50:15,642 --> 02:50:20,864
[SPEAKER_11]: They did drop the original Kindle Fire down to $160, though, to try to kind of undercut Google a little bit.

2551
02:50:20,924 --> 02:50:23,164
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199.

2552
02:50:23,304 --> 02:50:25,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you flash those or something?

2553
02:50:26,125 --> 02:50:27,505
[SPEAKER_11]: You can flash any Android system.

2554
02:50:27,946 --> 02:50:29,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of those can be jailbroken.

2555
02:50:30,226 --> 02:50:30,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

2556
02:50:30,906 --> 02:50:32,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my wife's Nook's jailbroken.

2557
02:50:33,827 --> 02:50:34,327
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of fun.

2558
02:50:34,347 --> 02:50:36,148
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get to do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to.

2559
02:50:36,428 --> 02:50:36,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah?

2560
02:50:36,648 --> 02:50:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?

2561
02:50:37,897 --> 02:50:46,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on the Nook, so I added that with an optional bootloader and stuff on there, and so she can do that.

2562
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:50,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, if she wanted to, she could pirate apps for it.

2563
02:50:50,341 --> 02:50:55,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do that, but it mainly was for the other app store.

2564
02:50:55,803 --> 02:50:57,104
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps.

2565
02:50:57,144 --> 02:50:58,704
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like, I don't want to get other apps.

2566
02:51:00,545 --> 02:51:02,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine, I did that all for nothing then.

2567
02:51:03,006 --> 02:51:04,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2568
02:51:05,543 --> 02:51:08,805
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I guess that's it for... Someone call, please.

2569
02:51:08,825 --> 02:51:09,826
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I shut the skyline.

2570
02:51:09,866 --> 02:51:10,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It's done.

2571
02:51:10,246 --> 02:51:10,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dang it.

2572
02:51:10,826 --> 02:51:11,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I want something happy.

2573
02:51:11,887 --> 02:51:13,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're after 9 o'clock.

2574
02:51:13,028 --> 02:51:14,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's going to take me to Pinkberry.

2575
02:51:14,368 --> 02:51:15,369
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a happy subject.

2576
02:51:15,509 --> 02:51:16,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Pinkberry's always a good thing.

2577
02:51:16,690 --> 02:51:19,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very sad, though, they did not respond to our tweet from Pinkberry last week.

2578
02:51:19,932 --> 02:51:20,512
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

2579
02:51:20,732 --> 02:51:22,013
[SPEAKER_12]: When we didn't have a show, you and I went there.

2580
02:51:22,033 --> 02:51:28,297
[SPEAKER_04]: We celebrated the show by going shopping for candles in the mall at Yankee Candle, and then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful.

2581
02:51:28,557 --> 02:51:32,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dan had made some type of comment like, oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out, you're hanging out...

2582
02:51:34,963 --> 02:51:35,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

2583
02:51:37,205 --> 02:51:40,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he didn't call, so I gotta put this out there.

2584
02:51:41,088 --> 02:51:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know if he's listening, but if he is, Ranma, stay black.

2585
02:51:45,757 --> 02:52:13,170
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he just joined us not that long ago so there you go I was just talking to him in private message so about private things I know right alright anyhow we're gonna wrap up the show Dan thank you very much for being here tonight and bringing your always controversial opinions I mean that in a great way to the program and best of all the fights we all love it and keep on blasting keep on blasting Dan do you have any last words for our listeners tonight final thoughts stay black everyone will do

2586
02:52:14,661 --> 02:52:16,242
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, you're his wife.

2587
02:52:16,262 --> 02:52:16,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you go next?

2588
02:52:17,143 --> 02:52:17,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Your final thought tonight.

2589
02:52:18,304 --> 02:52:18,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck bitches.

2590
02:52:19,805 --> 02:52:20,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

2591
02:52:21,607 --> 02:52:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2592
02:52:21,827 --> 02:52:23,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Because dudes can be bitches too.

2593
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:25,090
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2594
02:52:25,330 --> 02:52:26,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Sociopaths need to be locked up.

2595
02:52:26,631 --> 02:52:27,032
[SPEAKER_04]: End of story.

2596
02:52:29,076 --> 02:52:37,822
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is I want to thank Alan for getting me Clue on Blu-ray because it's about time I have such an amazing movie on Blu-ray.

2597
02:52:37,902 --> 02:52:40,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980s, you're doing yourself a disservice.

2598
02:52:40,964 --> 02:52:43,846
[SPEAKER_12]: They rerun it on TV all the time and it's a cult classic.

2599
02:52:44,586 --> 02:52:46,047
[SPEAKER_12]: 1 plus 2 plus 2 plus 1 is?

2600
02:52:47,888 --> 02:52:49,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Please, there are ladies present.

2601
02:52:50,109 --> 02:52:51,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2602
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:52,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Go play Minecraft.

2603
02:52:54,555 --> 02:52:55,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Join the VOG server

2604
02:53:13,184 --> 02:53:16,165
[SPEAKER_11]: You can basically log in with that.

2605
02:53:16,305 --> 02:53:24,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a patched proxy server or something like that that you run the client through.

2606
02:53:25,008 --> 02:53:28,109
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers.

2607
02:53:28,229 --> 02:53:33,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Cracked servers are where they have the mode online toggled to false instead of true.

2608
02:53:33,490 --> 02:53:34,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I have mine on true right now.

2609
02:53:35,171 --> 02:53:42,533
[SPEAKER_11]: However, yesterday when their authentication server went down, I had it toggled to false so I could log in still without having to authenticate it.

2610
02:53:43,833 --> 02:53:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Technically, there's some security holes if you leave it to false.

2611
02:53:47,034 --> 02:53:55,737
[SPEAKER_11]: People can spoof stuff, but being that we're a closed-knit group, I could set it to false, but I'm going to stick to the true right now.

2612
02:53:56,617 --> 02:53:56,937
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2613
02:53:57,717 --> 02:54:02,759
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to thank you guys, as always, for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and showing us your support.

2614
02:54:03,059 --> 02:54:04,239
[SPEAKER_12]: We are an indie podcast.

2615
02:54:04,279 --> 02:54:09,661
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a giant website or commercial backing or what have you, so all we have is word of mouth.

2616
02:54:09,981 --> 02:54:11,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Please tell people about the show.

2617
02:54:11,962 --> 02:54:12,703
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

2618
02:54:12,723 --> 02:54:14,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Spread the word of other indie podcasts.

2619
02:54:14,484 --> 02:54:19,307
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, at vognetwork.com, there's a lot of great indie podcasts, and there's a lot of great indie podcasts all over the internet.

2620
02:54:19,667 --> 02:54:20,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Help spread the word, guys.

2621
02:54:20,828 --> 02:54:21,929
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all we got.

2622
02:54:21,949 --> 02:54:22,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

2623
02:54:22,649 --> 02:54:25,491
[SPEAKER_12]: The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it.

2624
02:54:25,991 --> 02:54:26,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We want oral love.

2625
02:54:27,832 --> 02:54:28,713
[SPEAKER_12]: A-U-R-A-L, right?

2626
02:54:28,993 --> 02:54:29,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2627
02:54:30,314 --> 02:54:31,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Oral, with mouth.

2628
02:54:32,355 --> 02:54:33,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, all right, whatever.

2629
02:54:34,296 --> 02:54:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Spread the love.

2630
02:54:35,617 --> 02:54:36,758
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something I can get behind.

2631
02:54:37,659 --> 02:54:38,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Or in front of.

2632
02:54:41,001 --> 02:54:42,241
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk to you guys next week.

2633
02:54:42,281 --> 02:54:45,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys for staying up late with us and participating with the show.

2634
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:46,223
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next time.

2635
02:54:46,503 --> 02:54:48,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Big week next week with the Nintendo Conference.

2636
02:54:48,464 --> 02:54:49,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Be ready for it.

2637
02:54:49,684 --> 02:54:51,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure Loki's going to have a lot to say.

2638
02:54:51,505 --> 02:54:53,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready to be underwhelmed.

2639
02:54:53,666 --> 02:54:54,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Is your body ready?

2640
02:54:54,946 --> 02:54:55,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my body's ready.

2641
02:54:55,907 --> 02:54:56,887
[SPEAKER_11]: What time is it at?

2642
02:54:56,907 --> 02:55:00,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know it's on... Is it in the morning?

2643
02:55:00,249 --> 02:55:00,649
[SPEAKER_11]: In the morning.

2644
02:55:01,349 --> 02:55:04,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit.

2645
02:55:04,570 --> 02:55:06,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we'll see if this is actually impressive.

2646
02:55:06,671 --> 02:55:07,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Another live blog.

2647
02:55:07,992 --> 02:55:08,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait.

2648
02:55:09,099 --> 02:55:11,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be with, what the hell is this shit?

2649
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:12,001
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?

2650
02:55:12,101 --> 02:55:12,481
[SPEAKER_12]: What the crap?

2651
02:55:12,501 --> 02:55:16,503
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to talk to Bobby real quick and see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network.

2652
02:55:17,283 --> 02:55:23,927
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all these live streaming software, live blogging software things, but I'm at work at that time, so we'll see.

2653
02:55:24,147 --> 02:55:25,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me.

2654
02:55:25,168 --> 02:55:27,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so your body is ready for the press conference.

2655
02:55:28,939 --> 02:55:30,280
[SPEAKER_11]: My body's ready for disappointment.

2656
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:31,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

2657
02:55:32,161 --> 02:55:33,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And the iOS conference as well.

2658
02:55:33,723 --> 02:55:38,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the iPhone and iPad is gaming, so I'm curious to see what the next thing is.

2659
02:55:39,066 --> 02:55:39,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see them next week.

2660
02:55:40,487 --> 02:55:41,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good week, everybody.

2661
02:55:41,368 --> 02:55:45,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they going to call it the new iPad or the new iPod or the new iPhone?

2662
02:55:45,711 --> 02:55:46,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be hilarious.

2663
02:55:46,792 --> 02:55:47,112
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2664
02:55:47,212 --> 02:55:47,413
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2665
02:55:47,893 --> 02:55:48,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, lastly.

2666
02:55:49,935 --> 02:55:50,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.

2667
02:55:51,116 --> 02:55:51,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.

2668
02:55:51,596 --> 02:55:52,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft reminded us.

2669
02:55:52,897 --> 02:55:53,798
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't even talk about it.

2670
02:55:54,659 --> 02:55:56,721
[SPEAKER_12]: You finally dressed as Tingle.

2671
02:55:57,181 --> 02:56:00,284
[SPEAKER_12]: And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show because it was like a week ago at this point.

2672
02:56:01,425 --> 02:56:03,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Quickly, tell us about the Tingle thing.

2673
02:56:03,627 --> 02:56:06,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally won that contest, the retweet thing.

2674
02:56:06,149 --> 02:56:08,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So she drew me as Tingle.

2675
02:56:08,872 --> 02:56:09,953
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the closest you're going to get.

2676
02:56:12,231 --> 02:56:13,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And they did hit their goal.

2677
02:56:14,092 --> 02:56:18,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So Evilot is going to get their orchestra soundtrack now.

2678
02:56:18,697 --> 02:56:19,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty awesome.

2679
02:56:19,918 --> 02:56:20,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats.

2680
02:56:21,059 --> 02:56:22,400
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, she's awesome.

2681
02:56:22,420 --> 02:56:24,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Beatrix is awesome.

2682
02:56:24,082 --> 02:56:26,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And she drew a wonderful picture of me.

2683
02:56:26,764 --> 02:56:31,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And my wife said, you should have used that to get a picture of Josh.

2684
02:56:31,108 --> 02:56:33,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, crap.

2685
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:34,731
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, whatever.

2686
02:56:35,372 --> 02:56:36,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Nah, the one he used is funnier.

2687
02:56:36,713 --> 02:56:37,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2688
02:56:37,354 --> 02:56:38,756
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, how old is your son now?

2689
02:56:38,796 --> 02:56:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Two?

2690
02:56:39,196 --> 02:56:39,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Two.

2691
02:56:39,336 --> 02:56:40,117
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll look different.

2692
02:56:40,137 --> 02:56:41,058
[SPEAKER_04]: He wouldn't appreciate it.

2693
02:56:41,979 --> 02:56:42,740
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd appreciate it.

2694
02:56:43,201 --> 02:56:45,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for five seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else.

2695
02:56:45,984 --> 02:56:48,327
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to make your Twitter picture or something so we can see it.

2696
02:56:48,968 --> 02:56:49,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2697
02:56:49,769 --> 02:56:50,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great week everybody.

2698
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:51,911
[SPEAKER_12]: We really are closing down shop now.

2699
02:56:51,931 --> 02:56:52,332
