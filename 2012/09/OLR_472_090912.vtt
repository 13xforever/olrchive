WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight September 9th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Rumors return about Valve creating a new console

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
The homebrew scene may have cracked the Vita

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
And one company finally decides to end their controversial DRM method

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 9th of 2012

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Oh, it's September 9th, you know what that means

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Happy birthday to you

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Happy birthday to you

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Happy birthday dear Dreamcast

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Happy birthday to you

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay, speed mix

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I was gonna say it's a little early for my birthday

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
We're almost to your birthday though

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
That's right, you've got, your birthday's just two days away, Techmaster Loki

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
We've gone and screwed up the intro, everything is all amiss

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Sorry, I can't talk yet

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
That's alright

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I've been shunned

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Please say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining us tonight

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Hi, you can introduce Jamie first

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I've decided to do things different tonight

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Differently

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Also say hello to Grammar Master Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
She'll cut a bitch

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I will cut a bitch

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I don't even care

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
How are you doing?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Um, yeah

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay, great

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
We are live of course at The Voice of Geeks Network

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
VoGnetwork.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I gotta say, props to Bobby

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
6, 7 years now

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Had our shows back to back, he had an A plus show tonight

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
He had an interview with Gearbox Software

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
And some of the guys over there, it addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And then Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Must listen episode, loved it

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
So check that out at VoGnetwork.com, it'll be posted later tonight

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I love when Bobby rants

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
But hopefully you'll listen to our show, I know usually he's so nice and inviting

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And you know, oh we're gonna have the listeners on the show

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And he doesn't get angry very often, but that was

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Bang bang

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
A little bit, a little bit, alright

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
He needs more flannel vests in order to hold out

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Well look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
With the game developer this week

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
But we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
The O.L. Army have been asking for for quite some time

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
We have the return surprise of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Say hello everybody to Dan

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Dan is back tonight

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yo, what up?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
How you doing Dan?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm doing good

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
For those who don't know Dan, I'm sorry

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Dan is Dark Soccer's husband

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yes

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Or me

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
It's gonna be one of those

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Shut up

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
See, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
They are just gonna fight all night long, good times

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Just like any other day

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Dan, since, how long has it been since you've been on the show?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It's been a good at least six months, right?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know, it's been a while

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Alright, well I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Between, you know, six months ago and now

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So tell us a little bit about your gaming history

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Why do you love video games?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And I know you love video games, don't even try to lie

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I like to keep it special

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Just show up once in a while, you know at random

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Nobody knows when I'm coming

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
But the games, the games

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm like a ninja

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Why do you like video games?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I don't know

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He's really having to think about this one

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
They've just always been there

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Video games have always been there?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Even when Jamie's yelling at you?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
You can turn to video games?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
No, no, I mean like, in the past

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
That's kinda how we met, kinda

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
That and anime

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fan fiction

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Kind of more anime

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
So, what is your favorite video game of all time?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I always like to ask guests on the show this

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
It's a tough question

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It's supposed to be a tough question

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Symphony of the Night

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
That's a damn good game

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Metal Gear Solid

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
You can go back a little bit further

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
There's a couple other good ones

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Gunstar Heroes

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
How do you feel about that?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I like Gunstar Heroes a lot

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Now, we were off last week

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Strider

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
We didn't have a show last week

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
At the various conventions going on everywhere

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
What have you

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
So we were gone last week

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So we missed some of last week's news

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
How do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm feeling pretty good

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I was watching the trailer and I'm just like

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh my god, it's so long

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
He changed his wallpaper

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
They keep introducing all these people

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Okay, okay, whatever

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Hey, it's Solid Snake

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, Naked Snake

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Hey, it's Snake

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Awesome

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
He changed his wallpaper

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, I put my snake wallpaper back up

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Or the big boss wallpaper

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Because big boss is a fucking gangster

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
No, it doesn't

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It's like this big intense face

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
He's like looking out of the screen like

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Blue Screen of Death that you had before

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
That one is awesome

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
That's old

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, but it's awesome

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
But it's old

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
But it's awesome

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
My wallpaper is far better than yours, thank you

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't care

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
While we were off on break

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Was Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No, no, no

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Excuse me!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Excuse me!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
How dare I?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
No, that's not worth it

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's Final Fantasy XIII III

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Let's be real

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
That's what it is

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But it's one of those weird Square Enix games

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Where they're like

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Hey, you know what?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
We're gonna put that subtitle first

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It's not gonna be a sub anymore

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It is a title

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Final Fantasy will take the back end

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
We'll just step down for a second

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Guess we'll take the back end this time

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
We're giving them the money shot

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Lightning's gonna explore the back door

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Like to savor the last shot before

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Popping the heat sink

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Alright

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We're gonna start off the show tonight

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
But I have a little bit something

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I have something special to get into

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
At the top of the show tonight here

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm gonna play something for you guys

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And unfortunately you only get to see the audio

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Or you only get to hear the audio of this

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Cause it is a podcast

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm gonna give you guys the premiere

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Of the new Xbox One

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And the new Xbox One

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And the premiere of the new Xbox Live indie game

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It is coming out very soon

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
In fact the designer is gonna be on the line with us

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
In just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
To talk a little more about this game

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And yes it is an OLR inspired game

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
You might remember we used to come up with these little

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Dream games, things we wanted to see

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Like what was the one we had the what-they-play.com snap

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Which was the, it's like Pokemon Snap

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
But it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Shouting fuck

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's like a really old reference to a news article

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
From like 2008

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Like right now you probably just think that's insanity

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And it is, that's a fun thing

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
But

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
What on the show is this saying

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I don't even remember what inspired it

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But we added the game

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing to the list

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And Aaron went

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And he actually made a game

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Called Bungee Ferret Tossing

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And it looks awesome

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Here's the debut trailer

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Here on Orange Lounge Radio

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Do you love flying a helicopter?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah!

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah!

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Do you love blowing stuff up?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Do you love terrorists?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Awkward

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Do you love blowing up terrorists?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah!

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Do you love flying a helicopter

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Swinging from a bungee cord

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
And blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
What?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Because that's what you do in

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
That's right

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Which is good because now there's something in Arizona

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
But it's bad because it's a terrorist base

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
So armed only with the most advanced ferret weapons technology

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You must attempt to storm their desert base

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
They'll come at you with guns

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Rockets

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
High powered rifles

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Higher engines

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And even insane laughter

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Proximity ferrets

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Homing ferrets

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And even cluster ferrets

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Will it be enough?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing also features two player co-op

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Free difficulty modes

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Full of survival and time attack modes

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
And a great soundtrack

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Intense action

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Bullet dodging grills

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
And the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
That's Bungee Ferret Tossing

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
On Xbox Live Indie Games

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
Love, love, love, yyrgames.com for more information on that

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
What do you think DarkSakura?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I am pleased

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I think that might have been your idea

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Are you happy with how that turned out?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Quite

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
And I named the dude, the last name

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
That's right

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I forgot what I named him

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Let's get Erin or YYR on the line right now

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
To talk a little more about Bungee Ferret Tossing

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And you guys are probably thinking there at home

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Like, God, Orange Laundry

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You're really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes we are

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Fuck yes we are

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Heck I'm thinking that, I'm at the show

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Hey Erin, you there?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I mean, yes, yes I am

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Can I just start by saying

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I love you man

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I love you man, seriously

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I love you guys too

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
You're making our dream come true and I love it

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I figured I'd take the ball and run with it

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I mean, it sat on my plate for a while

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
But hey, you guys told me to get on that

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
And so, eventually, I did

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well we are happy that you did

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So how long of a process did it take to grow

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Well actually, let me back up a little bit

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Because Bungee Ferret Tossing, it's almost done, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Like, we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Where other game creators basically try it out

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Make sure it doesn't crash

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Make sure there's nothing objectionable

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And, you know, other things are accurate

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And then, you know, once they find that there's nothing wrong with it

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
They pass it

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And once enough people pass it, it's approved

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And then once it's approved, I click a button and it's out

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
So, I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Let me tell you something, there is some stuff up there right now

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I would not wish on any of you

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I play the game so you don't have to, yes

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
But, yes, it's actually, I just checked before the show

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
And it is 75% of the way through review

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And it's only been up there since Friday night

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
So, this is going to happen very soon

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
That's all I'm saying

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh, well, I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
So, I'm just basically going to email everybody and be like

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Hey, guess what's happening, like, right now, this game, it's coming out

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Here's the trailer, here's a press kit

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Do you want a review code?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And I'd like to do that before the game comes out

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
So, basically, it means I'll probably be doing this, like, pretty soon

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Alright, I understand, yeah

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, then I'm going to push the button

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And, actually, this is kind of interesting

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
I have, this is kind of the answer to the Summer Games Arcade

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
And all the winter, like, all the other promotions they do for the big boy games

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
From the big companies, right?

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So, I'm going to be right there with them

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So, that's actually kind of exciting

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And also the fact that it's a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat, because this is too good

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And, by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
live.vognetwork.com

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Now, we understand that Bungee Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
But we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Will there be nudity in Bungee Ferret Tossing?

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And, of course, it's very fake and cartoony looking

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
No, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
And, by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
But it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
That's alright, I'll tell you what you need to know

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I mean, I'll tell you something

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Amazing, well, let's put boobs on the list

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I have to draw a line somewhere

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I want it to be as family friendly as possible

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
You should have darkly colored chickens

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Huge dark chickens

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Dark chickens?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, from another old joke, big black cock

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, stop

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
We can do dark chickens, I'll put that on the list

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Alright, that'll work

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Let me say this real quick, Jessica Harper

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
from Our Good Pals The Understanding Live

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Saturday nights here at VOG says

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Oh my god

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Did you even think of that?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I did not

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
We gotta be careful, because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation

14:43.000 --> 14:50.000
But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this, so

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Exploding ferrets

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
This is a fantastic idea

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
At least now there will be something in Arizona, there you go

15:00.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, honestly, everyone I've ever talked to who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
has basically said the same thing to me

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
There's nothing there

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
That is the whole reason why I put that in there

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Basically I'm acknowledging what they said

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Very nice, very nice

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Alright, so let me think, I gotta ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
But I wanted to bring you on, because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
And even though you're the one that's ultimately gonna profit from it, I still think it's great

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
It has my full blessing

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Let me tell you something, if this game does really well

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
I am totally gonna fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Like that is gonna be

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Beer works

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You can pay us in beer, sir

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
You got it, you got it

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Amazing, amazing

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway, so

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
We're fun, we promise

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
No exploding ferrets in person though, let's stay away from that

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Okay, so quickly

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I don't know, we could put a firecracker in one of the little ferrets

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
A little more about the game

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
But I can tell it has a great old arcade style look and feel to it

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
As all your previous games really have

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
You're very inspired by old school 80's arcade games, aren't you?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Just arcade games and intense action packed games in general

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
That's the only kind of game I'm ever gonna make because that's what I'm most into

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
So yeah, I don't know if it has an old looking vibe or what

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
But it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe because I'm not very good at it

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
I wouldn't say it's old looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
If an Atari 2600 game was modern and that's certainly not a bad thing

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
We killed hours and hours and hours of boom and stuff, you know what I mean?

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
It has a Defender-ish look to it

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Actually you're not the first person that compares it to Defender

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Obviously you're not saving people, you're destroying them with ferrets

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Yes you should

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
But yes, it has been compared to Defender before

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Nice, but it's a whole new, it's not a Defender clone at all

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's a whole new, there's bungee cords

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Defender meets Bionic Commando

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Kinda, it's just

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Exploding ferrets

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's new while feeling retro

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
And I think that's true in all your games

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It's just awesome

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Boom

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Alright, well Erin before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
What's going on in the gaming world this week

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
You know what, it's been a very long process

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
I actually started this project last May

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
So it's been in the works for a very long time

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
I nonetheless have had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
And I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
It'll be a dollar, it'll be free to try

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Do you want to hear very quickly the wishlist for the sequel?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Absolutely

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Elemental ferrets, fire, ice and lightning

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Strife amethysts

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Yes, not chaos emeralds because we can't rip off anybody

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Credits will contain a rhythm game

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Other vehicles besides helicopter, like bungee from a motorboat, yes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Dedicated sound for missile launch

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Screen-clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered anytime

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Ferrets equipped with milk tea

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Money should be used to buy stuff

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Oh, yes, raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
These trained ferrets would then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
Deformable landscapes summon killer train to attack enemies

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
An eagle operating a crane needs to be a stage boss

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, wow, Bungee Ferret Tossing 2 sounds epic

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
But hold on guys, don't sell the original short

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
The original is still going to be amazing and blow your mind

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
It's just, you know, this may soon, if it does well, wink wink nudge nudge

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
This may soon become the start of a new trilogy

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
You know what, I would love to bring that to you guys

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I got a quick question

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yes, Dan?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Are there any zombies in it?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Not yet

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Only you'll become if you play the game too much

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
There are no indie games without zombies

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
There's plenty of indie games

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
So you gotta put some zombies in

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Let me tell you something

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Every indie game has zombies

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
That's what I'm saying

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm saying every indie game has zombies

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So we need some zombie ferrets

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
You know what there is in the game though, and maybe I hope I'm not spoiling anything

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
There are kittens in the game

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Are they zombies?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Maybe

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
They're just played on the screen when you run the game that says

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Please don't throw animals in real life

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah we can't do that with my cat, she's too huge

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh I could

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
But we'll see

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Anyway, okay, Aaron I gotta wrap up and let you go

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
But everybody be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It will be out in the coming days

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
But it will be out very soon

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
And it's a dollar for heaven's sake

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
We never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
But we're gonna say buy this

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
Because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That are having a lot of spotlight this week

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
We really want Aaron to be able to do well

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
So when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
You probably already have it in your leftover points anyway

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And go buy this game

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
If you follow Y Y R Games on Twitter you'll know exactly when it comes out

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I will tweet the moment it releases

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
And check out the website of course Y Y R Games dot com

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
You have other games

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
But you have other games on the market place

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Like Snake 360 and Falling

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
That are worth checking out absolutely

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I appreciate that

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Old arcade game style stuff

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Alright, Aaron have a good one buddy

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Thank you again

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Hey you too

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Thanks so much for having me on

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Alright of course

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Take care

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Bye bye

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
You know, and if you're gonna make a game inspired by an Orange Zones Radio idea

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'll bring you on at the top of the show too

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Let's be real

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I am super excited

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I know I can't wait to play it

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
And I'm not just saying that because we're involved

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It just, it looks like fun

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I can't wait

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Ionotropic said ferret returns, bungee ferret tossing 13

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But we gotta make this one a success first

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Cause if this is a flop then Aaron's gonna be like

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Zombies

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Zombies are overrated

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Alright alright

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Let's move into how was your gaming week

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
What types of video games

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You obviously haven't been playing bungee ferret tossing

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
It's not out yet

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
But what have you been playing this week

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Let's start with Dark Sakura

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Wow, in mass effect

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Three

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
For a change

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
And two

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Shut up

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It was the zombie one

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
See, zombies overrated

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And I hadn't played through it yet

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
So

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
What the fuck man

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I have also been doing school stuff this week

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
And writing

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
And writing

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
So I have a life

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
How about you bite me

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
You just completely and totally squirt the whole segment

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
How about you bite me

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
That doesn't have anything to do with gaming either

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Where every gamer has a voice

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And they might use it to fight with their spouse

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Live on air

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Dark Sakura

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Of course not

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And then I shot my husband in the face

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's just mass effect and World of Warcraft

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
How was your gaming week

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
That was it

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
But zombies

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
It was pretty good

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Yeah

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
And it just sort of sat on the shelf

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And then for whatever reason this week I was like

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
You know what, I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Oh, and I did

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You like to do a lot of

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh, and he cursed a lot too

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
You like to do

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Oh, yeah

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs too

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Like you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
So you can kind of like watch people play games

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And stuff, right

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Yeah, you think that's a weird thing

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
And wrestling

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I don't think it's a weird thing

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Kind of to an extent

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, I will say this

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
It was something on the Game Boy

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It was like, was it DuckTales on the game

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
No, it was something even more obscure

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Was it Mega Man

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
No, it was even more obscure than that

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
It was some licensed game

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh, The Simpsons

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Oh, yeah

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It was Bart vs The Juggernauts

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Well, because a lot of these games are stuff that I've known existed

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
But I was always just like, what the fuck is this about

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And there's like this World of Long Plays channel on YouTube

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
And they do just these really good high definition long plays of games

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
And to an extent it's like, I'd like to check this game out

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
But God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So that's kind of the best way to go

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It's a good way to sample stuff too

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
A lot of the new stuff

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, well, you know

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
A lot of these games suck

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
So it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Alright, fair enough

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Alright, anything else you want to say about your gaming week, Dan?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Uh, no

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay, let's go to Loki

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Zombies

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
A little bit of that

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And then I also played McPixel

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Because I bought that on my Android phone

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And it's pretty fun, it's like a cross between

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
The old LucasArts point and click adventure games

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
And MacGyver

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
But really dirty

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Dirty MacGyver?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Like dirty MacGyver

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Because basically each one of the

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Like every single puzzle in the game is

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
You have 20 seconds to defuse the bomb

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
You don't know where the bomb is

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
You don't know how you have to defuse it

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
But you just have to figure out how to interact with stuff

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
And what you need to do

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
And most of the, well a lot of the puzzles

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Involve kicking someone in the nuts

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
And then some of them

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
To defuse a bomb?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
To defuse a bomb

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
That's how I play Scribblenauts

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Is the bomb in their pants?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Sometimes, yeah

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
It's just, it's such a weird game

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And it's awesome though

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I don't know why but I'm suddenly reminded of the game

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Don't Shit Your Pants

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
But yeah, it just, it gets really strange

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But it's definitely worth checking out

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Either, I think it's also on PC as well

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
But yeah, McPixel

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Really, really crazy but fun

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
So I played through the entire game of that

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And then Minecraft

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I've been playing a lot of Minecraft on PC

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Finally launched the VoG network server

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I actually have a remote server that I run now

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Tell us more about this

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Because we need more people on it

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Yes, it's a server

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's a whitelisted server

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
So basically you go to the forum thread on the VoG forums

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And you say, hey, I want to be let in

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
And I add your name to the whitelist

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And you can go in and build

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
And up on a hill is the clubhouse

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
You go in there, take a set of tools

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Or use that as a home base for a while

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Until you figure out what you're going to do

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
And then go off and build

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And it's just a survival thing

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
It's kind of fun

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Maybe we could have OLR Village

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah, I think that's kind of the idea

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Is that everybody would have their own little house and stuff

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah, you just build a house wherever

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I still don't have the game and I'm probably not gonna

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
You got to check, even if you don't buy the game yourself

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
At some point have one of us give you a tour

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Because it's pretty cool just seeing what other people have created

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Like in retrospect

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
That's fun

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
In retrospect though, I think I might have built myself

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Which I don't, I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
So maybe we can get something on YouTube

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
But anyway, we'll work on that later

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
But I was playing that this week on the server

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And I built a sad little house

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
But I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
You do have limited mobs

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
You're on like the easy mode

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
But you gotta have some mobs

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
To give some challenge, right?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Well, easy mode still has all the mobs

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
They just don't do all the damage

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
And the other day we were just fucking around

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Because since I'm the admin

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I can switch shit all the time

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Like right now I'm basically playing

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Or I was playing in creative mode

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Because I was

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Let's put it this way

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
When we first started the server

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And then I had Bobby telling me

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Hey, I can't go into the clubhouse

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, the door doesn't work

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Huh? That's weird

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Okay, whatever

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I was like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm like, what?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Why couldn't you go into the clubhouse?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Well, apparently I built it too close to the spawn point

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
And see, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And build stuff and stuff like that

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Other players cannot

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Because it wasn't updating the block that was there

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
So I had to tear it all down

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
And build it up on a hill

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Which is kind of funny, but

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
It looks great though

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Because now you have that waterfall and everything

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, so we were doing that

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
But anyway, so

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Like I said, I was fucking around

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Because I was in creative mode

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And so you can spawn whatever you want

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Including monster eggs that spawn

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Monsters

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
So my friend's like

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
You know, I was telling him about the endermen

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And he's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm like, alright

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
So I spawned one and he fought it

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
And he killed it pretty easily

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I'm like, okay

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
So I spawned 20 of them

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
But you will not make a habit out of spawning random endermen

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
No, no, no

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Because we were just spawning all sorts of garbage

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
It was hilarious

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
It will be real

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
By the way, if you do go on the VoG Network server and play

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It will be really easy to find my house

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Because I thought I went way far away to go build it

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
But apparently not

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Because Loki and I have already managed to connect our mines

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
It did not take very long

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
It's a temporary mine

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm going to abandon mine anyways

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Because I'm going to build somewhere else

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
It just wasn't very feasible right there

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
But yeah, there's stuff around

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I've got to figure out a way to

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Maybe we'll put up a sign on our house

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
That's like, hey, property blah blah blah

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
You know, so you don't like accidentally

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I mean, because someone can go into my mine

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And that's fine, I don't really give a crap

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
But yeah, there's a ton of

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Go ahead

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in the Sims

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
And build underground

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Live in a cave

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Which you can do

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Oh yeah, I mean, that's easy

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
A lot of people kind of do that

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
They have their main house

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And they build little outposts as they're in the mine

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That's a very common thing to do

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I mean, just living underground

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Now I did see a cool video

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Area was in Lord of the Rings

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Nice

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
It was really cool

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Nice

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
It's more like just creative mode

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Which we can, you know, if no one wants to play as a rival mode

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
We can do that

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
But I didn't want to do like creative mode

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Because it's like, eh, who cares

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
You know, I have all the objects

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I don't need to go find whatever

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
I think it's fine

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I haven't died yet

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, I've come close

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
But I haven't died yet

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
This is still how I play the Sims

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
But, I mean, and trust me

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
When I'm not building that, you know, clubhouse

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I am actually playing survival mode

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And I'm not actually cheating

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't have, like, diamond armor or anything

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
So I'm just playing legit

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
But, you know, aside from building the start area

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
You know, that obviously is doing creative

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So vognetwork.com forums

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
If you want to join us, and please do

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
But don't destroy my house

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Or I will find you and I will kill you

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, and we've got plenty of server space

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I can host up to 35 people at a time

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
And I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Good times

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Not yet

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Please join

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Not yet

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yes

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
No, that's it

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I bought Minecraft PC this week

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
That are not in the Xbox One

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Is it worth the 20 bucks?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I think it's really fun

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I do

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I bought the 360 version

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I thought it was pretty slick

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
And I started to get bored of it

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And the PC version is, like, so much better

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah, the PC one you can mod

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
And do all that stuff too as well

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Like, Alan's helping me get a map mod

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Which I think would be very useful

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Yeah, any of that stuff's okay

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
As long as it's not like, hey, mod two

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
You know, x-ray mod and stuff like that

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
So I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Walking around in armor, so, you know

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
But, yeah

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Just like in real life

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah, just like in real life and I'm not wearing a shirt

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Well, I was gonna say, yeah

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
It's definitely worth it and there's a lot more to do

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Plus, the thing is

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
The one thing that really turned me off about Minecraft originally

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Was using keyboard and mouse

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Especially on my laptop, it's touchpad and keyboard

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And I said, fuck that

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So I actually have, and I even linked it in there

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
There's a, you know, program you can use with x-pad

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Or to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
And that's actually how it plays

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
With an Xbox 360 controller

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
And it's awesome

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
It's great if you play the 360 version

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Sweet

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Alright, the rest of my gaming week

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Because we've been pretty lengthy so far

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
I'm just gonna say

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
More World of Warcraft, surprise

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
But I got my sixth level 85

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Cue the womp womp

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Whatever, don't judge me

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
And then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
So if you are a PlayStation Plus person

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
You can get Borderlands for free

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
But I am not one to turn down a free game

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Especially one that I was enjoying on the PC

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And the only problem I'm having is that

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Than it is with the PlayStation 3 controller

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
That's the only bummer

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
But the game looks good

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
And it runs really smooth

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Couple little graphical glitches here and there

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
But nothing that's a game ruining experience

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
And I really like the whole fusion of a role playing game in a first person shooter

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It makes the first person shooters very accessible

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
So, love it

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
That's mostly it

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
So, for this week that I can think of

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Let's do some housekeeping

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And then we're gonna get into some big news tonight

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Right at the top, right Loki?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
If you wanna join us on Facebook

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
If you wanna join us on Twitter

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And you can always follow us there

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
And keep on top of what's new with the show

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
And when we're gonna have weeks off or what have you

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Speaking of weeks off

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Dark Sakura will not be here next week

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
But we will still be doing a show

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Maybe we can get Dan to come back

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I don't know, we'll see

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
It's a holiday

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Alright, moving on

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Starting off

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
News tonight, Loki

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
So apparently there is a

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
There's this thing that went around the internet

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
It's funny cause I get to watch it happen

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
There's a distributor that leaked

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
The Wii U pricing and

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The release date, that's just so weird

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And they listed three skews

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And the price is anywhere from

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
$249.99 to

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
$349.99 and

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah, it's so weird

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Never heard that before, crazy

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's funny because

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I saw it, I was actually reading

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Go Nintendo and

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Funny enough, it's actually my company

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
So a little bit

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
A little bit of shock there, I was like

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
But to be clear, it wasn't you

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
No, it wasn't me

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
That was the funny thing, it wasn't me

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
It was some dude goes by Hound Dog

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
On YouTube

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Which we tracked down

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Which I'll get into in just a second here

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
So yeah

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's a little weird, I don't like to talk about

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Where I work because you know

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It comes back to me sometimes

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
It did once before

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It did once

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's documented, people know what happened

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Honestly

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Quite surprised that the Wii U stuff hasn't

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
But see

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I've kind of removed anything that points

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Me back to my company

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But yeah

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It's funny though, everybody

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
This is not necessarily a story about

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Information I pretty much already told you guys

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Based off of

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
This information

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
That I've known for a while now

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
And also other information pointing to the release

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Date of the 18th

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Which is

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
PDP leak and of course some other

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Games that are going to be announced probably this week

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That are going to be launching on

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
The 18th that kind of point to

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
That release date

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Is how

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
The gaming media works

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
And watching how it works is really

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Interesting

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
How there's literally

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Copy pasted stories, no research done

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And then it starts playing the telephone game

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Where it gets even more ridiculous

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
And I kind of, I don't know if anyone's followed my

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Twitter, you kind of saw a little bit of that

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Because I kept posting articles like

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
LOL, did they really just do that?

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So it started off in games facts

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
It went to go Nintendo

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And other Nintendo kind of

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Websites started running it

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
And one of the things that kind of got back

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
To the higher

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Ups at our company because we

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Started getting calls from our customers

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Was the fact that

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
They go, oh

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
This distributor

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Supplies Amazon over stock

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And blah blah blah

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
True, we work, we do sell stuff

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
To Amazon but we're not the main

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Supplier for Amazon

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It makes it sound like

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Basically a lot of these places

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Were just like, oh Amazon distributor

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Leaks price because that

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Headline gets a lot more hits

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And it adds a little bit more credence

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
To the information in there

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Despite the fact the funny part is the date's

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Wrong

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
It's a placeholder date, it's not right

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
At all, no one knows

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
What the real date is

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Well, I mean I speculate what the real date

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Is, but that date's not it

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Which is funny because everyone's like

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Well that doesn't go with the rumors

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I've heard that it's the 18th

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
That's a week before, but it's a Sunday, I guess it's real

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But like

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
CNET, I think out of all the

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Stories I saw from

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The different blogs, CNET's probably the

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Funniest one, and I don't know who this

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Guy is, but

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
He first, he put the text

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You know, that was the text information

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
He's like, yeah okay, so it was the Wii U system

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
1111, and 249

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
299, 349

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
But then I got this

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Additional information

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
A screenshot of the website

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Oh, that backs up the information

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Oh wait, I got another source

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It's a video, it's like you're a fucking idiot

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
They're all the same goddamn thing

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
It's the same goddamn source

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And you're like sourcing two other things

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
To make it sound like that it's

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
More legit

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Some comments from our chatroom at

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Live.vognetwork.com

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Costa journalism

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Frisbee says, control C, control

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
V, that's how the stories go from you

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
To me

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I like that

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
There's like a little song about that

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
WhatupG says it would be cool if it was November 11th

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
But November 18th makes sense at least

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Historically for Nintendo, that's the exact

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Same day they released

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
The Wii, the GameCube?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
One of the other systems was the exact same day

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So, Mr. Dan

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Having a background in video

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
As a release date

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
It's really irritating

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And it does also make sense about the 11th that

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
They will be sending them out early

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Because, you know, the stores

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Don't get it, you know, it doesn't just magically spawn

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
In the store Sunday morning

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
You know, we have it hidden away somewhere

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
So that you can't get it

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
You can't steal it

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And post it on the internet

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
No, you never put other people down

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Here's the funny part

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Like I said before, you know

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
There is this guy, this anonymous guy

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Hound dog, who leaked it

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Dude

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
First rule of the internet

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Anything that you post on the internet

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Always stays on the internet

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
So, when you post

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
A video or whatever

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
And then

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
You know, think that we're not gonna figure it out

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
First off, his video

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Basically it was a video of a screenshot

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Had a time and date

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
In the bottom corner

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Stupid

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Because, you know what we could do?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
We went back, we looked at our web access logs

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
And guess what?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We query every single search

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
On there

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
During that time frame, there was only two

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
And then

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And then it was basically two different customers

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
And then

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Oh, guess what? You do a Google

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Cache search on, you know, Hound dog

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And oh, he has a trailer

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
An advertisement for a certain

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Store that happens to be one

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Of the two customers

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Oh, Guerrilla Games and Saint

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Cloud

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Don't hold back now

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
So what happened?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Did anybody go to the guy

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
And say, why'd you do it?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Honestly, I don't know

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Because this was stuff that was handled

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
By managers and upper management

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And stuff like that, because funny

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Like I said, this had nothing to do with me

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I do item setup sometimes

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
For a lot of games, but I don't do

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
First party because our buyer for some goddamn reason

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Wants to hold on to first party even though

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
She fucks everything up

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
So

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
She set that up, she didn't

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Flag it to not show up on our website

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Even though maybe she should've

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And it wasn't any of my

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Customers that leaked the information

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
So I just sat back and kind of like

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Lol

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Frisbee said she should've used the free Wi-Fi

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
At Starbucks

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Oh yeah, that was the other thing too, his IP

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Pointed back to Saint Cloud as well

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Whatever, anyway, this is all in

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Moot Point come Thursday

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Exactly, it's all in Moot Point and the whole thing

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Blew over pretty fast, except for the fact that

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Amazon's like, we need an apology

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
From you, we need you

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Blah blah blah, Nintendo of course

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
On people's asses about, hey

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
You know, this is not supposed to be

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Which only leads credit to the fact

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That it's probably true

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Except that the date's not right, but you know

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I mean, some information's obviously

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Accurate, like the pricing

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
And like I said

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
If you've been listening to this show

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
For the last few months

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
This is no

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
This is not news to you

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Put it that way

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I just find it funny though

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Like how, seriously

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Copy paste all these articles are

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And like, big comp- like

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
IGN, and what the fuck, okay

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Seriously, let's step aside here

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
What the fuck is it with IGN

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And GameSpot where

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
You have an article, okay

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
And there's not that much information

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
In this article, it's like, okay

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Distributor, three prices, three skews

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
November 11th date

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
They have an article, and then they have

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
A video in the article, that's talking about

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
The article

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Why do they, and why is it some

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
British guy, it's always a British guy

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
People don't like to read

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
They're like, having some intern guy read this

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Dude, and there's this like

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
This distributor, we can't get

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Into their website because you need to log in

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And password, but this guy got in

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And he got this exclusive information

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
And blah blah blah, and

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
People don't like to read

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
It's ridiculous

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I feel ignorant without IGN

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Well it's funny you say that, because people

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Can't read, but there is somewhat

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Truth to that, because this makes a very

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Interesting companion piece to

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Bobby's show before us tonight, and the whole

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Girlfriend mode thing

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
And how that kind of got carried away

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
And all that as well, and that's because people

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Didn't really want to read the entire article

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
They just wanted to read the part where

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Because he clearly hates women

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I think it was a poor

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Choice of words, but really people just need to get over it

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
But, I mean, we all make poor

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Choice of words sometimes, I mean, thank God

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
No one really does listen to this show, except

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
You know, you fell for, because God, we've

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Said shit on this show that would have gotten us

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Through the coals in the past, because

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
That's unfortunately the way

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Our little internet medium works

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Sometimes, and it's- There's no one, no one pays attention

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
To us, but they'll pay attention to like

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Joe Schmo, I mean like

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Seriously, like MTV

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Like, it went

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It went everywhere, it went to MTV's

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Website, they're the gaming block, it went to

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET, it went

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Well CNET takes stuff from Yahoo

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Or, I mean, vice versa

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I think that's just saying that people want to know

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
The Wii U date already

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I understand that, but it's just, it's so ridiculous

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
How, I literally got one

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Email from an independent site

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Asking the, you know, follow up on that

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
One person

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Fucking hilarious, because what did Bobby

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Ran about on his show, just, just

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
An hour ago, what was Bobby's ran on his show

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
About his exclusive interview with Gearbox

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
How did he get that exclusive interview?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
He asked

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And here's the other thing too that was funny about

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Nobody else had asked

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Here's the other thing that was funny about the CNET article

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
And then we went to our gaming gurus

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
In the, in the

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
In the office

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And they, yeah we talked to this editor

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And he said, yeah that sounds like that could be real

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Really? Really? That is your

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Fucking, like, proof

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
This guy just says, yeah that sounds like

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Feasible information

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Millionaire? Ask the experts

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Are you on a game show?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
It's like, yeah, yeah

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
That seems feasible

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Hey Joe Schmo who plays some video games that

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Delivers our mail, do you think that this release date

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Sounds like it could be real?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Sounds right

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It was the release date

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I have no information to back that up

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
But it sounds like a date to me

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I mean it is a date and it hasn't happened

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Yet so um

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I guess it could happen

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Anyways, let me just, let me just stop right here

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And reiterate what I've said

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
In the past

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Okay, three SKUs, $249, $299

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
$349, $299 SKU I

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Speculate, Wii U system

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Tablet, that's it

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's in case you already have a Wii

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
A Wii system, Speculate

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Okay, because I don't know any information other than

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Three prices

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Oh and November 18th release date, but that's also

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Speculation based on information, but whatever

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Um, not information that I have

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
From Nintendo, nothing from Nintendo

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Um, $299

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
SKU, System

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Nunchuck, in case you don't

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Own a Wii U

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Or a Wii system

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
$349 SKU

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
System, Gamepad, Nunchuck

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Remote Plus

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Nintendo Land, that's my guess

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
So we'll see in a few days if I'm right

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
We'll find out on Thursday

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It's going to be a busy week between the iPhone 5

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
On Wednesday, and then Nintendo on Thursday

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
This is Tech Christmas in some ways

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
So we'll uh, the blogs

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Will be busy this week copy pasting

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
From each other

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
When they're not live blogging

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Because that's the other big thing, live blogging

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Anyhow, I think I just

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Gave Loki an aneurysm

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Let's move on, let's move on to something a little more

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Indie, shall we? Something a little more under the radar

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It's Steam Greenlight

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's a chance for you to basically

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Help, I don't want to say it's Kickstarter

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Because it's not, but it's helped generate

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Buzz for indie games

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
People that want to get their ideas

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Out there to be approved by the community

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
To be sold on Steam

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, when this first went live

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
A lot of people were putting

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
A lot of crap on there

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Things like Half Life 3

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Showed up on Steam Greenlight

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And things of that sort

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
So in order to kind of curb this

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Valve decided to set a $100

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Fee to get your project listed

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
On Steam Greenlight

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
This fee goes to Child's Play

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Pretty interesting solution

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
A pretty ingenious way to figure it out

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
The Valve UI designer

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Alden Kroll said

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
We have no interest in making money from this

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
But we do need to cut down the noise

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
In the system

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Which is causing a little bit of controversy

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Because some people think, well for a true indie

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
$100 is a lot of money

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Blah blah blah blah blah

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
What do you guys think? Is this fair?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I think it's a good way to make sure

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
People are serious about it

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I think it's fair

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
So, very cool

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Also some other changes to the system

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Now when you log in

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And look at Steam Greenlight

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
You're gonna see a smaller list

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
You're not gonna get thrown everything at you

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Popular games and new games

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
On Steam Greenlight

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Does that have anything to do with

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It's a sequel. It's the one that was on Kickstarter

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm gonna go upvote that right after the show

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
They have a demo you can play

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Really? Already?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, it's pretty sweet

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Over 700 submissions already since August 30th

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
One thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Just for the record

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Sex games

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
There was a game called Seduce Me

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
That was on Project Greenlight

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And yes, it was removed

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Said, quote,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Steam has never been a leading destination

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
For erotic material

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Greenlight doesn't aim to change that

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And what a shame

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Alright, I guess we can understand

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Why they don't want that stuff associated

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
With sex is overrated

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Well, because of the media sensation that would occur

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Think about it

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
If they were to sell Booby Game

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Then suddenly it's gonna be on CNN

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
And there would be the commentators

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
On Fox News

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Oh my god

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Can you believe on Steam

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The Booby Games that are corrupting our children

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
They don't let your dirty money

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
It's Booby Steam

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
But I wish people weren't so freakin'

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Uptight? Stick up their ass?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Have their game, dammit

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Hehe, boobs

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
When you tell a little kid they can't do something

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
What's the first thing they want to do?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Just go out and do it

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
You know, like, vowel language

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Or fucking

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
People are just gonna want to see it more

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Going to

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Missworldnude13

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
For Greenlight

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Excellent suggestion

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Saig, who knows a thing or two about

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Developing games, is in our chatroom saying

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
The Greenlight stuff is cheaper

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Than any other commercial game seller

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Steam is $100

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
For one time

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
iOS is $99 a year

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Mac is another $99 a year

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
So, very interesting perspective

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
On what that $100

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
If that really is too much money

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Or what, is that, you know

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
That's the same price you're gonna pay for iOS

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Which is seen as a huge indie boom

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I'm sorry, it's the same amount

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
For one year, and then you have to renew on

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
iOS where you don't with Steam

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It's basically

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Like the free to play model

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
If you think about it

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
You buy the game, or you buy, you know

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
You pay your $100, and you're done

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
So

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah, like

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Unbaptized babies lactating out of

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Cleopatra's nipple. Oops, that was

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Dante's Inferno

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Good point

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Alright, let's move on

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Dark Sakura

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Well, I don't know how clean it is, but

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
About the whole

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Steam box thing that we've talked about before

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
There is a job listing

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
For an industrial designer

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
On Valve's website

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And I'll read the quote on here

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
We're frustrated by the lack of innovation

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
In the computer hardware space

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
So we're jumping in

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Even basic input, keyboard and mouse

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Hasn't really changed any meaningful way over the years

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
So basically, they're trying to

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I guess, expand further

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
But they're still kind of denying the whole

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Steam box thing

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Why do these rumors keep perpetuating

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Everywhere? It's interesting

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Although, it does have me thinking

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
If Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
It's because they keep hiring

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
For people for that

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
That's why

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
When you have someone that's being hired for like

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Hardware design

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Steam software

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Or anytime soon

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
For example, they hired console developers

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
For Diablo 3 at Blizzard

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Doesn't mean that we've seen

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Diablo 3 on consoles yet

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Maybe it'll happen next year

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Or maybe not

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I don't even see it being its own sort of system

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Maybe the potential of having something as a

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Computer add-on

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
You know

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Like a combination storage device

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Maybe graphics boosting

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
It would seem so easy

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
To just do a little PC in a box

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
That plays very basic Steam games

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
You know, what the hell's an Ouya?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
It's kind of like that

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Very, very, very bare bones

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Type of system that just plugs in your TV

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Maybe Valve could pump

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Another couple hundred dollars worth of tech

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Into it and have something that could play Portal

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
See, I could do that. It's called my computer

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Well, they could sell it

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
That I already have

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
That I play Mass Effect on

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Alright, well since we are talking

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
About Valve, there was something else

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Valve going on this week and

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I want to invite our resident Valve fanboy

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
At Orange Lounge Radio here on the program

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
To talk a little bit about this

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
So welcome to the show everybody, Alan!

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
How you doing Alan?

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
How was your gaming week? What have you been playing lately?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Mass Effect 3

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
How's the multiplayer weekend going for you?

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I haven't done it yet, I need to get on that

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Oh my gosh, you better hurry, you don't have much time

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Bejeweled? What's with this new Bejeweled addiction you got going on?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I just remembered that Bejeweled 2 was good

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And I found a copy of 3

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So why not?

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
So what did you want to talk about tonight?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I have Half-Life news

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
So

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
In June 2004

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
To show off the, at the time, brand new

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Source engine

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
That Half-Life 2 was going to come out on

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
In November of that year

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Valve put out Half-Life Source

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
They basically piped the original Half-Life game

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Into the Source engine

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
And it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
It's like, okay

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It has better lights and physics

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
But otherwise, it's Half-Life

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
1998 game

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
And it kind of ticked off about it

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source project

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
They are just amateur programmers

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
They're not professionals

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Not getting paid to do this, and they said

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
We are going to take Half-Life

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And literally redesign it and program it

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
From the ground up

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Into the Half-Life 2 engine

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
They had a fiasco in 2009

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Where they released a really awesome trailer

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
And ultimately

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The game didn't come out because they're like

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
This isn't done

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
They went out on a media blackout

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
For the last three years

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
And it's coming September 14th, they finally announced

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That's very interesting

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
So because they got burned the first time

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It was entirely their fault

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
But they went underground with it

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
They didn't update the Twitter, YouTube

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
No leaked screenshots, they're like

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
We are off the grid, we're still working on it

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Dan just said

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Sounds like Valve to me

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
But this isn't Valve

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
But Valve is kind of embracing it

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Some companies would cease and desist

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
The shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Remake in Square Enix

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Right?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I think they asked them to change

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
The name because there was some confusion

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
That Valve was doing it

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
And Valve wasn't offended

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
That people thought

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
That they themselves were making it

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
But they were like, you guys need to name this something else

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
So that people will be aware that it's an indie project

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
And it's your project

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
This is your thing

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I think it's already got its clearance on Steam

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Green light

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Shock

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Steam is probably going to host it

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
If anything

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Get people interested in the franchise

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Again, considering that it's been

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
8 years since Half-Life 2

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Proper came out

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
And a good 5 years

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Since Episode 2 came out

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
And there's still not a people

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
About Valve for Half-Life 3

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
So they also

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Said for this remake

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
They added some dialogue

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
They did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
More interesting, but otherwise it's a shot for shot

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Remake

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
The trailer is still on YouTube from 3 years ago

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
If you haven't seen the trailer, you should watch it

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
It's really awesome

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's free, why wouldn't I?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And you'll be playing through it?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
So I'll see you in a week?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Before we say goodbye for now

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Thank you for the update

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I unfortunately am very ignorant

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
When it comes to Half-Life

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
We don't have time to play every single game

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But Alan will make me play it

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
At some point I'm sure

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room says

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
It's better they continue working on it

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
And when they feel it's ready, to release it

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
No reason to release a buggy game

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
If Half-Life 3 ever comes out

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
It'll probably go multi-platform

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
The reason I'm teasing Alan with that idea

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Maybe it'll be a PC and

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Playstation 4 exclusive

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Or something like that

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
About the game

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
We shall see, however

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Alright, let's move on with some other news

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Loki

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
To register participation for this week's episode

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio on

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
vognetwork.com

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Use the passphrase, thumb

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
So this is kind of interesting

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I talked about a game I played during the week

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Which is called McPixel

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And this weekend they actually

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Went about a unique way to advertise the game

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
It's on the front page

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Of the Pirate Bay

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Pirate Bay being a very notorious

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Website for

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Piracy

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
McPixel, they have a

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Basically a little bit of a letter

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
To people, it's like

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Hi, I'm SOS

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Video games, but not in a big company

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I make games I want to make

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I know that not everyone

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Can afford entertainment, but everyone needs it

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And even though I make games

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
For a living

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I am most happy to just see people

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Enjoy them

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
So today you can download a torrent of my game

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And if you like, throw some coins

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
In my general direction

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
And so they actually have that on there

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
You can download a torrent

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
For it and download it for free

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Or you can

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Once you've done that and you play it

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
You can decide to donate money to

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
You know, to them

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Isn't this what Radiohead did for one of their albums

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Like five years ago?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I don't remember, but I know that this is what

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Also like

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Oh, the RiffTrax guys do

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Because they're like, listen, we know that

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Not everybody, you know, downloads these from us

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
But, you know, if you like them

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
You know, maybe kick us some money

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Well, RiffTrax is in a little

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Bit of a stickier situation though

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Because they are doing parody art

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Of movies that you kind of already

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Have to own, like they can't put it out there

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Attaching it to the movie

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
For them to get that, but

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
You know, they're in a weird place

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
It's also a lot more convenient than trying to sync that stuff up

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Because I've synced that stuff up before

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Like I'll have, we watch all the Twilight movies

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
With the RiffTrax stuff on there

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And I had the DVD for Twilight

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
But man, downloading the

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Precinct stuff is way easier than

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Having to have a second source

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
To play the MP3 at the same time as the audio

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Because it gets off sync pretty easy

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Alright

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Um

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
What do you think, um, I mean

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I don't know if there's a lot to think about this

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Because clearly no big publisher is ever

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Going to do anything like this, but

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Do you think the guy will actually make some money?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
He'll probably make some money, I mean the game's not that expensive

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
He probably didn't spend that much

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Money on it, so

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I mean, it's exposure to him

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
And, you know, if he figures that people are gonna

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
And saying, hey, you know what

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Um, at least donate some money

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
If you like it, you know, donate a dollar, five dollars

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Whatever

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
About a game that, let's be real,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
People probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Unfortunately

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It's really hard for indie games to get press

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah, exactly, and the other thing too

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Like, you look at some of the people, it's much like

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
The Humble Bundle, where, you know, some people

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Just pay a penny or whatever to get it

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But there's people that, like, donated a hundred

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
One dollar, or a hundred and forty-one dollars for this game

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The Brony Bundle group

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
On Twitter or whatever? That always, um

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I get a kick out of that

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
People that band together to donate lots of money

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But it's, you know, it is a good cause

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I love those Humble Bundles, those are always good times

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
But yeah, they've got, like, in fact, let's see here

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Um, I was trying to see

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The, uh, there's a couple of people

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That did, uh, you know, a hundred and forty dollars

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Uh, one hundred and thirty-three dollars

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Sixty-seven, there's a bunch in the fifties

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And the average right now, this is the average price

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
That people are paying for is two dollars and fifty-eight cents

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Uh, Neesh said, um, Radiohead

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Did this for their In Rainbows album

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And said it brought more money to them

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Than, um, all their other albums combined

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You know why? Because they cut out

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The record label by doing that

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Well, yeah, but still

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And if you are

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Because this is only going for about another

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Four hours

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Go downloading the torrent

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
While you still can

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And you can do that guilt-free

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And you are totally a law-abiding citizen

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Because the creator has given his blessing

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
He wants this to happen

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
To get the word out

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Although, one little problem with that

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Is that, you know, he says that

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
You know, you download the torrent

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And there's, you know, it's only available

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
For four hours, but

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
And there's going to be someone always hosting that game

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Or hosting, you know, seeding it, so

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yeah

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Alright, well, from one controversial viewpoint

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
On piracy to another, Ubisoft

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
You know, they're always on

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Over the years, um, or I should say

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Over the years, it's only really been about

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
A couple years, but, um, Ubisoft

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Is now changing their policy on this

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Always-on DRM, you know, it's just been too much

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Headache and so forth, I think some of us

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Saw this coming, but here's the new DRM

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Policy, according to Stephanie

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Parodi, who's the company's worldwide director

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
For online games, Ubisoft PC games

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Are now going to require a one-time

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Online activation when you first

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Install the game, then you can

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You are free to play the game offline

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
And they claim this has been Ubisoft's

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Policy since June of 2011

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But, uh, it's

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Been noticed that maybe there's been some

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Games that didn't get that memo, because

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Always-on we've seen in some more recent releases

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
However, um

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This is going to be their new policy moving

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Forward. A fair compromise?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
What do y'all think?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
It's fair

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I do think it's fair

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But I always have concern

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
For people that can't get

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That online connection

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And, you know, there are still some people

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
In the world that can't get that online connection

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I'm not just talking about people who live in the sticks

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But I'm talking about, like, military service people

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Overseas, you know, sometimes

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Want to play some games to, you know,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Blow off steam a little bit

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And, you know, I do realize they can use

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
The satellite connections and some of these things

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
But that's not always a reality, or it's expensive

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Or what have you, so

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I just hope there might be some workarounds

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Some considerations made for people

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Who really are trying to do the right

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Thing. They usually do that

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
With a lot of software that phones

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Home is they'll have, you know, the

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Alternate means of, you know

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It usually involves, you know, calling up a

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Number and you give them, you know, whatever

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And they give you authentication code or something

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That would be fair. I hope there is some type of

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Little plan B in the small print

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
For people that truly can't,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You know, which is how they create a lot of those

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Cracks out there for software, but I'm

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Just saying, you know, it's

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I mean, they're already expected to be

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Having 93% of their software

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Pirated, so

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
We're running along this segment, of course

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But we knew we would. DarkSakura

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'll try to keep this one short then

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Basically, the

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Developed by

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Looks like Straight Right

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Who is out of Australia

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Basically saying that

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
They've been putting a lot of work into this

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's not going to be a rushed deal

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Launch and that it's supposed to be amazing

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Well, thank god they didn't

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Come out and say, you know what, we're going to

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Half-ass it

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And say, eh, whatever

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
You know, you'll like what you get

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Deal with it. They're saying it's supposed to look just

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
As good as the other console versions

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And, I mean, I'm kind of

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Interested to see exactly how it plays

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
With the little Wii U pad thing

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Wait, did they really say that? Just as good

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
As the other console versions? That's exactly what they said

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It will look just as good

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Now, wouldn't you think

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
With a new console coming out

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You'd want to say, better

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
A new console using old technology?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I just

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
How can it be any better? I'm just saying

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It's not helping the case of the Wii U

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
It's using old tech. It's using the Wii

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I'm just saying

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So, I would expect it to look as good as a Wii

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I'm being sensationalist

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And latching onto that one quote

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
My headline, my pull quote

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Mass Effect 3 will look about as good

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
As it does on the other consoles on the Wii U

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
There's my pull quote

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Orange Lounge Radio exclusive

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Rob

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yes?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
There is a quote here

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It says

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
There is a significant technical challenge

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Bringing the game from its original format

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
To the Wii U. It's new, different

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And sophisticated piece of hardware

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
As of

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So there's a good deal of technical energy

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That's being expended to make that happen

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I mean, you have to see the size of the shoehorn

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We need to have

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
In order to get that tablet to work

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I mean, seriously

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Of that size

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
We used a hammer

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Look, I will say

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I really kind of wanted to see how it works

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
With the screen and everything

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I'm very curious. It could be interesting

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
This is me

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
With no fucks left to give

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Stop

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I'm just gonna play it on PC

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It's already fun

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Or something, but I don't care

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And a copy of Mass Effect 3

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You know when you come over you'd be like

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I want to kind of see it

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I want it to make me buy a Wii U

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
What would be enough

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
To make you buy a Wii U?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Fuck if I knew

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
How about a good system?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
How about it being good?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
How about it having good games?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm not saying it doesn't have good games

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
We don't know yet

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
This is the problem with Mass Effect 3

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I already have Mass Effect 3

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Shut up

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Uh oh, uh oh

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dan's got something to say

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
See this is from the woman

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Who wanted a Wii to start with

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
She waited in line overnight

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I was like, fuck the Wii

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's last gen

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
This is the man who played

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Twilight Princess for hours

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I didn't play through Twilight Princess

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
The Zelda games are good

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But at the same time

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I try to do surgery

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I just think it's a stupid idea

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I already have Mass Effect

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
How about you shut the fuck up

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And let me finish what I was saying

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Yeah

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That was what I was trying to say, dumb butt

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Goody goody gumdrops

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Give Rob back his mic

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Give Rob back his mic

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
No

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
To be fair

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Dan's making a point we've made on this show before

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
It's hard to get excited about

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
You know, Arkham City redone

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Mass Effect 3 redone

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It's not even that redone

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You can tilt the Wii U tablet

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
To move the battering round

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You can do that also with the 6 axis controller

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
On the PS3 version

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I would love

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Please Nintendo

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And be like, here's what's coming

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It better have like

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Shut up Dan

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Don't make me buy it, okay

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But no seriously, they could come out Thursday and say

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You know, we've got this Zelda

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Or this F-Zero

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Or this new IP that looks really cute

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I would like for that to happen

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That would make me very happy

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
The only thing I fear

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Is that there's a new excite truck

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I want the bite if it's a new excite truck

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Are you kidding?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It would be amazing

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It would be absolutely amazing

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Use a mic

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Alright

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Let's move on

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I was still

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Oh I'm sorry, go ahead

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Shut up

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I'm done

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Are you gonna let him win?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I'll get him later

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Oh, okay

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Let's travel around the world

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And check out release dates of games that are coming out

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
A little sooner than a Wii U

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
There's actually some stuff coming out this week

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Finding Nemo Escape to Big Blue

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The special edition being

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
re-released now by Disney Interactive

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
As opposed to THQ because guess what?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
That they're re-releasing into theaters

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Kind of appropriate

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's also coming out on the 3DS as well

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So it's not just the DS this time

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Because I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
What happened to movies on the 3DS?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Wasn't that supposed to be a thing?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
That's a serious question

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
They had a couple

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
They did the Tekken 1

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Oh, that's right

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I mean

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
The Tekken 1

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Didn't they do Pokemon anime on Game Boy Advance cartridges?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Where's my Tron legacy?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It was a different time

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That was in E3, remember?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
When they had those demos for it

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Because that technology just vaporized

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And they gave you free headphones

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Okay, let me put it this way

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Never comes to fruition like online

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
There's a dig at the Wii U

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I'm telling you that online's gonna suck

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Battlefield 3

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
The premium edition for 60 bucks

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
You get all the DLC

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
This week

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
NHL 13 on PS3 and 360

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
For PS3 and 360

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Also NHL The Stanley Cup Collector's Edition

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Which is probably a complete waste of money

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Unless you like DLC

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That is coming out for 80 bucks on PS3 and 360

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
For 2012 and probably 2013

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
NBA Baller Beats

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
For Xbox 360

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Fuck yes

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The game where you have to dribble a basketball

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
To the beat of the music

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
On my carpet

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
In front of Kinect

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Because that's gonna fucking work

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That is coming out this week

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
This game is gonna scare the shit out of the cats

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I can't wait

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
One week from today

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Kirby's Dream Land

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Collector's Special Edition

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
That's too many fucking adjectives

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Collector's Special Edition is too much

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Just call it a

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Special Edition or Collector's Edition

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Limited

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It can't be a 20 years anniversary edition

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Just call it

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Virtual Console Games we could have released

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But we decided to put them on a fucking cart

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Or I'm sorry, CD

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
DVD, whatever, disc

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
It has a cart painted on it

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Hey you know what though?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And it comes with a special gold cartridge

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That has absolutely nothing inside it

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
At the very least, at least there is

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
More than one ROM on this fucking disc

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
As opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
As a limited edition

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
More than having people buy it for $80

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It has that little retrospective

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Hallway new thing in it

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Look at that

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Well bravo for Nintendo

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
For putting a minute

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Bit of effort into it

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Act deft in our chatroom

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Fuck you Loki, Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Orange right says

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Super Hyper Kirby EX

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Plus Alpha Zero Turbo

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And then I added for matching service

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
You know what? Kirby sucks

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
No, Kirby doesn't suck

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Actually he does suck

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
That is the truth

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
He also blows

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Kirby blows

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
He's gone from suck to blow

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Moving on

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Japanese releases

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
They get in on the fun this week as well

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
September 13 is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Going to the Playstation 3

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Of course, same game there as well

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And a game called Excel World

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Ginyoku no Kakuse

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Comes out, limited and regular editions

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
From also

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
That sounds terribly boring, a whole world based on

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
A database program

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Not looking forward to that

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Nothing on the Vita

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
The little big planet is just a couple weeks away

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
At this point in Japan

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Metarot 7

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Kabuto and Kuwagata versions

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I don't know what game this

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
This is two separate editions

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So it looks like little

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
This looks like fighting mech robots

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Looks like you collect little mech robots

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
And fight them to the death

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh shoot

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I know what this is

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Tell me that's not a total Pokemon inspired

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Screenshot right there

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I watched some of this

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Where the guy gets

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
These little robots

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It turned out that his dad

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Played these two or something

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
He tried to beat up his little robot

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
But his robot wins

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And tears up his house in the meantime

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I don't remember

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I only just saw it once

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Robots tear up a house? Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Little teeny robots

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Sengoku Musou

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Chronicles 2

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
On the 3DS as well

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You guys know what that is right?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Once again

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And lastly but not least

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Kiyoshitsu comes out from Nintendo

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
On the 3DS this week

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
This game is not something that looks

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It's an artist program

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Oh this was one of the crazy wacky games

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It's art academy

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I can't remember what it's coming out as

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It's art drawing things

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Still life, art

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
What the hell is this?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It's coming out in October over here

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I like that painting of the doggy

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Not bad

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Alright there you go that's Japanese releases

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I think it's like art academy you can draw everything

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I think is what it's called or something

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We'll figure it out

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Go into the UK

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I'm sorry I was still looking at this funny screenshot

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
So in the UK on the 11th

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
We have Battlefield 3 Armored Kill

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
On the 14th Joe Danger 2

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
The movie Tekken Tag Tournament 2

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And Chaos Off Deponia

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
That's it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Alright just a couple more news stories

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
For you guys than the classic game of the week

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
But first Loki

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So more Vita hacking

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Independent developer

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Yifan Lu

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Has found an exploit that allows

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Retail systems to run native

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Homebrew Vita code

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
As opposed to running

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
PSP

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Homebrew stuff because that's been the last few

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Hacks

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Okay hey we got some

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Homebrew to run in the PSP mode or whatever

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Using one of the games

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
That are out there that you can

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Download to your console

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Of course

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
He's basically

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Saying you know we're not

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I'm gonna not make anything that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Will benefit piracy

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
This tool is in fact

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
This tool in fact cannot be used for loading

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Backups or pirated content even if I

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Wanted to because of the physical limitations

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Of the exploit however

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
He says that you know

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
This kind of stuff could lead

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
To people developing a better

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Method that could lead to that stuff

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But as of right now he is

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
In no way endorsing piracy

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Even though everyone thinks that

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Homebrew equals piracy but that's

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Kind of the

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Situation that we're in right now

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Of course he hasn't released any information on it yet

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Because like before whenever

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
They would release an exploit they would

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Patch whatever game was involved with it

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So hopefully

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
This one isn't game reliant

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Like the last few have been

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
How quick do you think

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Sony will patch this up I mean here we go

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Again if it's game reliant pretty

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Quick if it's not it might take a little

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Bit or if it's even something they can

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Patch it I mean they may they should be

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Able to patch it pretty quick and so we don't know how they're

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Get the jump on because before it used to be like

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
You know even before they released something hey

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
You know this is the game

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That you need to have in order to

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
You know run this modified

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Save that loads you know the bootloader

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
For some PSP homebrew

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Before that would run in PSP mode but now that

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It's in Vita mode you have more

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Access to memory

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And processing power and that kind of stuff

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
It's not throttled like it was before

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
So hopefully

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I mean I understand

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
He's hoping that by saying oh

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah it's not going to really run any

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You know sort of exploit

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
That'll allow you the pirate games

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
That he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Shit as soon as they can

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Alright one more story for you guys

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And this is about what was a

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Classic video game network at one

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Point G4

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Some rumors going around about G4 look I want to make

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
It clear G4 hasn't been a gaming

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Network for several years at this point

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You know they switched to that whole

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Cops reruns and stuff quite some time

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
What are their ties to gaming at this point

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
X-Play and Attack of the Show

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Sometimes but X-Play now doesn't have

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Adam Sessler obviously

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Cause he's gone

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Is Morgan Webb still there though?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I think Morgan Webb's still there

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Even Attack of the Show's lost a lot

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Of their

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Casts that people would watch it for

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Well Variety published an article

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
This week that G4 is going geek

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And more chic and this is rumor

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Right now but because G4 is owned by

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
NBC Universal, Comcast

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
They want to change

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
G4 into a direction that's more

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Like GQ

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
The modern male magazine

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So basically I don't know how it's

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
More modern male

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
More refined I guess

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I don't know what kind of programming that would entail

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So basically Spike but for high brow

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
People

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
For hipsters

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So we're not going to have episodes of

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
A Thousand Ways to Die

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Involve women with big boobs

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Bouncing up and down or explosions

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I'm not really interested

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Me neither because Logo still has

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
On cable worth watching

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
So high brow are they talking about more like GQ

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So they're going to start rerunning episodes of

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Is that how they're going? Is it going to be like the

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Metrosexual channel or something?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Who knows? I don't know

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Maybe the guys who flip the

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Million Dollar Homes

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
The real estate shows

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It's going to be garbage whatever it is

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
We'll see we'll see but regardless

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Any video game ties

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
You might have to this network are

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Looking to be severed pretty soon

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It hasn't been dumped from

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Satellite providers at this point

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
They're not doing too well

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Like you said there's been a huge turnover and so forth

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
So

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
American Ninja Warrior may not have

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
A place on GQ

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That actually was a pretty good show

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
There's nothing to say about this

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It's probably going to get a new name

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That's the other reason that makes this a big deal

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Is because G4 will probably become something

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I can tell you right now American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So I'm sure that won't be gone for long

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
So there you go

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
We'll talk a little more about this story in Part B

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
With our FUGO Question of the Week

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
But for now

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Let's take a trip down memory lane

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
For a moment shall we?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
With a segment we call

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
The Classic Game of the Week

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Where DarkSakura steps into the classic

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Gaming vault

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Moves Shirmi aside

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Blows the dust off the cabinet

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Shirmi's probably still sitting in her older box

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Pulls out a game that she says

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Hey! Play this game this week

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You ungrateful little brat

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
This comes from a time before there was

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Ultra Limited Collector

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Mega Edition for Special

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Week, whatever it is

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Midnight Special Edition

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
That sounds kinky

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Doesn't it? A little bit?

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Well this game is not so kinky

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
But this is a game I looked at it and I went really?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
In 200 episodes plus

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Of this segment she has not done this game?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I checked

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Well it's about fucking time this week DarkSakura

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Blaster Master

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
In Japan it was called

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Chōwakusei Senki Meta Fight

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Which translates to

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Planetary War Record Meta Fight

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Which honestly is a really

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Freaking cool name

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It came out in the US in

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
November 1988 and in Europe

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
On April 25th, 1991

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah they had to wait a long ass time to get this

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
We just had to wait a few months after Japan

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But yeah

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
This game went from having

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
A killer story in Japan

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
To having the dumbest

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Story ever in the US

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I mean that doesn't affect how awesome

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
The game itself was

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Ok get this

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
The Japanese version you're like

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
An explorer landing on Sophia III

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
The planet

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
And you have to

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Explore where this ancient civilization was

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And stop this evil emperor

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And go through the whole planet

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Dan shut up

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Hold on I'm getting Dan to comment

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
No seriously man

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
It's a game where you drive a tank to save a frog

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
In the US one

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Jamie never played Blaster Master

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
She doesn't know nothing about Blaster Master

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I'm gonna tell you about Blaster Master

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Blaster Master is awesome

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
First of all it's by Sunsoft

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So you know that the music is super

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Choice for the NES

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Second of all it's tough as fucking nails

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The game is really

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Really hard even for a NES game

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I mean it is Nintendo hard

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And there's no save function

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Which is pretty brutal cause it's not a

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Short game and you upgrade the tank

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And when you die

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And the tank is called Sophia in the NES version

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Sophia III which I always thought was really

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Kind of weird but it's cute in a way

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And you can make it fly

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
You can drive on walls

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
You can jump out of the tank

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And your little dude runs around

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Or you can go into like caves and you run around

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Independently of the character

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Who's named Jason and the tank

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Which once again is named Sophia

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Cause who fucking cares

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
The Japanese version

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
The Japanese version was a

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Failure

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
The Nintendo version is a classic

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Is it both Nintendo?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
No no no no

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
The NES version

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Whatever you completely didn't

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Listen to anything that I said

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Rob take the mic please

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
The Japanese version of an epic storyline

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
It was so wonderful

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
The Nintendo version you drive a tank

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
To save a frog

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It's awesome

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Saves your frog

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And you can use the pause trick and kill the bosses real easy

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It's amazing

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it and then they die

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Now to be fair we might have somebody who's like 14

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Listening to this program with their parents

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
For permission of course

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Jamie please

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Let's continue telling the listeners about

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Master Master

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Well as Dan said there is no save feature

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Whatever

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Shut up

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Jason and Sophia

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Have different power meters

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
So they can

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
They take

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Dan you're flustering her

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Let her get through the segment

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And then fluster her while we're on break

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I'm about to cut a bitch

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
At any rate

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You've got different power meters

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
You can power up separately

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
You get 5 continues which he didn't say

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And you can

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Restart the game at the same level

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
In which you lost all of your lives

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
You have a hover gauge that

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Controls how much thrust

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Is left in your tank

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I don't believe you brought up that the tank

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Flies

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
He did

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Oh my bad

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Are you the king

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Are you the king of blaster master

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I'm the blaster master

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
James is like

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I play blaster master

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
We can turn on the desk right now

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
We can actually turn on 2 nesses and we can have a blaster master

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Race and I will fuck her shit up

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
But if we played mass effect

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yeah that wouldn't even be a good race

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
She'd murder the shit out of me

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
If we cut us out

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Give me the mic

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
For other releases that came out

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
There was

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
A re-release on the playstation

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
For blaster master

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Itself

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Actually my apologies for meta fight

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And ripple island

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Came out on playstation in

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
The volume 4 of sunsoft memorial

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Series in 2002

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And then it came out on the Wii virtual console

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
On December 14th 2009

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And um

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
There was

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Meta fight was re-released for the

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Virtual console on June 29th

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
2010

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
There was blaster master overdrive

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
That um

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Honestly I didn't give a crap about

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So I'm not gonna talk about it

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Yeah

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I actually played the Wii

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Believe it or not I played the Wii remake

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It's it just didn't

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Have the charm of the original

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
For me like it just felt I remember the

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Controls bugged me like I seem to

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
It was a few years ago but I remember the controls

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Really bothered me that was an issue

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
That was released by victor ireland

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
From working design

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And rest in peace

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
New company Gaijin works

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Yeah Gaijin works There was also a sequel on the

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Genesis which was not

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Produced by the original creator which was not so

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Good there was kind of a pseudo

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Remake for the gameboy advance

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Called uh like enemy within

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Actually no it was for gameboy color

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Which was also not as good

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And there was a punishment from god

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Succo on the playstation called blaster master

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Blasting again

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So really there's only one good blaster master game

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
The whole reason why the story

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Was changed is because um

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
You have to give them credit

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Frogs are pretty awesome

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
They're slimy and stupid

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And they make you hallucinate

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Anyway they changed it because they didn't think

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
That the space exploration

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Would be popular in the US

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
That whole genre of anime

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Hadn't really made it over

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
And so they changed it to Jason and his

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Frog and used the name

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Of the planet Sophia the third

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
There was a portion

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Of the map in the fourth level

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
That did not map over

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
So actually you have to make this

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Huge jump

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Off a ladder suspended in mid air

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I'm not gonna say anymore

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Alright

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It's an amazing

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Game it's one of my favorite NES games

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Ever and the soundtrack we can't say

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Enough about the soundtrack I mean it's just

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Like I love the soundtrack it's amazing

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
So good alright

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So then that's it there it is your

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Classic game of the week actually

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Sophia the third made an appearance in

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
A flash game called Super Mario Brothers

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Crossover that we've talked about on the show

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Before how'd that kickstarter

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Go for them they

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Made it they made more than

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Initial I figured they would

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Good times

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Alright this game is hard

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
As hell

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Alright there it is blast I was just watching the

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
YouTube in the background remembering having a horrible

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Horrible nightmares of the game alright there it is

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I thought that that particular playthrough it was

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Because it was a non machine assisted speed run

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
That takes

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
That looked like the

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
You can kind of tell when it's an emulator

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And when it's that dirty connection

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
To the TV through an RCA cable like

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
You kind of tell the difference on YouTube and that was definitely

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
The TV being plugged in there so

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Blaster Master

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
We're gonna take a break here but don't go anywhere

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
We've got plenty more of show to come

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Yes there's more we're gonna talk

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
A little bit about the Ouya in part B

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Tonight as well as some Final Fantasy

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Collections and of course rapid fire news

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Your phone calls as well you want to

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Call in you want to get involved in

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Dan and Jamie's discussions here's your chance

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
During the uh skype line

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I don't want to be involved in our discussions

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
In part B tonight

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But first a break we'll be right

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
After this

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Welcome back everybody

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
To Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Live on September the 9th

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
2012 Dreamcast day

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
At vognetwork.com the voice of

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Geeks network we've had a pretty exciting show

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So far this tonight

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Dark Sakura I think they hugged it out

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
During the break yes we're good

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
More like I collapsed on him because I have

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
A headache aw I'm sorry

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It's okay and something

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
We didn't talk about during part A because we just had so

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Much other stuff going on with the bungee ferret tossing

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
And all that we're having Mexican night

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Where we've been eating burritos

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And quesadillas and you know

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Slinging guacamole sadly not

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Real Mexican food like

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Taco bell but much better because it's homemade

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
So kinda yeah

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
We went to the grocery store and got stuff

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
So there you go it's

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
That kind of night here at Orange Lounge Radio Studios

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Okay a couple quick announcements for you guys

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
First off Dark Sakura wants to say something

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And what did I have music for this?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Yes

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Last Saturday was my

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Advanced anniversary

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
We've been married for seven years

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Or was it seven thousand

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
He says at least

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
We've been okay

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
In January

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Coming up next year

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
We will have been together

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
For fifteen years but we've been married

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
For seven

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yes

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You are such a dork

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
What am I supposed to say?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
I don't know

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm leaving you

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Okay this is funny

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Because Rob's cutting his quesadilla with fingers

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
You use a pizza cutter

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Really?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Rob doesn't have a mic so you can't hear any of this

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Anyway

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So yeah

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Dan and I have been married for seven years

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Yay

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
The end

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I love your vision

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I did

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I went back to Alabama and got my clique-o-vision

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And brought it back

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And then I found someone at work

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That was selling a clique-o-vision

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I found them on the work message boards

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And told you about it

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
You are a liar

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
No I'm not

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
You are such a liar

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Definitely married for seven years

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Jamie and Dan

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Congratulations

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Couple quick things

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
We are just a couple weeks away

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
From episode four hundred and seventy-five

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Wait, one more thing

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
On September 2nd

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I converted

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I became Jewish

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I thought you had already had that

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
No, not this last one

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It meant two years past my conversion

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It was the anniversary

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And that's why you're not here next week

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Because Rosh Hashanah starts

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So Happy New Year all the Jews out there

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Understandable, have a good week off

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Hope you'll listen to the podcast during the week

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Maybe

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Anyhow, episode four seventy-five is coming up

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
We might have some surprises in store

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
So be sure you're here that night

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Mostly for the long-time OLR fans

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
There's something brewing

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Where you long-time OLR fans

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Are going to be like, what?

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
That's all I'm going to say

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Episode four seventy-five, be here

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Alright

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Because reasons

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Rapid Fire News

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Is up next

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
While I finish cutting my quesadilla

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Which, by the way, smells delicious

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
You take all the pictures you want

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Of my delicious quesadilla

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
From the work-provided quesadilla maker

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
That I won, thank you

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Picture with scissors

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
So there's a new free Vita game

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
That you can download

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It's called Treasure Park

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And basically it's a game that allows you

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
To create your own grid-based puzzles

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And with hidden objects and bombs and stuff

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And you can share them with your friends in the near app

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
That might be a reason

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
For me to play my Vita

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
That I haven't played

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah, I heard it was really short though

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
It is, but they have all the online level

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It's a good game

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Alright, fine

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And that pinball, that pinball, now that I haven't really played

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
But I hear it's good, I played it on Xbox

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
As well as the God of War

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
PS3 collections

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Those have been given

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
An update to allow for remote play

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
On the Vita

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
So now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
On the go, which is pretty sweet

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Of course

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Those include the first two God of War games

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Ego and Shadow of the Colossus

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So that's pretty sweet

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And last but not least

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Angry Birds is getting

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Yet another spinoff this time in the form

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Of Bad Piggies

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Where you're gonna take the

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Villains, I guess, of the game and play as them

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
In puzzle-like fashion

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I'm sure

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
September 27th

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
With other versions

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Windows Phone, Windows 8

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And PC

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Later on, I guess

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Oh, it doesn't sound very exciting

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
But I'm not a big Angry Birds fan

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Nah

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Of course

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Alright, um

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Metroid

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
On the Wii U

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Do I have your attention?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Alright, well here's the unfortunate part

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
It's just part of Nintendo Land

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Of the Battle.me prototype, if you ever saw that

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
During the trade shows

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
They showed this during the press conference

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah, but isn't this new?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
The screenshots and everything that are out now?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Not really

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I thought this was some new stuff, whatever

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So fine, what's old is new again

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I just got excited because it was Metroid

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Alright, how about this?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
This is something that's been going around for like five years

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And finally, finally

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Making its way this week

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Dark Tetsuya, listen up

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
La Mulana, finally

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
On WiiWare, September 20th

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Is the big day

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
This is a big sordid story here

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It was gonna come out, and then it wasn't

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Because they didn't think it would make money, da da da

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
They said it was gonna be cancelled

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Then the internet got mad, so here it is

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
There was a lot of QQ

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
The most complete archaeology action and exploration game

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Ever created

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So that Indiana Jones game

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I guess that can suck it

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Cause this is the most complete

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Archaeology action and exploration game

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Ever created, over 40 hours of play

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
No, for real

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
For like retro looking games, it looks awesome

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Because here, okay

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I gotta admit

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Cause I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
But the game blogs are saying

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
No

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Shit

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Is like saying the sun is gonna rise in the morning

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
That bears shit in the woods

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
That's what you call a safe bet

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And also what you call

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
A headline that will get people to go

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Oh my god, there's a Zelda game coming

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I need to repog this everywhere

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
So your site gets

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
You know, hits

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
It's all about the hits, folks

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Here's the thing though

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Why would it be 2014? Why not next year?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
They haven't announced one yet

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
They've already announced everything they've got coming

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So what's gonna be their big thing next year?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
They've gotta have something big, big, big next year

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Next year

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Well, unless it's a 3D Mario

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
A Donkey Kong poop throwing game

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Smash Brothers are thinking

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Remember in 2013

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Those Smash Brothers games always take forever

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I don't know

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Alright, that's all I got

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Dark Sakura

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Well, other news

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
We have a

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
A new trademark from Squeenix

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Called Circle of Mana

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So maybe it's gonna

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Be out in that series, who knows

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
The last one that came out was

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Heroes of Mana, which I didn't even bother

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
No news

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
No news yet on Circle of Evermore?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
No

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And then Ace Attorney 5

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Will be coming out

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Let me

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
See if there is a date on here

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Well, it doesn't say the date

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
But we're gonna be getting it here and

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
In Europe

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I saw some of the

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Pictures for it

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Who was that other girl that has the side ponytail?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
She looks awful

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And then

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Emma, I guess

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I don't know, I hate her pigtail

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And then

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Rhythm Thief

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Is supposed to be coming to the IOS

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
This winter

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
So this one is just gonna be

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
One player

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And I think should have leaderboard options

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
So that's it

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Sorry, my mouth is full

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Of quesadilla

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Rhythm Thief, I wanna play that though

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Okay

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I'm not stopping you

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I played the demo on 3DS, it was good

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
What is Dan playing over there? It sounds like a Mario game

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Is that Wario something something?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Mario 2

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I didn't even know that thing was charged

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That's amazing

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Facebook, Google, put them together

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
You get foogle

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And we ask a question every week

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And we read some of the answers

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I wanna reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That I don't read their answers

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
If I read all the answers, it would be a 5 hour show

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
So we picked some of the answers

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
To read from Google Plus and Facebook

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
About the question

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
The question ties into a story from part A

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Some changes

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Some time ago, we wanna ask you about video game television

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Do you think a dedicated

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Video game television station could work

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
In today's world?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
If you do, what kind of shows would you wanna see on it?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
If you don't think it would work, why not?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Entertainment on Google Plus starts

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
They tried it

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It was G4 in the beginning

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
The problem was that G4 could never draw a large audience

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
As measured by the Nielsen rating system

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
The system is a critically flawed system

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But it is the accepted system

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Unless Nielsen changes to actually measure online

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
In DVR

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Or until Nielsen is thrown out entirely

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
A cable network for gamers cannot survive for very long

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Interesting

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
You know what?

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I actually equivalent the Nielsen system

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
With using BMI to track health

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Both of them are inherently

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Flawed and useless

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Technus replied on Google Plus and said

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Long gone

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
So much, it was nuts

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I remember getting the channel as a preview channel

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And they would air the same old episodes that I saw

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
A few months ago

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Pretty well with finally cutting out the excess

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Of reruns and shows that nobody really watched

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
From both networks

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
And then they flushed it down the drain and so forth

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
He says at the end

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Though it's all about video on demand

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And IPTV services these days

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And I think that's where a video game network can thrive

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
So he thinks in the traditional sense

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It's done

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And Jim replies and says it would never work

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
The channel wouldn't be able to be very critical

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Of games or the industry in general

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Would have to come from

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Because he thinks that the conflict

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
It would never work

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I think there's some truth in that

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
They can be pretty mean sometimes

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Alright, going over to Facebook

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And checking out some of the answers on Facebook

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Which there's a lot

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And I'm never going to be able to get through some of these

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Another comment from Dark Charger

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
About IPTV becoming the norm

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Nutman says

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I think a video game channel could work

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
But TV executives need to step out of the way

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
G4, like many other TV endeavors

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Failed because guys in suits thought they knew

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Better than the people they hired

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Scott Rubin and others behind G4

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Were met with opposition on everything

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And eventually just gave up entirely

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Executives set it up for failure

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And then asked everybody why it failed

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So they need to get rid of the management

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Red the Haze says

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Nope, every now and then I remember

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Tech TV and G4 missed those channels

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
But then I remember we have the internet now

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Ronnie says yes it would work

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
There will always be the casual market

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
That doesn't know as much as we do on the internet

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
I imagine it would be extremely casual

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Tigerclaw says

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
The problem with having a cable network

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
To a certain demographic which is relatively

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Small to a mass audience

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Who needs a 24 hour cable network devoted to video games

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Looking at some of the other answers

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Degenerate Johnny says

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Especially with the YouTube channels and internet shows

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Being dedicated to video games

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I think that a cable network channel would not work for long

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So many of these e-shows and podcasts

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
To satisfy gamers of all ages

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Such features include up to date news

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
The latest reviews of games and DLC

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Etcetera

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
These features are all that the average video gamer requires

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
For something that could easily be accessed on the internet

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
In an entertaining fashion

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
We killed G4

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Degenerate Johnny

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Mike simply says

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Yes it would work

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how to, achievements

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Type shows

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Wicked says

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
With how diverse and expansive the internet is

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Gaming content that would be on a television network

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Is numerous

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
But too far and wide for some

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Would concentrate a lot of good shows

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Topics and games in one location

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
For easy digestion

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
As for what should be on the network

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
That simple

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Look at G4 Tech TV

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Both separate entities during the merger

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And name some various shows there

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It was easy to fill up the network with gaming

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Though a lot of it was tech

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
But also hey they knew the demographic

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And I think if done properly it could thrive again

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Just not as G4

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
God I hope not

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Lastly Pete Garuno says

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Charlie Brooker's Game Swipe

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Thank you to everybody who answered

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
How about you folks here in studio

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Would it work or is it done?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
It's done

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Well I mean really everyone said

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It goes back to what the other people said

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
The internet's taken over

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And besides that

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
On their TV than watch a show on their TV

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I mean me I don't even watch TV

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I download my shows on the internet

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And that's it

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
If there was a dedicated video game station

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Or station

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
A channel on TV I still wouldn't watch it

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I remember there used to be a show on G4

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
That just showed nothing but gameplay footage

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Like little five minute clips of gameplay footage

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
It was a way to like sample all the new games

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
It was interesting

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I have the internet for that

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I mean there's plenty of times when

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Like Dan said

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And look up

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
A particular path in a game that I want to do

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Or

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
He watches playthroughs of stuff

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
All the time

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It's really just

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I don't think that

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
It would have to be one or the other

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
If TV was the only way to get the information

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Then yeah then it would work

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But there's so many other outlets

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
That are so convenient

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And you don't have to wait for programming times

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Or wait for it to record

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It's there when you want it

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
The chatters jumped in

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Cinematech was the show I was thinking of

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Loki

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah it's going to be hard for them

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I think the problem would be

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
It's too niche for them to have enough

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Revenue

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Revenue dollars from ads and stuff

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
To warrant keeping the station

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It's just too

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Before going away where it's so generic

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Now that

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
You know it gets more viewers I guess

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
People like watching cops and stuff

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
At weird hours at night or they'll just shut

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Off the station for a few hours

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And run their infomercials that's what they do

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Like late at night

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
My answer is yes and no

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Because I think all

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Networks in a sense traditional TV

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And cable as we know it is all kind of

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
On a ticking clock here

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
And it's really about being able to evolve

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And I think you see a lot of it with tying

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Into the

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Xbox style content

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Even Comcast getting in on that

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And a lot more of that on demand style stuff

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Hulu, Netflix

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I think if a gaming company could kind of build

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Itself around that primary

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And be a cable network secondary

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
They'd be in a much better place

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Than say

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Somebody coming around and just trying to copy

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
G4

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It's going to be doomed

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Dan

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
It could have been doable

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I mean I don't know if it could still be doable

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Because again the money is hard but

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
The problem is that they never played it straight

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Like even the biggest names

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
You know when they had the video game shows

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
He was just such a fucking retard

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And you'd watch and just be like

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I don't want to be associated with this guy

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And then they had the girl

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Who wasn't really good looking

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Enough to be kind of eye candy

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
And people were just like

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Well they're not really talking to gamers

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
They're kind of

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Just doing their thing

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And I believe that they were gamers

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I believe that they cared about what they were doing

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I just never thought that they were good

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I don't think that they played it real

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I think that if there was a show

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I don't think there could be a network

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
But I think there could be a show

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
That did the trick

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You know if it played it real and not douchey

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I get what you're saying

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Felt like they were catered to 12 year old boys

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And it gets old

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Talk up to me not down to me

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Some folks in the chat

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
GDR dollar bill agreed with you

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
He said Sessler was a tool

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But fifth dream does not

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Sessler was pretty awesome

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
But Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Because that's all they really needed

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Is one show dedicated to video games

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
And the rest was pretty awesome

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
That's the network you need to copy

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
If you're going to try to copy a network

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Don't copy G4, copy tech TV

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Because that was awesome

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
That's a network I think that could have actually made it

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Give it a little bit more advertising

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Alright, well

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Go ahead, one last thought

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I just don't really understand why

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
TV is still big

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
When you've got the internet

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
What Dan watches is like one show on TV now

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
MasterChef

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
And then the rest

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And the rest of it we use

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
The internet, we have Hulu

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
We have everything else

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I'm really paying an insane amount for cable

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Cable is going to go

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And Dan likes MasterChef

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
It's kind of going the way of the landline telephone

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
A lot of people get rid of those too

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Alright, in the meantime

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Let's move on with gaming news

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Thank you again to the folks on Facebook and Google who answered

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Loki, let's start off with more gaming news

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Alright, let's talk a little bit about

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
GameStop

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
But let's also talk about Ouya

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
The GameStop of course is interested in

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Ouya since

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
As of recently they've been

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Interested in pretty much anything that runs Android

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
That they can turn around and

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Get people to pre-order or resell or something like that

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
And it says of course

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
We will be a part of any console launch

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
In the future

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
That's when they were asked about Ouya

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
We think Ouya is cool

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
It has open source components

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Everything we've read is great

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And of course they're used to

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Selling DLCs

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
So assuming that this is kind of like

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Steam or Xbox Live Arcade

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Or Playstation or something like that

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
They would probably have like

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Codes that could be redeemed for

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Apps and stuff on there

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
But at the same time

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I don't think you can go to

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
GameStop and buy

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
An app that's on the Android marketplace

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Or something like that or Google Play

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
You can't just go hey

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Dan no one can hear you when you don't have a mic

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It's just like

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
I don't know

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
I just don't know if people would really

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
They're kind of pointless

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
When it comes to

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Buying stuff online

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
That I can purchase online without having to

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Drive down to the store

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Aside from I'm trading in something

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
But that only works if you're trading in like a console game

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Because right now there's no trading on

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Digital games

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
So if really you're playing on a system

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Let's say you only own an OUYA

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
You're probably not going to be going down to them

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
For anything

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Except for maybe hardware and accessories

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Assuming you need like another

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
OUYA controller or something

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
If you didn't want to buy it online

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Well this is all kind of about

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Evolving to match what people want

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Because if OUYA is

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Going to be this big deal GameStop wants a piece of it

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Because

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
GameStop's another one of those companies

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Where as digital distribution becomes more and more

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
They're getting a little worried

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
And then another thing

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
There was a game that was on Kickstarter

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Mercenary Kings

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Of course they've surpassed their goal that they had

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
But now they're saying

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
They're going to be

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Putting it on the OUYA as well

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So right now they're

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Allowing anybody

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
That's ordered a digital copy of the game

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Which is $15 pledged

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
You'll get a copy of the

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Steam key and you'll get a copy of

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
The OUYA key which they believe that there's going to be

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
A key system for that

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
But in some way they'll try to

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Get it so that you can

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Play that and for those who are not aware

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Mercenary Kings is a game that's

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Kind of a cross between Metal Slug and

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Minecraft I guess

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
You craft things based on the

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Components that are dropped

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
By the enemies and it's also

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Animated by Paul Robinson who does

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Really kick ass

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
8 bit, 16 bit

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Animated gifs and he also did the

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Animation in the Scott

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So it is worth checking out

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I backed it

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I love Paul Robinson

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
That sounds like something

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
To check out

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
He's got an awesome animated gif with a dog with an eye patch

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And a robotic dog shooting

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Bullets and glowing dogs

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Nice

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Alright well moving in a different direction here

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Talking about MMOs for a little bit and a way

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
That you could make money off of MMOs

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Sony Online Entertainment

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Not to be totally confused

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
With Playstation 3 stuff because

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
The MMO business is a little

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Different, it's another arm of the company

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
You do see crossover once in a while like

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
What was that, Free Realms or something

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Is on Playstation 3

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
It's not worth your time but you might have heard

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
DC Universe

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
That's a big one, thank you

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
These are all big games

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
SOE is looking into

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Something where you the player

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Can create in game items

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And if Sony

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Online Entertainment adds them to the shop

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
You would get a kick back

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Once complete

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Players are encouraged to name and create a description

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
For the item, describe how the item would fit

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Into the perspective games ongoing narrative

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Storyline and submit it to SOE

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
For review and possible inclusion in the SOE

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Marketplace. If a player created

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Item is selected for inclusion in the

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Marketplace, SOE will share

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
40% of the net amount it receives

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
From the sale of the item with the player that created

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
The item. Now before you get too

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Excited or wonder how SOE would

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Not drown under these requests

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Keep in mind to create these items

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
You're gonna have to know how to do 3D

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Modeling. So if you don't know Maya

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Or 3DS Max you

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
May not exactly get to get on this

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Also you don't get to pick stats

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
That's something

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Sony gets to do

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
You can do the design

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
You can do the item and the lore behind it

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
But ultimately it will be up to

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Sony Online Entertainment

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Very interesting

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Sort of prospect but

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Maybe they're thinking word of mouth

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
To help these games succeed because let's say I have

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
An item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I'm likely to start advertising

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
For the game and tell all these people

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Hey go buy my item

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
And it kind of helps the game get more exposure

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And possibly generate

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
More sales which

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Sony gets a cut of

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Not unlike the iOS Marketplace or what have you

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
So

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
It's definitely a neat idea

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I think people

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Will probably use it

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
If they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
We'll see

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
There you go

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Next story Dark Sakura

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Sorry I had a little debate in the chat room

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Oh anything you want to share?

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Progress

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Why I think radio is going to go away

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And why TV

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Is going to go away

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yeah but not tomorrow

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
No I didn't say that at all but I'm saying that

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
It may not even happen in our lifetime

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
But this format isn't going to be around anymore

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
I gotta admit I really like radio though

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Obviously we're a

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Podcast so there's a radio element to it

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
But traditional radio

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Is in trouble because of things like us

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And satellite and so forth

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Yeah exactly

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
But in the car

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I find myself listening to a lot of radio

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And I do a lot of driving sometimes

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
So I think a lot of us do

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Like at work while they're doing

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Oh I feel sorry for them

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Some type of job

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I listen to BBC podcasts on history

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Yeah

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
So I think there is still a demand

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
For the audio only

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
It just might be the traditional radio

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I mean it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Where traditional TV is in trouble

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
No

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But eventually it is going to go away

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I can guarantee you that the TV set

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
That I owned when I was in high school

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Wouldn't work now

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
It doesn't have any HD input

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Almost all the stations

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Have gone to an HD format

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I've got video game systems

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
That we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Like that Odyssey that we have

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
We can't play it, we don't have anything it'll work on

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
You know

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
When was the last time you saw a video tape new?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
In a store?

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Been a while

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Where were you at, the thrift store?

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Radio Shack

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
That's Radio Shack, they're behind the times anyway

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
But the point is

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And keep in mind

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I'm in print media

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And really how long do you think print is going to be around

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Other than a specialty format

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Game Guru

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
In our chat room says

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Radio and TV won't disappear

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
You kinda can, it's getting really close

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Think of it this way

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
20 years ago

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
We got to the internet on dial up

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
20 years ago would have been 92

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Maybe we were at the stage where like

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
28.8K

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Dial up was kind of the big thing

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
About then

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
That was how we were connecting online and all that

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
So we progressed that much

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
From dial up modem 28.8K

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
To where we're at now

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
So think where we're going to be in 20 years

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I think that whole internet off an antenna

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Is right around the corner

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I was thinking about this earlier because

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
There was actually a Cracked article talking about

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Technology then and now

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Saying that like half of a level

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Of Angry Birds would not fit on

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
A duck hunt cartridge or something

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Stan says way less than that

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It's just a matter of progress

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It's going to change everything

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Doesn't exist today

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Well one of the reasons that they work

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
You know kind of cutting every

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Or making everybody go digital anyways

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
The whole switch over is

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
The analog frequencies and stuff

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
That are out there

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
You know that was 4 terrestrial broadcasts

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And stuff that's all up in the air now

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
So now they can use that for broadcasting

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Internet

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And Stan learn InDesign if you're going to do print media

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
You're crazy!

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Maybe this is a little too heavy

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
For our show

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
But what if

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Maybe there comes a time

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
I'm not even going into that territory

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
What if

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Well what if society rejected

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
That technology

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Like I'm not saying everybody goes Amish

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
But there are Amish people in the world

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
They have a phone

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Well not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Technology

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And they have a neighborhood computer

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Well that's kind of my point

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Is that what if society

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Doesn't want to keep going that direction

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Or do you think

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
It might happen

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
If war broke out over it

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
It might happen

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Nope, not even then

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Because if war broke out over it then that means that they

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Really want it

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
If war broke out over it it would be who controls it

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Too heavy for the show

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Because the people that wouldn't want it

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
They would just die eventually

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I do like what Tecna said about it not going away

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
It will evolve

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
That's more what I'm thinking of

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You're going to look

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Ten years down the line when we've all got

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Pocket broadband radios

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
We don't have

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Wireless FM radios

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
We don't use radio waves we're using

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Broadband signals

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Well technically a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Is a broadband radio

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
In my pocket

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
But I mean

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Older forms of

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
The same idea are going to fall by the wayside

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
That's what progress is

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
That's just how it happens

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Do you have a Victrola Rob?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Do you know what one is?

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
A hand cranked phonograph

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Not radio the record player

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
When was the last time you used a mimeograph?

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Just saying

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I want to see a DJ use those

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Good times

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Alright let's move on

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Dark Soccer don't skip your story

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
I just wanted to make a point

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That's all

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Anyway

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
It's gone from games on demand

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
It has been removed

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
They think they added it

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
On August 28th

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And on it's Japanese support site

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
They just said we're sorry for the inconvenience

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
The resumption of delivery is being addressed now

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Please wait for a while

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Yeah

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Nothing else they just said that we're looking into it

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Don't worry we'll receive this about the same time

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
We decide to release a patch for the

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Xbox 360 version of

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Silent Hill HD Collection

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Ever?

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
We'll just kind of file it back

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Or the next DDR game

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Just going to hope everyone forgets about it

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Well I mean if it did have a lot of problems

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Well at the end of the day how is it selling?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
If it was selling decent enough they'll find a reason to put it back on there

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
But if not

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Okay Stan your friend may have a Victrola

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
But tell me

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Does it use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
It's for the retro kitsch of it right?

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Yeah it's a kitsch collectors thing

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I would love to have a Victrola

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I still have albums

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I don't have anything to play it on

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I used to have this rocking, bitching record player

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
when I was like 5 years old that I could play

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Sesame Street records on and it would light

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
up like these really awesome red and green colors

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
in tone with the audio

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I would love to have that shit again

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
You know what I had? An 8 track player

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
You know what I don't care if I ever have again?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
An 8 track player

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I downloaded my

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
favorite song from my Muppets 8 track

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
It was Lydia the tattooed lady

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Just saying

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Not the rainbow connection?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
No it was Lydia the tattooed lady

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Someday we'll find it

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
This was in 1979

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
When did the Muppet movie come out?

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
The original one?

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Yeah

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So yeah I had a Muppet

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
show best of 8 track

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
It was yellow and I remember how

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
many times I had to fish the damn tape

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
out of the 8 track player and fix it

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Let's see

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
The Muppet movie was

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
1979

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
So it was right around the same time

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Unfortunately I would have been

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
1 year old when this movie came out

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I remember when I was a kid the big deal

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
was Sesame Street follow that

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
bird and that scarring

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
scene of the blue

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
big bird in the cage

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Oh my god just

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
kill me as a child

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
and then return to Oz

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Return to Oz was great

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80's

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Well it was closer to the books anyway but yeah

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Oh yes gaming news

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Hi Loki

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Well you know he did start off as a blue bird

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It was still

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
an homage

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
He was sad and it was hard to see

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Anyways let's talk about TV

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
and you know

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
there's a series of games

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
that were out on the PSP

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
called Invisibles

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
those will be coming out on the Vita

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
they're going to get a new game apparently

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
and it's going to be tied into a TV show

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
and it's going to have a section of the show

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
that's augmented reality

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
where basically you'll take your Vita

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
pointing at the screen and something fancy will happen

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
unlocking new content in your game

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Cool

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
I'm guessing

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
that it's probably going to be some sort of

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
AR code or QR code

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
or something like that

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
which will probably just

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
that interacted with the thing on TV

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
and all it was doing was kind of like a

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
light gun type technology it just could see

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
what was on the screen and light

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
does its little things accordingly

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
like and you think you're interacting with the movie

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
but you're really not

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Like the Action Max? Is that what it is?

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I can't remember the name of it, probably

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I had an Action Max. Did you really?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
My dad used to buy all sorts of weird game

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
consoles, we had an Action Max

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
That's where you got it from

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
It's like my dad doesn't understand why I like video

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
games and I'm like dude you've

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
bought the ColecoVision, you bought me

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
a TI computer, you bought

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
an Action Max at one point

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
you had the Atari adapter and stuff

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
and you can't figure out why I like

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
video games? I don't get it, I can't get the cats

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
to get into video games no matter how hard I try

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
The cats, they're just defiant and everything

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
My cat used to sit on top

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
of my Nintendo. Have you tried the iPad game?

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
It was warm. I haven't because I'm

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
freaked out about the scratching thing

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
They can't scratch the screen

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Everybody says that, but I don't believe it

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Cut their claws! No! Why?

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
No, it's like cutting their little

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
No, it's not like

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
No, I'm not declawing them

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Trim their damn nails, you're supposed to

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
That's part of cat care

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
That's, probably Alan does

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Because they're Alan's cats is the point I was getting at

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
See that's what I do when my cat's being an asshole, I just cut her claws

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
and go ahead and scratch me

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Because you have no fucking claws

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Well, Shermie gets ingrown claws

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
But anyways, yeah, so

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
cut their claws

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
glass. My cat used to

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
paw at the TV, like my LCD

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
TV all the time, and if that

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
thing's not scratched up already by them, then

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
it's no big deal

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I like what Infinal says in the chatroom

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Put little gloves on their paws

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Mitten mittens

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
It's your cat being too loud?

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
You should get the little cat claw

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
cappers that look like nail polish

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Those things are awful

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Again, not my cats

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
not my decision to make

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Really?

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
it's cool

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
My struggles with cats goes back to

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Oh, that's the freaking

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Play it, play it, play it. No, that's not the actual commercial

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
That's the promo for the episode

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I think it's this one

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
My struggle? No

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Not that one

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Great radio

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Great radio right here

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I saw it, I saw it

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Donor and cat

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
enthusiast

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Is your cat making too much

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
noise all the time?

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Is your cat constantly stomping

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
around, driving you

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
crazy?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Is your cat clawing

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
at your furniture?

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Think there's no answer?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
You're so stupid

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
There is

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Kitten Mittens

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Finally, there's a

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:11.000
chance to get comfortable mitten for cats

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I couldn't hear anything

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Is your cat one legged?

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Is your cat fat, skinny, or an

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
in between? That doesn't matter

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Cause one size fits all

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Kitten Mittens, you'll be smitten

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
So come on down to Patty's Pub

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
We're the home of the

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
original Kitten Mittens

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Meow

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
The hell was that?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
That's awesome

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
An amazing fucking television show

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Which is why you should

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
watch your TV once in a while cause that show is

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
fucking hilarious

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
The official dick tell

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Okay

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Shermie would just shit

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
That's all she'd do

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
My favorite is

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
when the cat's walking across the table

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Like, surely

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
PETA called in on that cause I was

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
borderline inhumane

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Serious face

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Back to gaming news

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Oh yes, it's my turn

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Final Fantasy

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
There is no transition

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
You know, if you

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
have a lot of money

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
and you've bought a lot of Kitten Mittens

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Maybe have some more disposable income

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Say $450

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
You could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
It's coming out of Japan

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Every game in

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
the series up through Final Fantasy 13

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
in the Ultimate Compilation

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Does it have 11?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
It even has 11

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Does it have 14?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
No it does not

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Does it have Mystic Quest?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Will you shut up and let me talk about it?

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Just the numbered ones

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Is that Dirge of Cerberus?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Now I know how you felt when

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Dan kept interrupting you during the classic game of the week

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Hey Rob, Rob

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
What?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Final Fantasies 1 through 13

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
No 10-2s, no 13-2s

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Cause they're not gonna bother to port it somewhere new, sorry

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
PlayStation 2 version of 10

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
As well as 11

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And 12

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
And PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Oh yeah

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
So here's the bet

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Wait a second here

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
But the problem is though you're gonna need to have an old style PlayStation 2 for that to work

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I don't see a hard drive attached there too

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I know it is kind of a little bit like

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Won't work but whatever

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Or if you have an old ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I believe there's a way to do it

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I think they patched it in at one point

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Anyway, 35,000 yen

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
That's about 450 dollars

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
There will also be a commemorative DVD

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
An art collection

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
And a 2-disc soundtrack

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Cause there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
There just haven't

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
They need it to be another

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
There it is

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Something I probably won't be buying

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Just cause I have all the ones I won already

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I don't have 450

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But if I had 450 dollars

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I would pay to go to DragonCon or something

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
At this point

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Come on, seriously

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Get the Xbox 360 version

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Seriously, if you're gonna buy a console version right now

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
The 360 version is probably the way to go

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
But PC is pretty good

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Mailbag!

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
We haven't even done the mailbag yet

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
It's 8.30 and we haven't even done the mailbag

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Is the place to send us emails every week

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
There's the mailbag music

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
DarkSoccer dives in

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Picks her favorites, reads them now

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
This comes from

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Sam

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Hi Sam

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Hello OLR crew, I probably love the show

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
This one's missing

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I might love the show

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Do any of you think

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
The Wii U will become

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
The lead platform for development

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Since it will be released before the next PlayStation

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Xbox

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
No

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Look at what's happening now

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Let's look to the Dreamcast

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Possibly

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
On a couple games maybe

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
If there's gonna be some stuff that's coming out

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
During that time

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
I can see them

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Having slightly better looking games

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
But maybe I don't know if they're gonna necessarily be

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Developing for Wii U first and then porting over

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It's hard to say

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
It depends on when the next platforms are coming out

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Everyone assumes it's gonna be the end of next year

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
But it could be in a couple years

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
In which case, yeah you may have a few games there like that

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I am dying to see if there is gonna be a game

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
That is Wii U

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
And PS3, PS Vita

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Cause it could happen

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I'm dying to see if that happens

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
A third party could do it

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Or

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Xbox 360 and tablet

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Oh yeah that whole

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Thingy thing they said at E3

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Smart glass, we haven't heard anything on in a while

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
That's true

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
They should call it smart ass

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Okay, next email

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
This comes from Rababababa

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I was playing Rock Band Blitz

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
The night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
And up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I was thinking that

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Would be a great name to play with someone

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
But there's no multiplayer

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I just remembered the game I forgot to review

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Then I saw

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Then I saw

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Score War Mode

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
And I thought, surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Nope, it just matches you up with

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Any random guy 64

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
So no friends list competition either

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
It's just the leaderboards

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Like many games before it, the game is meant

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
For a social gaming crowd but it isolates you

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
From your friends, fantastic

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I think Rabababa found this

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Because after he sent the email

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
That's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Is there's a lot of enhanced

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Things that are through Facebook

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Which is good and it's bad

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And I'll leave it at that

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
And I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I have played an awful lot of it

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
The short answer, it's good

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
But

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Bless them at Harmonix

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
They're standing by their guns

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I just think there's some mistakes they made

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Um

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
But that's

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
No, I mean to be fair they make a lot of great games

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I do like Rock Band Blitz

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
But bless them for trying and sticking to it

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
That's all I'll say for now

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Okay

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
This last email is from Nasty Canasta

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Um

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Hi there OLR

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
If you recall back in the famously infamous

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Episode 469

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
I offered a PSN code

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
For a live listener to claim

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
However that meant grumpy Mr. Bobby Blackwolf

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Made a super duper offensive comment

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
That was along the lines of not

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Including podcast listeners in that giveaway

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Yeah Bobby Grumpwolf

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Well Mr. Blackwolf here is my response

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I left in the email a steam code

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
For depth of peril

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
An action RPG with some strategy elements

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
And random level generation

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I'll leave it to the OLR crew

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
To come up with a way to give this code

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Away to a lucky listener

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Also have fun dealing with the brony fandom

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Once again at the next Dragon Con Mr. Blackwolf

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
In addition

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
If Dark Sacra Sky or Loki is interested

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
I have one copy of hybrid RTS

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on steam

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Oooh

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
After you three fight to the death

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Dance battle or whatever it is you three do to decide

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
On things please add me on steam

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
To get the game I apologize for not having

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
A code the Nuclear Dawn

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Developers decided on gifting the

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Option for those who have purchased the game

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
As part of a promotion I promise

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
To keep things discreet and platonic no homo

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Maybe

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Alright

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
We'll make this very simple email us

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Tell us you want the code what's it for again?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Thank you by the way for the code

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
For depth of peril

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Depth of peril Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
And we'll give it away to one lucky listener

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
There you go

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
But that's just for not the live listeners

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
That was for podcast listeners

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Well you're not going to know if they're one or the other

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
So it really ends up being for everybody

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Well okay how about this

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
You can't email we won't take the emails

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Until after the podcast airs

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Blackwolf says

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
And there are furries and bronies all

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Over Dragon Con. Tara Strong was a guest

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I barely saw them

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Meaning they were all up on Tara

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Lastly

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
For Loki did you know there's an official

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Yeah but the problem is

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
I don't really care too much about Chip's Challenge

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I mean I cared about it back in the 90's

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
But now it's just like ehhh

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Okay so you said

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
There was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
In April and it's on Steam Greenlight

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Cool

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It's just yeah

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
You know what one I wish I did get in on it was Guncraft

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
But with guns and stuff that would have been pretty cool

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
That does sound kind of neat

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Okay that's it for emails

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Alright

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
We'll get to Twitter in a minute so your last chance

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
To get the tweets in Twitter.com slash O-L-R

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
But first it's time to get a little bit

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Angsty in a segment we call

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
F-U

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Um

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Fuck this dad headache I've had

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
For the last two days

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And I want my whatever it is

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
In my butt that's hurting

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
And no it's not like that it's one of the muscles

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Around my left hip has been really

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Killing me I would like for it to stop

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Done

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Um

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Thank you for

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
No one being on while I'm on Minecraft

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Like I'm on a lot

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
And there's no one there

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
This is the

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
First week you've been able to mention it on the podcast

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Well that's true yeah I mean literally I started

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
And then I F-U'd myself

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
For accidentally kicking Bobby off the server

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
A few times back

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
You did it on purpose I was just getting

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Revenge is yours I figured out

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Take that Bobby Grumple

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
I just figured out how to finally

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Do things on the server I mean

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I've never run a Minecraft server before so

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
It's a little tricky but now I figured it out

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Ignorance is no excuse

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
And

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And just for that an Enderman will be spawning

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
In my house later tonight

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I can make a lot of them

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
No I don't want that

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
They're actually really easy to kill

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
And they're afraid of water

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Oh so it's like signs

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Water damages them

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Alright

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
My F-U I also give an F-U to headaches

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Because I've been getting some killer ones lately

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
And it's no fun

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
F-U to kind of like stress

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Because I've taken on a lot of projects

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Over the next month it's already keeping me busy

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
And I'm starting to feel the pressures

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Of a lot of that stress

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
I would have done it if I didn't want to but

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
I'm kind of just nephewed to the fact that

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I haven't been hanging out

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Enough with people

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't see enough basically

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
So because I'm taking

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
A lot on it's a good thing because it's allowing

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Me to hang out with people I haven't hung out with in a while

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Or I'm hanging out with all new

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
But at the same time I'm starting to neglect those

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I hung out with before and I don't want to like

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
That up so F-U to there not being

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
48 hours in the day basically

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
And F-U to needing sleep

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Although sleep feels so good

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Dan do you have any F-U's

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
You want to give?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
He's busy playing game boy advance

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
He's lying out on the floor like a kid

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Playing the advance it is kind of funny

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
You gotta admit that

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
My husband is adorable

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I didn't go that far but alright

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Alright just a couple more stories

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
For you guys and then the Skype line at 1877

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Game O-L-R but first Loki

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
There's a little bit more information coming

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Out now about the whole

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Stardock lawsuit

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I think we talked about it a couple

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Weeks ago where

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Stardock was accusing one of their employees who

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Recently left the company of

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Ruining a game

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Because they claimed that she deleted

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Stuff for it and because of that

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
That's what made the game terrible not because

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Maybe the game was just terrible to begin with

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Not as good as they had hoped

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Well there's a little bit more being added

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
To that

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Apparently the cases

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Now that they're saying

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Alexandria

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Mazetta she had filed

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
A harassment

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Lawsuit for well sex over

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Harassment lawsuit against the

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Head of the company

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Before the whole

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
You know leaving the company thing

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Seeking I guess

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
$25,000

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
In damage or something

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And um

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I'm sorry unspecified damages

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
In excess of $25,000

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Um

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And she you know had

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Filed complaints at the EEOC

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
And claiming

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Basically that the

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Head of the

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Company had done a lot of lewd things

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Including you know linking to a

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Sexually explicit YouTube video

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Making comments like you know

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Oh you're not chosen to go to some place

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Because you're not

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Just because you're hot or you know asking

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Her to take a purity test question

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Thing that had you know sexual

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Taboo questions and stuff on there

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Stuff that's no one else's business then?

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
You know have you engaged in group sex

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I'd like to know that you know because I think

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I have a you know

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Good chance of the oral like it was

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Also I guess there were some witnesses

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
That said oh

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
He described to her he said

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Was it talking about the

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Employees and their breasts and bra sizes

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
And said that you know

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
She should attend a media tour because

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Her nipples look better on

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
TV

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Wow

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
But you know like any court case or anything

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
There's people on both sides and

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
You know she

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
You know her

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
People or

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Whatever you know made all those comments

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
That she of course

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Send him a message basically saying okay

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I don't want you to touch me

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Or any parts of my body not even jokingly

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I don't want you to make comments about

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
You know my boyfriend or future husband

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Or anything like that I don't want you to make sexually

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
You know charged jokes

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Yes

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Let's remind ourselves that email

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Should not have had to have been sent

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I mean never appropriate

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Praise this girl for having the amazing

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Self restraint

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
To be professional at this point about it

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
But despite whatever

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Other allegations are out there

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Fucking A

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Apparently he responded though

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
To this email

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Saying you know

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I don't recall item one

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
But I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I understand number two but I'll be more conscious

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
However number three is unacceptable

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
To me I am an inappropriate

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Sexist vulgar and embarrassing person

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
And I'm not inclined to change my behavior

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
If this is a problem for you

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
You'll need to find another job

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Again I'm not willing to adapt

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
My behavior to suit others

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
If you find my behavior

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Problematic I recommend finding another job

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I'm not some manager or co-worker of yours

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I own the company

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
It and your job here exists to suit

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
My purpose not vice versa

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
The company is an end to

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Or is not an end

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Unto itself

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Is a means to an end

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Which to further the objective of its shareholders

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
In this case me

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Yeah but there's still laws

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
That's a law

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
You can't get around that

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Even if you're a disgusting shit hole like

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
You know

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Sorry

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I mean

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
A man has no excuse

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
To ever act that way to another

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
To a woman or any human being

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Has no right to act that way towards another

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Person at all

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
And then of course he responded

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
You know the whole thing

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Basically to this

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Website quarter of three

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
You know saying

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Okay I'm going to go ahead and respond

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
To this, the incident happened back in 2010

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Myself and Alexandria and a few others

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Were at a pub

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Going to the

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
QT3 dinner

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
That Lloyd Case had

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Set up

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
And while there

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Alexandria got teased and got mad at the time

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I didn't realize she was so upset about it

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And blah blah blah

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Later she emailed me about the incident

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
And stuff like that, basically he plays it off

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Saying oh this stuff you know didn't happen

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Or wasn't as bad as

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Smoking mirrors, smoking mirrors

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And basically seeing this as retaliatory

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Or the charge that

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Basically the whole thing was insinuating

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
That the retaliatory

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
The legit retaliatory lawsuit

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Of her ruining their game

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
So

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
It's all going to come out

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
They're accusing her of deleting all this

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Stuff or whatever but it doesn't

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
It's one of those things where like you know

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
If the shoe fits, wear it

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Or if the shoe, whatever

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
My point is

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Her incredible professionalism

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
In that email and lack

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Of restraint

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Praise her for being able to show

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
That kind of restraint

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Doesn't match that of somebody who would

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Go in and delete everything

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It's kind of like you got this over here

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
And this over here, it doesn't line up

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
You know what I mean? How do we know?

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
And again I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
So I'm being a total couch

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Jury right now which is probably bad

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
But just throwing it out there

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
If that's the environment this person

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Created at this company where it's like

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
You deal with it because it's my company

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Or what have you

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
How do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Maybe somebody else chose not to take

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
The high road. Just throwing it out there

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Well also the thing too is like

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
They're talking about how she knew where

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
The files were and had access

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
To relevant Google Docs

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Why are you using Google Docs as like

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
A lot of businesses use Google Docs

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
It just seems very

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I've heard of that before

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school too

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
You'd seem like you'd have your own

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Intranet or something that you do that on

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Anyhow

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
The moral of the story is

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
People need to

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Not do this to

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Other people and I'm talking the whole

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Harassment thing in the first place

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
And that kind of bugs me

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
That in the response it's very

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Smoke and mirrors like

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Well there was teasing and da da da

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
But that doesn't give anybody the right to

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Here's what he's saying

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
There's no excuse for what happened

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
No he doesn't even

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
He doesn't even apologize

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Now you can argue that I was a jerk

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
And how I responded to her

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
But it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Quitting without notice and using her network access

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
To wipe out our marketing access

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
How dare this person

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Oh my god it's so infuriating

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
How dare you try to blame her

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
How dare you

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I'd love to see somebody do it to him

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
That is an attitude

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
That very very bad people have

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Since my self showing restraint

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Honestly

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
His behavior is a sign of

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Something fundamentally wrong with a person

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Like I'm talking about mentally ill

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
This shit in the industry

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Needs to stop because

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
It is making us all look bad

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Knock it off

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Thank you

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
This is fucking psychotic

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Behavior

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Well I don't even know

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
How to follow that up

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
How about a story about Mega Man

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Mega Man

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Mega person

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Capcom, you might be wondering

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Why hasn't there been a new Mega Man game

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Or what is with all this shit about Mega Man projects

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Getting cancelled and da da da da

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Well Senior Vice President of Capcom

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
USA, Christian Svensson

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Mentioned to members on Capcom

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Unity's forum that the problem is

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Mega Man had too many franchise

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Or excuse me, too many competing

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Sub series

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Quote, thanks for the suggestion

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I and probably I alone so please don't

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Describe said belief to Capcom

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Think one of the problems Mega Man has had

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
As a brand is that we've had too many

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Competing splinter sub brands within it

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I'm not sure starting yet another

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Is the way to get the franchise as a whole

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Back on track more than creating

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Greater brand confusion but will take it

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Under advisement

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
There's a bunch of shit right there because

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
The different series that they have were on different

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Platforms that they didn't have other Mega Man games

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Advance then you're playing Mega Man

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Power or something or other

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I don't remember what it was but um

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
It wasn't like oh hey you know we're gonna have

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Mega Man this and Mega Man that and

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
You know they're gonna compete against each other

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
I don't think they really had that it was just

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Different games especially nowadays

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
There are no Mega Man games

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Like that are super old anymore

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
You're not gonna be having people you know

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Oh hey I'm confused because I played this one on the

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Game Boy Advance or hey I'm confused because

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I played ZX on the DS or something

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Like that I mean those games came out years ago

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Except for

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
You know 9 and 10 those are pretty much

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
The last new Mega Man games that

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Came out Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Well yeah they kinda

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Let him go where he walked Ah that never stops people

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
In the industry Well I'm saying if he

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Was the I mean he was a big wig

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
If he was the one driving Mega Man

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Development and he's like okay I'm out

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
And everyone else is just like uh

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
What the fuck do we do? Let's just go

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And put that one away I

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Kinda think this and now granted

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I'm reading way too much into this but I kinda think

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
This points towards there's gonna be some

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Big reboot cause that's always

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
The fucking answer to every problem reboot

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Of the Mega Man franchise in the future

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
I bet you anything there's gonna be a new

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Mega Man game that's just Mega Man

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
And it's a reboot and there's

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Some new creative person at the helm

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And it's not Grin making it

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Yeah it's not it lends

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Itself perfectly to some type of reboot

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Whether that be on the next consoles or

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
You know maybe a 3DS game

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Probably no or a Vita game I think there

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Will be a Mega Man reboot

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Just Mega Man

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Speculation rampant whatever

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Fanboy wank call it what you want

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I just kinda think that's where all the signs point towards

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Especially with that type of rebuttal

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
There's too many franchises

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
So they're gonna bring it back to one

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
We'll see

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I bet it's a reboot

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Hey!

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Let's go to the skype line

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
1877 game OLR our username

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
On skype is orange lounge radio we've had a heck of a show

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
So far tonight let's see what you guys want to talk about

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
The skype line is open

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Again 1877 game OLR

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Our username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
I'm gonna get to the tweets here in a moment

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
But first let me ask Loki do you have any

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Last minute stories or dark soccer of course

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
If you have anything you want to throw out as well

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I'm still in the middle of being disgusted

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
There's some stupid stories you've probably heard all these before

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Where you know some teenager

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Drives cross country to meet her boyfriend

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
So this uh

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Girl Beth Robinson

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Who was 13 met somebody

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
On Xbox Live who was 12

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Actually 12 not necessarily a 4 year old

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Who came to be 12 and he lived in Houston

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
And she lives in Kentucky

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
And I guess she ended up chatting with him

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
And then eventually stole her brother's car

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Her mother's ATM card and then drove

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
To his house

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
And I guess she uh got as far as Nashville Tennessee

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Before being stopped by police

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
So

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
And of course we must blame

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Xbox Live for this not because

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Her parents are retarded

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Or you know

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
She's stupid for

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Driving across

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I have a belated F.U.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Um sure

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
To everyone taking a crap on

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Mass Effect Paragon Lost

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
So shut up

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I'll reserve judgement until the first step's out

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
But I'm not gonna hate on it just cause

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
It's Vega

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Vega was pretty cool

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Alright He's like the bro of the ship

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Shall I do some tweets? Sure

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
He's totally getting on with Cortez

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Again 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Orange Launch Radio

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
How might one acquire episode 169

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
From the encore last week

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
And recording it

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
But since you asked nicely Dark Tetsuya

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Uh talk to me offline and

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
We'll talk yeah

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Um

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Let's see another tweet from Salacious Pop

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I know who that is

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Who tweets something I forgot to mention

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Earlier on the show but it is definitely

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Uh important it's going on

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Rest in peace city of heroes

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
That's right

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Paragon Studios is closing

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Taking city of heroes with it

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
They cut down by the end of the year and they got blindsided

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
They did not know it was coming cause one day

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
There's a post about oh here's all the cool stuff coming

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
At the end of the year and then the next day it's like

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Bye

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
No firm date yet sent for the closure

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
But um that's kind of a

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Bummer I know Allen played a lot

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Of city of heroes he was into that game

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I did not really get

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Into it but I saw it and it was

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
It looked good

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
I guess maybe because

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I didn't play it as part of the reason it was closing

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I don't know

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
There's a lot of people like me

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Let's go to the phones, hi you're on orange songs radio who's this?

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I'm Zaku here

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Hey Zaku long time no talk what's up buddy

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Uh nothing much just

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Chilling on this uh sleepy sunday

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Yeah what's on your mind

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Just like finishing off like a little bit of Skyrim

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Not finishing the game

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
But just like finish playing some of it

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
You can never finish Skyrim

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
That's that's pretty much the story of my life

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Anyways um

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Zero to the knee

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Yeah that whole thing

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Um I'm looking right now through Kotaku

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
For a particular PAX

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Incident that happened

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Recently in uh in one of the

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
The Minecraft party

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Where basically this

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Apparently this pervert

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Exposed himself

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
More importantly actually

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Took the hand of a thumbnail

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
And actually placed it on his jump

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
And blogged

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I don't know if you heard this

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
This is like a big deal

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
For the past couple of days that I was

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
You know that I was uh catching up on

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Hold on

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I'm gonna say before I let him finish the story

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
If that last thing made you mad

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
This will set you on fire

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
This is so fucked up

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
This story go ahead Zaku

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Go ahead and tell us and

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Brace yourselves this is bad

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Okay let me see

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Uh it was in

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
The V.I.P. section

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
For Minecraft and

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
This blogger

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Long story short

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
She was in the V.I.P. section

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
When a guy right there

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
She was just minding her own business

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
And all of a sudden

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
A guy started off like showing her

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Showing her pictures of

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
You know of chicks

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Of girls that he actually took

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
You know of their breasts

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
This guy actually took pictures of women's

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Breasts throughout the party

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
So I mean at first it was a bit creepy

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
But then it got

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Then he really ratcheted up when

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
He basically exposed his penis

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
And he grabbed her

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
He grabbed her hand and placed it in his

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Right there in his crotch

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
With the penis exposed

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And she just like

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Freaked out in the sense that

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
You know she panicked later on

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
To the point where she was like

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Suffering from stress

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
She didn't even call like

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
The police or security

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Okay I'm gonna stop you there

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I'm gonna stop you there

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Cause there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
If you go to the source and read the original story

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Cause this is the part that infuriated me

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
She went to the security at the club

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
And she told her friends about what was going on

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Cause you can read this at the source

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
She talked to the security guards

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
And the security guards the answer was basically like

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Well what are we supposed to do about it

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
That infuriated me

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
This has nothing

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
The problem is at the end of the day

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
This really doesn't have anything to do with

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Video games or what have you

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
It gives

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Male gamers like myself a bad rep

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I mean I have a

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Girl gamer girlfriend of mine

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
She's an awesome gamer

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Just as hardcore as I am

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
But more but

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
The bottom line is that

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Every time any other like

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Woman would

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Picture a gamer or even look at me

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
As a gamer

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I don't want them to think that I'm some

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Perv that just like

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Flashes himself in front of everyone

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Because that adds like

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Negative connotations to the whole

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
To our whole culture

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
See

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I have to say this cause I'm thinking back to

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
My uh

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Before I hurt my ankle I used to

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Take a couple different

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Styles of martial arts

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
You punch him in the dick

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Seriously

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
But that would be assault

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
That would be assault

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
I do not

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
I don't condone that but I don't

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
If it's somebody you know

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Putting you in a situation

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Cause technically he grabbed her that could be assault

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Let us all agree

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
It's battery if you grab somebody

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Without I mean battery is like

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
If you like hurt them and they don't

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
You know if you touch them without necessarily

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Hurting them that is battery

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
He touched her first

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Yeah and it's sexual battery if it

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Here's the deal you guys are going into this crazy

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
What if whatever because obviously

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
In the moment hold on hold on

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
In the moment she didn't know

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
If security guards called the cops

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Then it would be his word it would be her word

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Against his and trying to sort out that mess

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Unless they have

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
There's no way they can press charges

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
They can get like

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
They can convict him

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Or at least you know put him behind

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Put him in cuffs

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
If there were actual witnesses

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
That can attest to her story

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Then she could easily press charges

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Otherwise a cop would just leave

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
So they're going to believe him over her

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
You're basically saying that they're all sexist

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
And they're going to take his word immediately

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
It's basically he said she said

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Even when he's got photos of people

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
From the post

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
He's got the photos on his phone

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Don't tell me there's not going to be

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Cameras at the club that could see what's going on

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
But the incident

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
It's at the heart of the matter where

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
He basically grabbed

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Her hand into his crotch

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Unless he has someone actually seeing

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
That then you can't

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
The cops can't really do anything

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
But there is other evidence

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
For stuff that is just like

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Substantial at best

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
That doesn't mean you ignore it

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
It was totally wrong

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
What the security guard did

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
If he did it to her

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
That's likely not the first time he's done this

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Probably in the same night

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
They would

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Separate everybody and question

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
All the witnesses

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I'm not talking about security guards

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I'm saying if the police were called in

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Yes

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
They would have to actually

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Step the party down

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
And detain everyone and investigate

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
So why are you defending them?

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I'm not trying to defend them

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
I'm just saying that given the circumstances

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
That it's really hard

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
It's kind of like a no win scenario

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
You either call the police

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
And see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
To arrest him

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
On that particular charge

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Or you do nothing

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And you basically

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Get chided for inaction

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Him grabbing her hand

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
If you don't

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Him grabbing her hand and putting it on his junk

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Is sexual assault, end of story

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Right, of course

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
But the security guard

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
He would still suffer consequences

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Regardless of his actions

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Even if he did call the police

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
As well he should

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Yeah of course

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
No doubt

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
There was not that much he could have done

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
No it's the victim's responsibility

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
If she wants to get the police to call the police

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
The security guard is there to maintain the security

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
In the club, he's not there to enforce the law

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
He's there to keep people alive

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
And to keep the business running

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
You know

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
He can only ask them to leave

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
And if he assaults

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
If the patron in question

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Assaults the security guard

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Then yeah he has a right to defend himself

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Other than that he can't really

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Physically detain them

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
He can only ask them to leave

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
And only after that point

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
If they resist

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
And they start being aggressive

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Then the guard has the right

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
To defend himself

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
The security guard is not a cop

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
But thank you very much for calling in

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
And sharing this unfortunate story with us

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Alright, take care

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Bye

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I just

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
I don't know

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
What does it say about our culture?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
I don't want to live on this planet anymore

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I don't

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
There are so many people

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
How much

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Can we all agree

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
How much of this fault is hers?

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Zero

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Zero

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
The behavior has to be addressed

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
The guy's a sociopath

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I just

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Something that went back and said

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
In the chat room is like

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
We have this environment here where they're telling women

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Oh well don't dress

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Provocatively you could get raped

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Or you know

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
You could get raped

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
It shouldn't be don't get raped

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
It should be don't rape

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Don't assault

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
To Zaku's credit

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
And in the interest of fairness

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I get where he's going

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
When you're innocent until proven guilty

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
But all I'm saying

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Is that an investigation

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Needed to be done

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
An investigation needed to be done

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
And I do think it's on the onus of the club

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
And the people that knew about it

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
To make sure that investigation

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Takes place

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
The job of the security guard

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Is to protect the interest of the club

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Protecting the interest of the club

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Also includes protecting the safety

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Of those who were there

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Yeah you're right in protecting the interest of the club

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Because if I were a game company or whatever

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
If I was Mojang I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
For any future event after this story

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Or nor would anybody

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
If I was the owner of the club I would have

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Basically ended my contract with that security firm

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And gotten one with a better reputation

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
But the victim needs to contact the authority

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
The victim does need to contact the authority

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
As Dan just said

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I hope

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I hope the internet

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Made her feel like she can do that

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I don't know what else to say

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
One thing that I think men need to understand

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Is that we still live in an environment

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Where women are basically still treated

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
As second class citizens

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
A man is

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Dan's saying that's bullshit but it happens

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
It's happened to me

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
You don't get it because you're a guy

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
And just because you see it in the pornos

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Where a woman catches sight of a penis

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
It doesn't happen in reality

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Guys don't see it

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
And you allow yourself to be treated second class

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
You believe that it's happening

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
That's why you feel like it's happening

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
No

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
That's exactly the problem

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Let's cut this shit off, we'll talk about this later

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
What was that last story

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
We just talked about then

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
It's happening

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
What was that last story in the game industry

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
I'm not even saying woman

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I'm saying person person

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
A person has

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
I said that in the last story too

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
What if it was a guy

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Whips it up from another guy

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Same story

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I would say the exact same thing

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Or a woman doing it to another woman

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
It's inappropriate

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Or a woman doing it to a guy

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Yeah absolutely

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Absolutely still inappropriate

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Just because

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Somebody doesn't tell

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Doesn't mean there wasn't a crime

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
That's not the point

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
The point is

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
No one can hear what you're saying

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Hold on

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
That's not the point

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
The point is she needs to stand up for herself

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
That's

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
How the citrus is going to get fixed

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
That's how the slimeball is going to get his fucking comeuppance

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
If he victimizes somebody

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
And that victim steps up

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
And fucking puts him down

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
There is a degree of

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Having to choose not to be a victim

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Which I don't understand why anyone would choose

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
To keep a victim's mentality

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
I don't think it's a choice

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
But you have to be able to go ahead

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
And say look

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
This happened to me

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I accepted this happened to me

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
And this is the action I'm going to take

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
To rectify that

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Okay

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
And also pointing and laughing at his penis

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Would have been funny too

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Pretty quick

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Yeah tiny penis

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
But again hindsight

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Is 20

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Hindsight is 20 20

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Hindsight is 20 20

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
You know it's easy to sit here and say

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I would have done this

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Someone should have done this

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
It's easy to sit here and do that

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
But when it's happening to you in that moment

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
You don't have that luxury

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
And that doesn't make what she did

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Wrong by any means

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
And we need to have a society that still

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Protects people

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
From having this happen to them

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Anyhow

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Let's move on

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Do we have a gaming story or something? Let me go to Twitter

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Because the tweets were sent in a long time ago

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
So we might have some gaming tweets

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Just saying

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Moving on

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Ossifer on Twitter

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
With Mass Effect content

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Ooh, Garris

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Ossifer says

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Just started Final Fantasy 13-2

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
And I freaked out a little

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
When I saw DLC for N7 armor

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
For the main characters

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
That's true

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
There was some really awesome DLC

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
In Final Fantasy 13-2 that incorporated the games

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I think so

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Let's see

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Other tweets

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
A couple from Tigerclaw

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
We do an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
On Twitter

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
At Twitter.com slash OLR

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
It's not loading for me right now

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
But I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
That basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
For Wii U

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
I don't think that necessarily means

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
They don't think they really have anything in the pipeline

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Beyond

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
I don't know, they just released

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Surely there's something we just don't know about

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
But nothing that they've announced

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
That have

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
You know, have yet to come out

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
I mean they have Dishonored coming out

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
But that's pretty much it

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
I guess if you count Zenimax

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
But aside from stuff beyond

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
2012

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
There really isn't anything that's been announced yet

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
So

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Yeah, I guess that's a true statement

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Alright, another tweet from Tigerclaw

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
About Double Fine

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
He links us to a clip on

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Gamasutra

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
This is not the big Kickstarter thing

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
It's a free-to-play superhero

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Management game called Middle Manager of Justice

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Okay, you have to admit

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
That's kind of funny

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Obviously, because it's on iOS

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Here's the thing, the game was not supposed to be out

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
For several weeks

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
So they pulled it from the iOS store

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
But a lot of people were able to download it anyway

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
So they're just considering it, eh, beta test

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
And you know what, they're owning up to it

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Which I think is very interesting

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
One of the folks here, Ki Chi

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Who is the project lead

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Yep, it was totally my fault

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
With the way you submit things on the app store

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
You have to specify what the release date is

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
And a while back we had set the date to September

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
But at the time, we didn't know if that would be final or not

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Once we submitted the game, we realized

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
We had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
But at the same time, we didn't want to remove it

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
From the submission process in case Apple catches

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Other things we need to take care of

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Is to do a double submission

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
So, at least they're trying to

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
You know, make lemonade out of lemons

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
On getting the stuff released early

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
That's it for Twitter tonight

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
One last call for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Although I can't fault people

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
For not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
If you, obviously

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
There's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Is a great place, you know

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
And those of you in the chat room

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
And so forth, we want everybody to be able to have

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Their say, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
If you would like to get your two cents in

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Of course there's always Facebook

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
And Twitter as well

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Google Plus and what have you

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Skype line ain't lighting up

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
I guess that means I'm gonna go ahead and close it

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
We'll try again next week

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
We did all last minute stories, do we have any more?

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Loki?

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Anything? I mean

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
This week will be interesting

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Yeah, this coming week is gonna be very interesting

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Between the iPhone 5 and the

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Possible iPad mini

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Nintendo

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
I don't know if we'll see that, but

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
What do you think of the new Kindles

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
That they have coming out?

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
I didn't really read up on them enough

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Because we already have a Kindle

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
I'm not really in the market for a new one

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
The other one that sounded interesting was

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
I'm not in the market for tablet at all

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
It's the

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
Kindle Fire HD

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
The one that has the 9 inch screen

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Or whatever

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
The 4G one has

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
A $50 a year data plan

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
250 megabytes a month

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Data

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
You get with that

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
For 50 bucks a year, that's not bad

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
If you're not using a ton of data

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
For me, I normally wouldn't use

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
That much data, but I do stream

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Pandora, so I've used up like

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
600-700 megabytes

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
This month, but

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
That's like the most I've ever

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Used

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
I don't know, it looked interesting

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
But, you know

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
We'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Being the same, you know, the $199

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
They did drop the original Kindle Fire down

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
The $160 though, to try to

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Undercut Google a little bit, but

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Can't you flash those or something?

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
You can flash any Android system

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Any of those can be jailbroken

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Yeah, my wife's Nook's

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Jailbroken

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
It's kind of fun, you can do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Oh yeah, like what?

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
The Nook, so I added

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
That with an optional bootloader

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
And stuff on there, and so she can do that

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Plus, if she wanted

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
To, she could pirate apps for it

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I didn't do that

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
But I mainly

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Went with Windows 4 to the other app store

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
And she's like, I don't want to get other apps

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Fine, I did that all for nothing then

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
So

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Alright

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
I guess that's it for

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Someone call, please

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
No, I shut the Skype line, it's done

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Oh, dang it, I want something happy

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Well, we're after 9 o'clock

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Dan's gonna take me to Pinkberry

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
That's a happy subject, Pinkberry's always a good thing

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
I was very sad though, they did not respond to our tweet

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
We celebrated the show by going shopping

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
For candles in the mall at Yankee Candle

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
And then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
And Dan had made some type of comment like

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
You're hanging out

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Yep

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Well

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
He didn't call, so I gotta put this out there

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Don't know if he's listening

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
But if he is, Ronma, stay black

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
I think

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
He just joined us not that long ago, so there you go

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I was just talking to him in private message, so

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
About private things

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I know, right

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Dan, thank you very much for being here tonight

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
And bringing your always controversial opinions

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
I mean that in a great way

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
To the program, and best of all, the fights

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
We all love it

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
You don't fight

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Dan, do you have any last words for our listeners tonight? Final thoughts?

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Stay black, everyone

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Will do

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
DarkSakura, you're his wife, why don't you go next?

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Your final thought tonight

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Fuck bitches

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
I'm kidding

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Because dudes can be bitches too

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
You know what?

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Sociopaths need to be locked up, end of story

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
My final thought is

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
I wanna thank Alan

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
For getting me Clue on Blu-ray

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Because it's about time I have such an amazing movie

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
On Blu-ray

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980's

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
You're doing yourself a disservice

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
They rerun it on TV all the time

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
And it's a cult classic

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Please, there are ladies present

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Go play Minecraft

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Buy it for me

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Join the VoG server

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
See, here's the thing

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Technically I could set up the server in a way that you don't need to buy it

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
But

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
There is a way

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Through a website called Mine Shafter

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
We wanna support Mojang

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
But there is a way through Mine Shafter

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
It's www.mineshafter.com

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Where you can

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Basically log in with that

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Instead of

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
It's a patched

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Proxy server or something like that

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
You run

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
The client through

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Cracked servers are

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Where they have the mode online toggled to false

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Instead of true

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I have mine on true right now

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
However, yesterday when their authentication server went down

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I had it toggled to false

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
So I could log in still

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
And authenticate it

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Technically there's some security holes if you leave it to false

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
People can spoof stuff

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
But being that we're a close-knit group

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
I could

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Set it to false

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
But I'm gonna stick with the true right now

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Alright

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
We wanna thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
And showing us your support

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
We are an indie podcast

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
We don't have a giant website

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Or commercial backing or what have you

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
So all we have is word of mouth

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Please tell people about the show

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
And you know what, spread the word of other indie podcasts

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
You know, at vognetwork.com

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
There's a lot of great indie podcasts

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
And there's a lot of great indie podcasts all over the internet

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Help spread the word guys, it's all we got

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Hey Rob

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
We want oral love

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
A-U-R-A-L right?

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
No, oral with mouth

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Right, alright, whatever

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Spread the love

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
That's something I can get behind

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
In front of

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
We'll talk to you guys next week

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Thank you guys for staying up late with us

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
And participating with the show

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
We'll see you next time

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Big week next week with the Nintendo Conference

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Be ready for it

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I'm sure Loki's gonna have a lot to say

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
I'm ready to be underwhelmed

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Is your body ready?

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Oh my body's ready

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
What time is it at?

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Is it in the morning?

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Another live blog

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
I can't wait

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
What the hell is this shit?

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
We need to talk to Bobby real quick

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
And see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
There's all these live streaming

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Live blogging software things

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
I'm at work at that time

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
So we'll see

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Excuse me

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
So your body is ready for the press conference

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
My body's ready for disappointment

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Seriously

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
And the iOS conference as well

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
The iPhone and the iPad is gaming

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
So I'm curious to see what the next thing is

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
So we'll see them next week

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Have a good week everybody

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Are they gonna call it the new iPad or the new iPod

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Or the new iPhone

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Because that would be hilarious

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Lastly

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Oh my god

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Act Def reminded us

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
We didn't even talk about it

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
You finally dressed as Tingle

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Because it was like a week ago at this point

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Tell us about the Tingle thing

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
I finally won that contest

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
The retweet thing

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
So she drew me as Tingle

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
That's the closest you're gonna get

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
And they did hit their goal

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:18.000
So Evilot is gonna get their orchestra soundtrack now

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
So that's pretty awesome

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
But yeah

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
She's awesome

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Beatrix is awesome

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
And she drew a wonderful picture of me

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
My wife said

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
I drew a picture of Josh

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
I'm like crap

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
But you know whatever

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Nah the one he used funnier

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
You know what first of all how old is your son now 2

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
He'll look different

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
He wouldn't appreciate it

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Like for 5 seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Make it your twitter picture or something so we can see it

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Alright
