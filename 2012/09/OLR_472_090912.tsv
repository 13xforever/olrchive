55000	58000	I was gonna say it's a little early for my birthday
58000	60000	We're almost to your birthday though
60000	64000	That's right, you've got, your birthday's just two days away, Techmaster Loki
64000	67000	We've gone and screwed up the intro, everything is all amiss
67000	68000	Sorry, I can't talk yet
68000	69000	That's alright
69000	70000	I've been shunned
70000	72000	You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki
72000	75000	Please say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki, joining us tonight
75000	77000	Hi, you can introduce Jamie first
77000	80000	I've decided to do things different tonight
80000	81000	Differently
81000	86000	Also say hello to Grammar Master Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
86000	88000	She'll cut a bitch
88000	89000	I will cut a bitch
89000	91000	I don't even care
91000	92000	How are you doing?
92000	95000	Um, yeah
95000	96000	Okay, great
96000	99000	We are live of course at The Voice of Geeks Network
99000	103000	VoGnetwork.com where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific
103000	106000	9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
106000	108000	I gotta say, props to Bobby
108000	112000	I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like
112000	114000	6, 7 years now
114000	117000	Had our shows back to back, he had an A plus show tonight
117000	119000	He had an interview with Gearbox Software
119000	124000	And some of the guys over there, it addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy
124000	128000	And then Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place
128000	130000	Must listen episode, loved it
130000	134000	So check that out at VoGnetwork.com, it'll be posted later tonight
134000	135000	I love when Bobby rants
135000	140000	But hopefully you'll listen to our show, I know usually he's so nice and inviting
140000	142000	And you know, oh we're gonna have the listeners on the show
142000	144000	And he doesn't get angry very often, but that was
144000	147000	I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley
149000	150000	Bang bang
150000	151000	A little bit, a little bit, alright
151000	155000	He needs more flannel vests in order to hold out
155000	158000	He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers
158000	164000	Well look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview
164000	166000	With the game developer this week
166000	170000	But we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio
170000	172000	The O.L. Army have been asking for for quite some time
172000	177000	We have the return surprise of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio
177000	180000	Say hello everybody to Dan
180000	182000	Dan is back tonight
182000	183000	Yo, what up?
183000	184000	How you doing Dan?
184000	185000	I'm doing good
185000	188000	For those who don't know Dan, I'm sorry
188000	191000	For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky
191000	194000	Dan is Dark Soccer's husband
194000	195000	Yes
195000	196000	Or me
196000	197000	It's gonna be one of those
197000	198000	Shut up
198000	201000	See, it's gonna be one of those shows tonight
201000	204000	They are just gonna fight all night long, good times
204000	205000	Just like any other day
205000	207000	Dan, since, how long has it been since you've been on the show?
207000	209000	It's been a good at least six months, right?
209000	210000	I don't know, it's been a while
210000	213000	Alright, well I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners
213000	215000	Between, you know, six months ago and now
215000	217000	So tell us a little bit about your gaming history
217000	219000	Why do you love video games?
219000	221000	And I know you love video games, don't even try to lie
221000	223000	I like to keep it special
223000	225000	Just show up once in a while, you know at random
225000	227000	Nobody knows when I'm coming
227000	228000	But the games, the games
228000	229000	I'm like a ninja
229000	231000	Why do you like video games?
231000	232000	I don't know
232000	234000	He's really having to think about this one
234000	235000	They've just always been there
235000	237000	Video games have always been there?
237000	238000	Yeah
238000	239000	Even when Jamie's yelling at you?
239000	241000	You can turn to video games?
241000	243000	No, no, I mean like, in the past
243000	245000	That's kinda how we met, kinda
245000	247000	That and anime
247000	251000	Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fan fiction
251000	253000	Kind of more anime
253000	257000	So, what is your favorite video game of all time?
257000	259000	I always like to ask guests on the show this
259000	261000	It's a tough question
261000	263000	It's supposed to be a tough question
263000	265000	Symphony of the Night
265000	268000	That's a damn good game
268000	270000	Metal Gear Solid
270000	273000	You can go back a little bit further
273000	275000	There's a couple other good ones
275000	277000	Gunstar Heroes
277000	278000	How do you feel about that?
278000	280000	I like Gunstar Heroes a lot
280000	282000	Now, we were off last week
282000	283000	Strider
283000	284000	We didn't have a show last week
284000	286000	I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day
286000	288000	At the various conventions going on everywhere
288000	289000	What have you
289000	290000	So we were gone last week
290000	292000	So we missed some of last week's news
292000	294000	You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan
294000	296000	How do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?
296000	298000	I'm feeling pretty good
298000	300000	I was watching the trailer and I'm just like
300000	302000	Oh my god, it's so long
302000	303000	He changed his wallpaper
303000	305000	They keep introducing all these people
305000	307000	Okay, okay, whatever
307000	308000	Hey, it's Solid Snake
308000	309000	Well, Naked Snake
309000	310000	Hey, it's Snake
310000	311000	Awesome
311000	312000	He changed his wallpaper
312000	314000	Yeah, I put my snake wallpaper back up
314000	316000	Or the big boss wallpaper
316000	317000	Yeah
317000	320000	Because big boss is a fucking gangster
322000	324000	Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her
324000	325000	No, it doesn't
325000	327000	It's like this big intense face
327000	328000	He's like looking out of the screen like
328000	331000	I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error
331000	333000	Blue Screen of Death that you had before
333000	335000	That one is awesome
335000	336000	That's old
336000	337000	Yeah, but it's awesome
337000	338000	But it's old
338000	339000	But it's awesome
339000	341000	My wallpaper is far better than yours, thank you
341000	342000	I don't care
342000	345000	So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced
345000	346000	While we were off on break
346000	349000	Was Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns
351000	352000	No, no, no
352000	355000	It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII
355000	357000	Excuse me!
357000	359000	Excuse me!
359000	361000	How dare I?
361000	362000	No, that's not worth it
362000	364000	It's Final Fantasy XIII III
364000	365000	Let's be real
365000	366000	That's what it is
366000	368000	But it's one of those weird Square Enix games
368000	369000	Where they're like
369000	370000	Hey, you know what?
370000	372000	We're gonna put that subtitle first
372000	373000	It's not gonna be a sub anymore
373000	375000	It is a title
375000	377000	Final Fantasy will take the back end
377000	380000	We'll just step down for a second
380000	383000	Guess we'll take the back end this time
383000	384000	We're giving them the money shot
384000	386000	Lightning's gonna explore the back door
386000	388000	Like to savor the last shot before
388000	389000	Popping the heat sink
389000	390000	Alright
390000	392000	We're gonna start off the show tonight
392000	394000	We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit
394000	395000	But I have a little bit something
395000	396000	I have something special to get into
396000	398000	At the top of the show tonight here
398000	400000	I'm gonna play something for you guys
400000	402000	And unfortunately you only get to see the audio
402000	404000	Or you only get to hear the audio of this
404000	405000	Cause it is a podcast
405000	408000	But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes
408000	411000	I'm gonna give you guys the premiere
411000	413000	Of the new Xbox One
413000	415000	And the new Xbox One
415000	419000	And the premiere of the new Xbox Live indie game
419000	421000	Bungee Ferret Tossing
421000	423000	It is coming out very soon
423000	425000	In fact the designer is gonna be on the line with us
425000	427000	In just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys
427000	428000	To talk a little more about this game
428000	431000	And yes it is an OLR inspired game
431000	434000	You might remember we used to come up with these little
434000	436000	Dream games, things we wanted to see
436000	439000	Like what was the one we had the what-they-play.com snap
439000	441000	Which was the, it's like Pokemon Snap
441000	443000	But it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head
443000	444000	Shouting fuck
444000	446000	It's like a really old reference to a news article
446000	447000	From like 2008
447000	449000	Like right now you probably just think that's insanity
449000	450000	And it is, that's a fun thing
450000	451000	But
451000	452000	What on the show is this saying
452000	454000	I don't even remember what inspired it
454000	456000	But we added the game
456000	458000	Bungee Ferret Tossing to the list
458000	460000	And Aaron went
460000	462000	And he actually made a game
462000	463000	Called Bungee Ferret Tossing
463000	465000	And it looks awesome
465000	467000	Here's the debut trailer
467000	469000	Here on Orange Lounge Radio
469000	471000	Do you love flying a helicopter?
471000	472000	Yeah!
472000	474000	Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?
474000	475000	Yeah!
475000	477000	Do you love blowing stuff up?
477000	478000	Yeah!
478000	480000	Do you love terrorists?
480000	481000	Awkward
481000	483000	Do you love blowing up terrorists?
483000	484000	Yeah!
484000	486000	Do you love flying a helicopter
486000	487000	Swinging from a bungee cord
487000	490000	And blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?
490000	491000	What?
491000	492000	Because that's what you do in
492000	494000	Bungee Ferret Tossing
494000	495000	That's right
495000	497000	Bungee Ferret Tossing
497000	500000	The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona
500000	502000	Which is good because now there's something in Arizona
502000	505000	But it's bad because it's a terrorist base
505000	508000	So armed only with the most advanced ferret weapons technology
508000	510000	You must attempt to storm their desert base
510000	512000	They'll come at you with guns
512000	513000	Rockets
513000	515000	High powered rifles
515000	516000	Higher engines
516000	518000	And even insane laughter
520000	523000	But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets
523000	525000	Proximity ferrets
525000	526000	Homing ferrets
526000	528000	And even cluster ferrets
528000	529000	Will it be enough?
529000	532000	Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games
532000	535000	Bungee Ferret Tossing also features two player co-op
535000	536000	Free difficulty modes
536000	539000	Full of survival and time attack modes
539000	540000	And a great soundtrack
540000	542000	Intense action
542000	543000	Bullet dodging grills
543000	547000	And the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else
549000	551000	That's Bungee Ferret Tossing
551000	553000	On Xbox Live Indie Games
553000	560000	Love, love, love, yyrgames.com for more information on that
560000	561000	What do you think DarkSakura?
561000	562000	I am pleased
562000	564000	I think that might have been your idea
564000	566000	Are you happy with how that turned out?
566000	567000	Quite
567000	568000	And I named the dude, the last name
568000	569000	That's right
569000	571000	I forgot what I named him
571000	573000	Let's get Erin or YYR on the line right now
573000	575000	To talk a little more about Bungee Ferret Tossing
575000	577000	And you guys are probably thinking there at home
577000	579000	Like, God, Orange Laundry
579000	581000	You're really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top
581000	583000	Yes we are
583000	584000	Fuck yes we are
584000	586000	Heck I'm thinking that, I'm at the show
586000	590000	When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas
590000	591000	Hey Erin, you there?
593000	594000	I mean, yes, yes I am
594000	596000	Can I just start by saying
596000	597000	I love you man
599000	601000	I love you man, seriously
601000	602000	I love you guys too
602000	605000	You're making our dream come true and I love it
607000	610000	I figured I'd take the ball and run with it
610000	612000	I mean, it sat on my plate for a while
612000	615000	But hey, you guys told me to get on that
615000	618000	And so, eventually, I did
620000	622000	Well we are happy that you did
622000	624000	So how long of a process did it take to grow
624000	626000	Well actually, let me back up a little bit
626000	629000	Because Bungee Ferret Tossing, it's almost done, right?
629000	632000	Like, we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?
632000	637000	The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now
637000	641000	Where other game creators basically try it out
641000	642000	Make sure it doesn't crash
642000	644000	Make sure there's nothing objectionable
644000	648000	Make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially
648000	651000	And, you know, other things are accurate
651000	655000	And then, you know, once they find that there's nothing wrong with it
655000	656000	They pass it
656000	658000	And once enough people pass it, it's approved
658000	661000	And then once it's approved, I click a button and it's out
661000	666000	So, I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend
666000	669000	Let me tell you something, there is some stuff up there right now
669000	672000	I would not wish on any of you
672000	675000	I play the game so you don't have to, yes
675000	680000	But, yes, it's actually, I just checked before the show
680000	683000	And it is 75% of the way through review
683000	685000	And it's only been up there since Friday night
685000	691000	So, this is going to happen very soon
691000	694000	I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days
694000	695000	That's all I'm saying
695000	701000	Oh, well, I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it
701000	706000	And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card
706000	710000	I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with
710000	713000	So, I'm just basically going to email everybody and be like
713000	717000	Hey, guess what's happening, like, right now, this game, it's coming out
717000	719000	Here's the trailer, here's a press kit
719000	720000	Do you want a review code?
720000	723000	And I'd like to do that before the game comes out
723000	726000	So, basically, it means I'll probably be doing this, like, pretty soon
726000	728000	Alright, I understand, yeah
728000	730000	Yeah, then I'm going to push the button
730000	733000	I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest
733000	737000	I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway
737000	739000	And, actually, this is kind of interesting
739000	743000	Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?
743000	749000	I have, this is kind of the answer to the Summer Games Arcade
749000	753000	And all the winter, like, all the other promotions they do for the big boy games
753000	755000	From the big companies, right?
755000	760000	Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow
760000	764000	And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising
764000	768000	Is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe
768000	771000	So, I'm going to be right there with them
771000	773000	So, that's actually kind of exciting
773000	776000	Because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way
776000	780000	And also the fact that it's a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing
780000	783000	Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat, because this is too good
783000	787000	And, by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room
787000	789000	live.vognetwork.com
789000	793000	Now, we understand that Bungee Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter
793000	797000	But we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity
797000	800000	Will there be nudity in Bungee Ferret Tossing?
800000	803000	Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere
803000	806000	And, of course, it's very fake and cartoony looking
806000	810000	No, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity
810000	815000	And, by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment
815000	818000	But it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once
818000	819000	That's alright, I'll tell you what you need to know
819000	822000	Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel
822000	824000	I mean, I'll tell you something
824000	829000	I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous
829000	832000	In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes
832000	835000	Amazing, well, let's put boobs on the list
835000	838000	No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry
838000	840000	I have to draw a line somewhere
840000	843000	I want it to be as family friendly as possible
843000	847000	You should have darkly colored chickens
847000	849000	Huge dark chickens
849000	851000	Dark chickens?
851000	853000	Yeah, from another old joke, big black cock
853000	855000	Oh, stop
855000	857000	We can do dark chickens, I'll put that on the list
857000	859000	Alright, that'll work
859000	862000	Let me say this real quick, Jessica Harper
862000	864000	from Our Good Pals The Understanding Live
864000	866000	Saturday nights here at VOG says
866000	872000	The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me
872000	874000	Oh my god
874000	876000	Did you even think of that?
876000	878000	I did not
878000	883000	We gotta be careful, because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation
883000	890000	But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this, so
890000	892000	Exploding ferrets
892000	897000	This is a fantastic idea
897000	900000	At least now there will be something in Arizona, there you go
900000	908000	Yeah, honestly, everyone I've ever talked to who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona
908000	910000	has basically said the same thing to me
910000	912000	There's nothing there
912000	915000	That is the whole reason why I put that in there
915000	917000	Basically I'm acknowledging what they said
917000	919000	Very nice, very nice
919000	925000	Alright, so let me think, I gotta ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight
925000	928000	But I wanted to bring you on, because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here
928000	932000	And even though you're the one that's ultimately gonna profit from it, I still think it's great
932000	933000	It has my full blessing
933000	935000	Let me tell you something, if this game does really well
935000	941000	I am totally gonna fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff
941000	943000	Like that is gonna be
943000	945000	Beer works
945000	947000	You can pay us in beer, sir
947000	949000	You got it, you got it
949000	950000	Amazing, amazing
950000	952000	It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway, so
952000	954000	We're fun, we promise
954000	957000	No exploding ferrets in person though, let's stay away from that
957000	958000	Okay, so quickly
958000	960000	I don't know, we could put a firecracker in one of the little ferrets
960000	962000	A little more about the game
962000	966000	One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet
966000	969000	I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you
969000	974000	But I can tell it has a great old arcade style look and feel to it
974000	976000	As all your previous games really have
976000	979000	You're very inspired by old school 80's arcade games, aren't you?
979000	983000	Just arcade games and intense action packed games in general
983000	987000	That's the only kind of game I'm ever gonna make because that's what I'm most into
987000	992000	So yeah, I don't know if it has an old looking vibe or what
992000	997000	But it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe because I'm not very good at it
997000	1002000	I wouldn't say it's old looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like
1002000	1006000	If an Atari 2600 game was modern and that's certainly not a bad thing
1006000	1009000	We killed hours and hours and hours of boom and stuff, you know what I mean?
1009000	1013000	It has a Defender-ish look to it
1013000	1016000	Actually you're not the first person that compares it to Defender
1016000	1020000	Obviously you're not saving people, you're destroying them with ferrets
1020000	1022000	Yes you should
1022000	1026000	But yes, it has been compared to Defender before
1026000	1030000	Nice, but it's a whole new, it's not a Defender clone at all
1030000	1032000	It's a whole new, there's bungee cords
1032000	1034000	Defender meets Bionic Commando
1034000	1036000	Kinda, it's just
1036000	1038000	Exploding ferrets
1038000	1040000	It's new while feeling retro
1040000	1042000	And I think that's true in all your games
1042000	1044000	It's just awesome
1044000	1045000	Boom
1045000	1048000	Alright, well Erin before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR
1048000	1050000	What's going on in the gaming world this week
1050000	1052000	Anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?
1052000	1056000	You know what, it's been a very long process
1056000	1061000	I actually started this project last May
1061000	1064000	So it's been in the works for a very long time
1064000	1068000	I nonetheless have had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it
1068000	1071000	And I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together
1071000	1074000	It'll be a dollar, it'll be free to try
1074000	1077000	And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it
1077000	1081000	Do you want to hear very quickly the wishlist for the sequel?
1081000	1082000	Absolutely
1082000	1085000	Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this
1085000	1088000	Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking
1088000	1092000	Alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers
1092000	1095000	Elemental ferrets, fire, ice and lightning
1095000	1097000	Strife amethysts
1097000	1101000	Yes, not chaos emeralds because we can't rip off anybody
1101000	1103000	Credits will contain a rhythm game
1103000	1106000	Other vehicles besides helicopter, like bungee from a motorboat, yes
1106000	1108000	Dedicated sound for missile launch
1108000	1110000	Screen-clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered anytime
1110000	1112000	Ferrets equipped with milk tea
1112000	1114000	Money should be used to buy stuff
1114000	1118000	Oh, yes, raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club
1118000	1122000	These trained ferrets would then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game
1122000	1127000	Deformable landscapes summon killer train to attack enemies
1127000	1130000	An eagle operating a crane needs to be a stage boss
1130000	1133000	Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city
1133000	1137000	Dark Tetsuya in our chat says, wow, Bungee Ferret Tossing 2 sounds epic
1137000	1141000	But hold on guys, don't sell the original short
1141000	1144000	The original is still going to be amazing and blow your mind
1144000	1148000	It's just, you know, this may soon, if it does well, wink wink nudge nudge
1148000	1152000	This may soon become the start of a new trilogy
1152000	1155000	You know what, I would love to bring that to you guys
1155000	1156000	I got a quick question
1156000	1157000	Yes, Dan?
1157000	1159000	Are there any zombies in it?
1159000	1160000	Not yet
1160000	1163000	Only you'll become if you play the game too much
1163000	1164000	There are no indie games without zombies
1164000	1165000	There's plenty of indie games
1165000	1167000	So you gotta put some zombies in
1167000	1168000	Let me tell you something
1168000	1169000	Every indie game has zombies
1169000	1173000	There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games
1173000	1174000	That's what I'm saying
1174000	1177000	I'm saying every indie game has zombies
1177000	1179000	So we need some zombie ferrets
1179000	1182000	You know what there is in the game though, and maybe I hope I'm not spoiling anything
1182000	1184000	There are kittens in the game
1184000	1185000	Are they zombies?
1185000	1187000	Maybe
1187000	1191000	They're just played on the screen when you run the game that says
1191000	1194000	Please don't throw animals in real life
1194000	1197000	Yeah we can't do that with my cat, she's too huge
1197000	1199000	Oh I could
1199000	1204000	There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens
1204000	1205000	But we'll see
1205000	1207000	Anyway, okay, Aaron I gotta wrap up and let you go
1207000	1210000	But everybody be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing
1210000	1212000	It will be out in the coming days
1212000	1215000	We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process
1215000	1216000	But it will be out very soon
1216000	1219000	And it's a dollar for heaven's sake
1219000	1222000	We never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio
1222000	1224000	But we're gonna say buy this
1224000	1229000	Because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games
1229000	1231000	That are having a lot of spotlight this week
1231000	1232000	We really want Aaron to be able to do well
1232000	1236000	So when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar
1236000	1239000	You probably already have it in your leftover points anyway
1239000	1241000	And go buy this game
1241000	1244000	If you follow Y Y R Games on Twitter you'll know exactly when it comes out
1244000	1247000	I will tweet the moment it releases
1247000	1249000	And check out the website of course Y Y R Games dot com
1249000	1251000	You have other games
1251000	1253000	We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight
1253000	1255000	But you have other games on the market place
1255000	1257000	Like Snake 360 and Falling
1257000	1259000	That are worth checking out absolutely
1259000	1261000	I appreciate that
1261000	1263000	Old arcade game style stuff
1263000	1265000	Alright, Aaron have a good one buddy
1265000	1266000	Thank you again
1266000	1267000	Hey you too
1267000	1268000	Thanks so much for having me on
1268000	1269000	Alright of course
1269000	1270000	Take care
1270000	1271000	Bye bye
1271000	1275000	You know, and if you're gonna make a game inspired by an Orange Zones Radio idea
1275000	1277000	I'll bring you on at the top of the show too
1277000	1279000	Let's be real
1279000	1280000	I am super excited
1280000	1282000	I know I can't wait to play it
1282000	1285000	And I'm not just saying that because we're involved
1285000	1286000	It just, it looks like fun
1286000	1287000	I can't wait
1287000	1290000	Ionotropic said ferret returns, bungee ferret tossing 13
1290000	1294000	I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels
1294000	1296000	But we gotta make this one a success first
1296000	1298000	Cause if this is a flop then Aaron's gonna be like
1298000	1302000	Maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money
1302000	1303000	Zombies
1303000	1305000	Zombies are overrated
1305000	1306000	Alright alright
1306000	1309000	Let's move into how was your gaming week
1309000	1310000	What types of video games
1310000	1312000	You obviously haven't been playing bungee ferret tossing
1312000	1313000	It's not out yet
1313000	1314000	But what have you been playing this week
1314000	1316000	Let's start with Dark Sakura
1316000	1318000	Wow, in mass effect
1318000	1319000	Three
1319000	1320000	For a change
1320000	1321000	And two
1321000	1322000	Shut up
1322000	1325000	Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night
1325000	1327000	It was the zombie one
1327000	1329000	See, zombies overrated
1329000	1331000	And I hadn't played through it yet
1331000	1332000	So
1332000	1334000	What the fuck man
1337000	1340000	I have also been doing school stuff this week
1340000	1341000	And writing
1341000	1342000	That doesn't have anything to do with gaming
1342000	1343000	And writing
1343000	1345000	So I have a life
1345000	1347000	Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week
1347000	1348000	How about you bite me
1348000	1350000	You just completely and totally squirt the whole segment
1350000	1352000	How about you bite me
1352000	1354000	That doesn't have anything to do with gaming either
1354000	1356000	How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me
1356000	1358000	Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio
1358000	1360000	Where every gamer has a voice
1360000	1362000	And they might use it to fight with their spouse
1362000	1364000	Live on air
1366000	1369000	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Dark Sakura
1369000	1370000	Of course not
1370000	1372000	And then I shot my husband in the face
1372000	1374000	It's just mass effect and World of Warcraft
1374000	1377000	Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan
1377000	1379000	How was your gaming week
1379000	1382000	I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare
1382000	1384000	That was it
1386000	1387000	But zombies
1387000	1388000	It was pretty good
1388000	1389000	Yeah
1389000	1391000	Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out
1391000	1392000	And it just sort of sat on the shelf
1392000	1394000	And then for whatever reason this week I was like
1394000	1396000	You know what, I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies
1396000	1398000	Oh, and I did
1398000	1399000	You like to do a lot of
1399000	1401000	Oh, and he cursed a lot too
1401000	1402000	You like to do
1402000	1403000	Oh, yeah
1403000	1406000	You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs too
1406000	1408000	Like you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV
1408000	1410000	So you can kind of like watch people play games
1410000	1412000	And stuff, right
1412000	1415000	Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube
1415000	1416000	Yeah, you think that's a weird thing
1416000	1417000	And wrestling
1417000	1418000	I don't think it's a weird thing
1418000	1419000	Kind of to an extent
1419000	1420000	Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling
1420000	1421000	Well, I will say this
1421000	1423000	I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week
1423000	1425000	It was something on the Game Boy
1425000	1427000	It was like, was it DuckTales on the game
1427000	1428000	No, it was something even more obscure
1428000	1429000	Was it Mega Man
1429000	1431000	No, it was even more obscure than that
1431000	1432000	It was some licensed game
1432000	1433000	Oh, The Simpsons
1433000	1435000	It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy
1435000	1437000	And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch
1437000	1438000	Oh, yeah
1438000	1440000	It was Bart vs The Juggernauts
1440000	1444000	Well, because a lot of these games are stuff that I've known existed
1444000	1447000	But I was always just like, what the fuck is this about
1447000	1449000	And there's like this World of Long Plays channel on YouTube
1449000	1452000	And they do just these really good high definition long plays of games
1452000	1455000	And to an extent it's like, I'd like to check this game out
1455000	1458000	But God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it
1458000	1460000	So that's kind of the best way to go
1460000	1462000	It's a good way to sample stuff too
1462000	1463000	A lot of the new stuff
1463000	1464000	Yeah, well, you know
1464000	1467000	A lot of these games suck
1467000	1472000	So it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them
1472000	1474000	Alright, fair enough
1474000	1477000	Alright, anything else you want to say about your gaming week, Dan?
1477000	1478000	Uh, no
1478000	1479000	Okay, let's go to Loki
1479000	1480000	Zombies
1480000	1482000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1482000	1486000	I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3
1486000	1488000	A little bit of that
1488000	1491000	And then I also played McPixel
1491000	1494000	Because I bought that on my Android phone
1494000	1497000	And it's pretty fun, it's like a cross between
1497000	1501000	The old LucasArts point and click adventure games
1501000	1504000	And MacGyver
1504000	1507000	But really dirty
1507000	1510000	Dirty MacGyver?
1510000	1511000	Like dirty MacGyver
1511000	1512000	Okay
1512000	1514000	Because basically each one of the
1514000	1518000	Like every single puzzle in the game is
1518000	1520000	You have 20 seconds to defuse the bomb
1520000	1522000	You don't know where the bomb is
1522000	1523000	You don't know how you have to defuse it
1523000	1526000	But you just have to figure out how to interact with stuff
1526000	1527000	And what you need to do
1527000	1529000	And most of the, well a lot of the puzzles
1529000	1531000	Involve kicking someone in the nuts
1531000	1533000	And then some of them
1533000	1534000	To defuse a bomb?
1534000	1535000	To defuse a bomb
1535000	1537000	That's how I play Scribblenauts
1537000	1539000	Is the bomb in their pants?
1539000	1541000	Sometimes, yeah
1541000	1544000	It's just, it's such a weird game
1544000	1546000	And it's awesome though
1546000	1548000	I don't know why but I'm suddenly reminded of the game
1548000	1550000	Don't Shit Your Pants
1550000	1552000	Which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?
1552000	1554000	Yeah
1554000	1558000	But yeah, it just, it gets really strange
1558000	1560000	But it's definitely worth checking out
1560000	1562000	Either, I think it's also on PC as well
1562000	1564000	But yeah, McPixel
1564000	1566000	Really, really crazy but fun
1566000	1568000	So I played through the entire game of that
1568000	1570000	And then Minecraft
1570000	1572000	I've been playing a lot of Minecraft on PC
1572000	1575000	Finally launched the VoG network server
1575000	1578000	I actually have a remote server that I run now
1578000	1579000	Tell us more about this
1579000	1580000	Because we need more people on it
1580000	1582000	Yes, it's a server
1582000	1584000	It's a whitelisted server
1584000	1588000	So basically you go to the forum thread on the VoG forums
1588000	1591000	And you say, hey, I want to be let in
1591000	1593000	And I add your name to the whitelist
1593000	1595000	And you can go in and build
1595000	1597000	And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome
1597000	1599000	And up on a hill is the clubhouse
1599000	1601000	You go in there, take a set of tools
1601000	1604000	Or use that as a home base for a while
1604000	1606000	Until you figure out what you're going to do
1606000	1607000	And then go off and build
1607000	1609000	And it's just a survival thing
1609000	1610000	It's kind of fun
1610000	1612000	Maybe we could have OLR Village
1612000	1614000	Yeah, I think that's kind of the idea
1614000	1616000	Is that everybody would have their own little house and stuff
1616000	1617000	Yeah, you just build a house wherever
1617000	1619000	I still don't have the game and I'm probably not gonna
1619000	1622000	You got to check, even if you don't buy the game yourself
1622000	1624000	At some point have one of us give you a tour
1624000	1626000	Because it's pretty cool just seeing what other people have created
1626000	1628000	Like in retrospect
1628000	1629000	That's fun
1629000	1631000	In retrospect though, I think I might have built myself
1631000	1635000	Actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing
1635000	1638000	Which I don't, I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that
1638000	1640000	So maybe we can get something on YouTube
1640000	1643000	But anyway, we'll work on that later
1643000	1645000	But I was playing that this week on the server
1645000	1647000	And I built a sad little house
1647000	1650000	But I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode
1650000	1652000	You do have limited mobs
1652000	1653000	You're on like the easy mode
1653000	1655000	But you gotta have some mobs
1655000	1656000	To give some challenge, right?
1656000	1658000	Well, easy mode still has all the mobs
1658000	1660000	They just don't do all the damage
1660000	1663000	Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode
1663000	1666000	And the other day we were just fucking around
1666000	1668000	Because since I'm the admin
1668000	1670000	I can switch shit all the time
1670000	1672000	Like right now I'm basically playing
1672000	1674000	Or I was playing in creative mode
1674000	1676000	Because I was
1676000	1678000	Let's put it this way
1678000	1680000	When we first started the server
1680000	1682000	I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff
1682000	1684000	And then I had Bobby telling me
1684000	1686000	Hey, I can't go into the clubhouse
1686000	1689000	I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?
1689000	1691000	Yeah, the door doesn't work
1691000	1693000	Huh? That's weird
1693000	1694000	Okay, whatever
1694000	1696000	I was like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse
1696000	1697000	I'm like, what?
1697000	1699000	Why couldn't you go into the clubhouse?
1699000	1701000	Well, apparently I built it too close to the spawn point
1701000	1704000	And see, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point
1704000	1706000	And build stuff and stuff like that
1706000	1707000	Other players cannot
1707000	1709000	So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through
1709000	1711000	Because it wasn't updating the block that was there
1711000	1713000	So I had to tear it all down
1713000	1714000	And build it up on a hill
1714000	1715000	Which is kind of funny, but
1715000	1716000	It looks great though
1716000	1718000	Because now you have that waterfall and everything
1718000	1719000	Yeah, so we were doing that
1719000	1720000	But anyway, so
1720000	1721000	Like I said, I was fucking around
1721000	1722000	Because I was in creative mode
1722000	1724000	And so you can spawn whatever you want
1724000	1726000	Including monster eggs that spawn
1726000	1727000	Monsters
1727000	1728000	So my friend's like
1728000	1729000	You know, I was telling him about the endermen
1729000	1731000	And he's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those
1731000	1733000	I'm like, alright
1733000	1736000	So I spawned one and he fought it
1736000	1737000	And he killed it pretty easily
1737000	1739000	I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy
1739000	1741000	I'm like, okay
1741000	1744000	So I spawned 20 of them
1744000	1746000	But you will not make a habit out of spawning random endermen
1746000	1747000	No, no, no
1747000	1750000	This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch
1750000	1752000	Because we were just spawning all sorts of garbage
1752000	1753000	It was hilarious
1753000	1754000	It will be real
1754000	1756000	By the way, if you do go on the VoG Network server and play
1756000	1757000	It will be really easy to find my house
1757000	1760000	Because I thought I went way far away to go build it
1760000	1761000	But apparently not
1761000	1763000	Because Loki and I have already managed to connect our mines
1763000	1765000	It did not take very long
1765000	1766000	It's a temporary mine
1766000	1767000	I'm going to abandon mine anyways
1767000	1769000	Because I'm going to build somewhere else
1769000	1771000	It just wasn't very feasible right there
1771000	1772000	But yeah, there's stuff around
1772000	1774000	I've got to figure out a way to
1774000	1776000	Maybe we'll put up a sign on our house
1776000	1778000	That's like, hey, property blah blah blah
1778000	1780000	You know, so you don't like accidentally
1780000	1782000	I mean, because someone can go into my mine
1782000	1784000	And that's fine, I don't really give a crap
1784000	1785000	But yeah, there's a ton of
1785000	1786000	Go ahead
1786000	1788000	It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game
1788000	1790000	I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in the Sims
1790000	1792000	And build underground
1792000	1793000	Live in a cave
1793000	1794000	Which you can do
1794000	1795000	Oh yeah, I mean, that's easy
1795000	1796000	A lot of people kind of do that
1796000	1797000	They have their main house
1797000	1799000	And they build little outposts as they're in the mine
1799000	1801000	That's a very common thing to do
1801000	1802000	I mean, just living underground
1802000	1804000	Now I did see a cool video
1804000	1807000	Where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf
1807000	1810000	Area was in Lord of the Rings
1810000	1811000	Nice
1811000	1812000	It was really cool
1812000	1813000	Nice
1813000	1814000	Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that
1814000	1817000	It's more like just creative mode
1817000	1819000	Which we can, you know, if no one wants to play as a rival mode
1819000	1820000	We can do that
1820000	1822000	But I didn't want to do like creative mode
1822000	1825000	Because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything
1825000	1827000	Because it's like, eh, who cares
1827000	1828000	You know, I have all the objects
1828000	1829000	I don't need to go find whatever
1829000	1830000	I think it's fine
1830000	1831000	I haven't died yet
1831000	1832000	Yeah, I've come close
1832000	1833000	But I haven't died yet
1833000	1834000	This is still how I play the Sims
1834000	1836000	But, I mean, and trust me
1836000	1839000	When I'm not building that, you know, clubhouse
1839000	1840000	I am actually playing survival mode
1840000	1842000	And I'm not actually cheating
1842000	1844000	I don't have, like, diamond armor or anything
1844000	1845000	So I'm just playing legit
1845000	1848000	But, you know, aside from building the start area
1848000	1850000	You know, that obviously is doing creative
1850000	1852000	So vognetwork.com forums
1852000	1853000	If you want to join us, and please do
1853000	1854000	But don't destroy my house
1854000	1855000	Or I will find you and I will kill you
1855000	1857000	Yeah, and we've got plenty of server space
1857000	1860000	I can host up to 35 people at a time
1860000	1864000	And I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once
1864000	1865000	Good times
1865000	1866000	Yeah
1866000	1867000	Not yet
1867000	1868000	Please join
1868000	1869000	Not yet
1869000	1870000	Yes
1870000	1871000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1871000	1872000	No, that's it
1872000	1874000	Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already
1874000	1875000	I bought Minecraft PC this week
1875000	1878000	Solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server
1878000	1880000	So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there
1880000	1881000	That are not in the Xbox One
1881000	1883000	Is it worth the 20 bucks?
1883000	1885000	I think it's really fun
1885000	1886000	I do
1886000	1887000	I bought the 360 version
1887000	1888000	I thought it was pretty slick
1888000	1889000	And I started to get bored of it
1889000	1891000	And the PC version is, like, so much better
1891000	1893000	Yeah, the PC one you can mod
1893000	1894000	And do all that stuff too as well
1894000	1896000	Like, Alan's helping me get a map mod
1896000	1897000	Which I think would be very useful
1897000	1899000	Yeah, any of that stuff's okay
1899000	1901000	As long as it's not like, hey, mod two
1901000	1903000	You know, x-ray mod and stuff like that
1903000	1906000	And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin
1906000	1909000	So I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now
1909000	1912000	Walking around in armor, so, you know
1912000	1913000	But, yeah
1913000	1914000	Just like in real life
1914000	1916000	Yeah, just like in real life and I'm not wearing a shirt
1916000	1918000	Well, I was gonna say, yeah
1918000	1920000	It's definitely worth it and there's a lot more to do
1920000	1921000	Plus, the thing is
1921000	1924000	The one thing that really turned me off about Minecraft originally
1924000	1926000	Was using keyboard and mouse
1926000	1928000	Especially on my laptop, it's touchpad and keyboard
1928000	1930000	And I said, fuck that
1930000	1932000	So I actually have, and I even linked it in there
1932000	1935000	There's a, you know, program you can use with x-pad
1935000	1938000	Or to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller
1938000	1939000	And that's actually how it plays
1939000	1940000	With an Xbox 360 controller
1940000	1941000	And it's awesome
1941000	1943000	It's great if you play the 360 version
1943000	1944000	Sweet
1944000	1946000	Alright, the rest of my gaming week
1946000	1948000	I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news
1948000	1950000	Because we've been pretty lengthy so far
1950000	1951000	I'm just gonna say
1951000	1953000	More World of Warcraft, surprise
1953000	1955000	But I got my sixth level 85
1955000	1957000	Cue the womp womp
1957000	1959000	Whatever, don't judge me
1959000	1962000	And then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3
1962000	1964000	Because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now
1964000	1965000	So if you are a PlayStation Plus person
1965000	1967000	You can get Borderlands for free
1967000	1970000	Which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel
1970000	1973000	I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus
1973000	1975000	But I am not one to turn down a free game
1975000	1978000	Especially one that I was enjoying on the PC
1978000	1980000	And the only problem I'm having is that
1980000	1982000	It was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse
1982000	1983000	Than it is with the PlayStation 3 controller
1983000	1984000	That's the only bummer
1984000	1985000	But the game looks good
1985000	1986000	And it runs really smooth
1986000	1988000	You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3
1988000	1991000	Couple little graphical glitches here and there
1991000	1994000	But nothing that's a game ruining experience
1994000	1996000	A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands
1996000	2000000	And I really like the whole fusion of a role playing game in a first person shooter
2000000	2002000	It makes the first person shooters very accessible
2002000	2004000	So, love it
2004000	2007000	That's mostly it
2007000	2010000	So, for this week that I can think of
2010000	2012000	Let's do some housekeeping
2012000	2014000	And then we're gonna get into some big news tonight
2014000	2015000	Right at the top, right Loki?
2015000	2017000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

2018000	2020000	Twitter.com slash OLR

2027000	2029000	And when we're gonna have weeks off or what have you
2029000	2030000	Speaking of weeks off
2030000	2032000	Dark Sakura will not be here next week
2032000	2034000	But we will still be doing a show
2034000	2036000	Maybe we can get Dan to come back
2036000	2038000	I don't know, we'll see
2038000	2040000	It's a holiday
2040000	2042000	Alright, moving on
2042000	2044000	Starting off
2044000	2046000	News tonight, Loki
2046000	2048000	So apparently there is a
2048000	2050000	There's this thing that went around the internet
2050000	2052000	It's funny cause I get to watch it happen
2052000	2054000	There's a distributor that leaked
2054000	2056000	The Wii U pricing and
2056000	2058000	The release date, that's just so weird
2058000	2060000	And they listed three skews
2060000	2062000	And the price is anywhere from
2062000	2064000	$249.99 to
2064000	2066000	$349.99 and
2066000	2067000	Yeah, it's so weird
2067000	2069000	Never heard that before, crazy
2069000	2071000	It's funny because
2071000	2073000	I saw it, I was actually reading
2073000	2075000	Go Nintendo and
2075000	2077000	Funny enough, it's actually my company
2077000	2079000	So a little bit
2079000	2081000	A little bit of shock there, I was like
2081000	2083000	But to be clear, it wasn't you
2083000	2085000	No, it wasn't me
2085000	2087000	That was the funny thing, it wasn't me
2087000	2089000	It was some dude goes by Hound Dog
2089000	2091000	On YouTube
2091000	2093000	Which we tracked down
2093000	2095000	Which I'll get into in just a second here
2095000	2097000	So yeah
2097000	2099000	It's a little weird, I don't like to talk about
2099000	2101000	Where I work because you know
2101000	2103000	It comes back to me sometimes
2103000	2105000	It did once before
2105000	2107000	It did once
2107000	2109000	It's documented, people know what happened
2109000	2111000	Honestly
2111000	2113000	Quite surprised that the Wii U stuff hasn't
2113000	2115000	But see
2115000	2117000	I've kind of removed anything that points
2117000	2119000	Me back to my company
2119000	2121000	But yeah
2121000	2123000	It's funny though, everybody
2123000	2125000	This is not necessarily a story about
2125000	2127000	Information I pretty much already told you guys
2127000	2129000	Based off of
2129000	2131000	This information
2131000	2133000	That I've known for a while now
2133000	2135000	And also other information pointing to the release
2135000	2137000	Date of the 18th
2137000	2139000	Which is
2139000	2141000	PDP leak and of course some other
2141000	2143000	Games that are going to be announced probably this week
2143000	2145000	That are going to be launching on
2145000	2147000	The 18th that kind of point to
2147000	2149000	That release date
2149000	2151000	Is how
2151000	2153000	The gaming media works
2153000	2155000	And watching how it works is really
2155000	2157000	Interesting
2157000	2159000	How there's literally
2159000	2161000	Copy pasted stories, no research done
2161000	2163000	And then it starts playing the telephone game
2163000	2165000	Where it gets even more ridiculous
2165000	2167000	And I kind of, I don't know if anyone's followed my
2167000	2169000	Twitter, you kind of saw a little bit of that
2169000	2171000	Because I kept posting articles like
2171000	2173000	LOL, did they really just do that?
2173000	2175000	So it started off in games facts
2175000	2177000	It went to go Nintendo
2177000	2179000	And other Nintendo kind of
2179000	2181000	Websites started running it
2181000	2183000	And one of the things that kind of got back
2183000	2185000	To the higher
2185000	2187000	Ups at our company because we
2187000	2189000	Started getting calls from our customers
2189000	2191000	Was the fact that
2191000	2193000	They go, oh
2193000	2195000	This distributor
2195000	2197000	Supplies Amazon over stock
2197000	2199000	And blah blah blah
2199000	2201000	True, we work, we do sell stuff
2201000	2203000	To Amazon but we're not the main
2203000	2205000	Supplier for Amazon
2205000	2207000	It makes it sound like
2207000	2209000	Basically a lot of these places
2209000	2211000	Were just like, oh Amazon distributor
2211000	2213000	Leaks price because that
2213000	2215000	Headline gets a lot more hits
2215000	2217000	And it adds a little bit more credence
2217000	2219000	To the information in there
2219000	2221000	Despite the fact the funny part is the date's
2221000	2223000	Wrong
2223000	2225000	It's a placeholder date, it's not right
2225000	2227000	At all, no one knows
2227000	2229000	What the real date is
2229000	2231000	Well, I mean I speculate what the real date
2231000	2233000	Is, but that date's not it
2233000	2235000	Which is funny because everyone's like
2235000	2237000	Well that doesn't go with the rumors
2237000	2239000	I've heard that it's the 18th
2239000	2241000	That's a week before, but it's a Sunday, I guess it's real
2241000	2243000	But like
2243000	2245000	CNET, I think out of all the
2245000	2247000	Stories I saw from
2247000	2249000	The different blogs, CNET's probably the
2249000	2251000	Funniest one, and I don't know who this
2251000	2253000	Guy is, but
2253000	2255000	He first, he put the text
2255000	2257000	You know, that was the text information
2257000	2259000	He's like, yeah okay, so it was the Wii U system
2259000	2261000	1111, and 249
2261000	2263000	299, 349
2263000	2265000	But then I got this
2265000	2267000	Additional information
2267000	2269000	A screenshot of the website
2269000	2271000	Oh, that backs up the information
2271000	2273000	Oh wait, I got another source
2273000	2275000	It's a video, it's like you're a fucking idiot
2275000	2277000	They're all the same goddamn thing
2277000	2279000	It's the same goddamn source
2279000	2281000	And you're like sourcing two other things
2281000	2283000	To make it sound like that it's
2283000	2285000	More legit
2285000	2287000	Some comments from our chatroom at
2287000	2289000	Live.vognetwork.com
2289000	2291000	Costa journalism
2291000	2293000	Frisbee says, control C, control
2293000	2295000	V, that's how the stories go from you
2295000	2297000	To me
2297000	2299000	I like that
2299000	2301000	There's like a little song about that
2301000	2303000	WhatupG says it would be cool if it was November 11th
2303000	2305000	But November 18th makes sense at least
2305000	2307000	Historically for Nintendo, that's the exact
2307000	2309000	Same day they released
2309000	2311000	The Wii, the GameCube?
2311000	2313000	One of the other systems was the exact same day
2313000	2315000	So, Mr. Dan
2315000	2317000	Having a background in video
2317000	2319000	Games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense
2319000	2321000	As a release date
2321000	2323000	Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays
2323000	2325000	It's really irritating
2325000	2327000	And it does also make sense about the 11th that
2327000	2329000	They will be sending them out early
2329000	2331000	Because, you know, the stores
2331000	2333000	Don't get it, you know, it doesn't just magically spawn
2333000	2335000	In the store Sunday morning
2335000	2337000	You know, we have it hidden away somewhere
2337000	2339000	So that you can't get it
2339000	2341000	You can't steal it
2341000	2343000	So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it
2343000	2345000	And post it on the internet
2345000	2347000	No, you never put other people down
2347000	2349000	Here's the funny part
2349000	2351000	Like I said before, you know
2351000	2353000	There is this guy, this anonymous guy
2353000	2355000	Hound dog, who leaked it
2355000	2357000	Dude
2357000	2359000	First rule of the internet
2359000	2361000	Anything that you post on the internet
2361000	2363000	Always stays on the internet
2363000	2365000	So, when you post
2365000	2367000	A video or whatever
2367000	2369000	And then
2369000	2371000	You know, think that we're not gonna figure it out
2371000	2373000	First off, his video
2373000	2375000	Basically it was a video of a screenshot
2375000	2377000	Had a time and date
2377000	2379000	In the bottom corner
2379000	2381000	Stupid
2381000	2383000	Because, you know what we could do?
2383000	2385000	We went back, we looked at our web access logs
2385000	2387000	And guess what?
2387000	2389000	We query every single search
2389000	2391000	On there
2391000	2393000	Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U
2393000	2395000	And
2395000	2397000	During that time frame, there was only two
2397000	2399000	And then
2399000	2401000	And then it was basically two different customers
2401000	2403000	Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs
2403000	2405000	And then
2405000	2407000	Oh, guess what? You do a Google
2407000	2409000	Cache search on, you know, Hound dog
2409000	2411000	And oh, he has a trailer
2411000	2413000	An advertisement for a certain
2413000	2415000	Store that happens to be one
2415000	2417000	Of the two customers
2417000	2419000	Oh, Guerrilla Games and Saint
2419000	2421000	Cloud
2421000	2423000	Don't hold back now
2423000	2425000	So what happened?
2425000	2427000	Did anybody go to the guy
2427000	2429000	And say, why'd you do it?
2429000	2431000	Honestly, I don't know
2431000	2433000	Because this was stuff that was handled
2433000	2435000	By managers and upper management
2435000	2437000	And stuff like that, because funny
2437000	2439000	Like I said, this had nothing to do with me
2439000	2441000	I do item setup sometimes
2441000	2443000	For a lot of games, but I don't do
2443000	2445000	First party because our buyer for some goddamn reason
2445000	2447000	Wants to hold on to first party even though
2447000	2449000	She fucks everything up
2449000	2451000	So
2451000	2453000	She set that up, she didn't
2453000	2455000	Flag it to not show up on our website
2455000	2457000	Even though maybe she should've
2457000	2459000	And it wasn't any of my
2459000	2461000	Customers that leaked the information
2461000	2463000	So I just sat back and kind of like
2463000	2465000	Lol
2465000	2467000	Frisbee said she should've used the free Wi-Fi
2467000	2469000	At Starbucks
2469000	2471000	Oh yeah, that was the other thing too, his IP
2471000	2473000	Pointed back to Saint Cloud as well
2473000	2475000	Whatever, anyway, this is all in
2475000	2477000	Moot Point come Thursday
2477000	2479000	Exactly, it's all in Moot Point and the whole thing
2479000	2481000	Blew over pretty fast, except for the fact that
2481000	2483000	Amazon's like, we need an apology
2483000	2485000	From you, we need you
2485000	2487000	Blah blah blah, Nintendo of course
2487000	2489000	On people's asses about, hey
2489000	2491000	You know, this is not supposed to be
2491000	2493000	Which only leads credit to the fact
2493000	2495000	That it's probably true
2495000	2497000	Except that the date's not right, but you know
2497000	2499000	I mean, some information's obviously
2499000	2501000	Accurate, like the pricing
2501000	2503000	And like I said
2503000	2505000	If you've been listening to this show
2505000	2507000	For the last few months
2507000	2509000	This is no
2509000	2511000	This is not news to you
2511000	2513000	Put it that way
2513000	2515000	I just find it funny though
2515000	2517000	Like how, seriously
2517000	2519000	Copy paste all these articles are
2519000	2521000	And like, big comp- like
2521000	2523000	IGN, and what the fuck, okay
2523000	2525000	Seriously, let's step aside here
2525000	2527000	What the fuck is it with IGN
2527000	2529000	And GameSpot where
2529000	2531000	You have an article, okay
2531000	2533000	And there's not that much information
2533000	2535000	In this article, it's like, okay
2535000	2537000	Distributor, three prices, three skews
2537000	2539000	November 11th date
2539000	2541000	They have an article, and then they have
2541000	2543000	A video in the article, that's talking about
2543000	2545000	The article
2545000	2547000	Why do they, and why is it some
2547000	2549000	British guy, it's always a British guy
2549000	2551000	People don't like to read
2551000	2553000	They're like, having some intern guy read this
2553000	2555000	Dude, and there's this like
2555000	2557000	This distributor, we can't get
2557000	2559000	Into their website because you need to log in
2559000	2561000	And password, but this guy got in
2561000	2563000	And he got this exclusive information
2563000	2565000	And blah blah blah, and
2565000	2567000	People don't like to read
2567000	2569000	It's ridiculous
2569000	2571000	I feel ignorant without IGN
2571000	2573000	Well it's funny you say that, because people
2573000	2575000	Can't read, but there is somewhat
2575000	2577000	Truth to that, because this makes a very
2577000	2579000	Interesting companion piece to
2579000	2581000	Bobby's show before us tonight, and the whole
2581000	2583000	Girlfriend mode thing
2583000	2585000	And how that kind of got carried away
2585000	2587000	And all that as well, and that's because people
2587000	2589000	Didn't really want to read the entire article
2589000	2591000	They just wanted to read the part where
2591000	2593000	Oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode
2593000	2595000	Because he clearly hates women
2595000	2597000	I think it was a poor
2597000	2599000	Choice of words, but really people just need to get over it
2599000	2601000	But, I mean, we all make poor
2601000	2603000	Choice of words sometimes, I mean, thank God
2603000	2605000	No one really does listen to this show, except
2605000	2607000	You know, you fell for, because God, we've
2607000	2609000	Said shit on this show that would have gotten us
2609000	2611000	Through the coals in the past, because
2611000	2613000	That's unfortunately the way
2613000	2615000	Our little internet medium works
2615000	2617000	Sometimes, and it's- There's no one, no one pays attention
2617000	2619000	To us, but they'll pay attention to like
2619000	2621000	Joe Schmo, I mean like
2621000	2623000	Seriously, like MTV
2623000	2625000	Like, it went
2625000	2627000	It went everywhere, it went to MTV's
2627000	2629000	Website, they're the gaming block, it went to
2629000	2631000	IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET, it went
2631000	2633000	Well CNET takes stuff from Yahoo
2633000	2635000	Or, I mean, vice versa
2635000	2637000	I think that's just saying that people want to know
2637000	2638000	The Wii U date already
2638000	2640000	I understand that, but it's just, it's so ridiculous
2640000	2642000	How, I literally got one
2642000	2644000	Email from an independent site
2644000	2646000	Asking the, you know, follow up on that
2646000	2648000	One person
2649000	2651000	Fucking hilarious, because what did Bobby
2651000	2653000	Ran about on his show, just, just
2653000	2655000	An hour ago, what was Bobby's ran on his show
2655000	2657000	About his exclusive interview with Gearbox
2657000	2659000	How did he get that exclusive interview?
2659000	2660000	He asked
2660000	2662000	And here's the other thing too that was funny about
2662000	2663000	Nobody else had asked
2663000	2665000	Here's the other thing that was funny about the CNET article
2665000	2667000	And then we went to our gaming gurus
2667000	2669000	In the, in the
2669000	2671000	In the office
2671000	2673000	And they, yeah we talked to this editor
2673000	2675000	And he said, yeah that sounds like that could be real
2675000	2677000	Really? Really? That is your
2677000	2679000	Fucking, like, proof
2679000	2681000	This guy just says, yeah that sounds like
2681000	2683000	Feasible information
2683000	2685000	Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a
2685000	2687000	Millionaire? Ask the experts
2687000	2689000	Are you on a game show?
2689000	2691000	It's like, yeah, yeah
2691000	2693000	That seems feasible
2693000	2695000	Hey Joe Schmo who plays some video games that
2695000	2697000	Delivers our mail, do you think that this release date
2697000	2699000	Sounds like it could be real?
2699000	2701000	Sounds right
2701000	2703000	It was the release date
2703000	2705000	I have no information to back that up
2705000	2707000	But it sounds like a date to me
2707000	2709000	I mean it is a date and it hasn't happened
2709000	2711000	Yet so um
2711000	2713000	I guess it could happen
2713000	2715000	Anyways, let me just, let me just stop right here
2715000	2717000	And reiterate what I've said
2717000	2719000	In the past
2719000	2721000	Okay, three SKUs, $249, $299
2721000	2723000	$349, $299 SKU I
2723000	2725000	Speculate, Wii U system
2725000	2727000	Tablet, that's it
2727000	2729000	It's in case you already have a Wii
2729000	2731000	A Wii system, Speculate
2731000	2733000	Okay, because I don't know any information other than
2733000	2735000	Three prices
2735000	2737000	Oh and November 18th release date, but that's also
2737000	2739000	Speculation based on information, but whatever
2739000	2741000	Um, not information that I have
2741000	2743000	From Nintendo, nothing from Nintendo
2743000	2745000	Um, $299
2745000	2747000	SKU, System
2747000	2749000	Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus
2749000	2751000	Nunchuck, in case you don't
2751000	2753000	Own a Wii U
2753000	2755000	Or a Wii system
2755000	2757000	$349 SKU
2757000	2759000	System, Gamepad, Nunchuck
2759000	2761000	Remote Plus
2761000	2763000	Nintendo Land, that's my guess
2763000	2765000	So we'll see in a few days if I'm right
2765000	2767000	We'll find out on Thursday
2767000	2769000	It's going to be a busy week between the iPhone 5
2769000	2771000	On Wednesday, and then Nintendo on Thursday
2771000	2773000	This is Tech Christmas in some ways
2773000	2775000	So we'll uh, the blogs
2775000	2777000	Will be busy this week copy pasting
2777000	2779000	From each other
2779000	2781000	When they're not live blogging
2781000	2783000	Because that's the other big thing, live blogging
2783000	2785000	Anyhow, I think I just
2785000	2787000	Gave Loki an aneurysm
2787000	2789000	Let's move on, let's move on to something a little more
2789000	2791000	Indie, shall we? Something a little more under the radar
2791000	2793000	Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to
2793000	2795000	It's Steam Greenlight
2795000	2797000	Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?
2797000	2799000	It's a chance for you to basically
2799000	2801000	Help, I don't want to say it's Kickstarter
2801000	2803000	Because it's not, but it's helped generate
2803000	2805000	Buzz for indie games
2805000	2807000	People that want to get their ideas
2807000	2809000	Out there to be approved by the community
2809000	2811000	To be sold on Steam
2811000	2813000	Well, when this first went live
2813000	2815000	A lot of people were putting
2815000	2817000	A lot of crap on there
2817000	2819000	Things like Half Life 3
2819000	2821000	Showed up on Steam Greenlight
2821000	2823000	And things of that sort
2823000	2825000	So in order to kind of curb this
2825000	2827000	Valve decided to set a $100
2827000	2829000	Fee to get your project listed
2829000	2831000	On Steam Greenlight
2831000	2833000	This fee goes to Child's Play
2833000	2835000	Pretty interesting solution
2835000	2837000	A pretty ingenious way to figure it out
2837000	2839000	The Valve UI designer
2839000	2841000	Alden Kroll said
2841000	2843000	Quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play
2843000	2845000	We have no interest in making money from this
2845000	2847000	But we do need to cut down the noise
2847000	2849000	In the system
2849000	2851000	Which is causing a little bit of controversy
2851000	2853000	Because some people think, well for a true indie
2853000	2855000	$100 is a lot of money
2855000	2857000	Blah blah blah blah blah
2857000	2859000	What do you guys think? Is this fair?
2859000	2861000	I think it's a good way to make sure
2861000	2863000	People are serious about it
2863000	2865000	I think it's fair
2865000	2867000	And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice
2867000	2869000	I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing
2869000	2871000	So, very cool
2871000	2873000	Also some other changes to the system
2873000	2875000	Now when you log in
2875000	2877000	And look at Steam Greenlight
2877000	2879000	You're gonna see a smaller list
2879000	2881000	You're not gonna get thrown everything at you
2881000	2883000	Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see
2883000	2885000	Popular games and new games
2885000	2887000	On Steam Greenlight
2887000	2889000	I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna
2889000	2891000	Does that have anything to do with
2891000	2893000	Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?
2893000	2895000	It's a sequel. It's the one that was on Kickstarter
2895000	2897000	I'm gonna go upvote that right after the show
2897000	2899000	They have a demo you can play
2899000	2901000	Really? Already?
2901000	2903000	Yeah, it's pretty sweet
2903000	2905000	Over 700 submissions already since August 30th
2905000	2907000	One thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight
2907000	2909000	Just for the record
2909000	2911000	Sex games
2911000	2913000	There was a game called Seduce Me
2913000	2915000	That was on Project Greenlight
2915000	2917000	And yes, it was removed
2917000	2919000	And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve
2919000	2921000	Said, quote,
2921000	2923000	Steam has never been a leading destination
2923000	2925000	For erotic material
2925000	2927000	Greenlight doesn't aim to change that
2927000	2929000	And what a shame
2929000	2931000	Alright, I guess we can understand
2931000	2933000	Why they don't want that stuff associated
2933000	2935000	With sex is overrated
2935000	2937000	Well, because of the media sensation that would occur
2937000	2939000	Think about it
2939000	2941000	If they were to sell Booby Game
2941000	2943000	Then suddenly it's gonna be on CNN
2943000	2945000	And there would be the commentators
2945000	2947000	On Fox News
2947000	2949000	Oh my god
2949000	2951000	Can you believe on Steam
2951000	2953000	The Booby Games that are corrupting our children
2953000	2955000	They don't let your dirty money
2955000	2957000	It's Booby Steam
2957000	2961000	So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that
2961000	2963000	But I wish people weren't so freakin'
2965000	2967000	Uptight? Stick up their ass?
2967000	2969000	Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes
2969000	2971000	Have their game, dammit
2973000	2975000	Hehe, boobs
2975000	2977000	You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing
2977000	2979000	When you tell a little kid they can't do something
2979000	2981000	What's the first thing they want to do?
2981000	2983000	Just go out and do it
2983000	2985000	Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things
2985000	2987000	You know, like, vowel language
2987000	2989000	Or fucking
2989000	2991000	People are just gonna want to see it more
2991000	2993000	Going to
2993000	2995000	Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2995000	2997000	Missworldnude13
2997000	2999000	For Greenlight
2999000	3001000	Excellent suggestion
3001000	3003000	Saig, who knows a thing or two about
3003000	3005000	Developing games, is in our chatroom saying
3005000	3007000	The Greenlight stuff is cheaper
3007000	3009000	Than any other commercial game seller
3009000	3011000	Steam is $100
3011000	3013000	For one time
3013000	3015000	iOS is $99 a year
3015000	3017000	Mac is another $99 a year
3017000	3019000	So, very interesting perspective
3019000	3021000	On what that $100
3021000	3023000	If that really is too much money
3023000	3025000	Or what, is that, you know
3025000	3027000	That's the same price you're gonna pay for iOS
3027000	3029000	Which is seen as a huge indie boom
3029000	3031000	I'm sorry, it's the same amount
3031000	3033000	For one year, and then you have to renew on
3033000	3035000	iOS where you don't with Steam
3035000	3037000	It's basically
3037000	3039000	Like the free to play model
3039000	3041000	If you think about it
3041000	3043000	You buy the game, or you buy, you know
3043000	3045000	You pay your $100, and you're done
3045000	3047000	So
3047000	3049000	Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says
3049000	3051000	Yeah, like
3051000	3053000	Unbaptized babies lactating out of
3053000	3055000	Cleopatra's nipple. Oops, that was
3055000	3057000	Dante's Inferno
3057000	3059000	Good point
3059000	3061000	Alright, let's move on
3061000	3063000	Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome
3063000	3065000	Dark Sakura
3065000	3067000	Well, I don't know how clean it is, but
3067000	3069000	It's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill
3069000	3071000	About the whole
3071000	3073000	Steam box thing that we've talked about before
3073000	3075000	There is a job listing
3075000	3077000	For an industrial designer
3077000	3079000	On Valve's website
3079000	3081000	And I'll read the quote on here
3081000	3083000	We're frustrated by the lack of innovation
3083000	3085000	In the computer hardware space
3085000	3087000	So we're jumping in
3087000	3089000	Even basic input, keyboard and mouse
3089000	3091000	Hasn't really changed any meaningful way over the years
3091000	3093000	So basically, they're trying to
3093000	3095000	I guess, expand further
3095000	3097000	But they're still kind of denying the whole
3097000	3099000	Steam box thing
3099000	3101000	Why do these rumors keep perpetuating
3101000	3103000	Everywhere? It's interesting
3103000	3105000	Although, it does have me thinking
3105000	3107000	If Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time
3107000	3109000	It's because they keep hiring
3109000	3111000	For people for that
3111000	3113000	That's why
3113000	3115000	When you have someone that's being hired for like
3115000	3117000	Hardware design
3117000	3119000	Steam software
3119000	3121000	It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year
3121000	3123000	Or anytime soon
3123000	3125000	For example, they hired console developers
3125000	3127000	For Diablo 3 at Blizzard
3127000	3129000	Doesn't mean that we've seen
3129000	3131000	Diablo 3 on consoles yet
3131000	3133000	Maybe it'll happen next year
3133000	3135000	Or maybe not
3135000	3137000	I don't even see it being its own sort of system
3137000	3139000	Maybe the potential of having something as a
3139000	3141000	Computer add-on
3141000	3143000	You know
3143000	3145000	Like a combination storage device
3145000	3147000	Maybe graphics boosting
3147000	3149000	It would seem so easy
3149000	3151000	To just do a little PC in a box
3151000	3153000	That plays very basic Steam games
3153000	3155000	You know, what the hell's an Ouya?
3155000	3157000	It's kind of like that
3157000	3159000	Very, very, very bare bones
3159000	3161000	Type of system that just plugs in your TV
3161000	3163000	Maybe Valve could pump
3163000	3165000	Another couple hundred dollars worth of tech
3165000	3167000	Into it and have something that could play Portal
3167000	3169000	See, I could do that. It's called my computer
3169000	3171000	Well, they could sell it
3171000	3173000	That I already have
3173000	3175000	That I play Mass Effect on
3175000	3177000	Alright, well since we are talking
3177000	3179000	About Valve, there was something else
3179000	3181000	Valve going on this week and
3181000	3183000	I want to invite our resident Valve fanboy
3183000	3185000	At Orange Lounge Radio here on the program
3185000	3187000	To talk a little bit about this
3187000	3189000	So welcome to the show everybody, Alan!
3189000	3191000	How you doing Alan?
3191000	3193000	How was your gaming week? What have you been playing lately?
3193000	3195000	Mass Effect 3
3195000	3197000	How's the multiplayer weekend going for you?
3197000	3199000	I haven't done it yet, I need to get on that
3199000	3201000	Oh my gosh, you better hurry, you don't have much time
3201000	3203000	Bejeweled? What's with this new Bejeweled addiction you got going on?
3203000	3205000	I just remembered that Bejeweled 2 was good
3205000	3207000	And I found a copy of 3
3207000	3209000	So why not?
3209000	3211000	So what did you want to talk about tonight?
3211000	3213000	I have Half-Life news
3213000	3215000	So
3215000	3217000	In June 2004
3217000	3219000	To show off the, at the time, brand new
3219000	3221000	Source engine
3221000	3223000	That Half-Life 2 was going to come out on
3223000	3225000	In November of that year
3225000	3227000	Valve put out Half-Life Source
3227000	3229000	They basically piped the original Half-Life game
3229000	3231000	Into the Source engine
3231000	3233000	And it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done
3233000	3235000	It's like, okay
3235000	3237000	It has better lights and physics
3237000	3239000	But otherwise, it's Half-Life
3239000	3241000	1998 game
3241000	3243000	And it kind of ticked off about it
3243000	3245000	So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source project
3245000	3247000	They are just amateur programmers
3247000	3249000	They're not professionals
3249000	3251000	Not getting paid to do this, and they said
3251000	3253000	We are going to take Half-Life
3253000	3255000	And literally redesign it and program it
3255000	3257000	From the ground up
3257000	3259000	Into the Half-Life 2 engine
3259000	3261000	They had a fiasco in 2009
3261000	3263000	Where they released a really awesome trailer
3263000	3265000	And ultimately
3265000	3267000	The game didn't come out because they're like
3267000	3269000	This isn't done
3269000	3271000	They went out on a media blackout
3271000	3273000	For the last three years
3273000	3275000	And it's coming September 14th, they finally announced
3275000	3277000	That's very interesting
3277000	3279000	So because they got burned the first time
3279000	3281000	It was entirely their fault
3281000	3283000	But they went underground with it
3283000	3285000	They didn't update the Twitter, YouTube
3285000	3287000	No leaked screenshots, they're like
3287000	3289000	We are off the grid, we're still working on it
3289000	3291000	Dan just said
3291000	3293000	Sounds like Valve to me
3293000	3295000	But this isn't Valve
3295000	3297000	But Valve is kind of embracing it
3297000	3299000	Some companies would cease and desist
3299000	3301000	The shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger
3301000	3303000	Remake in Square Enix
3303000	3305000	Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there
3305000	3307000	Right?
3307000	3309000	I think they asked them to change
3309000	3311000	The name because there was some confusion
3311000	3313000	That Valve was doing it
3313000	3315000	And Valve wasn't offended
3315000	3317000	That people thought
3317000	3319000	That they themselves were making it
3319000	3321000	But they were like, you guys need to name this something else
3321000	3323000	So that people will be aware that it's an indie project
3323000	3325000	And it's your project
3325000	3327000	This is your thing
3327000	3329000	I think it's already got its clearance on Steam
3329000	3331000	Green light
3331000	3333000	Shock
3333000	3335000	Steam is probably going to host it
3335000	3337000	What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life
3337000	3339000	If anything
3339000	3341000	Get people interested in the franchise
3341000	3343000	Again, considering that it's been
3343000	3345000	8 years since Half-Life 2
3345000	3347000	Proper came out
3347000	3349000	And a good 5 years
3349000	3351000	Since Episode 2 came out
3351000	3353000	And there's still not a people
3353000	3355000	About Valve for Half-Life 3
3355000	3357000	So they also
3357000	3359000	Said for this remake
3359000	3361000	They added some dialogue
3361000	3363000	They did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it
3363000	3365000	More interesting, but otherwise it's a shot for shot
3365000	3367000	Remake
3367000	3369000	The trailer is still on YouTube from 3 years ago
3369000	3371000	If you haven't seen the trailer, you should watch it
3371000	3373000	It's really awesome
3373000	3375000	And so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out?
3375000	3377000	It's free, why wouldn't I?
3377000	3379000	And you'll be playing through it?
3379000	3381000	So I'll see you in a week?
3381000	3383000	Before we say goodbye for now
3383000	3385000	Thank you for the update
3385000	3387000	I unfortunately am very ignorant
3387000	3389000	When it comes to Half-Life
3389000	3391000	We don't have time to play every single game
3391000	3393000	But Alan will make me play it
3393000	3395000	At some point I'm sure
3395000	3397000	And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it
3397000	3399000	Tigerclaw in our chat room says
3399000	3401000	It's better they continue working on it
3401000	3403000	And when they feel it's ready, to release it
3403000	3405000	No reason to release a buggy game
3405000	3407000	If Half-Life 3 ever comes out
3407000	3409000	It'll probably go multi-platform
3409000	3411000	The reason I'm teasing Alan with that idea
3411000	3413000	Is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles
3413000	3415000	Maybe it'll be a PC and
3415000	3417000	Playstation 4 exclusive
3417000	3419000	Or something like that
3419000	3421000	That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy
3421000	3423000	About the game
3423000	3425000	We shall see, however
3425000	3427000	Alright, let's move on with some other news
3427000	3429000	Loki
3429000	3431000	To register participation for this week's episode
3431000	3433000	Of Orange Lounge Radio on
3433000	3435000	vognetwork.com
3435000	3437000	Use the passphrase, thumb
3437000	3439000	So this is kind of interesting
3439000	3441000	I talked about a game I played during the week
3441000	3443000	Which is called McPixel
3443000	3445000	And this weekend they actually
3445000	3447000	Went about a unique way to advertise the game
3447000	3449000	It's on the front page
3449000	3451000	Of the Pirate Bay
3451000	3453000	Pirate Bay being a very notorious
3453000	3455000	Website for
3455000	3457000	Piracy
3457000	3459000	McPixel, they have a
3459000	3461000	Basically a little bit of a letter
3461000	3463000	To people, it's like
3463000	3465000	Hi, I'm SOS
3465000	3467000	Video games, but not in a big company
3467000	3469000	I make games I want to make
3469000	3471000	I know that not everyone
3471000	3473000	Can afford entertainment, but everyone needs it
3473000	3475000	And even though I make games
3475000	3477000	For a living
3477000	3479000	I am most happy to just see people
3479000	3481000	Enjoy them
3481000	3483000	So today you can download a torrent of my game
3483000	3485000	And if you like, throw some coins
3485000	3487000	In my general direction
3487000	3489000	And so they actually have that on there
3489000	3491000	You can download a torrent
3491000	3493000	For it and download it for free
3493000	3495000	Or you can
3495000	3497000	Once you've done that and you play it
3497000	3499000	You can decide to donate money to
3499000	3501000	You know, to them
3501000	3503000	Isn't this what Radiohead did for one of their albums
3503000	3505000	Like five years ago?
3505000	3507000	I don't remember, but I know that this is what
3507000	3509000	Also like
3509000	3511000	Oh, the RiffTrax guys do
3511000	3513000	Because they're like, listen, we know that
3513000	3515000	Not everybody, you know, downloads these from us
3515000	3517000	But, you know, if you like them
3517000	3519000	You know, maybe kick us some money
3519000	3521000	Well, RiffTrax is in a little
3521000	3523000	Bit of a stickier situation though
3523000	3525000	Because they are doing parody art
3525000	3527000	Of movies that you kind of already
3527000	3529000	Have to own, like they can't put it out there
3529000	3531000	Attaching it to the movie
3531000	3533000	So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff
3533000	3535000	For them to get that, but
3535000	3537000	You know, they're in a weird place
3537000	3539000	It's also a lot more convenient than trying to sync that stuff up
3539000	3541000	Because I've synced that stuff up before
3541000	3543000	Like I'll have, we watch all the Twilight movies
3543000	3545000	With the RiffTrax stuff on there
3545000	3547000	And I had the DVD for Twilight
3547000	3549000	But man, downloading the
3549000	3551000	Precinct stuff is way easier than
3551000	3553000	Having to have a second source
3553000	3555000	To play the MP3 at the same time as the audio
3555000	3557000	Because it gets off sync pretty easy
3557000	3559000	Alright
3559000	3561000	Um
3561000	3563000	What do you think, um, I mean
3563000	3565000	I don't know if there's a lot to think about this
3565000	3567000	Because clearly no big publisher is ever
3567000	3569000	Going to do anything like this, but
3569000	3571000	Do you think the guy will actually make some money?
3571000	3573000	He'll probably make some money, I mean the game's not that expensive
3573000	3575000	He probably didn't spend that much
3575000	3577000	Money on it, so
3577000	3579000	I mean, it's exposure to him
3579000	3581000	And, you know, if he figures that people are gonna
3581000	3583000	Pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces
3583000	3585000	And saying, hey, you know what
3585000	3587000	Um, at least donate some money
3587000	3589000	If you like it, you know, donate a dollar, five dollars
3589000	3591000	Whatever
3591000	3593000	It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity
3593000	3595000	About a game that, let's be real,
3595000	3597000	People probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway
3597000	3599000	Unfortunately
3599000	3601000	It's really hard for indie games to get press
3601000	3603000	Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere
3603000	3605000	Yeah, exactly, and the other thing too
3605000	3607000	Like, you look at some of the people, it's much like
3607000	3609000	The Humble Bundle, where, you know, some people
3609000	3611000	Just pay a penny or whatever to get it
3611000	3613000	But there's people that, like, donated a hundred
3613000	3615000	One dollar, or a hundred and forty-one dollars for this game
3615000	3617000	The Brony Bundle group
3617000	3619000	On Twitter or whatever? That always, um
3619000	3621000	I get a kick out of that
3621000	3623000	People that band together to donate lots of money
3623000	3625000	But it's, you know, it is a good cause
3625000	3627000	I love those Humble Bundles, those are always good times
3627000	3629000	But yeah, they've got, like, in fact, let's see here
3629000	3631000	Um, I was trying to see
3631000	3633000	The, uh, there's a couple of people
3633000	3635000	That did, uh, you know, a hundred and forty dollars
3635000	3637000	Uh, one hundred and thirty-three dollars
3637000	3639000	Sixty-seven, there's a bunch in the fifties
3639000	3641000	And the average right now, this is the average price
3641000	3643000	That people are paying for is two dollars and fifty-eight cents
3643000	3645000	Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment
3645000	3647000	Uh, Neesh said, um, Radiohead
3647000	3649000	Did this for their In Rainbows album
3649000	3651000	And said it brought more money to them
3651000	3653000	Than, um, all their other albums combined
3653000	3655000	You know why? Because they cut out
3655000	3657000	The record label by doing that
3657000	3659000	Well, yeah, but still
3659000	3661000	And if you are
3661000	3663000	I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners
3663000	3665000	Because this is only going for about another
3665000	3667000	Four hours
3667000	3669000	If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend
3669000	3671000	Go downloading the torrent
3671000	3673000	While you still can
3673000	3675000	And you can do that guilt-free
3675000	3677000	And you are totally a law-abiding citizen
3677000	3679000	Because the creator has given his blessing
3679000	3681000	He wants this to happen
3681000	3683000	To get the word out
3683000	3685000	Although, one little problem with that
3685000	3687000	Is that, you know, he says that
3687000	3689000	You know, you download the torrent
3689000	3691000	And there's, you know, it's only available
3691000	3693000	For four hours, but
3693000	3695000	Once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet
3695000	3697000	And there's going to be someone always hosting that game
3697000	3699000	Or hosting, you know, seeding it, so
3701000	3703000	Yeah
3703000	3705000	Alright, well, from one controversial viewpoint
3705000	3707000	On piracy to another, Ubisoft
3707000	3709000	You know, they're always on
3709000	3711000	DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap
3711000	3713000	Over the years, um, or I should say
3713000	3715000	Over the years, it's only really been about
3715000	3717000	A couple years, but, um, Ubisoft
3717000	3719000	Is now changing their policy on this
3719000	3721000	Always-on DRM, you know, it's just been too much
3721000	3723000	Headache and so forth, I think some of us
3723000	3725000	Saw this coming, but here's the new DRM
3725000	3727000	Policy, according to Stephanie
3727000	3729000	Parodi, who's the company's worldwide director
3729000	3731000	For online games, Ubisoft PC games
3731000	3733000	Are now going to require a one-time
3733000	3735000	Online activation when you first
3735000	3737000	Install the game, then you can
3737000	3739000	You are free to play the game offline
3739000	3741000	And they claim this has been Ubisoft's
3741000	3743000	Policy since June of 2011
3743000	3745000	But, uh, it's
3745000	3747000	Been noticed that maybe there's been some
3747000	3749000	Games that didn't get that memo, because
3749000	3751000	Always-on we've seen in some more recent releases
3751000	3753000	However, um
3753000	3755000	This is going to be their new policy moving
3755000	3757000	Forward. A fair compromise?
3757000	3759000	What do y'all think?
3759000	3761000	It's fair
3761000	3763000	I do think it's fair
3763000	3765000	But I always have concern
3765000	3767000	For people that can't get
3767000	3769000	That online connection
3769000	3771000	And, you know, there are still some people
3771000	3773000	In the world that can't get that online connection
3773000	3775000	I'm not just talking about people who live in the sticks
3775000	3777000	But I'm talking about, like, military service people
3777000	3779000	Overseas, you know, sometimes
3779000	3781000	Want to play some games to, you know,
3781000	3783000	Blow off steam a little bit
3783000	3785000	And, you know, I do realize they can use
3785000	3787000	The satellite connections and some of these things
3787000	3789000	But that's not always a reality, or it's expensive
3789000	3791000	Or what have you, so
3791000	3793000	I just hope there might be some workarounds
3793000	3795000	Some considerations made for people
3795000	3797000	Who really are trying to do the right
3797000	3799000	Thing. They usually do that
3799000	3801000	With a lot of software that phones
3801000	3803000	Home is they'll have, you know, the
3803000	3805000	Alternate means of, you know
3805000	3807000	It usually involves, you know, calling up a
3807000	3809000	Number and you give them, you know, whatever
3809000	3811000	And they give you authentication code or something
3811000	3813000	That would be fair. I hope there is some type of
3813000	3815000	Little plan B in the small print
3815000	3817000	For people that truly can't,
3817000	3819000	You know, which is how they create a lot of those
3819000	3821000	Cracks out there for software, but I'm
3821000	3823000	Just saying, you know, it's
3823000	3825000	I mean, they're already expected to be
3825000	3827000	Having 93% of their software
3827000	3829000	Pirated, so
3829000	3831000	Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85
3831000	3833000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on
3833000	3835000	We're running along this segment, of course
3835000	3837000	But we knew we would. DarkSakura
3837000	3839000	I'll try to keep this one short then
3839000	3841000	Basically, the
3841000	3843000	Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being
3843000	3845000	Developed by
3845000	3847000	Looks like Straight Right
3847000	3849000	Who is out of Australia
3849000	3851000	And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up
3851000	3853000	Basically saying that
3853000	3855000	They've been putting a lot of work into this
3855000	3857000	It's not going to be a rushed deal
3857000	3859000	They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's
3859000	3861000	Launch and that it's supposed to be amazing
3861000	3863000	Well, thank god they didn't
3863000	3865000	Come out and say, you know what, we're going to
3865000	3867000	Half-ass it
3867000	3869000	I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out
3869000	3871000	And say, eh, whatever
3871000	3873000	You know, you'll like what you get
3873000	3875000	Deal with it. They're saying it's supposed to look just
3875000	3877000	As good as the other console versions
3877000	3879000	And, I mean, I'm kind of
3879000	3881000	Interested to see exactly how it plays
3881000	3883000	With the little Wii U pad thing
3883000	3885000	Wait, did they really say that? Just as good
3885000	3887000	As the other console versions? That's exactly what they said
3887000	3889000	It will look just as good
3889000	3891000	Now, wouldn't you think
3891000	3893000	With a new console coming out
3893000	3895000	You'd want to say, better
3895000	3897000	A new console using old technology?
3897000	3899000	I just
3899000	3901000	How can it be any better? I'm just saying
3901000	3903000	It's not helping the case of the Wii U
3903000	3905000	It's using old tech. It's using the Wii
3905000	3907000	I'm just saying
3907000	3909000	So, I would expect it to look as good as a Wii
3909000	3911000	I'm being sensationalist
3911000	3913000	And latching onto that one quote
3913000	3915000	My headline, my pull quote
3915000	3917000	Mass Effect 3 will look about as good
3917000	3919000	As it does on the other consoles on the Wii U
3919000	3921000	There's my pull quote
3921000	3923000	Orange Lounge Radio exclusive
3923000	3925000	Rob
3925000	3927000	Yes?
3927000	3929000	There is a quote here
3929000	3931000	It says
3931000	3933000	This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time
3933000	3935000	There is a significant technical challenge
3935000	3937000	Bringing the game from its original format
3937000	3939000	To the Wii U. It's new, different
3939000	3941000	And sophisticated piece of hardware
3941000	3943000	As of
3943000	3945000	So there's a good deal of technical energy
3945000	3947000	That's being expended to make that happen
3949000	3951000	I mean, you have to see the size of the shoehorn
3951000	3953000	We need to have
3953000	3955000	In order to get that tablet to work
3955000	3957000	I mean, seriously
3957000	3959000	It's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns
3959000	3961000	Of that size
3961000	3963000	We used a hammer
3963000	3965000	Look, I will say
3965000	3967000	Because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy
3967000	3969000	I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version
3969000	3971000	I really kind of wanted to see how it works
3971000	3973000	With the screen and everything
3973000	3975000	I'm very curious. It could be interesting
3975000	3977000	This is me
3977000	3979000	With no fucks left to give
3979000	3981000	Stop
3981000	3983000	I'm just gonna play it on PC
3983000	3985000	It's already fun
3985000	3987000	Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen
3987000	3989000	Or something, but I don't care
3989000	3991000	If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there
3991000	3993000	And a copy of Mass Effect 3
3993000	3995000	You know when you come over you'd be like
3995000	3997000	I want to kind of see it
3997000	3999000	I want it to make me buy a Wii U
3999000	4001000	What would be enough
4001000	4003000	To make you buy a Wii U?
4003000	4005000	Fuck if I knew
4005000	4007000	How about a good system?
4007000	4009000	How about it being good?
4009000	4011000	How about it having good games?
4011000	4013000	I'm not saying it doesn't have good games
4013000	4015000	We don't know yet
4015000	4017000	This is the problem with Mass Effect 3
4017000	4019000	I already have Mass Effect 3
4019000	4021000	Shut up
4021000	4023000	Uh oh, uh oh
4023000	4025000	Dan's got something to say
4025000	4027000	See this is from the woman
4027000	4029000	Who wanted a Wii to start with
4029000	4031000	She waited in line overnight
4031000	4033000	I was like, fuck the Wii
4033000	4035000	It's last gen
4035000	4037000	This is the man who played
4037000	4039000	Twilight Princess for hours
4039000	4041000	I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours
4041000	4043000	I didn't play through Twilight Princess
4043000	4045000	The Zelda games are good
4045000	4047000	But at the same time
4047000	4049000	I try to do surgery
4049000	4051000	I just think it's a stupid idea
4051000	4053000	He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying
4053000	4055000	I already have Mass Effect
4055000	4059000	Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect
4059000	4061000	How about you shut the fuck up
4061000	4063000	And let me finish what I was saying
4063000	4065000	Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it
4065000	4067000	Yeah
4067000	4069000	That was what I was trying to say, dumb butt
4069000	4071000	Goody goody gumdrops
4071000	4073000	Give Rob back his mic
4073000	4075000	Give Rob back his mic
4075000	4077000	No
4077000	4079000	To be fair
4079000	4081000	Dan's making a point we've made on this show before
4081000	4083000	It's hard to get excited about
4083000	4085000	You know, Arkham City redone
4085000	4087000	Mass Effect 3 redone
4087000	4089000	It's not even that redone
4089000	4091000	You can tilt the Wii U tablet
4091000	4093000	To move the battering round
4093000	4095000	You can do that also with the 6 axis controller
4095000	4097000	On the PS3 version
4097000	4099000	I would love
4099000	4101000	Please Nintendo
4101000	4103000	Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday
4103000	4105000	And be like, here's what's coming
4105000	4107000	It better have like
4107000	4109000	Shut up Dan
4109000	4111000	Don't make me buy it, okay
4111000	4113000	But no seriously, they could come out Thursday and say
4113000	4115000	You know, we've got this Zelda
4115000	4117000	Or this F-Zero
4117000	4119000	Or this new IP that looks really cute
4119000	4121000	I would like for that to happen
4121000	4123000	That would make me very happy
4123000	4125000	The only thing I fear
4125000	4127000	Is that there's a new excite truck
4127000	4129000	I want the bite if it's a new excite truck
4129000	4131000	Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet
4131000	4133000	Are you kidding?
4133000	4135000	It would be amazing
4135000	4137000	It would be absolutely amazing
4137000	4139000	Use a mic
4139000	4141000	Alright
4141000	4143000	Let's move on
4143000	4145000	I was still
4145000	4147000	Oh I'm sorry, go ahead
4147000	4149000	Shut up
4149000	4151000	I'm done
4153000	4155000	Are you gonna let him win?
4155000	4157000	I'll get him later
4157000	4159000	Oh, okay
4159000	4161000	Let's travel around the world
4161000	4163000	And check out release dates of games that are coming out
4163000	4165000	A little sooner than a Wii U
4165000	4167000	There's actually some stuff coming out this week
4167000	4169000	Finding Nemo Escape to Big Blue
4169000	4171000	The special edition being
4171000	4173000	re-released now by Disney Interactive
4173000	4175000	As opposed to THQ because guess what?
4175000	4177000	They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo
4177000	4179000	That they're re-releasing into theaters
4179000	4181000	Kind of appropriate
4181000	4183000	It's also coming out on the 3DS as well
4183000	4185000	So it's not just the DS this time
4185000	4187000	Because I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements
4187000	4189000	What happened to movies on the 3DS?
4189000	4191000	Wasn't that supposed to be a thing?
4191000	4193000	Yeah
4193000	4195000	That's a serious question
4195000	4197000	They had a couple
4197000	4199000	They did the Tekken 1
4199000	4201000	Oh, that's right
4201000	4203000	I mean
4203000	4205000	The Tekken 1
4205000	4207000	Didn't they do Pokemon anime on Game Boy Advance cartridges?
4207000	4209000	Where's my Tron legacy?
4209000	4211000	It was a different time
4211000	4213000	That was in E3, remember?
4213000	4215000	When they had those demos for it
4215000	4217000	Because that technology just vaporized
4217000	4219000	And they gave you free headphones
4219000	4221000	Okay, let me put it this way
4221000	4223000	A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises
4223000	4225000	Never comes to fruition like online
4225000	4227000	But
4227000	4229000	There's a dig at the Wii U
4229000	4231000	I'm telling you that online's gonna suck
4231000	4233000	Battlefield 3
4233000	4235000	The premium edition for 60 bucks
4235000	4237000	You get all the DLC
4237000	4239000	It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360
4239000	4241000	This week
4241000	4243000	NHL 13 on PS3 and 360
4243000	4245000	Tekken Tag Tournament 2
4245000	4247000	For PS3 and 360
4247000	4249000	Also NHL The Stanley Cup Collector's Edition
4249000	4251000	Which is probably a complete waste of money
4251000	4253000	Unless you like DLC
4253000	4257000	That is coming out for 80 bucks on PS3 and 360
4257000	4259000	And
4259000	4261000	What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game
4261000	4265000	For 2012 and probably 2013
4265000	4267000	NBA Baller Beats
4267000	4269000	For Xbox 360
4269000	4271000	Fuck yes
4271000	4273000	The game where you have to dribble a basketball
4273000	4275000	To the beat of the music
4275000	4277000	On my carpet
4277000	4279000	In front of Kinect
4279000	4281000	Because that's gonna fucking work
4281000	4283000	That is coming out this week
4283000	4285000	This game is gonna scare the shit out of the cats
4285000	4287000	I can't wait
4287000	4289000	One week from today
4289000	4291000	Kirby's Dream Land
4291000	4293000	Collector's Special Edition
4293000	4295000	That's too many fucking adjectives
4295000	4297000	Collector's Special Edition is too much
4297000	4299000	Just call it a
4299000	4301000	Special Edition or Collector's Edition
4301000	4303000	It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition
4303000	4305000	Limited
4305000	4307000	It can't be a 20 years anniversary edition
4307000	4309000	Just call it
4309000	4311000	Virtual Console Games we could have released
4311000	4313000	But we decided to put them on a fucking cart
4313000	4315000	Or I'm sorry, CD
4315000	4317000	DVD, whatever, disc
4317000	4319000	It has a cart painted on it
4319000	4321000	Hey you know what though?
4321000	4323000	And it comes with a special gold cartridge
4323000	4325000	That has absolutely nothing inside it
4325000	4327000	At the very least, at least there is
4327000	4329000	More than one ROM on this fucking disc
4329000	4331000	As opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars
4331000	4333000	As a limited edition
4333000	4335000	More than having people buy it for $80
4335000	4337000	It has that little retrospective
4337000	4339000	Hallway new thing in it
4339000	4341000	Look at that
4341000	4343000	Well bravo for Nintendo
4343000	4345000	For putting a minute
4345000	4347000	Bit of effort into it
4347000	4349000	Act deft in our chatroom
4349000	4351000	At live.vognetwork.com
4351000	4353000	Fuck you Loki, Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants
4353000	4355000	Orange right says
4355000	4357000	Super Hyper Kirby EX
4357000	4359000	Plus Alpha Zero Turbo
4359000	4361000	And then I added for matching service
4361000	4363000	You know what? Kirby sucks
4363000	4365000	No, Kirby doesn't suck
4365000	4367000	Actually he does suck
4367000	4369000	That is the truth
4369000	4371000	He also blows
4371000	4373000	Kirby blows
4373000	4375000	He's gone from suck to blow
4375000	4377000	Moving on
4377000	4379000	Japanese releases
4379000	4381000	Tekken Tag Tournament 2
4381000	4383000	They get in on the fun this week as well
4383000	4385000	September 13 is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360
4385000	4387000	Going to the Playstation 3
4387000	4389000	Of course, same game there as well
4389000	4391000	And a game called Excel World
4391000	4393000	Ginyoku no Kakuse
4393000	4395000	Comes out, limited and regular editions
4395000	4397000	From also
4397000	4399000	That sounds terribly boring, a whole world based on
4399000	4401000	A database program
4401000	4403000	Not looking forward to that
4403000	4405000	Nothing on the Vita
4405000	4407000	The little big planet is just a couple weeks away
4407000	4409000	At this point in Japan
4409000	4411000	Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week
4411000	4413000	Metarot 7
4413000	4415000	Kabuto and Kuwagata versions
4415000	4417000	I don't know what game this
4417000	4419000	This is two separate editions
4419000	4421000	So it looks like little
4421000	4423000	This looks like fighting mech robots
4423000	4425000	Looks like you collect little mech robots
4425000	4427000	And fight them to the death
4427000	4429000	Oh shoot
4429000	4431000	I know what this is
4431000	4433000	Tell me that's not a total Pokemon inspired
4433000	4435000	Screenshot right there
4435000	4437000	I watched some of this
4437000	4439000	Where the guy gets
4439000	4441000	These little robots
4441000	4443000	It turned out that his dad
4443000	4445000	Played these two or something
4445000	4447000	He tried to beat up his little robot
4447000	4449000	But his robot wins
4449000	4451000	And tears up his house in the meantime
4451000	4453000	And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots
4453000	4455000	I don't remember
4455000	4457000	I only just saw it once
4457000	4459000	Robots tear up a house? Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?
4459000	4461000	Little teeny robots
4461000	4463000	Sengoku Musou
4463000	4465000	Chronicles 2
4465000	4467000	On the 3DS as well
4467000	4469000	You guys know what that is right?
4469000	4471000	Once again
4471000	4473000	And lastly but not least
4473000	4475000	Kiyoshitsu comes out from Nintendo
4475000	4477000	On the 3DS this week
4477000	4479000	This game is not something that looks
4479000	4481000	It's an artist program
4481000	4483000	Oh this was one of the crazy wacky games
4483000	4485000	It's art academy
4485000	4487000	I can't remember what it's coming out as
4487000	4489000	It's art drawing things
4489000	4491000	Still life, art
4491000	4493000	We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences
4493000	4495000	What the hell is this?
4495000	4497000	It's coming out in October over here
4497000	4499000	I like that painting of the doggy
4499000	4501000	Not bad
4501000	4503000	Alright there you go that's Japanese releases
4503000	4505000	I think it's like art academy you can draw everything
4505000	4507000	I think is what it's called or something
4507000	4509000	We'll figure it out
4509000	4511000	Go into the UK
4511000	4513000	I'm sorry I was still looking at this funny screenshot
4513000	4515000	So in the UK on the 11th
4515000	4517000	We have Battlefield 3 Armored Kill
4517000	4519000	On the 14th Joe Danger 2
4519000	4521000	The movie Tekken Tag Tournament 2
4521000	4523000	And Chaos Off Deponia
4523000	4525000	And
4525000	4527000	That's it
4527000	4529000	Alright just a couple more news stories
4529000	4531000	For you guys than the classic game of the week
4531000	4533000	But first Loki
4533000	4535000	So more Vita hacking
4535000	4537000	Independent developer
4537000	4539000	Yifan Lu
4539000	4541000	Has found an exploit that allows
4541000	4543000	Retail systems to run native
4543000	4545000	Homebrew Vita code
4545000	4547000	As opposed to running
4547000	4549000	PSP
4549000	4551000	Homebrew stuff because that's been the last few
4551000	4553000	Hacks
4553000	4555000	Okay hey we got some
4555000	4557000	Homebrew to run in the PSP mode or whatever
4557000	4559000	Using one of the games
4559000	4561000	That are out there that you can
4561000	4563000	Download to your console
4563000	4565000	Of course
4565000	4567000	He's basically
4567000	4569000	Saying you know we're not
4569000	4571000	I'm gonna not make anything that
4571000	4573000	Will benefit piracy
4573000	4575000	This tool is in fact
4575000	4577000	This tool in fact cannot be used for loading
4577000	4579000	Backups or pirated content even if I
4579000	4581000	Wanted to because of the physical limitations
4581000	4583000	Of the exploit however
4583000	4585000	He says that you know
4585000	4587000	This kind of stuff could lead
4587000	4589000	To people developing a better
4589000	4591000	Method that could lead to that stuff
4591000	4593000	But as of right now he is
4593000	4595000	In no way endorsing piracy
4595000	4597000	Even though everyone thinks that
4597000	4599000	Homebrew equals piracy but that's
4599000	4601000	Kind of the
4601000	4603000	Situation that we're in right now
4603000	4605000	Of course he hasn't released any information on it yet
4605000	4607000	Because like before whenever
4607000	4609000	They would release an exploit they would
4609000	4611000	Patch whatever game was involved with it
4611000	4613000	So hopefully
4613000	4615000	This one isn't game reliant
4615000	4617000	Like the last few have been
4619000	4621000	How quick do you think
4621000	4623000	Sony will patch this up I mean here we go
4623000	4625000	Again if it's game reliant pretty
4625000	4627000	Quick if it's not it might take a little
4627000	4629000	Bit or if it's even something they can
4629000	4631000	Patch it I mean they may they should be
4631000	4633000	Able to patch it pretty quick and so we don't know how they're
4633000	4635000	Doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to
4635000	4637000	Get the jump on because before it used to be like
4637000	4639000	You know even before they released something hey
4639000	4641000	You know this is the game
4641000	4643000	That you need to have in order to
4643000	4645000	You know run this modified
4645000	4647000	Save that loads you know the bootloader
4647000	4649000	For some PSP homebrew
4649000	4651000	Before that would run in PSP mode but now that
4651000	4653000	It's in Vita mode you have more
4653000	4655000	Access to memory
4655000	4657000	And processing power and that kind of stuff
4657000	4659000	It's not throttled like it was before
4659000	4661000	So hopefully
4661000	4663000	I mean I understand
4663000	4665000	He's hoping that by saying oh
4665000	4667000	Yeah it's not going to really run any
4667000	4669000	You know sort of exploit
4669000	4671000	That'll allow you the pirate games
4671000	4673000	That he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer
4673000	4675000	But I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that
4675000	4677000	Shit as soon as they can
4677000	4679000	Alright one more story for you guys
4679000	4681000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
4681000	4683000	And this is about what was a
4683000	4685000	Classic video game network at one
4685000	4687000	Point G4
4687000	4689000	Some rumors going around about G4 look I want to make
4689000	4691000	It clear G4 hasn't been a gaming
4691000	4693000	Network for several years at this point
4693000	4695000	You know they switched to that whole
4695000	4697000	Cops reruns and stuff quite some time
4697000	4699000	What are their ties to gaming at this point
4699000	4701000	X-Play and Attack of the Show
4701000	4703000	Sometimes but X-Play now doesn't have
4703000	4705000	Adam Sessler obviously
4705000	4707000	Cause he's gone
4707000	4709000	Is Morgan Webb still there though?
4709000	4711000	I think Morgan Webb's still there
4711000	4713000	Even Attack of the Show's lost a lot
4713000	4715000	Of their
4715000	4717000	Casts that people would watch it for
4717000	4719000	Well Variety published an article
4719000	4721000	This week that G4 is going geek
4721000	4723000	And more chic and this is rumor
4723000	4725000	Right now but because G4 is owned by
4725000	4727000	NBC Universal, Comcast
4727000	4729000	They want to change
4729000	4731000	G4 into a direction that's more
4731000	4733000	Like GQ
4733000	4735000	The modern male magazine
4735000	4737000	So basically I don't know how it's
4737000	4739000	More modern male
4739000	4741000	More refined I guess
4741000	4743000	I don't know what kind of programming that would entail
4743000	4745000	So basically Spike but for high brow
4745000	4747000	People
4747000	4749000	For hipsters
4749000	4751000	So we're not going to have episodes of
4751000	4753000	A Thousand Ways to Die
4753000	4755000	Involve women with big boobs
4755000	4757000	Bouncing up and down or explosions
4757000	4759000	I'm not really interested
4759000	4761000	Me neither because Logo still has
4761000	4763000	RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing
4763000	4765000	On cable worth watching
4765000	4767000	So high brow are they talking about more like GQ
4767000	4769000	So they're going to start rerunning episodes of
4769000	4771000	Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that
4771000	4773000	Is that how they're going? Is it going to be like the
4773000	4775000	Metrosexual channel or something?
4775000	4777000	Who knows? I don't know
4777000	4779000	Maybe the guys who flip the
4779000	4781000	Million Dollar Homes
4781000	4783000	The real estate shows
4783000	4785000	It's going to be garbage whatever it is
4785000	4787000	We'll see we'll see but regardless
4787000	4789000	Any video game ties
4789000	4791000	You might have to this network are
4791000	4793000	Looking to be severed pretty soon
4793000	4795000	It hasn't been dumped from
4795000	4797000	Satellite providers at this point
4797000	4799000	They're not doing too well
4799000	4801000	Like you said there's been a huge turnover and so forth
4801000	4803000	So
4803000	4805000	American Ninja Warrior may not have
4805000	4807000	A place on GQ
4807000	4809000	That actually was a pretty good show
4809000	4811000	There's nothing to say about this
4811000	4813000	It's probably going to get a new name
4813000	4815000	That's the other reason that makes this a big deal
4815000	4817000	Is because G4 will probably become something
4817000	4819000	I can tell you right now American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike
4819000	4821000	So I'm sure that won't be gone for long
4823000	4825000	So there you go
4825000	4827000	We'll talk a little more about this story in Part B
4827000	4829000	With our FUGO Question of the Week
4829000	4831000	But for now
4831000	4833000	Let's take a trip down memory lane
4833000	4835000	For a moment shall we?
4835000	4837000	With a segment we call
4837000	4839000	The Classic Game of the Week
4839000	4841000	Where DarkSakura steps into the classic
4841000	4843000	Gaming vault
4843000	4845000	Moves Shirmi aside
4845000	4847000	Blows the dust off the cabinet
4847000	4849000	Shirmi's probably still sitting in her older box
4849000	4851000	Pulls out a game that she says
4851000	4853000	Hey! Play this game this week
4853000	4855000	You ungrateful little brat
4855000	4857000	This comes from a time before there was
4857000	4859000	Ultra Limited Collector
4859000	4861000	Mega Edition for Special
4861000	4863000	Week, whatever it is
4863000	4865000	Midnight Special Edition
4865000	4867000	That sounds kinky
4867000	4869000	Doesn't it? A little bit?
4869000	4871000	Well this game is not so kinky
4871000	4873000	But this is a game I looked at it and I went really?
4873000	4875000	In 200 episodes plus
4875000	4877000	Of this segment she has not done this game?
4877000	4879000	I checked
4879000	4881000	Well it's about fucking time this week DarkSakura
4881000	4883000	What is the Classic Game of the Week?
4883000	4885000	Blaster Master
4885000	4887000	In Japan it was called
4887000	4889000	Chōwakusei Senki Meta Fight
4889000	4891000	Which translates to
4891000	4893000	Planetary War Record Meta Fight
4893000	4895000	Which honestly is a really
4895000	4897000	Freaking cool name
4897000	4899000	It came out in the US in
4899000	4901000	November 1988 and in Europe
4901000	4903000	On April 25th, 1991
4903000	4905000	Yeah they had to wait a long ass time to get this
4905000	4907000	We just had to wait a few months after Japan
4907000	4909000	But yeah
4909000	4911000	This game went from having
4911000	4913000	A killer story in Japan
4913000	4915000	To having the dumbest
4915000	4917000	Story ever in the US
4917000	4919000	I mean that doesn't affect how awesome
4919000	4921000	The game itself was
4921000	4923000	Ok get this
4923000	4925000	The Japanese version you're like
4925000	4927000	An explorer landing on Sophia III
4927000	4929000	The planet
4929000	4931000	And you have to
4931000	4933000	Explore where this ancient civilization was
4933000	4935000	And stop this evil emperor
4935000	4937000	And go through the whole planet
4937000	4939000	Dan shut up
4939000	4941000	Hold on I'm getting Dan to comment
4941000	4943000	No seriously man
4943000	4945000	It's a game where you drive a tank to save a frog
4945000	4947000	In the US one
4947000	4949000	Jamie never played Blaster Master
4949000	4951000	She doesn't know nothing about Blaster Master
4951000	4953000	I'm gonna tell you about Blaster Master
4953000	4955000	Blaster Master is awesome
4955000	4957000	First of all it's by Sunsoft
4957000	4959000	So you know that the music is super
4959000	4961000	Choice for the NES
4961000	4963000	Second of all it's tough as fucking nails
4963000	4965000	The game is really
4965000	4967000	Really hard even for a NES game
4967000	4969000	I mean it is Nintendo hard
4969000	4971000	And there's no save function
4971000	4973000	Which is pretty brutal cause it's not a
4973000	4975000	Short game and you upgrade the tank
4975000	4977000	And when you die
4977000	4979000	And the tank is called Sophia in the NES version
4979000	4981000	Sophia III which I always thought was really
4981000	4983000	Kind of weird but it's cute in a way
4983000	4985000	And you can make it fly
4985000	4987000	You can drive on walls
4987000	4989000	You can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls
4989000	4991000	You can jump out of the tank
4991000	4993000	And your little dude runs around
4993000	4995000	Or you can go into like caves and you run around
4995000	4997000	Like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons
4997000	4999000	Independently of the character
4999000	5001000	Who's named Jason and the tank
5001000	5003000	Which once again is named Sophia
5003000	5005000	I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline
5005000	5007000	Cause who fucking cares
5007000	5009000	The Japanese version
5009000	5011000	The Japanese version was a
5011000	5013000	Failure
5013000	5015000	The Nintendo version is a classic
5015000	5017000	Is it both Nintendo?
5017000	5019000	No no no no
5019000	5021000	The NES version
5021000	5023000	Whatever you completely didn't
5023000	5025000	Listen to anything that I said
5025000	5027000	Rob take the mic please
5027000	5029000	The Japanese version of an epic storyline
5029000	5031000	It was so wonderful
5031000	5033000	The Nintendo version you drive a tank
5033000	5035000	To save a frog
5035000	5037000	It's awesome
5037000	5039000	Saves your frog
5039000	5041000	And you can use the pause trick and kill the bosses real easy
5041000	5043000	It's amazing
5043000	5045000	The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it and then they die
5051000	5053000	Now to be fair we might have somebody who's like 14
5053000	5055000	Listening to this program with their parents
5055000	5057000	For permission of course
5057000	5059000	Jamie please
5059000	5061000	Let's continue telling the listeners about
5061000	5063000	Master Master
5063000	5065000	Well as Dan said there is no save feature
5065000	5067000	Whatever
5067000	5069000	Shut up
5071000	5073000	Jason and Sophia
5073000	5075000	Have different power meters
5075000	5077000	So they can
5077000	5079000	They take
5079000	5081000	Dan you're flustering her
5081000	5083000	Let her get through the segment
5083000	5085000	And then fluster her while we're on break
5085000	5087000	I'm about to cut a bitch
5087000	5089000	At any rate
5089000	5091000	You've got different power meters
5091000	5093000	You can power up separately
5093000	5095000	You get 5 continues which he didn't say
5095000	5097000	And you can
5097000	5099000	Restart the game at the same level
5099000	5101000	In which you lost all of your lives
5101000	5103000	You have a hover gauge that
5103000	5105000	Controls how much thrust
5105000	5107000	Is left in your tank
5107000	5109000	I don't believe you brought up that the tank
5109000	5111000	Flies
5111000	5113000	He did
5113000	5115000	Oh my bad
5117000	5119000	Are you the king
5119000	5121000	Are you the king of blaster master
5121000	5123000	I'm the blaster master
5123000	5125000	James is like
5125000	5127000	I play blaster master
5127000	5129000	We can turn on the desk right now
5129000	5131000	We can actually turn on 2 nesses and we can have a blaster master
5131000	5133000	Race and I will fuck her shit up
5135000	5137000	But if we played mass effect
5137000	5139000	Yeah that wouldn't even be a good race
5139000	5141000	She'd murder the shit out of me
5141000	5143000	If we cut us out
5143000	5145000	Give me the mic
5147000	5149000	For other releases that came out
5149000	5151000	There was
5151000	5153000	A re-release on the playstation
5153000	5155000	For blaster master
5155000	5157000	Itself
5157000	5159000	Actually my apologies for meta fight
5159000	5161000	And ripple island
5161000	5163000	Came out on playstation in
5163000	5165000	The volume 4 of sunsoft memorial
5165000	5167000	Series in 2002
5167000	5169000	And then it came out on the Wii virtual console
5169000	5171000	On December 14th 2009
5171000	5173000	And um
5173000	5175000	There was
5175000	5177000	Meta fight was re-released for the
5177000	5179000	Virtual console on June 29th
5179000	5181000	2010
5181000	5183000	There was blaster master overdrive
5183000	5185000	That um
5185000	5187000	Honestly I didn't give a crap about
5187000	5189000	So I'm not gonna talk about it
5189000	5191000	Yeah
5191000	5193000	I actually played the Wii
5193000	5195000	Believe it or not I played the Wii remake
5195000	5197000	It's it just didn't
5197000	5199000	Have the charm of the original
5199000	5201000	For me like it just felt I remember the
5201000	5203000	Controls bugged me like I seem to
5203000	5205000	It was a few years ago but I remember the controls
5205000	5207000	Really bothered me that was an issue
5207000	5209000	That was released by victor ireland
5209000	5211000	From working design
5211000	5213000	And rest in peace
5213000	5215000	New company Gaijin works
5215000	5217000	Yeah Gaijin works There was also a sequel on the
5217000	5219000	Genesis which was not
5219000	5221000	Produced by the original creator which was not so
5221000	5223000	Good there was kind of a pseudo
5223000	5225000	Remake for the gameboy advance
5225000	5227000	Called uh like enemy within
5227000	5229000	Actually no it was for gameboy color
5229000	5231000	Which was also not as good
5231000	5233000	And there was a punishment from god
5233000	5235000	Succo on the playstation called blaster master
5235000	5237000	Blasting again
5237000	5239000	So really there's only one good blaster master game
5239000	5241000	The whole reason why the story
5241000	5243000	Was changed is because um
5247000	5249000	You have to give them credit
5249000	5251000	Frogs are pretty awesome
5251000	5253000	They're slimy and stupid
5253000	5255000	And they make you hallucinate
5257000	5259000	Anyway they changed it because they didn't think
5259000	5261000	That the space exploration
5261000	5263000	Would be popular in the US
5263000	5265000	That whole genre of anime
5265000	5267000	Hadn't really made it over
5267000	5269000	And so they changed it to Jason and his
5269000	5271000	Frog and used the name
5271000	5273000	Of the planet Sophia the third
5273000	5275000	There was a portion
5275000	5277000	Of the map in the fourth level
5277000	5279000	That did not map over
5279000	5281000	So actually you have to make this
5281000	5283000	Huge jump
5283000	5285000	Off a ladder suspended in mid air
5287000	5289000	I'm not gonna say anymore
5289000	5291000	Alright
5291000	5293000	It's an amazing
5293000	5295000	Game it's one of my favorite NES games
5295000	5297000	Ever and the soundtrack we can't say
5297000	5299000	Enough about the soundtrack I mean it's just
5299000	5301000	Like I love the soundtrack it's amazing
5301000	5303000	So good alright
5303000	5305000	So then that's it there it is your
5305000	5307000	Classic game of the week actually
5307000	5309000	Sophia the third made an appearance in
5309000	5311000	A flash game called Super Mario Brothers
5311000	5313000	Crossover that we've talked about on the show
5313000	5315000	Before how'd that kickstarter
5315000	5317000	Go for them they
5317000	5319000	Made it they made more than
5319000	5321000	Initial I figured they would
5321000	5323000	Good times
5323000	5325000	Alright this game is hard
5325000	5327000	As hell
5327000	5329000	Alright there it is blast I was just watching the
5329000	5331000	YouTube in the background remembering having a horrible
5331000	5333000	Horrible nightmares of the game alright there it is
5333000	5335000	I thought that that particular playthrough it was
5335000	5337000	Because it was a non machine assisted speed run
5337000	5339000	That takes
5339000	5341000	That looked like the
5341000	5343000	You can kind of tell when it's an emulator
5343000	5345000	And when it's that dirty connection
5345000	5347000	To the TV through an RCA cable like
5347000	5349000	You kind of tell the difference on YouTube and that was definitely
5349000	5351000	The TV being plugged in there so
5351000	5353000	Alright there it is your classic game of the week
5353000	5355000	Blaster Master
5355000	5357000	We're gonna take a break here but don't go anywhere

5509000	5511000	I did
5511000	5513000	I went back to Alabama and got my clique-o-vision
5513000	5515000	And brought it back
5515000	5517000	And then I found someone at work
5517000	5519000	That was selling a clique-o-vision
5519000	5521000	I found them on the work message boards
5521000	5523000	And told you about it
5523000	5525000	You are a liar
5525000	5527000	No I'm not

5543000	5545000	On September 2nd
5545000	5547000	I converted
5547000	5549000	I became Jewish
5549000	5551000	I thought you had already had that
5551000	5553000	No, not this last one
5553000	5555000	It meant two years past my conversion
5555000	5557000	It was the anniversary
5557000	5559000	And that's why you're not here next week
5559000	5561000	Because Rosh Hashanah starts
5561000	5563000	So Happy New Year all the Jews out there
5563000	5565000	Understandable, have a good week off
5565000	5567000	Hope you'll listen to the podcast during the week
5567000	5569000	Maybe
5569000	5571000	Anyhow, episode four seventy-five is coming up
5571000	5573000	We might have some surprises in store
5573000	5575000	So be sure you're here that night
5575000	5577000	Mostly for the long-time OLR fans
5577000	5579000	There's something brewing
5579000	5581000	Where you long-time OLR fans
5581000	5583000	Are going to be like, what?
5583000	5585000	That's all I'm going to say
5585000	5587000	Episode four seventy-five, be here
5587000	5589000	Alright
5589000	5591000	Because reasons
5591000	5593000	Rapid Fire News
5593000	5595000	Is up next
5595000	5597000	While I finish cutting my quesadilla
5597000	5599000	Which, by the way, smells delicious
5599000	5601000	You take all the pictures you want
5601000	5603000	Of my delicious quesadilla
5603000	5605000	From the work-provided quesadilla maker
5605000	5607000	That I won, thank you
5607000	5609000	Picture with scissors
5609000	5611000	So there's a new free Vita game
5611000	5613000	That you can download
5613000	5615000	It's called Treasure Park
5615000	5617000	And basically it's a game that allows you
5617000	5619000	To create your own grid-based puzzles
5619000	5621000	And with hidden objects and bombs and stuff
5621000	5623000	And you can share them with your friends in the near app
5623000	5625000	That might be a reason
5625000	5627000	For me to play my Vita
5627000	5629000	That I haven't played
5629000	5631000	Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet
5631000	5633000	Yeah, I heard it was really short though
5633000	5635000	It is, but they have all the online level
5635000	5637000	It's a good game
5637000	5639000	Alright, fine
5639000	5641000	And that pinball, that pinball, now that I haven't really played
5641000	5643000	But I hear it's good, I played it on Xbox
5643000	5647000	The Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection
5647000	5649000	As well as the God of War
5649000	5651000	PS3 collections
5651000	5653000	Those have been given
5653000	5655000	An update to allow for remote play
5655000	5657000	On the Vita
5657000	5659000	So now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix
5659000	5661000	On the go, which is pretty sweet
5661000	5663000	Of course
5663000	5665000	Those include the first two God of War games
5665000	5667000	Ego and Shadow of the Colossus
5667000	5669000	So that's pretty sweet
5669000	5671000	And last but not least
5671000	5673000	Angry Birds is getting
5673000	5675000	Yet another spinoff this time in the form
5675000	5677000	Of Bad Piggies
5677000	5679000	Where you're gonna take the
5679000	5681000	Villains, I guess, of the game and play as them
5681000	5683000	In puzzle-like fashion
5683000	5685000	I'm sure
5685000	5687000	And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac
5687000	5689000	September 27th
5689000	5691000	With other versions
5691000	5693000	Windows Phone, Windows 8
5693000	5695000	And PC
5695000	5697000	Later on, I guess
5697000	5701000	Oh, it doesn't sound very exciting
5701000	5703000	But I'm not a big Angry Birds fan
5703000	5705000	Nah
5705000	5709000	I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did
5709000	5711000	Of course
5711000	5713000	Alright, um
5713000	5715000	Metroid
5715000	5717000	On the Wii U
5717000	5719000	Do I have your attention?
5719000	5721000	Alright, well here's the unfortunate part
5721000	5723000	It's just part of Nintendo Land
5723000	5725000	But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat
5725000	5727000	A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version
5727000	5729000	Of the Battle.me prototype, if you ever saw that
5729000	5731000	During the trade shows
5731000	5733000	They showed this during the press conference
5733000	5735000	Yeah, but isn't this new?
5735000	5737000	The screenshots and everything that are out now?
5737000	5739000	Not really
5739000	5741000	I thought this was some new stuff, whatever
5741000	5743000	So fine, what's old is new again
5743000	5745000	I just got excited because it was Metroid
5745000	5747000	Alright, how about this?
5747000	5749000	This is something that's been going around for like five years
5749000	5751000	And finally, finally
5751000	5753000	Making its way this week
5753000	5755000	Dark Tetsuya, listen up
5755000	5757000	La Mulana, finally
5757000	5759000	On WiiWare, September 20th
5759000	5761000	Is the big day
5761000	5763000	This is a big sordid story here
5763000	5765000	It was gonna come out, and then it wasn't
5765000	5767000	Because they didn't think it would make money, da da da
5767000	5769000	They said it was gonna be cancelled
5769000	5771000	Then the internet got mad, so here it is
5771000	5773000	There was a lot of QQ
5773000	5775000	The most complete archaeology action and exploration game
5775000	5777000	Ever created
5777000	5779000	So that Indiana Jones game
5779000	5781000	That was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game
5781000	5783000	I guess that can suck it
5783000	5785000	Cause this is the most complete
5785000	5787000	Archaeology action and exploration game
5787000	5789000	Ever created, over 40 hours of play
5789000	5791000	No, for real
5791000	5793000	For like retro looking games, it looks awesome
5793000	5795000	I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight
5795000	5797000	Because here, okay
5797000	5799000	I gotta admit
5799000	5801000	The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs
5801000	5803000	Cause I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world
5803000	5805000	But the game blogs are saying
5805000	5807000	Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?
5807000	5809000	No
5809000	5811000	Shit
5811000	5813000	Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U
5813000	5815000	Is like saying the sun is gonna rise in the morning
5815000	5817000	That bears shit in the woods
5817000	5819000	That's what you call a safe bet
5819000	5821000	And also what you call
5821000	5823000	A headline that will get people to go
5823000	5825000	Oh my god, there's a Zelda game coming
5825000	5827000	I need to repog this everywhere
5827000	5829000	So your site gets
5829000	5831000	You know, hits
5831000	5833000	It's all about the hits, folks
5833000	5835000	Here's the thing though
5835000	5837000	Why would it be 2014? Why not next year?
5837000	5839000	They haven't announced one yet
5839000	5841000	They've already announced everything they've got coming
5841000	5843000	So what's gonna be their big thing next year?
5843000	5845000	They've gotta have something big, big, big next year
5845000	5847000	Next year
5847000	5849000	Well, unless it's a 3D Mario
5849000	5851000	A Donkey Kong poop throwing game
5851000	5853000	Smash Brothers are thinking
5853000	5855000	Remember in 2013
5855000	5857000	Those Smash Brothers games always take forever
5857000	5859000	I don't know
5859000	5861000	Alright, that's all I got
5861000	5863000	Dark Sakura
5863000	5865000	Well, other news
5865000	5867000	We have a
5867000	5869000	A new trademark from Squeenix
5869000	5871000	Called Circle of Mana
5871000	5873000	So maybe it's gonna
5873000	5875000	Be out in that series, who knows
5875000	5877000	The last one that came out was
5877000	5879000	Heroes of Mana, which I didn't even bother
5879000	5881000	No news
5881000	5883000	No news yet on Circle of Evermore?
5883000	5885000	No
5885000	5887000	And then Ace Attorney 5
5887000	5889000	Will be coming out
5889000	5891000	And
5891000	5893000	Let me
5893000	5895000	See if there is a date on here
5895000	5897000	Well, it doesn't say the date
5897000	5899000	But we're gonna be getting it here and
5899000	5901000	In Europe
5901000	5903000	I saw some of the
5903000	5905000	Pictures for it
5905000	5907000	Who was that other girl that has the side ponytail?
5907000	5909000	She looks awful
5909000	5911000	And then
5911000	5913000	Emma, I guess
5913000	5915000	I don't know, I hate her pigtail
5915000	5917000	And then
5917000	5919000	Rhythm Thief
5919000	5921000	Is supposed to be coming to the IOS
5921000	5923000	This winter
5923000	5925000	So this one is just gonna be
5925000	5927000	One player
5927000	5929000	And I think should have leaderboard options
5931000	5933000	So that's it
5933000	5935000	Sorry, my mouth is full
5935000	5937000	Of quesadilla
5937000	5939000	Rhythm Thief, I wanna play that though
5939000	5941000	Okay
5941000	5943000	I'm not stopping you
5943000	5945000	I played the demo on 3DS, it was good
5945000	5947000	What is Dan playing over there? It sounds like a Mario game
5947000	5949000	Is that Wario something something?
5949000	5951000	Mario 2
5951000	5953000	I didn't even know that thing was charged
5953000	5955000	That's amazing
5955000	5957000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week
5965000	5967000	Facebook, Google, put them together
5967000	5969000	You get foogle
5969000	5971000	And we ask a question every week
5971000	5973000	And we read some of the answers
5973000	5975000	I wanna reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset
5975000	5977000	That I don't read their answers
5977000	5979000	If I read all the answers, it would be a 5 hour show
5979000	5981000	So we picked some of the answers
5981000	5983000	To read from Google Plus and Facebook
5983000	5985000	About the question
5985000	5987000	The question ties into a story from part A
5987000	5989000	There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through
5989000	5991000	Some changes
5991000	5993000	Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech
5993000	5995000	Some time ago, we wanna ask you about video game television
5995000	5997000	Do you think a dedicated
5997000	5999000	Video game television station could work
5999000	6001000	In today's world?
6001000	6003000	If you do, what kind of shows would you wanna see on it?
6003000	6005000	If you don't think it would work, why not?
6005000	6007000	Entertainment on Google Plus starts
6007000	6009000	They tried it
6009000	6011000	It was G4 in the beginning
6011000	6013000	The problem was that G4 could never draw a large audience
6013000	6015000	As measured by the Nielsen rating system
6015000	6017000	The system is a critically flawed system
6017000	6019000	But it is the accepted system
6019000	6021000	Unless Nielsen changes to actually measure online
6021000	6023000	In DVR
6023000	6025000	Or until Nielsen is thrown out entirely
6025000	6027000	A cable network for gamers cannot survive for very long
6027000	6029000	Interesting
6029000	6031000	You know what?
6031000	6033000	I actually equivalent the Nielsen system
6033000	6035000	With using BMI to track health
6035000	6037000	Both of them are inherently
6037000	6039000	Flawed and useless
6039000	6041000	Technus replied on Google Plus and said
6041000	6043000	I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is
6043000	6045000	Long gone
6045000	6047000	The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns
6047000	6049000	So much, it was nuts
6049000	6051000	I remember getting the channel as a preview channel
6051000	6053000	And they would air the same old episodes that I saw
6053000	6055000	A few months ago
6055000	6057000	When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist
6057000	6059000	Pretty well with finally cutting out the excess
6059000	6061000	Of reruns and shows that nobody really watched
6061000	6063000	From both networks
6063000	6065000	And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV
6065000	6067000	And then they flushed it down the drain and so forth
6067000	6069000	He says at the end
6069000	6071000	Though it's all about video on demand
6071000	6073000	And IPTV services these days
6073000	6075000	And I think that's where a video game network can thrive
6075000	6077000	So he thinks in the traditional sense
6077000	6079000	It's done
6079000	6081000	And Jim replies and says it would never work
6081000	6083000	The channel wouldn't be able to be very critical
6083000	6085000	Of games or the industry in general
6085000	6087000	Because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars
6087000	6089000	Would have to come from
6089000	6091000	Because he thinks that the conflict
6091000	6093000	It would never work
6093000	6095000	I think there's some truth in that
6095000	6097000	They can be pretty mean sometimes
6097000	6099000	Alright, going over to Facebook
6099000	6101000	And checking out some of the answers on Facebook
6101000	6103000	Which there's a lot
6103000	6105000	And I'm never going to be able to get through some of these
6105000	6107000	Another comment from Dark Charger
6107000	6109000	About IPTV becoming the norm
6109000	6111000	Nutman says
6111000	6113000	I think a video game channel could work
6113000	6115000	But TV executives need to step out of the way
6115000	6117000	G4, like many other TV endeavors
6117000	6119000	Failed because guys in suits thought they knew
6119000	6121000	Better than the people they hired
6121000	6123000	Scott Rubin and others behind G4
6123000	6125000	Were met with opposition on everything
6125000	6127000	And eventually just gave up entirely
6127000	6129000	Executives set it up for failure
6129000	6131000	And then asked everybody why it failed
6131000	6133000	So they need to get rid of the management
6133000	6135000	Red the Haze says
6135000	6137000	Nope, every now and then I remember
6137000	6139000	Tech TV and G4 missed those channels
6139000	6141000	But then I remember we have the internet now
6141000	6143000	Ronnie says yes it would work
6143000	6145000	There will always be the casual market
6145000	6147000	That doesn't know as much as we do on the internet
6147000	6149000	I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4
6149000	6151000	I imagine it would be extremely casual
6151000	6153000	Tigerclaw says
6153000	6155000	The problem with having a cable network
6155000	6157000	Dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal
6157000	6159000	To a certain demographic which is relatively
6159000	6161000	Small to a mass audience
6161000	6163000	Who needs a 24 hour cable network devoted to video games
6163000	6165000	And you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online
6169000	6171000	Looking at some of the other answers
6171000	6173000	Degenerate Johnny says
6173000	6175000	Especially with the YouTube channels and internet shows
6175000	6177000	Being dedicated to video games
6177000	6179000	I think that a cable network channel would not work for long
6179000	6181000	So many of these e-shows and podcasts
6181000	6183000	Such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content
6183000	6185000	To satisfy gamers of all ages
6185000	6187000	Such features include up to date news
6187000	6189000	The latest reviews of games and DLC
6189000	6191000	Etcetera
6191000	6193000	These features are all that the average video gamer requires
6193000	6195000	It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV
6195000	6197000	For something that could easily be accessed on the internet
6197000	6199000	In an entertaining fashion
6199000	6201000	We killed G4
6201000	6203000	Degenerate Johnny
6203000	6205000	Mike simply says
6205000	6207000	Yes it would work
6207000	6209000	I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how to, achievements
6209000	6211000	Type shows
6211000	6213000	Wicked says
6213000	6215000	I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market
6215000	6217000	With how diverse and expansive the internet is
6217000	6219000	Gaming content that would be on a television network
6219000	6221000	Is numerous
6221000	6223000	But too far and wide for some
6223000	6225000	A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses
6225000	6227000	Would concentrate a lot of good shows
6227000	6229000	Topics and games in one location
6229000	6231000	For easy digestion
6231000	6233000	As for what should be on the network
6233000	6235000	That simple
6235000	6237000	Look at G4 Tech TV
6237000	6239000	Both separate entities during the merger
6239000	6241000	And name some various shows there
6241000	6243000	It was easy to fill up the network with gaming
6243000	6245000	Though a lot of it was tech
6245000	6247000	But also hey they knew the demographic
6247000	6249000	And I think if done properly it could thrive again
6249000	6251000	Just not as G4
6251000	6253000	God I hope not
6253000	6255000	Lastly Pete Garuno says
6255000	6257000	Charlie Brooker's Game Swipe

6261000	6263000	Thanks to everybody and Google Plus as well
6263000	6265000	Search for Orange Lounge Radio
6265000	6267000	Plus and you'll find that
6267000	6269000	Thank you to everybody who answered
6269000	6271000	How about you folks here in studio
6271000	6273000	Would it work or is it done?
6273000	6275000	It's done
6275000	6277000	Well I mean really everyone said
6277000	6279000	It goes back to what the other people said
6279000	6281000	The internet's taken over
6281000	6283000	And besides that
6283000	6285000	I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game
6285000	6287000	On their TV than watch a show on their TV
6287000	6289000	I mean me I don't even watch TV
6289000	6291000	I download my shows on the internet
6291000	6293000	I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who
6293000	6295000	And that's it
6295000	6297000	If there was a dedicated video game station
6297000	6299000	Or station
6299000	6301000	A channel on TV I still wouldn't watch it
6301000	6303000	I remember there used to be a show on G4
6303000	6305000	That just showed nothing but gameplay footage
6305000	6307000	Like little five minute clips of gameplay footage
6307000	6309000	It was a way to like sample all the new games
6309000	6311000	It was interesting
6311000	6313000	I have the internet for that
6313000	6315000	I mean there's plenty of times when
6315000	6317000	Like Dan said
6317000	6319000	I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game
6319000	6321000	And look up
6321000	6323000	A particular path in a game that I want to do
6323000	6325000	Or
6325000	6327000	He watches playthroughs of stuff
6327000	6329000	All the time
6329000	6331000	It's really just
6331000	6333000	I don't think that
6333000	6335000	It would have to be one or the other
6335000	6337000	If TV was the only way to get the information
6337000	6339000	Then yeah then it would work
6339000	6341000	But there's so many other outlets
6341000	6343000	That are so convenient
6343000	6345000	And you don't have to wait for programming times
6345000	6347000	Or wait for it to record
6347000	6349000	It's there when you want it
6349000	6351000	The chatters jumped in
6351000	6353000	Cinematech was the show I was thinking of
6353000	6355000	Loki
6355000	6357000	Yeah it's going to be hard for them
6357000	6359000	I think the problem would be
6359000	6361000	It's too niche for them to have enough
6361000	6363000	Revenue
6363000	6365000	Revenue dollars from ads and stuff
6365000	6367000	To warrant keeping the station
6367000	6369000	It's just too
6369000	6371000	Before going away where it's so generic
6371000	6373000	Now that
6373000	6375000	You know it gets more viewers I guess
6375000	6377000	People like watching cops and stuff
6377000	6379000	At weird hours at night or they'll just shut
6379000	6381000	Off the station for a few hours
6381000	6383000	And run their infomercials that's what they do
6383000	6385000	Like late at night
6385000	6387000	My answer is yes and no
6387000	6389000	Because I think all
6389000	6391000	Networks in a sense traditional TV
6391000	6393000	And cable as we know it is all kind of
6393000	6395000	On a ticking clock here
6395000	6397000	And it's really about being able to evolve
6397000	6399000	And I think you see a lot of it with tying
6399000	6401000	Into the
6401000	6403000	Xbox style content
6403000	6405000	You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that
6405000	6407000	Even Comcast getting in on that
6407000	6409000	And a lot more of that on demand style stuff
6409000	6411000	Hulu, Netflix
6411000	6413000	I think if a gaming company could kind of build
6413000	6415000	Itself around that primary
6415000	6417000	And be a cable network secondary
6417000	6419000	They'd be in a much better place
6419000	6421000	Than say
6421000	6423000	Somebody coming around and just trying to copy
6423000	6425000	G4
6425000	6427000	It's going to be doomed
6427000	6429000	Dan
6429000	6431000	It could have been doable
6431000	6433000	I mean I don't know if it could still be doable
6433000	6435000	Because again the money is hard but
6435000	6437000	The problem is that they never played it straight
6437000	6439000	Like even the biggest names
6439000	6441000	You know when they had the video game shows
6441000	6443000	Like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag
6443000	6445000	He was just such a fucking retard
6445000	6447000	And you'd watch and just be like
6447000	6449000	I don't want to be associated with this guy
6449000	6451000	And then they had the girl
6451000	6453000	Who wasn't really good looking
6453000	6455000	Enough to be kind of eye candy
6455000	6457000	And people were just like
6457000	6459000	Well they're not really talking to gamers
6459000	6461000	They're kind of
6461000	6463000	Just doing their thing
6463000	6465000	And I believe that they were gamers
6465000	6467000	I believe that they cared about what they were doing
6467000	6469000	I just never thought that they were good
6469000	6471000	I don't think that they played it real
6471000	6473000	I think that if there was a show
6473000	6475000	I don't think there could be a network
6475000	6477000	But I think there could be a show
6477000	6479000	That did the trick
6479000	6481000	You know if it played it real and not douchey
6481000	6483000	I get what you're saying
6483000	6485000	I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows
6485000	6487000	Felt like they were catered to 12 year old boys
6487000	6489000	And it gets old
6489000	6491000	Talk up to me not down to me
6491000	6493000	Some folks in the chat
6493000	6495000	GDR dollar bill agreed with you
6495000	6497000	He said Sessler was a tool
6497000	6499000	But fifth dream does not
6499000	6501000	Sessler was pretty awesome
6501000	6503000	But Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV
6503000	6505000	Because that's all they really needed
6505000	6507000	Is one show dedicated to video games
6507000	6509000	And the rest was pretty awesome
6509000	6511000	That's the network you need to copy
6511000	6513000	If you're going to try to copy a network
6513000	6515000	Don't copy G4, copy tech TV
6515000	6517000	Because that was awesome
6517000	6519000	That's a network I think that could have actually made it
6519000	6521000	Give it a little bit more advertising
6521000	6523000	Alright, well
6523000	6525000	Go ahead, one last thought
6525000	6527000	I just don't really understand why
6527000	6529000	TV is still big
6529000	6531000	When you've got the internet
6531000	6533000	What Dan watches is like one show on TV now
6533000	6535000	MasterChef
6535000	6537000	And then the rest
6537000	6539000	And the rest of it we use
6539000	6541000	The internet, we have Hulu
6541000	6543000	We have everything else
6543000	6545000	I'm really paying an insane amount for cable
6545000	6547000	Cable is going to go
6547000	6549000	The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well
6551000	6553000	And Dan likes MasterChef
6553000	6555000	It's kind of going the way of the landline telephone
6555000	6557000	A lot of people get rid of those too
6557000	6559000	Alright, in the meantime
6559000	6561000	Let's move on with gaming news
6561000	6563000	Thank you again to the folks on Facebook and Google who answered
6563000	6565000	Loki, let's start off with more gaming news
6565000	6567000	Alright, let's talk a little bit about
6567000	6569000	GameStop
6569000	6571000	But let's also talk about Ouya
6571000	6573000	The GameStop of course is interested in
6573000	6575000	Ouya since
6575000	6577000	As of recently they've been
6577000	6579000	Interested in pretty much anything that runs Android
6579000	6581000	That they can turn around and
6581000	6583000	Get people to pre-order or resell or something like that
6583000	6585000	And it says of course
6585000	6587000	We will be a part of any console launch
6587000	6589000	In the future
6589000	6591000	That's when they were asked about Ouya
6591000	6593000	We think Ouya is cool
6593000	6595000	It has open source components
6595000	6597000	Everything we've read is great
6597000	6599000	And of course they're used to
6599000	6601000	Selling DLCs
6601000	6603000	So assuming that this is kind of like
6603000	6605000	Steam or Xbox Live Arcade
6605000	6607000	Or Playstation or something like that
6607000	6609000	They would probably have like
6609000	6611000	Codes that could be redeemed for
6611000	6613000	Apps and stuff on there
6613000	6615000	But at the same time
6615000	6617000	I don't think you can go to
6617000	6619000	GameStop and buy
6619000	6621000	An app that's on the Android marketplace
6621000	6623000	Or something like that or Google Play
6623000	6625000	You can't just go hey
6625000	6627000	Dan no one can hear you when you don't have a mic
6627000	6629000	It's just like
6629000	6631000	I don't know
6631000	6633000	I just don't know if people would really
6633000	6635000	They're kind of pointless
6635000	6637000	When it comes to
6637000	6639000	Buying stuff online
6639000	6641000	Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something
6641000	6643000	That I can purchase online without having to
6643000	6645000	Drive down to the store
6645000	6647000	Aside from I'm trading in something
6647000	6649000	But that only works if you're trading in like a console game
6649000	6651000	Because right now there's no trading on
6651000	6653000	Digital games
6653000	6655000	So if really you're playing on a system
6655000	6657000	Let's say you only own an OUYA
6657000	6659000	You're probably not going to be going down to them
6659000	6661000	For anything
6661000	6663000	Except for maybe hardware and accessories
6663000	6665000	Assuming you need like another
6665000	6667000	OUYA controller or something
6667000	6669000	If you didn't want to buy it online
6671000	6673000	Well this is all kind of about
6673000	6675000	Evolving to match what people want
6675000	6677000	Because if OUYA is
6677000	6679000	Going to be this big deal GameStop wants a piece of it
6679000	6681000	Because
6681000	6683000	GameStop's another one of those companies
6683000	6685000	Where as digital distribution becomes more and more
6685000	6687000	They're getting a little worried
6687000	6689000	And then another thing
6689000	6691000	There was a game that was on Kickstarter
6691000	6693000	Mercenary Kings
6693000	6695000	Of course they've surpassed their goal that they had
6695000	6697000	But now they're saying
6697000	6699000	They're going to be
6699000	6701000	Putting it on the OUYA as well
6701000	6703000	So right now they're
6703000	6705000	Allowing anybody
6705000	6707000	That's ordered a digital copy of the game
6707000	6709000	Which is $15 pledged
6709000	6711000	You'll get a copy of the
6711000	6713000	Steam key and you'll get a copy of
6713000	6715000	The OUYA key which they believe that there's going to be
6715000	6717000	A key system for that
6717000	6719000	Although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet
6719000	6721000	But in some way they'll try to
6721000	6723000	Get it so that you can
6723000	6725000	Play that and for those who are not aware
6725000	6727000	Mercenary Kings is a game that's
6727000	6729000	Kind of a cross between Metal Slug and
6729000	6731000	Minecraft I guess
6731000	6733000	You craft things based on the
6733000	6735000	Components that are dropped
6735000	6737000	By the enemies and it's also
6737000	6739000	Animated by Paul Robinson who does
6739000	6741000	Really kick ass
6741000	6743000	8 bit, 16 bit
6743000	6745000	Animated gifs and he also did the
6745000	6747000	Animation in the Scott
6747000	6749000	Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade
6749000	6751000	So it is worth checking out
6751000	6753000	I backed it
6753000	6755000	I love Paul Robinson
6755000	6757000	That sounds like something
6757000	6759000	To check out
6759000	6761000	He's got an awesome animated gif with a dog with an eye patch
6761000	6763000	And a robotic dog shooting
6763000	6765000	Bullets and glowing dogs
6765000	6767000	Nice
6767000	6769000	Alright well moving in a different direction here
6769000	6771000	Talking about MMOs for a little bit and a way
6771000	6773000	That you could make money off of MMOs
6773000	6775000	Sony Online Entertainment
6775000	6777000	Not to be totally confused
6777000	6779000	With Playstation 3 stuff because
6779000	6781000	The MMO business is a little
6781000	6783000	Different, it's another arm of the company
6783000	6785000	You do see crossover once in a while like
6785000	6787000	What was that, Free Realms or something
6787000	6789000	Is on Playstation 3
6789000	6791000	It's not worth your time but you might have heard
6791000	6793000	Things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2
6793000	6795000	DC Universe
6795000	6797000	That's a big one, thank you
6797000	6799000	These are all big games
6799000	6801000	SOE is looking into
6801000	6803000	Something where you the player
6803000	6805000	Can create in game items
6805000	6807000	And if Sony
6807000	6809000	Online Entertainment adds them to the shop
6809000	6811000	You would get a kick back
6811000	6813000	Once complete
6813000	6815000	Players are encouraged to name and create a description
6815000	6817000	For the item, describe how the item would fit
6817000	6819000	Into the perspective games ongoing narrative
6819000	6821000	Storyline and submit it to SOE
6821000	6823000	For review and possible inclusion in the SOE
6823000	6825000	Marketplace. If a player created
6825000	6827000	Item is selected for inclusion in the
6827000	6829000	Marketplace, SOE will share
6829000	6831000	40% of the net amount it receives
6831000	6833000	From the sale of the item with the player that created
6833000	6835000	The item. Now before you get too
6835000	6837000	Excited or wonder how SOE would
6837000	6839000	Not drown under these requests
6839000	6841000	Keep in mind to create these items
6841000	6843000	You're gonna have to know how to do 3D
6843000	6845000	Modeling. So if you don't know Maya
6845000	6847000	Or 3DS Max you
6847000	6849000	May not exactly get to get on this
6849000	6851000	Also you don't get to pick stats
6851000	6853000	That's something
6853000	6855000	Sony gets to do
6855000	6857000	You can do the design
6857000	6859000	You can do the item and the lore behind it
6859000	6861000	But ultimately it will be up to
6861000	6863000	Sony Online Entertainment
6863000	6865000	Very interesting
6865000	6867000	Sort of prospect but
6867000	6869000	Maybe they're thinking word of mouth
6869000	6871000	To help these games succeed because let's say I have
6871000	6873000	An item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of
6873000	6875000	I'm likely to start advertising
6875000	6877000	For the game and tell all these people
6877000	6879000	Hey go buy my item
6879000	6881000	And it kind of helps the game get more exposure
6881000	6883000	And possibly generate
6883000	6885000	More sales which
6885000	6887000	Sony gets a cut of
6887000	6889000	Not unlike the iOS Marketplace or what have you
6889000	6891000	So
6891000	6893000	It's definitely a neat idea
6893000	6895000	I think people
6895000	6897000	Will probably use it
6897000	6899000	If they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash
6899000	6901000	We'll see
6901000	6903000	There you go
6903000	6905000	Next story Dark Sakura
6905000	6907000	Sorry I had a little debate in the chat room
6907000	6909000	Oh anything you want to share?
6909000	6911000	Progress
6911000	6913000	Why I think radio is going to go away
6913000	6915000	And why TV
6915000	6917000	Is going to go away
6917000	6919000	Yeah but not tomorrow
6919000	6921000	No I didn't say that at all but I'm saying that
6921000	6923000	It may not even happen in our lifetime
6923000	6925000	But this format isn't going to be around anymore
6925000	6927000	I gotta admit I really like radio though
6927000	6929000	Obviously we're a
6929000	6931000	Podcast so there's a radio element to it
6931000	6933000	But traditional radio
6933000	6935000	Is in trouble because of things like us
6935000	6937000	And satellite and so forth
6937000	6939000	How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?
6939000	6941000	Yeah exactly
6941000	6943000	But in the car
6943000	6945000	I find myself listening to a lot of radio
6945000	6947000	And I do a lot of driving sometimes
6947000	6949000	So I think a lot of us do
6949000	6951000	And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically
6951000	6953000	Like at work while they're doing
6953000	6955000	Oh I feel sorry for them
6955000	6957000	Some type of job
6957000	6959000	I listen to BBC podcasts on history
6959000	6961000	Yeah
6961000	6963000	So I think there is still a demand
6963000	6965000	For the audio only
6965000	6967000	It just might be the traditional radio
6967000	6969000	I mean it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier
6969000	6971000	Where traditional TV is in trouble
6971000	6973000	I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow
6973000	6975000	No
6975000	6977000	But eventually it is going to go away
6977000	6979000	I can guarantee you that the TV set
6979000	6981000	That I owned when I was in high school
6981000	6983000	Wouldn't work now
6983000	6985000	It doesn't have any HD input
6985000	6987000	Almost all the stations
6987000	6989000	Have gone to an HD format
6989000	6991000	And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore
6991000	6993000	I've got video game systems
6993000	6995000	That we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it
6995000	6997000	Like that Odyssey that we have
6997000	6999000	We can't play it, we don't have anything it'll work on
6999000	7001000	You know
7001000	7003000	When was the last time you saw a video tape new?
7003000	7005000	In a store?
7005000	7007000	Been a while
7007000	7009000	Where were you at, the thrift store?
7009000	7011000	Radio Shack
7011000	7013000	That's Radio Shack, they're behind the times anyway
7013000	7015000	But the point is
7015000	7017000	And keep in mind
7017000	7019000	I'm in print media
7019000	7021000	And really how long do you think print is going to be around
7021000	7023000	Other than a specialty format
7023000	7025000	Game Guru
7025000	7027000	In our chat room says
7027000	7029000	Unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna
7029000	7031000	Radio and TV won't disappear
7031000	7033000	You kinda can, it's getting really close
7033000	7035000	Think of it this way
7035000	7037000	20 years ago
7037000	7039000	We got to the internet on dial up
7039000	7041000	20 years ago would have been 92
7041000	7043000	Maybe we were at the stage where like
7043000	7045000	28.8K
7045000	7047000	Dial up was kind of the big thing
7047000	7049000	About then
7049000	7051000	That was how we were connecting online and all that
7051000	7053000	So we progressed that much
7053000	7055000	From dial up modem 28.8K
7055000	7057000	To where we're at now
7057000	7059000	So think where we're going to be in 20 years
7059000	7061000	I think that whole internet off an antenna
7061000	7063000	Is right around the corner
7063000	7065000	I was thinking about this earlier because
7065000	7067000	There was actually a Cracked article talking about
7067000	7069000	Technology then and now
7069000	7071000	Saying that like half of a level
7071000	7073000	Of Angry Birds would not fit on
7073000	7075000	A duck hunt cartridge or something
7075000	7077000	And
7077000	7079000	Stan says way less than that
7079000	7081000	It's just a matter of progress
7081000	7083000	It's going to change everything
7083000	7085000	Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now
7085000	7087000	Doesn't exist today
7087000	7089000	And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside
7089000	7091000	Well one of the reasons that they work
7091000	7093000	You know kind of cutting every
7093000	7095000	Or making everybody go digital anyways
7095000	7097000	The whole switch over is
7097000	7099000	The analog frequencies and stuff
7099000	7101000	That are out there
7101000	7103000	You know that was 4 terrestrial broadcasts
7103000	7105000	And stuff that's all up in the air now
7105000	7107000	So now they can use that for broadcasting
7107000	7109000	Internet
7109000	7111000	And Stan learn InDesign if you're going to do print media
7111000	7113000	Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit
7113000	7115000	You're crazy!
7115000	7117000	Maybe this is a little too heavy
7117000	7119000	For our show
7119000	7121000	But what if
7121000	7123000	Maybe there comes a time
7123000	7125000	What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet
7125000	7127000	I'm not even going into that territory
7127000	7129000	What if
7129000	7131000	Well what if society rejected
7131000	7133000	That technology
7133000	7135000	Like I'm not saying everybody goes Amish
7135000	7137000	But there are Amish people in the world
7137000	7139000	They have a phone
7139000	7141000	Well not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace
7141000	7143000	Technology
7143000	7145000	And they have a neighborhood computer
7145000	7147000	Well that's kind of my point
7147000	7149000	Is that what if society
7149000	7151000	Doesn't want to keep going that direction
7151000	7153000	Or do you think
7153000	7155000	It might happen
7155000	7157000	If war broke out over it
7157000	7159000	It might happen
7159000	7161000	Nope, not even then
7161000	7163000	Because if war broke out over it then that means that they
7163000	7165000	Really want it
7165000	7167000	If war broke out over it it would be who controls it
7167000	7169000	Too heavy for the show
7169000	7171000	Because the people that wouldn't want it
7171000	7173000	They would just die eventually
7173000	7175000	I do like what Tecna said about it not going away
7175000	7177000	It will evolve
7177000	7179000	That's more what I'm thinking of
7179000	7181000	You're going to look
7181000	7183000	Ten years down the line when we've all got
7183000	7185000	Pocket broadband radios
7185000	7187000	We don't have
7187000	7189000	Wireless FM radios
7189000	7191000	We don't use radio waves we're using
7191000	7193000	Broadband signals
7193000	7195000	Well technically a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora
7195000	7197000	Is a broadband radio
7197000	7199000	In my pocket
7199000	7201000	But I mean
7201000	7203000	Older forms of
7203000	7205000	The same idea are going to fall by the wayside
7205000	7207000	That's what progress is
7207000	7209000	That's just how it happens
7209000	7211000	Do you have a Victrola Rob?
7211000	7213000	Do you know what one is?
7213000	7215000	A hand cranked phonograph
7215000	7217000	Not radio the record player
7217000	7219000	When was the last time you used a mimeograph?
7219000	7221000	Just saying
7221000	7223000	I want to see a DJ use those
7223000	7225000	Good times
7225000	7227000	Alright let's move on
7227000	7229000	Dark Soccer don't skip your story
7229000	7231000	I just wanted to make a point
7231000	7233000	That's all
7233000	7235000	Anyway
7235000	7237000	Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker
7237000	7239000	It's gone from games on demand
7239000	7241000	It has been removed
7241000	7243000	And
7243000	7245000	They think they added it
7245000	7247000	On August 28th
7247000	7249000	And on it's Japanese support site
7249000	7251000	They just said we're sorry for the inconvenience
7251000	7253000	The resumption of delivery is being addressed now
7253000	7255000	Please wait for a while
7255000	7257000	Yeah
7257000	7259000	Nothing else they just said that we're looking into it
7259000	7261000	Don't worry we'll receive this about the same time
7261000	7263000	We decide to release a patch for the
7263000	7265000	Xbox 360 version of
7265000	7267000	Silent Hill HD Collection
7267000	7269000	Ever?
7269000	7271000	We'll just kind of file it back
7271000	7273000	Or the next DDR game
7273000	7275000	Just going to hope everyone forgets about it
7275000	7277000	Well I mean if it did have a lot of problems
7277000	7279000	Well at the end of the day how is it selling?
7279000	7281000	If it was selling decent enough they'll find a reason to put it back on there
7281000	7283000	But if not
7283000	7285000	Okay Stan your friend may have a Victrola
7285000	7287000	But tell me
7287000	7289000	Does it use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?
7289000	7291000	It's for the retro kitsch of it right?
7291000	7293000	Yeah it's a kitsch collectors thing
7293000	7295000	I would love to have a Victrola
7295000	7297000	I still have albums
7297000	7299000	I don't have anything to play it on
7299000	7301000	I used to have this rocking, bitching record player
7301000	7303000	when I was like 5 years old that I could play
7303000	7305000	Sesame Street records on and it would light
7305000	7307000	up like these really awesome red and green colors
7307000	7309000	in tone with the audio
7309000	7311000	I would love to have that shit again
7311000	7313000	You know what I had? An 8 track player
7313000	7315000	You know what I don't care if I ever have again?
7315000	7317000	An 8 track player
7317000	7319000	I downloaded my
7319000	7321000	favorite song from my Muppets 8 track
7321000	7323000	It was Lydia the tattooed lady
7323000	7325000	Just saying
7325000	7327000	Not the rainbow connection?
7327000	7329000	No it was Lydia the tattooed lady
7329000	7331000	Someday we'll find it
7331000	7333000	This was in 1979
7333000	7335000	When did the Muppet movie come out?
7335000	7337000	The original one?
7337000	7339000	Yeah
7339000	7341000	So yeah I had a Muppet
7341000	7343000	show best of 8 track
7343000	7345000	It was yellow and I remember how
7345000	7347000	many times I had to fish the damn tape
7347000	7349000	out of the 8 track player and fix it
7349000	7351000	Let's see
7351000	7353000	The Muppet movie was
7353000	7355000	1979
7355000	7357000	So it was right around the same time
7357000	7359000	Unfortunately I would have been
7359000	7361000	1 year old when this movie came out
7361000	7363000	I remember when I was a kid the big deal
7363000	7365000	was Sesame Street follow that
7365000	7367000	bird and that scarring
7367000	7369000	scene of the blue
7369000	7371000	big bird in the cage
7371000	7373000	Oh my god just
7373000	7375000	kill me as a child
7375000	7377000	and then return to Oz
7377000	7379000	Return to Oz was great
7379000	7381000	It was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80's
7381000	7383000	Well it was closer to the books anyway but yeah
7383000	7385000	Oh yes gaming news
7385000	7387000	Hi Loki
7387000	7389000	Well you know he did start off as a blue bird
7389000	7391000	It was still
7391000	7393000	an homage
7393000	7395000	He was sad and it was hard to see
7395000	7397000	Anyways let's talk about TV
7397000	7399000	and you know
7399000	7401000	there's a series of games
7401000	7403000	that were out on the PSP
7403000	7405000	called Invisibles
7405000	7407000	those will be coming out on the Vita
7407000	7409000	they're going to get a new game apparently
7409000	7411000	and it's going to be tied into a TV show
7411000	7413000	or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out
7413000	7415000	and it's going to have a section of the show
7415000	7417000	that's augmented reality
7417000	7419000	where basically you'll take your Vita
7419000	7421000	pointing at the screen and something fancy will happen
7421000	7423000	unlocking new content in your game
7423000	7425000	Cool
7425000	7427000	I'm guessing
7427000	7429000	that it's probably going to be some sort of
7429000	7431000	AR code or QR code
7431000	7433000	or something like that
7433000	7435000	which will probably just
7435000	7437000	Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes
7437000	7439000	they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship
7439000	7441000	that interacted with the thing on TV
7441000	7443000	and all it was doing was kind of like a
7443000	7445000	light gun type technology it just could see
7445000	7447000	what was on the screen and light
7447000	7449000	does its little things accordingly
7449000	7451000	like and you think you're interacting with the movie
7451000	7453000	but you're really not
7453000	7455000	Like the Action Max? Is that what it is?
7455000	7457000	I can't remember the name of it, probably
7457000	7459000	I had an Action Max. Did you really?
7459000	7461000	My dad used to buy all sorts of weird game
7461000	7463000	consoles, we had an Action Max
7463000	7465000	That's where you got it from
7465000	7467000	It's like my dad doesn't understand why I like video
7467000	7469000	games and I'm like dude you've
7469000	7471000	bought the ColecoVision, you bought me
7471000	7473000	a TI computer, you bought
7473000	7475000	an Action Max at one point
7475000	7477000	you had the Atari adapter and stuff
7477000	7479000	and you can't figure out why I like
7479000	7481000	video games? I don't get it, I can't get the cats
7481000	7483000	to get into video games no matter how hard I try
7483000	7485000	The cats, they're just defiant and everything
7485000	7487000	My cat used to sit on top
7487000	7489000	of my Nintendo. Have you tried the iPad game?
7489000	7491000	It was warm. I haven't because I'm
7491000	7493000	freaked out about the scratching thing
7493000	7495000	They can't scratch the screen
7495000	7497000	Everybody says that, but I don't believe it
7497000	7499000	Cut their claws! No! Why?
7499000	7501000	No, it's like cutting their little
7501000	7503000	No, it's not like
7503000	7505000	No, I'm not declawing them
7505000	7507000	Trim their damn nails, you're supposed to
7507000	7509000	That's part of cat care
7509000	7511000	That's, probably Alan does
7511000	7513000	Because they're Alan's cats is the point I was getting at
7513000	7515000	See that's what I do when my cat's being an asshole, I just cut her claws
7515000	7517000	and go ahead and scratch me
7517000	7519000	Because you have no fucking claws
7519000	7521000	Well, Shermie gets ingrown claws
7521000	7523000	Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways
7523000	7525000	But anyways, yeah, so
7525000	7527000	if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just
7527000	7529000	cut their claws
7529000	7531000	Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch
7531000	7533000	glass. My cat used to
7533000	7535000	paw at the TV, like my LCD
7535000	7537000	TV all the time, and if that
7537000	7539000	thing's not scratched up already by them, then
7539000	7541000	it's no big deal
7541000	7543000	I like what Infinal says in the chatroom
7543000	7545000	Put little gloves on their paws
7545000	7547000	Mitten mittens
7547000	7549000	It's your cat being too loud?
7549000	7551000	You should get the little cat claw
7551000	7553000	cappers that look like nail polish
7553000	7555000	Those things are awful
7555000	7557000	Again, not my cats
7557000	7559000	not my decision to make
7559000	7561000	Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her
7561000	7563000	Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me
7563000	7565000	the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday
7565000	7567000	Really?
7567000	7569000	Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but
7569000	7571000	it's cool
7571000	7573000	My struggles with cats goes back to
7573000	7575000	Oh, that's the freaking
7575000	7577000	Play it, play it, play it. No, that's not the actual commercial
7577000	7579000	That's the promo for the episode
7579000	7581000	I think it's this one
7583000	7585000	My struggle? No
7585000	7587000	Not that one
7587000	7589000	Great radio
7589000	7591000	Great radio right here
7591000	7593000	I saw it, I saw it
7593000	7595000	Donor and cat
7595000	7597000	enthusiast
7597000	7599000	Is your cat making too much
7599000	7601000	noise all the time?
7601000	7603000	Is your cat constantly stomping
7603000	7605000	around, driving you
7605000	7607000	crazy?
7609000	7611000	Is your cat clawing
7611000	7613000	at your furniture?
7613000	7615000	Think there's no answer?
7615000	7617000	You're so stupid
7617000	7619000	There is
7619000	7621000	Kitten Mittens
7621000	7623000	Finally, there's a
7623000	7631000	chance to get comfortable mitten for cats
7631000	7633000	I couldn't hear anything
7633000	7635000	Is your cat one legged?
7635000	7637000	Is your cat fat, skinny, or an
7637000	7639000	in between? That doesn't matter
7639000	7641000	Cause one size fits all
7641000	7643000	Kitten Mittens, you'll be smitten
7643000	7645000	So come on down to Patty's Pub
7645000	7647000	We're the home of the
7647000	7649000	original Kitten Mittens
7649000	7651000	Meow
7651000	7653000	The hell was that?
7653000	7655000	That's awesome
7655000	7657000	An amazing fucking television show
7657000	7659000	Which is why you should
7659000	7661000	watch your TV once in a while cause that show is
7661000	7663000	fucking hilarious
7663000	7665000	The official dick tell
7665000	7667000	Okay
7667000	7669000	Shermie would just shit
7669000	7671000	That's all she'd do
7671000	7673000	My favorite is
7673000	7675000	when the cat's walking across the table
7675000	7677000	Like, surely
7677000	7679000	PETA called in on that cause I was
7679000	7681000	borderline inhumane
7681000	7683000	Serious face
7683000	7685000	Back to gaming news
7685000	7687000	Oh yes, it's my turn
7687000	7689000	Final Fantasy
7689000	7691000	There is no transition
7691000	7693000	You know, if you
7693000	7695000	have a lot of money
7695000	7697000	and you've bought a lot of Kitten Mittens
7697000	7699000	Maybe have some more disposable income
7699000	7701000	Say $450
7701000	7703000	You could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation
7703000	7705000	It's coming out of Japan
7705000	7707000	Every game in
7707000	7709000	the series up through Final Fantasy 13
7709000	7711000	in the Ultimate Compilation
7711000	7713000	Does it have 11?
7713000	7715000	It even has 11
7715000	7717000	Does it have 14?
7717000	7719000	No it does not
7719000	7721000	Does it have Mystic Quest?
7721000	7723000	Will you shut up and let me talk about it?
7723000	7725000	Just the numbered ones
7725000	7727000	Is that Dirge of Cerberus?
7727000	7729000	Now I know how you felt when
7729000	7731000	Dan kept interrupting you during the classic game of the week
7731000	7733000	Hey Rob, Rob
7733000	7735000	What?
7735000	7739000	Final Fantasies 1 through 13
7739000	7741000	No 10-2s, no 13-2s
7741000	7745000	PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2
7745000	7747000	The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3
7747000	7749000	Cause they're not gonna bother to port it somewhere new, sorry
7749000	7753000	PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6
7753000	7757000	PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9
7757000	7759000	PlayStation 2 version of 10
7759000	7761000	As well as 11
7761000	7763000	And 12
7763000	7765000	And PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3
7765000	7769000	Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?
7769000	7771000	Oh yeah
7771000	7773000	So here's the bet
7773000	7775000	Wait a second here
7775000	7778000	But the problem is though you're gonna need to have an old style PlayStation 2 for that to work
7778000	7780000	I don't see a hard drive attached there too
7780000	7782000	I know it is kind of a little bit like
7782000	7784000	Won't work but whatever
7784000	7788000	Or if you have an old ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility
7788000	7790000	I believe there's a way to do it
7790000	7792000	I think they patched it in at one point
7792000	7794000	Anyway, 35,000 yen
7794000	7796000	That's about 450 dollars
7796000	7798000	There will also be a commemorative DVD
7798000	7800000	An art collection
7800000	7802000	And a 2-disc soundtrack
7802000	7804000	Cause there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan
7804000	7806000	There just haven't
7806000	7808000	They need it to be another
7808000	7810000	There it is
7810000	7812000	Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection
7812000	7814000	Something I probably won't be buying
7814000	7816000	Just cause I have all the ones I won already
7816000	7818000	I don't have 450
7818000	7820000	But if I had 450 dollars
7820000	7822000	I would pay to go to DragonCon or something
7822000	7824000	And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI
7824000	7826000	At this point
7826000	7828000	Come on, seriously
7828000	7830000	Get the Xbox 360 version
7830000	7832000	Seriously, if you're gonna buy a console version right now
7832000	7834000	The 360 version is probably the way to go
7834000	7836000	But PC is pretty good
7836000	7838000	Mailbag!
7838000	7840000	We haven't even done the mailbag yet
7840000	7842000	It's 8.30 and we haven't even done the mailbag
7842000	7844000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7844000	7846000	Is the place to send us emails every week
7846000	7848000	There's the mailbag music
7848000	7850000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7850000	7852000	DarkSoccer dives in
7852000	7854000	Picks her favorites, reads them now
7854000	7856000	This comes from
7856000	7858000	Sam
7858000	7860000	Hi Sam
7860000	7862000	Hello OLR crew, I probably love the show
7862000	7864000	This one's missing
7864000	7866000	I might love the show
7866000	7868000	Do any of you think
7868000	7870000	The Wii U will become
7870000	7872000	The lead platform for development
7872000	7874000	Since it will be released before the next PlayStation
7874000	7876000	Xbox
7876000	7878000	No
7878000	7880000	Look at what's happening now
7880000	7882000	Let's look to the Dreamcast
7882000	7884000	Possibly
7884000	7886000	On a couple games maybe
7886000	7888000	If there's gonna be some stuff that's coming out
7888000	7890000	During that time
7890000	7892000	I can see them
7892000	7894000	Having slightly better looking games
7894000	7896000	But maybe I don't know if they're gonna necessarily be
7896000	7898000	Developing for Wii U first and then porting over
7898000	7900000	It's hard to say
7900000	7902000	It depends on when the next platforms are coming out
7902000	7904000	Everyone assumes it's gonna be the end of next year
7904000	7906000	But it could be in a couple years
7906000	7908000	In which case, yeah you may have a few games there like that
7908000	7910000	I am dying to see if there is gonna be a game
7910000	7912000	That is Wii U
7912000	7914000	And PS3, PS Vita
7914000	7916000	Cause it could happen
7916000	7918000	I'm dying to see if that happens
7918000	7920000	A third party could do it
7920000	7922000	Or
7922000	7924000	Xbox 360 and tablet
7924000	7926000	Oh yeah that whole
7926000	7928000	Thingy thing they said at E3
7928000	7930000	Smart glass, we haven't heard anything on in a while
7930000	7932000	That's true
7932000	7934000	They should call it smart ass
7934000	7936000	Okay, next email
7936000	7938000	This comes from Rababababa
7938000	7940000	I was playing Rock Band Blitz
7940000	7942000	The night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade
7942000	7944000	And up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz
7944000	7946000	I was thinking that
7946000	7948000	Would be a great name to play with someone
7948000	7950000	But there's no multiplayer
7950000	7952000	I just remembered the game I forgot to review
7952000	7954000	Then I saw
7954000	7956000	Then I saw
7956000	7958000	Score War Mode
7958000	7960000	And I thought, surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list
7960000	7962000	Nope, it just matches you up with
7962000	7964000	Any random guy 64
7964000	7966000	So no friends list competition either
7966000	7968000	It's just the leaderboards
7968000	7970000	Like many games before it, the game is meant
7970000	7972000	For a social gaming crowd but it isolates you
7972000	7974000	From your friends, fantastic
7974000	7976000	I think Rabababa found this
7976000	7978000	Because after he sent the email
7978000	7980000	Because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app
7980000	7982000	That's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz
7982000	7984000	Is there's a lot of enhanced
7984000	7986000	Things that are through Facebook
7986000	7988000	Which is good and it's bad
7988000	7990000	And I'll leave it at that
7990000	7992000	I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top
7992000	7994000	I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week
7994000	7996000	And I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show
7996000	7998000	I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week
7998000	8000000	I have played an awful lot of it
8000000	8002000	The short answer, it's good
8002000	8004000	But
8004000	8006000	Bless them at Harmonix
8006000	8008000	They're standing by their guns
8008000	8010000	I just think there's some mistakes they made
8010000	8012000	Um
8012000	8014000	But that's
8014000	8016000	No, I mean to be fair they make a lot of great games
8016000	8018000	I do like Rock Band Blitz
8018000	8020000	But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do
8020000	8022000	But bless them for trying and sticking to it
8022000	8024000	That's all I'll say for now
8024000	8026000	Okay
8026000	8028000	This last email is from Nasty Canasta
8028000	8030000	Um
8030000	8032000	Hi there OLR
8032000	8034000	If you recall back in the famously infamous
8034000	8036000	Episode 469
8036000	8038000	I offered a PSN code
8038000	8040000	For a live listener to claim
8040000	8042000	However that meant grumpy Mr. Bobby Blackwolf
8042000	8044000	Made a super duper offensive comment
8044000	8046000	That was along the lines of not
8046000	8048000	Including podcast listeners in that giveaway
8048000	8050000	Yeah Bobby Grumpwolf
8050000	8052000	Well Mr. Blackwolf here is my response
8052000	8054000	I left in the email a steam code
8054000	8056000	For depth of peril
8056000	8058000	An action RPG with some strategy elements
8058000	8060000	And random level generation
8060000	8062000	I'll leave it to the OLR crew
8062000	8064000	To come up with a way to give this code
8064000	8066000	Away to a lucky listener
8066000	8068000	Also have fun dealing with the brony fandom
8068000	8070000	Once again at the next Dragon Con Mr. Blackwolf
8070000	8072000	In addition
8072000	8074000	If Dark Sacra Sky or Loki is interested
8074000	8076000	I have one copy of hybrid RTS
8076000	8078000	FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on steam
8078000	8080000	Oooh
8080000	8082000	After you three fight to the death
8082000	8084000	Dance battle or whatever it is you three do to decide
8084000	8086000	On things please add me on steam
8086000	8088000	To get the game I apologize for not having
8088000	8090000	A code the Nuclear Dawn
8090000	8092000	Developers decided on gifting the
8092000	8094000	Option for those who have purchased the game
8094000	8096000	As part of a promotion I promise
8096000	8098000	To keep things discreet and platonic no homo
8098000	8100000	Maybe
8100000	8102000	Alright
8102000	8104000	We'll make this very simple email us
8104000	8106000	Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com
8106000	8108000	Tell us you want the code what's it for again?
8108000	8110000	Thank you by the way for the code
8110000	8112000	For depth of peril
8112000	8114000	Depth of peril Mailbag at orangeonshredded.com
8114000	8116000	And we'll give it away to one lucky listener
8116000	8118000	There you go
8120000	8122000	But that's just for not the live listeners
8122000	8124000	That was for podcast listeners
8124000	8126000	Well you're not going to know if they're one or the other
8126000	8128000	So it really ends up being for everybody
8128000	8130000	Well okay how about this
8130000	8132000	You can't email we won't take the emails
8132000	8134000	Until after the podcast airs
8134000	8136000	Oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely
8136000	8138000	Blackwolf says
8138000	8140000	And there are furries and bronies all
8140000	8142000	Over Dragon Con. Tara Strong was a guest
8142000	8144000	I barely saw them
8144000	8146000	Meaning they were all up on Tara
8146000	8148000	Lastly
8148000	8150000	For Loki did you know there's an official
8150000	8152000	Sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D
8152000	8154000	Yeah but the problem is
8154000	8156000	I don't really care too much about Chip's Challenge
8156000	8158000	I mean I cared about it back in the 90's
8158000	8160000	But now it's just like ehhh
8160000	8162000	Okay so you said
8162000	8164000	There was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded
8164000	8166000	In April and it's on Steam Greenlight
8166000	8168000	Cool
8168000	8170000	It's just yeah
8170000	8172000	You know what one I wish I did get in on it was Guncraft
8172000	8174000	Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft
8174000	8176000	But with guns and stuff that would have been pretty cool
8176000	8178000	That does sound kind of neat
8178000	8180000	Okay that's it for emails
8180000	8182000	Alright
8182000	8184000	We'll get to Twitter in a minute so your last chance
8184000	8186000	To get the tweets in Twitter.com slash O-L-R
8186000	8188000	But first it's time to get a little bit
8188000	8190000	Angsty in a segment we call
8190000	8192000	F-U
8208000	8210000	Um
8210000	8212000	Fuck this dad headache I've had
8212000	8214000	For the last two days
8214000	8216000	I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting
8216000	8218000	And I want my whatever it is
8218000	8220000	In my butt that's hurting
8220000	8222000	And no it's not like that it's one of the muscles
8222000	8224000	Around my left hip has been really
8224000	8226000	Killing me I would like for it to stop
8226000	8228000	Done
8228000	8230000	Um
8230000	8232000	Thank you for
8232000	8234000	No one being on while I'm on Minecraft
8234000	8236000	Like I'm on a lot
8236000	8238000	And there's no one there
8238000	8240000	This is the
8240000	8242000	First week you've been able to mention it on the podcast
8242000	8244000	Well that's true yeah I mean literally I started
8244000	8246000	And then I F-U'd myself
8246000	8248000	For accidentally kicking Bobby off the server
8248000	8250000	A few times back
8250000	8252000	You did it on purpose I was just getting
8252000	8254000	Revenge is yours I figured out
8254000	8256000	Take that Bobby Grumple
8256000	8258000	I just figured out how to finally
8258000	8260000	Do things on the server I mean
8260000	8262000	I've never run a Minecraft server before so
8262000	8264000	It's a little tricky but now I figured it out
8264000	8266000	Ignorance is no excuse
8266000	8268000	And
8268000	8270000	And just for that an Enderman will be spawning
8270000	8272000	In my house later tonight
8272000	8274000	I can make a lot of them
8274000	8276000	No I don't want that
8276000	8278000	They're actually really easy to kill
8278000	8280000	And they're afraid of water
8280000	8282000	Oh so it's like signs
8282000	8284000	Water damages them
8284000	8286000	Alright
8286000	8288000	My F-U I also give an F-U to headaches
8288000	8290000	Because I've been getting some killer ones lately
8290000	8292000	And it's no fun
8292000	8294000	F-U to kind of like stress
8294000	8296000	Because I've taken on a lot of projects
8296000	8298000	Over the next month it's already keeping me busy
8298000	8300000	And I'm starting to feel the pressures
8300000	8302000	Of a lot of that stress
8302000	8304000	I would have done it if I didn't want to but
8304000	8306000	I'm kind of just nephewed to the fact that
8306000	8308000	I haven't been hanging out
8308000	8310000	Enough with people
8310000	8312000	I don't see enough basically
8312000	8314000	So because I'm taking
8314000	8316000	A lot on it's a good thing because it's allowing
8316000	8318000	Me to hang out with people I haven't hung out with in a while
8318000	8320000	Or I'm hanging out with all new
8320000	8322000	But at the same time I'm starting to neglect those
8322000	8324000	I hung out with before and I don't want to like
8324000	8326000	That up so F-U to there not being
8326000	8328000	48 hours in the day basically
8328000	8330000	And F-U to needing sleep
8330000	8332000	Although sleep feels so good
8332000	8334000	Dan do you have any F-U's
8334000	8336000	You want to give?
8336000	8338000	He's busy playing game boy advance
8338000	8342000	He's lying out on the floor like a kid
8342000	8344000	Playing the advance it is kind of funny
8344000	8346000	You gotta admit that
8346000	8348000	My husband is adorable
8348000	8350000	I didn't go that far but alright
8350000	8352000	Alright just a couple more stories
8352000	8354000	For you guys and then the Skype line at 1877
8354000	8356000	Game O-L-R but first Loki
8356000	8358000	There's a little bit more information coming
8358000	8360000	Out now about the whole
8360000	8362000	Stardock lawsuit
8362000	8364000	I think we talked about it a couple
8364000	8366000	Weeks ago where
8366000	8368000	Stardock was accusing one of their employees who
8368000	8370000	Recently left the company of
8370000	8372000	Ruining a game
8372000	8374000	Because they claimed that she deleted
8374000	8376000	Stuff for it and because of that
8376000	8378000	That's what made the game terrible not because
8378000	8380000	Maybe the game was just terrible to begin with
8380000	8382000	Not as good as they had hoped
8382000	8384000	Well there's a little bit more being added
8384000	8386000	To that
8386000	8388000	Apparently the cases
8388000	8390000	Now that they're saying
8390000	8392000	Alexandria
8392000	8394000	Mazetta she had filed
8394000	8396000	A harassment
8396000	8398000	Lawsuit for well sex over
8398000	8400000	Harassment lawsuit against the
8400000	8402000	Head of the company
8402000	8404000	Before the whole
8404000	8406000	You know leaving the company thing
8406000	8408000	Seeking I guess
8408000	8410000	$25,000
8410000	8412000	In damage or something
8412000	8414000	And um
8414000	8416000	I'm sorry unspecified damages
8416000	8418000	In excess of $25,000
8418000	8420000	Um
8420000	8422000	And she you know had
8422000	8424000	Filed complaints at the EEOC
8424000	8426000	And claiming
8426000	8428000	Basically that the
8428000	8430000	Head of the
8430000	8432000	Company had done a lot of lewd things
8432000	8434000	Including you know linking to a
8434000	8436000	Sexually explicit YouTube video
8436000	8438000	Making comments like you know
8438000	8440000	Oh you're not chosen to go to some place
8440000	8442000	Because you're not
8442000	8444000	Just because you're hot or you know asking
8444000	8446000	Her to take a purity test question
8446000	8448000	Thing that had you know sexual
8448000	8450000	Taboo questions and stuff on there
8450000	8452000	Stuff that's no one else's business then?
8452000	8454000	You know have you engaged in group sex
8454000	8456000	I'd like to know that you know because I think
8456000	8458000	I have a you know
8458000	8460000	Good chance of the oral like it was
8460000	8462000	Also I guess there were some witnesses
8462000	8464000	That said oh
8464000	8466000	He described to her he said
8466000	8468000	Was it talking about the
8468000	8470000	Employees and their breasts and bra sizes
8470000	8472000	And said that you know
8472000	8474000	She should attend a media tour because
8474000	8476000	Her nipples look better on
8476000	8478000	TV
8478000	8480000	Wow
8480000	8482000	But you know like any court case or anything
8482000	8484000	There's people on both sides and
8484000	8486000	You know she
8486000	8488000	You know her
8488000	8490000	People or
8490000	8492000	Whatever you know made all those comments
8492000	8494000	That she of course
8494000	8496000	Send him a message basically saying okay
8496000	8498000	I don't want you to touch me
8498000	8500000	Or any parts of my body not even jokingly
8500000	8502000	I don't want you to make comments about
8502000	8504000	You know my boyfriend or future husband
8504000	8506000	Or anything like that I don't want you to make sexually
8506000	8508000	You know charged jokes
8508000	8510000	Which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent
8510000	8512000	Yes
8512000	8514000	Let's remind ourselves that email
8514000	8516000	Should not have had to have been sent
8516000	8518000	I mean never appropriate
8518000	8520000	Praise this girl for having the amazing
8520000	8522000	Self restraint
8522000	8524000	To be professional at this point about it
8524000	8526000	But despite whatever
8526000	8528000	Other allegations are out there
8528000	8530000	Fucking A
8530000	8532000	Apparently he responded though
8532000	8534000	To this email
8534000	8536000	Saying you know
8536000	8538000	I don't recall item one
8538000	8540000	But I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful
8540000	8542000	I understand number two but I'll be more conscious
8542000	8544000	However number three is unacceptable
8544000	8546000	To me I am an inappropriate
8546000	8548000	Sexist vulgar and embarrassing person
8548000	8550000	And I'm not inclined to change my behavior
8550000	8552000	If this is a problem for you
8552000	8554000	You'll need to find another job
8554000	8556000	Again I'm not willing to adapt
8556000	8558000	My behavior to suit others
8558000	8560000	If you find my behavior
8560000	8562000	Problematic I recommend finding another job
8562000	8564000	I'm not some manager or co-worker of yours
8564000	8566000	I own the company
8566000	8568000	It and your job here exists to suit
8568000	8570000	My purpose not vice versa
8570000	8572000	The company is an end to
8572000	8574000	Or is not an end
8574000	8576000	Unto itself
8576000	8578000	Is a means to an end
8578000	8580000	Which to further the objective of its shareholders
8580000	8582000	In this case me
8582000	8584000	Yeah but there's still laws
8584000	8586000	If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at
8586000	8588000	That's a law
8588000	8590000	You can't get around that
8590000	8592000	Even if you're a disgusting shit hole like
8592000	8594000	You know
8594000	8596000	Sorry
8596000	8598000	I mean
8598000	8600000	A man has no excuse
8600000	8602000	To ever act that way to another
8602000	8604000	To a woman or any human being
8604000	8606000	Has no right to act that way towards another
8606000	8608000	Person at all
8608000	8610000	And then of course he responded
8610000	8612000	You know the whole thing
8612000	8614000	Basically to this
8614000	8616000	Website quarter of three
8616000	8618000	You know saying
8618000	8620000	Okay I'm going to go ahead and respond
8620000	8622000	To this, the incident happened back in 2010
8622000	8624000	Myself and Alexandria and a few others
8624000	8626000	Were at a pub
8626000	8628000	Going to the
8628000	8630000	QT3 dinner
8630000	8632000	That Lloyd Case had
8632000	8634000	Set up
8634000	8636000	And while there
8636000	8638000	Alexandria got teased and got mad at the time
8638000	8640000	I didn't realize she was so upset about it
8640000	8642000	And blah blah blah
8642000	8644000	Later she emailed me about the incident
8644000	8646000	And stuff like that, basically he plays it off
8646000	8648000	Saying oh this stuff you know didn't happen
8648000	8650000	Or wasn't as bad as
8650000	8652000	Smoking mirrors, smoking mirrors
8652000	8654000	And basically seeing this as retaliatory
8654000	8656000	Or the charge that
8656000	8658000	Basically the whole thing was insinuating
8658000	8660000	That the retaliatory
8660000	8662000	The legit retaliatory lawsuit
8662000	8664000	Of her ruining their game
8664000	8666000	Was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place
8666000	8668000	So
8668000	8670000	It's all going to come out
8670000	8672000	They're accusing her of deleting all this
8672000	8674000	Stuff or whatever but it doesn't
8674000	8676000	It's one of those things where like you know
8676000	8678000	If the shoe fits, wear it
8678000	8680000	Or if the shoe, whatever
8680000	8682000	My point is
8682000	8684000	Her incredible professionalism
8684000	8686000	In that email and lack
8686000	8688000	Of restraint
8688000	8690000	Praise her for being able to show
8690000	8692000	That kind of restraint
8692000	8694000	Doesn't match that of somebody who would
8694000	8696000	Go in and delete everything
8696000	8698000	It's kind of like you got this over here
8698000	8700000	And this over here, it doesn't line up
8700000	8702000	You know what I mean? How do we know?
8702000	8704000	And again I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case
8704000	8706000	So I'm being a total couch
8706000	8708000	Jury right now which is probably bad
8708000	8710000	But just throwing it out there
8710000	8712000	If that's the environment this person
8712000	8714000	Created at this company where it's like
8714000	8716000	You deal with it because it's my company
8716000	8718000	Or what have you
8718000	8720000	How do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?
8720000	8722000	Maybe somebody else chose not to take
8722000	8724000	The high road. Just throwing it out there
8724000	8726000	Well also the thing too is like
8726000	8728000	They're talking about how she knew where
8728000	8730000	The files were and had access
8730000	8732000	To relevant Google Docs
8732000	8734000	Why are you using Google Docs as like
8734000	8736000	A lot of businesses use Google Docs
8736000	8738000	It just seems very
8738000	8740000	I've heard of that before
8740000	8742000	I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school too
8742000	8744000	You'd seem like you'd have your own
8744000	8746000	Intranet or something that you do that on
8746000	8748000	Anyhow
8748000	8750000	The moral of the story is
8750000	8752000	People need to
8752000	8754000	Not do this to
8754000	8756000	Other people and I'm talking the whole
8756000	8758000	Harassment thing in the first place
8758000	8760000	And that kind of bugs me
8760000	8762000	That in the response it's very
8762000	8764000	Smoke and mirrors like
8764000	8766000	Well there was teasing and da da da
8766000	8768000	But that doesn't give anybody the right to
8768000	8770000	Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
8770000	8772000	Here's what he's saying
8772000	8774000	There's no excuse for what happened
8774000	8776000	No he doesn't even
8776000	8778000	He doesn't even apologize
8778000	8780000	Now you can argue that I was a jerk
8780000	8782000	And how I responded to her
8782000	8784000	But it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and
8784000	8786000	Quitting without notice and using her network access
8786000	8788000	To wipe out our marketing access
8788000	8790000	How dare this person
8790000	8792000	Oh my god it's so infuriating
8792000	8794000	How dare you try to blame her
8794000	8796000	How dare you
8796000	8798000	I'd love to see somebody do it to him
8798000	8800000	That is an attitude
8800000	8802000	That very very bad people have
8802000	8804000	Since my self showing restraint
8804000	8806000	Honestly
8806000	8808000	His behavior is a sign of
8808000	8810000	Something fundamentally wrong with a person
8810000	8812000	Like I'm talking about mentally ill
8812000	8814000	This shit in the industry
8814000	8816000	Needs to stop because
8816000	8818000	It is making us all look bad
8818000	8820000	Knock it off
8822000	8824000	Thank you
8824000	8826000	This is fucking psychotic
8826000	8828000	Behavior
8828000	8830000	Well I don't even know
8830000	8832000	How to follow that up
8832000	8834000	How about a story about Mega Man
8834000	8836000	Mega Man
8836000	8838000	Mega person
8838000	8840000	Capcom, you might be wondering
8840000	8842000	Why hasn't there been a new Mega Man game
8842000	8844000	Or what is with all this shit about Mega Man projects
8844000	8846000	Getting cancelled and da da da da
8846000	8848000	Well Senior Vice President of Capcom
8848000	8850000	USA, Christian Svensson
8850000	8852000	Mentioned to members on Capcom
8852000	8854000	Unity's forum that the problem is
8854000	8856000	Mega Man had too many franchise
8856000	8858000	Or excuse me, too many competing
8858000	8860000	Sub series
8860000	8862000	Quote, thanks for the suggestion
8862000	8864000	I and probably I alone so please don't
8864000	8866000	Describe said belief to Capcom
8866000	8868000	Think one of the problems Mega Man has had
8868000	8870000	As a brand is that we've had too many
8870000	8872000	Competing splinter sub brands within it
8872000	8874000	I'm not sure starting yet another
8874000	8876000	Is the way to get the franchise as a whole
8876000	8878000	Back on track more than creating
8878000	8880000	Greater brand confusion but will take it
8880000	8882000	Under advisement
8882000	8884000	There's a bunch of shit right there because
8884000	8886000	The different series that they have were on different
8886000	8888000	Platforms that they didn't have other Mega Man games
8888000	8890000	It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy
8890000	8892000	Advance then you're playing Mega Man
8892000	8894000	Power or something or other
8894000	8896000	I don't remember what it was but um
8896000	8898000	It wasn't like oh hey you know we're gonna have
8898000	8900000	Mega Man this and Mega Man that and
8900000	8902000	You know they're gonna compete against each other
8902000	8904000	I don't think they really had that it was just
8904000	8906000	Different games especially nowadays
8906000	8908000	There are no Mega Man games
8908000	8910000	Like that are super old anymore
8910000	8912000	You're not gonna be having people you know
8912000	8914000	Oh hey I'm confused because I played this one on the
8914000	8916000	Game Boy Advance or hey I'm confused because
8916000	8918000	I played ZX on the DS or something
8918000	8920000	Like that I mean those games came out years ago
8920000	8922000	Except for
8922000	8924000	You know 9 and 10 those are pretty much
8924000	8926000	The last new Mega Man games that
8926000	8928000	Came out Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?
8928000	8930000	Well yeah they kinda
8930000	8932000	Let him go where he walked Ah that never stops people
8932000	8934000	In the industry Well I'm saying if he
8934000	8936000	Was the I mean he was a big wig
8936000	8938000	If he was the one driving Mega Man
8938000	8940000	Development and he's like okay I'm out
8940000	8942000	And everyone else is just like uh
8942000	8944000	What the fuck do we do? Let's just go
8944000	8946000	And put that one away I
8946000	8948000	Kinda think this and now granted
8948000	8950000	I'm reading way too much into this but I kinda think
8950000	8952000	This points towards there's gonna be some
8952000	8954000	Big reboot cause that's always
8954000	8956000	The fucking answer to every problem reboot
8956000	8958000	Of the Mega Man franchise in the future
8958000	8960000	I bet you anything there's gonna be a new
8960000	8962000	Mega Man game that's just Mega Man
8962000	8964000	And it's a reboot and there's
8964000	8966000	Some new creative person at the helm
8966000	8968000	And it's not Grin making it
8968000	8970000	Yeah it's not it lends
8970000	8972000	Itself perfectly to some type of reboot
8972000	8974000	Whether that be on the next consoles or
8974000	8976000	You know maybe a 3DS game
8976000	8978000	Probably no or a Vita game I think there
8978000	8980000	Will be a Mega Man reboot
8980000	8982000	Just Mega Man
8982000	8984000	Speculation rampant whatever
8984000	8986000	Fanboy wank call it what you want
8986000	8988000	I just kinda think that's where all the signs point towards
8988000	8990000	Especially with that type of rebuttal
8990000	8992000	There's too many franchises
8992000	8994000	So they're gonna bring it back to one
8994000	8996000	We'll see
8996000	8998000	I bet it's a reboot
8998000	9000000	Hey!
9000000	9002000	Let's go to the skype line
9002000	9004000	1877 game OLR our username
9004000	9006000	On skype is orange lounge radio we've had a heck of a show
9006000	9008000	So far tonight let's see what you guys want to talk about
9008000	9010000	The skype line is open
9010000	9012000	Again 1877 game OLR
9012000	9014000	Our username on skype is orange lounge radio
9014000	9016000	I'm gonna get to the tweets here in a moment
9016000	9018000	But first let me ask Loki do you have any
9018000	9020000	Last minute stories or dark soccer of course
9020000	9022000	If you have anything you want to throw out as well
9022000	9024000	I'm still in the middle of being disgusted
9024000	9026000	There's some stupid stories you've probably heard all these before
9026000	9028000	Where you know some teenager
9028000	9030000	Drives cross country to meet her boyfriend
9030000	9032000	So this uh
9032000	9034000	Girl Beth Robinson
9034000	9036000	Who was 13 met somebody
9036000	9038000	On Xbox Live who was 12
9038000	9040000	Actually 12 not necessarily a 4 year old
9040000	9042000	Who came to be 12 and he lived in Houston
9042000	9044000	And she lives in Kentucky
9044000	9046000	And I guess she ended up chatting with him
9046000	9048000	And then eventually stole her brother's car
9048000	9050000	Her mother's ATM card and then drove
9050000	9052000	To his house
9052000	9054000	And I guess she uh got as far as Nashville Tennessee
9054000	9056000	Before being stopped by police
9056000	9058000	So
9058000	9060000	And of course we must blame
9060000	9062000	Xbox Live for this not because
9062000	9064000	Her parents are retarded
9064000	9066000	Or you know
9066000	9068000	She's stupid for
9068000	9070000	Driving across
9070000	9072000	I have a belated F.U.
9072000	9074000	Um sure
9074000	9076000	To everyone taking a crap on
9076000	9078000	Mass Effect Paragon Lost
9078000	9080000	Looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it
9080000	9082000	So shut up
9082000	9084000	I'll reserve judgement until the first step's out
9084000	9086000	But I'm not gonna hate on it just cause
9086000	9088000	It's Vega
9088000	9090000	Vega was pretty cool
9090000	9092000	Alright He's like the bro of the ship
9092000	9094000	Shall I do some tweets? Sure
9094000	9096000	He's totally getting on with Cortez
9096000	9098000	Again 1877 Game O.L.R. or username on Skype
9098000	9100000	Orange Launch Radio
9100000	9102000	Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says
9102000	9104000	How might one acquire episode 169
9104000	9106000	From the encore last week
9106000	9108000	And recording it
9108000	9110000	But since you asked nicely Dark Tetsuya
9110000	9112000	Uh talk to me offline and
9112000	9114000	We'll talk yeah
9114000	9116000	Um
9116000	9118000	Let's see another tweet from Salacious Pop
9118000	9120000	I know who that is
9120000	9122000	Who tweets something I forgot to mention
9122000	9124000	Earlier on the show but it is definitely
9124000	9126000	Uh important it's going on
9126000	9128000	Rest in peace city of heroes
9128000	9130000	That's right
9130000	9132000	Paragon Studios is closing
9132000	9134000	Taking city of heroes with it
9134000	9136000	They cut down by the end of the year and they got blindsided
9136000	9138000	They did not know it was coming cause one day
9138000	9140000	There's a post about oh here's all the cool stuff coming
9140000	9142000	At the end of the year and then the next day it's like
9142000	9144000	Bye
9144000	9146000	No firm date yet sent for the closure
9146000	9148000	But um that's kind of a
9148000	9150000	Bummer I know Allen played a lot
9150000	9152000	Of city of heroes he was into that game
9152000	9154000	I did not really get
9154000	9156000	Into it but I saw it and it was
9156000	9158000	It looked good
9158000	9160000	I guess maybe because
9160000	9162000	I didn't play it as part of the reason it was closing
9162000	9164000	I don't know
9164000	9166000	There's a lot of people like me
9166000	9168000	Let's go to the phones, hi you're on orange songs radio who's this?
9168000	9170000	I'm Zaku here

9176000	9178000	Yeah what's on your mind
9178000	9180000	Just like finishing off like a little bit of Skyrim
9180000	9182000	Not finishing the game
9182000	9184000	But just like finish playing some of it
9184000	9186000	You can never finish Skyrim
9186000	9188000	That's that's pretty much the story of my life
9188000	9190000	Anyways um
9190000	9192000	Zero to the knee
9192000	9194000	Yeah that whole thing
9194000	9196000	Um I'm looking right now through Kotaku
9196000	9198000	For a particular PAX
9198000	9200000	Incident that happened
9200000	9202000	Recently in uh in one of the
9202000	9204000	The Minecraft party
9204000	9206000	Where basically this
9206000	9208000	Apparently this pervert
9208000	9210000	Exposed himself
9210000	9212000	More importantly actually
9212000	9214000	Took the hand of a thumbnail
9214000	9216000	And actually placed it on his jump
9216000	9218000	And blogged
9218000	9220000	I don't know if you heard this
9220000	9222000	This is like a big deal
9222000	9224000	For the past couple of days that I was
9224000	9226000	You know that I was uh catching up on
9226000	9228000	Hold on
9228000	9230000	I'm gonna say before I let him finish the story
9230000	9232000	If that last thing made you mad
9232000	9234000	This will set you on fire
9234000	9236000	This is so fucked up
9236000	9238000	This story go ahead Zaku
9238000	9240000	Go ahead and tell us and
9240000	9242000	Brace yourselves this is bad
9242000	9244000	Okay let me see
9244000	9246000	Uh it was in
9246000	9248000	The V.I.P. section
9248000	9250000	For Minecraft and
9250000	9252000	This blogger
9252000	9254000	Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry
9254000	9256000	Long story short
9256000	9258000	She was in the V.I.P. section
9258000	9260000	When a guy right there
9260000	9262000	She was just minding her own business
9262000	9264000	And all of a sudden
9264000	9266000	A guy started off like showing her
9266000	9268000	Showing her pictures of
9268000	9270000	You know of chicks
9270000	9272000	Of girls that he actually took
9272000	9274000	You know of their breasts
9274000	9276000	This guy actually took pictures of women's
9276000	9278000	Breasts throughout the party
9278000	9280000	So I mean at first it was a bit creepy
9280000	9282000	But then it got
9282000	9284000	Then he really ratcheted up when
9284000	9286000	He basically exposed his penis
9286000	9288000	And he grabbed her
9288000	9290000	He grabbed her hand and placed it in his
9290000	9292000	Right there in his crotch
9292000	9294000	With the penis exposed
9294000	9296000	And she just like
9296000	9298000	Freaked out in the sense that
9298000	9300000	You know she panicked later on
9300000	9302000	To the point where she was like
9302000	9304000	Suffering from stress
9304000	9306000	She didn't even call like
9306000	9308000	The police or security
9308000	9310000	Okay I'm gonna stop you there
9310000	9312000	I'm gonna stop you there
9312000	9314000	Cause there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here
9314000	9316000	If you go to the source and read the original story
9316000	9318000	Cause this is the part that infuriated me
9318000	9320000	She went to the security at the club
9320000	9322000	And she told her friends about what was going on
9322000	9324000	Cause you can read this at the source
9324000	9326000	She talked to the security guards
9326000	9328000	And the security guards the answer was basically like
9328000	9330000	Well what are we supposed to do about it
9330000	9332000	That infuriated me
9332000	9334000	This has nothing
9334000	9336000	The problem is at the end of the day
9336000	9338000	This really doesn't have anything to do with
9338000	9340000	Video games or what have you
9340000	9342000	Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name
9342000	9344000	It gives
9344000	9346000	Male gamers like myself a bad rep
9346000	9348000	I mean I have a
9348000	9350000	Girl gamer girlfriend of mine
9350000	9352000	She's an awesome gamer
9352000	9354000	Just as hardcore as I am
9354000	9356000	But more but
9356000	9358000	The bottom line is that
9358000	9360000	Every time any other like
9360000	9362000	Woman would
9362000	9364000	Picture a gamer or even look at me
9364000	9366000	As a gamer
9366000	9368000	I don't want them to think that I'm some
9368000	9370000	Perv that just like
9370000	9372000	Flashes himself in front of everyone
9372000	9374000	Because that adds like
9374000	9376000	Negative connotations to the whole
9376000	9378000	To our whole culture
9378000	9380000	See
9380000	9382000	I have to say this cause I'm thinking back to
9382000	9384000	My uh
9384000	9386000	Before I hurt my ankle I used to
9386000	9388000	Take a couple different
9388000	9390000	Styles of martial arts
9390000	9392000	First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself
9392000	9394000	You punch him in the dick
9394000	9396000	Seriously
9396000	9398000	But that would be assault
9398000	9400000	That would be assault
9400000	9402000	I do not
9402000	9404000	I don't condone that but I don't
9404000	9406000	If it's somebody you know
9406000	9408000	Putting you in a situation
9408000	9410000	Cause technically he grabbed her that could be assault
9410000	9412000	Let us all agree
9412000	9414000	It's battery if you grab somebody
9414000	9416000	Without I mean battery is like
9416000	9418000	If you like hurt them and they don't
9418000	9420000	You know if you touch them without necessarily
9420000	9422000	Hurting them that is battery
9422000	9424000	He touched her first
9424000	9426000	Yeah and it's sexual battery if it
9426000	9428000	Here's the deal you guys are going into this crazy
9428000	9430000	What if whatever because obviously
9430000	9432000	In the moment hold on hold on
9432000	9434000	In the moment she didn't know
9434000	9436000	If security guards called the cops
9436000	9438000	Then it would be his word it would be her word
9438000	9440000	Against his and trying to sort out that mess
9440000	9442000	Unless they have
9442000	9444000	There's no way they can press charges
9444000	9446000	They can get like
9446000	9448000	They can convict him
9448000	9450000	Or at least you know put him behind
9450000	9452000	Put him in cuffs
9452000	9454000	If there were actual witnesses
9454000	9456000	That can attest to her story
9456000	9458000	Then she could easily press charges
9458000	9460000	Otherwise a cop would just leave
9462000	9464000	So they're going to believe him over her
9464000	9466000	You're basically saying that they're all sexist
9466000	9468000	And they're going to take his word immediately
9468000	9470000	It's basically he said she said
9470000	9472000	Even when he's got photos of people
9472000	9474000	From the post
9474000	9476000	He's got the photos on his phone
9476000	9478000	Don't tell me there's not going to be
9478000	9480000	Cameras at the club that could see what's going on
9480000	9482000	But the incident
9482000	9484000	It's at the heart of the matter where
9484000	9486000	He basically grabbed
9486000	9488000	Her hand into his crotch
9488000	9490000	Unless he has someone actually seeing
9490000	9492000	That then you can't
9492000	9494000	The cops can't really do anything
9494000	9496000	But there is other evidence
9496000	9498000	For stuff that is just like
9498000	9500000	Substantial at best
9500000	9502000	That doesn't mean you ignore it
9502000	9504000	It was totally wrong
9504000	9506000	What the security guard did
9506000	9508000	If he did it to her
9508000	9510000	That's likely not the first time he's done this
9510000	9512000	Probably in the same night
9512000	9514000	They would
9514000	9516000	Separate everybody and question
9516000	9518000	All the witnesses
9518000	9520000	Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal
9520000	9522000	I'm not talking about security guards
9522000	9524000	I'm saying if the police were called in
9524000	9526000	Yes
9526000	9528000	They would have to actually
9528000	9530000	Step the party down
9530000	9532000	And detain everyone and investigate
9532000	9534000	So why are you defending them?
9534000	9536000	I'm not trying to defend them
9536000	9538000	I'm just saying that given the circumstances
9538000	9540000	That it's really hard
9540000	9542000	It's kind of like a no win scenario
9542000	9544000	You either call the police
9544000	9546000	And see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds
9546000	9548000	To arrest him
9548000	9550000	On that particular charge
9550000	9552000	Or you do nothing
9552000	9554000	And you basically
9554000	9556000	Get chided for inaction
9556000	9558000	Him grabbing her hand
9558000	9560000	If you don't
9560000	9562000	Him grabbing her hand and putting it on his junk
9562000	9564000	Is sexual assault, end of story
9564000	9566000	Right, of course
9566000	9568000	But the security guard
9568000	9570000	He would still suffer consequences
9570000	9572000	Regardless of his actions
9572000	9574000	Even if he did call the police
9574000	9576000	As well he should
9576000	9578000	Yeah of course
9578000	9580000	No doubt
9580000	9582000	There was not that much he could have done
9582000	9584000	No it's the victim's responsibility
9584000	9586000	If she wants to get the police to call the police
9586000	9588000	The security guard is there to maintain the security
9588000	9590000	In the club, he's not there to enforce the law
9590000	9592000	He's there to keep people alive
9592000	9594000	And to keep the business running
9594000	9596000	He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer
9596000	9598000	You know
9598000	9600000	He can only ask them to leave
9600000	9602000	And if he assaults
9602000	9604000	If the patron in question
9604000	9606000	Assaults the security guard
9606000	9608000	Then yeah he has a right to defend himself
9608000	9610000	Other than that he can't really
9610000	9612000	Physically detain them
9612000	9614000	He can only ask them to leave
9614000	9616000	And only after that point
9616000	9618000	If they resist
9618000	9620000	And they start being aggressive
9620000	9622000	Then the guard has the right
9622000	9624000	To defend himself
9624000	9626000	The security guard is not a cop
9626000	9628000	I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls
9628000	9630000	But thank you very much for calling in
9630000	9632000	And sharing this unfortunate story with us
9632000	9634000	Alright, take care
9634000	9636000	Bye
9636000	9638000	I just
9638000	9640000	I don't know
9640000	9642000	What does it say about our culture?
9642000	9644000	I don't want to live on this planet anymore
9646000	9648000	I don't
9648000	9650000	There are so many people
9650000	9652000	How much
9652000	9654000	Can we all agree
9654000	9656000	How much of this fault is hers?
9656000	9658000	Zero
9658000	9660000	Zero
9660000	9662000	The behavior has to be addressed
9662000	9664000	The guy's a sociopath
9664000	9666000	I just
9666000	9668000	Something that went back and said
9668000	9670000	In the chat room is like
9670000	9672000	We have this environment here where they're telling women
9672000	9674000	Oh well don't dress
9674000	9676000	Provocatively you could get raped
9676000	9678000	Or you know
9678000	9680000	I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself
9680000	9682000	You could get raped
9682000	9684000	It shouldn't be don't get raped
9684000	9686000	It should be don't rape
9686000	9688000	Don't assault
9688000	9690000	To Zaku's credit
9690000	9692000	And in the interest of fairness
9692000	9694000	I get where he's going
9694000	9696000	When you're innocent until proven guilty
9696000	9698000	But all I'm saying
9698000	9700000	Is that an investigation
9700000	9702000	Needed to be done
9702000	9704000	An investigation needed to be done
9704000	9706000	And I do think it's on the onus of the club
9706000	9708000	And the people that knew about it
9708000	9710000	To make sure that investigation
9710000	9712000	Takes place
9712000	9714000	It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet
9714000	9716000	The job of the security guard
9716000	9718000	Is to protect the interest of the club
9718000	9720000	Protecting the interest of the club
9720000	9722000	Also includes protecting the safety
9722000	9724000	Of those who were there
9724000	9726000	Yeah you're right in protecting the interest of the club
9726000	9728000	Because if I were a game company or whatever
9728000	9730000	If I was Mojang I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club
9730000	9732000	For any future event after this story
9732000	9734000	Or nor would anybody
9734000	9736000	If I was the owner of the club I would have
9736000	9738000	Basically ended my contract with that security firm
9738000	9740000	And gotten one with a better reputation
9740000	9742000	But the victim needs to contact the authority
9742000	9744000	The victim does need to contact the authority
9744000	9746000	As Dan just said
9746000	9748000	I hope
9748000	9750000	I hope the internet
9750000	9752000	Made her feel like she can do that
9752000	9754000	I don't know what else to say
9754000	9756000	One thing that I think men need to understand
9756000	9758000	Is that we still live in an environment
9758000	9760000	Where women are basically still treated
9760000	9762000	As second class citizens
9762000	9764000	A man is
9764000	9766000	Dan's saying that's bullshit but it happens
9766000	9768000	It's happened to me
9768000	9770000	You don't get it because you're a guy
9772000	9774000	And just because you see it in the pornos
9774000	9776000	Where a woman catches sight of a penis
9776000	9778000	And all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis
9778000	9780000	It doesn't happen in reality
9780000	9782000	Guys don't see it
9782000	9784000	If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class
9784000	9786000	And you allow yourself to be treated second class
9786000	9788000	It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not
9788000	9790000	You believe that it's happening
9790000	9792000	That's why you feel like it's happening
9792000	9794000	No
9794000	9796000	That's exactly the problem
9796000	9798000	Let's cut this shit off, we'll talk about this later
9798000	9800000	What was that last story
9800000	9802000	We just talked about then
9802000	9804000	It's happening
9804000	9806000	What was that last story in the game industry
9806000	9808000	I'm not even saying woman
9808000	9810000	I'm saying person person
9810000	9812000	A person has
9812000	9814000	I said that in the last story too
9814000	9816000	What if it was a guy
9816000	9818000	Whips it up from another guy
9818000	9820000	Same story
9820000	9822000	I would say the exact same thing
9822000	9824000	Or a woman doing it to another woman
9824000	9826000	It's inappropriate
9826000	9828000	Or a woman doing it to a guy
9828000	9830000	Yeah absolutely
9830000	9832000	Absolutely still inappropriate
9832000	9834000	Just because
9834000	9836000	Somebody doesn't tell
9836000	9838000	Doesn't mean there wasn't a crime
9838000	9840000	That's not the point
9840000	9842000	The point is
9842000	9844000	No one can hear what you're saying
9844000	9846000	Hold on
9846000	9848000	That's not the point
9848000	9850000	The point is she needs to stand up for herself
9850000	9852000	That's
9852000	9854000	How the citrus is going to get fixed
9854000	9856000	That's how the slimeball is going to get his fucking comeuppance
9856000	9858000	If he victimizes somebody
9858000	9860000	And that victim steps up
9860000	9862000	And fucking puts him down
9862000	9864000	There is a degree of
9864000	9866000	Having to choose not to be a victim
9866000	9868000	Which I don't understand why anyone would choose
9868000	9870000	To keep a victim's mentality
9870000	9872000	I don't think it's a choice
9872000	9874000	But you have to be able to go ahead
9874000	9876000	And say look
9876000	9878000	This happened to me
9878000	9880000	I accepted this happened to me
9880000	9882000	And this is the action I'm going to take
9882000	9884000	To rectify that
9884000	9886000	Okay
9886000	9888000	And also pointing and laughing at his penis
9888000	9890000	Would have been funny too
9890000	9892000	Pretty quick
9892000	9894000	Yeah tiny penis
9894000	9896000	But again hindsight
9896000	9898000	Is 20
9898000	9900000	Hindsight is 20 20
9900000	9902000	Hindsight is 20 20
9902000	9904000	You know it's easy to sit here and say
9904000	9906000	I would have done this
9906000	9908000	Someone should have done this
9908000	9910000	It's easy to sit here and do that
9910000	9912000	But when it's happening to you in that moment
9912000	9914000	You don't have that luxury
9914000	9916000	And that doesn't make what she did
9916000	9918000	Wrong by any means
9918000	9920000	And we need to have a society that still
9920000	9922000	Protects people
9922000	9924000	From having this happen to them
9924000	9926000	Anyhow
9926000	9928000	Let's move on
9928000	9930000	Do we have a gaming story or something? Let me go to Twitter
9930000	9932000	Because the tweets were sent in a long time ago
9932000	9934000	So we might have some gaming tweets
9934000	9936000	Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate
9936000	9938000	Was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully
9938000	9940000	Just saying
9940000	9942000	Moving on
9942000	9944000	Ossifer on Twitter
9944000	9946000	With Mass Effect content
9946000	9948000	Ooh, Garris
9948000	9950000	Ossifer says
9950000	9952000	Just started Final Fantasy 13-2
9952000	9954000	And I freaked out a little
9954000	9956000	When I saw DLC for N7 armor
9956000	9958000	For the main characters
9958000	9960000	That's true
9960000	9962000	There was some really awesome DLC
9962000	9964000	In Final Fantasy 13-2 that incorporated the games
9964000	9966000	Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?
9966000	9968000	I think so
9968000	9970000	Let's see
9970000	9972000	Other tweets
9972000	9974000	A couple from Tigerclaw
9974000	9976000	We do an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to
9976000	9978000	On Twitter
9978000	9980000	At Twitter.com slash OLR
9980000	9982000	It's not loading for me right now
9982000	9984000	But I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week
9984000	9986000	That basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline
9986000	9988000	For Wii U
9988000	9990000	I don't think that necessarily means
9990000	9992000	They don't think they really have anything in the pipeline
9992000	9994000	Beyond
9994000	9996000	I don't know, they just released
9996000	9998000	Surely there's something we just don't know about
9998000	10000000	But nothing that they've announced
10000000	10002000	Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced
10002000	10004000	That have
10004000	10006000	You know, have yet to come out
10006000	10008000	I mean they have Dishonored coming out
10008000	10010000	But that's pretty much it
10010000	10012000	I guess if you count Zenimax
10012000	10014000	Releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition
10014000	10016000	But aside from stuff beyond
10016000	10018000	2012
10018000	10020000	There really isn't anything that's been announced yet
10020000	10022000	So
10022000	10024000	Yeah, I guess that's a true statement
10024000	10026000	Alright, another tweet from Tigerclaw
10026000	10028000	About Double Fine
10028000	10030000	Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test
10030000	10032000	He links us to a clip on
10032000	10034000	Gamasutra
10034000	10036000	This is not the big Kickstarter thing
10036000	10038000	It's a free-to-play superhero
10038000	10040000	Management game called Middle Manager of Justice
10040000	10042000	Okay, you have to admit
10042000	10044000	That's kind of funny
10044000	10046000	It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine
10046000	10048000	Obviously, because it's on iOS
10048000	10050000	Here's the thing, the game was not supposed to be out
10050000	10052000	For several weeks
10052000	10054000	So they pulled it from the iOS store
10054000	10056000	But a lot of people were able to download it anyway
10056000	10058000	So they're just considering it, eh, beta test
10058000	10060000	And you know what, they're owning up to it
10060000	10062000	Which I think is very interesting
10062000	10064000	One of the folks here, Ki Chi
10064000	10066000	Who is the project lead
10066000	10068000	Yep, it was totally my fault
10068000	10070000	With the way you submit things on the app store
10070000	10072000	You have to specify what the release date is
10072000	10074000	And a while back we had set the date to September
10074000	10076000	But at the time, we didn't know if that would be final or not
10076000	10078000	Once we submitted the game, we realized
10078000	10080000	We had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix
10080000	10082000	But at the same time, we didn't want to remove it
10082000	10084000	From the submission process in case Apple catches
10084000	10086000	Other things we need to take care of
10086000	10088000	Is to do a double submission
10088000	10090000	So, at least they're trying to
10090000	10092000	You know, make lemonade out of lemons
10092000	10094000	On getting the stuff released early
10094000	10096000	That's it for Twitter tonight
10096000	10098000	One last call for calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR
10098000	10100000	Or username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
10100000	10102000	Although I can't fault people
10102000	10104000	For not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion
10104000	10106000	If you, obviously
10106000	10108000	There's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight
10108000	10110000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
10110000	10112000	Is a great place, you know
10112000	10114000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice
10114000	10116000	We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio
10116000	10118000	And those of you in the chat room
10118000	10120000	And so forth, we want everybody to be able to have
10120000	10122000	Their say, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
10122000	10124000	If you would like to get your two cents in
10124000	10126000	Of course there's always Facebook
10126000	10128000	And Twitter as well
10128000	10130000	Google Plus and what have you
10130000	10132000	Skype line ain't lighting up
10132000	10134000	I guess that means I'm gonna go ahead and close it
10134000	10136000	We'll try again next week
10136000	10138000	In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight
10138000	10140000	We did all last minute stories, do we have any more?
10140000	10142000	Loki?
10142000	10144000	Anything? I mean
10144000	10146000	This week will be interesting
10146000	10148000	Yeah, this coming week is gonna be very interesting
10148000	10150000	Between the iPhone 5 and the
10150000	10152000	Possible iPad mini
10152000	10154000	Nintendo
10154000	10156000	I don't know if we'll see that, but
10156000	10158000	What do you think of the new Kindles
10158000	10160000	That they have coming out?
10160000	10162000	I didn't really read up on them enough
10162000	10164000	Because we already have a Kindle
10164000	10166000	I'm not really in the market for a new one
10166000	10168000	The other one that sounded interesting was
10168000	10170000	I'm not in the market for tablet at all
10170000	10172000	It's the
10172000	10174000	Kindle Fire HD
10174000	10176000	The one that has the 9 inch screen
10176000	10178000	Or whatever
10178000	10180000	The 4G one has
10180000	10182000	A $50 a year data plan
10182000	10184000	250 megabytes a month
10184000	10186000	Data
10186000	10188000	You get with that
10188000	10190000	For 50 bucks a year, that's not bad
10190000	10192000	If you're not using a ton of data
10192000	10194000	For me, I normally wouldn't use
10194000	10196000	That much data, but I do stream
10196000	10198000	Pandora, so I've used up like
10198000	10200000	600-700 megabytes
10200000	10202000	This month, but
10202000	10204000	That's like the most I've ever
10204000	10206000	Used
10206000	10208000	I don't know, it looked interesting
10210000	10212000	But, you know
10212000	10214000	We'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff
10214000	10216000	Being the same, you know, the $199
10216000	10218000	They did drop the original Kindle Fire down
10218000	10220000	The $160 though, to try to
10220000	10222000	Undercut Google a little bit, but
10222000	10224000	Still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199
10224000	10226000	Can't you flash those or something?
10226000	10228000	You can flash any Android system
10228000	10230000	Any of those can be jailbroken
10230000	10232000	Yeah, my wife's Nook's
10232000	10234000	Jailbroken
10234000	10236000	It's kind of fun, you can do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to
10236000	10238000	Oh yeah, like what?
10238000	10240000	Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on
10240000	10242000	The Nook, so I added
10242000	10244000	That with an optional bootloader
10244000	10246000	And stuff on there, and so she can do that
10246000	10248000	Plus, if she wanted
10248000	10250000	To, she could pirate apps for it
10250000	10252000	I didn't do that
10252000	10254000	But I mainly
10254000	10256000	Went with Windows 4 to the other app store
10256000	10258000	So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps
10258000	10260000	And she's like, I don't want to get other apps
10260000	10262000	Fine, I did that all for nothing then
10262000	10264000	So
10264000	10266000	Alright
10266000	10268000	I guess that's it for
10268000	10270000	Someone call, please
10270000	10272000	No, I shut the Skype line, it's done
10272000	10274000	Oh, dang it, I want something happy
10274000	10276000	Well, we're after 9 o'clock
10276000	10278000	Dan's gonna take me to Pinkberry
10278000	10280000	That's a happy subject, Pinkberry's always a good thing
10280000	10282000	I was very sad though, they did not respond to our tweet
10282000	10284000	We celebrated the show by going shopping
10284000	10286000	For candles in the mall at Yankee Candle
10286000	10288000	And then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful
10288000	10290000	And Dan had made some type of comment like
10290000	10292000	Oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out
10292000	10294000	You're hanging out
10294000	10296000	Yep
10296000	10298000	Well
10298000	10300000	He didn't call, so I gotta put this out there
10300000	10302000	Don't know if he's listening
10302000	10304000	But if he is, Ronma, stay black
10304000	10306000	I think
10306000	10308000	He just joined us not that long ago, so there you go
10308000	10310000	I was just talking to him in private message, so
10310000	10312000	About private things
10312000	10314000	I know, right
10314000	10316000	Anyhow, we're gonna wrap up the show
10316000	10318000	Dan, thank you very much for being here tonight
10318000	10320000	And bringing your always controversial opinions
10320000	10322000	I mean that in a great way
10322000	10324000	To the program, and best of all, the fights
10324000	10326000	We all love it
10326000	10328000	You don't fight
10328000	10330000	Dan, do you have any last words for our listeners tonight? Final thoughts?
10330000	10332000	Stay black, everyone
10332000	10334000	Will do
10334000	10336000	DarkSakura, you're his wife, why don't you go next?
10336000	10338000	Your final thought tonight
10338000	10340000	Fuck bitches
10340000	10342000	I'm kidding
10342000	10344000	Because dudes can be bitches too
10344000	10346000	You know what?
10346000	10348000	Sociopaths need to be locked up, end of story
10348000	10350000	My final thought is
10350000	10352000	I wanna thank Alan
10352000	10354000	For getting me Clue on Blu-ray
10354000	10356000	Because it's about time I have such an amazing movie
10356000	10358000	On Blu-ray
10358000	10360000	And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980's
10360000	10362000	You're doing yourself a disservice
10362000	10364000	They rerun it on TV all the time
10364000	10366000	And it's a cult classic
10366000	10368000	Please, there are ladies present
10368000	10370000	Loki, your final thought tonight
10370000	10372000	Go play Minecraft
10372000	10374000	Buy it for me
10374000	10376000	Join the VoG server
10376000	10378000	See, here's the thing
10378000	10380000	Technically I could set up the server in a way that you don't need to buy it
10380000	10382000	But
10382000	10384000	There is a way
10384000	10386000	Through a website called Mine Shafter
10386000	10388000	We wanna support Mojang
10388000	10390000	But there is a way through Mine Shafter
10390000	10392000	It's www.mineshafter.com
10392000	10394000	Where you can
10394000	10396000	Basically log in with that
10396000	10398000	Instead of
10398000	10400000	It's a patched
10400000	10402000	Proxy server or something like that
10402000	10404000	You run
10404000	10406000	The client through
10406000	10408000	But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers
10408000	10410000	Cracked servers are
10410000	10412000	Where they have the mode online toggled to false
10412000	10414000	Instead of true
10414000	10416000	I have mine on true right now
10416000	10418000	However, yesterday when their authentication server went down
10418000	10420000	I had it toggled to false
10420000	10422000	So I could log in still
10422000	10424000	And authenticate it
10424000	10426000	Technically there's some security holes if you leave it to false
10426000	10428000	People can spoof stuff
10428000	10430000	But being that we're a close-knit group
10430000	10432000	I could
10432000	10434000	Set it to false
10434000	10436000	But I'm gonna stick with the true right now
10436000	10438000	Alright
10438000	10440000	We wanna thank you guys as always for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio
10440000	10442000	And showing us your support
10442000	10444000	We are an indie podcast
10444000	10446000	We don't have a giant website
10446000	10448000	Or commercial backing or what have you
10448000	10450000	So all we have is word of mouth
10450000	10452000	Please tell people about the show
10452000	10454000	And you know what, spread the word of other indie podcasts

10460000	10462000	Help spread the word guys, it's all we got
10462000	10464000	Hey Rob
10464000	10466000	The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it
10466000	10468000	We want oral love
10468000	10470000	A-U-R-A-L right?
10470000	10472000	No, oral with mouth
10472000	10474000	Right, alright, whatever
10474000	10476000	Spread the love
10476000	10478000	That's something I can get behind
10478000	10480000	In front of

10482000	10484000	Thank you guys for staying up late with us
10484000	10486000	And participating with the show

10490000	10492000	Be ready for it
10492000	10494000	I'm sure Loki's gonna have a lot to say
10494000	10496000	I'm ready to be underwhelmed
10496000	10498000	Is your body ready?
10498000	10500000	Oh my body's ready
10500000	10502000	What time is it at?
10502000	10504000	Is it in the morning?
10504000	10506000	I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit
10506000	10508000	Another live blog
10508000	10510000	I can't wait
10510000	10512000	What the hell is this shit?
10512000	10514000	We need to talk to Bobby real quick
10514000	10516000	And see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network
10516000	10518000	There's all these live streaming
10518000	10520000	Live blogging software things
10520000	10522000	I'm at work at that time
10522000	10524000	So we'll see
10524000	10526000	Excuse me
10526000	10528000	So your body is ready for the press conference
10528000	10530000	My body's ready for disappointment
10530000	10532000	Seriously
10532000	10534000	And the iOS conference as well
10534000	10536000	The iPhone and the iPad is gaming
10536000	10538000	So I'm curious to see what the next thing is
10538000	10540000	So we'll see them next week
10540000	10542000	Have a good week everybody
10542000	10544000	Are they gonna call it the new iPad or the new iPod
10544000	10546000	Or the new iPhone
10546000	10548000	Because that would be hilarious
10548000	10550000	Lastly
10550000	10552000	Oh my god
10552000	10554000	Act Def reminded us
10554000	10556000	We didn't even talk about it
10556000	10558000	You finally dressed as Tingle
10558000	10560000	And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show
10560000	10562000	Because it was like a week ago at this point
10562000	10564000	Tell us about the Tingle thing
10564000	10566000	I finally won that contest
10566000	10568000	The retweet thing
10568000	10570000	So she drew me as Tingle
10570000	10572000	That's the closest you're gonna get
10572000	10574000	And they did hit their goal
10574000	10578000	So Evilot is gonna get their orchestra soundtrack now
10578000	10580000	So that's pretty awesome
10580000	10582000	But yeah
10582000	10584000	She's awesome
10584000	10586000	Beatrix is awesome
10586000	10588000	And she drew a wonderful picture of me
10588000	10590000	My wife said
10590000	10592000	I drew a picture of Josh
10592000	10594000	I'm like crap
10594000	10596000	But you know whatever
10596000	10598000	Nah the one he used funnier
10598000	10600000	You know what first of all how old is your son now 2
10600000	10602000	He'll look different
10602000	10604000	He wouldn't appreciate it
10604000	10606000	Like for 5 seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else
10606000	10608000	Make it your twitter picture or something so we can see it
10608000	10610000	Alright
10610000	10612000	Have a great week everybody
