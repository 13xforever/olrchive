13676	25548	Tonight, September 9th, 2012, rumors return about Valve creating a new console, the homebrew scene may have cracked the Vita, and one company finally decides to end their controversial DRM method.
31707	36771	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36851	41155	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this September the 9th of 2012.
42616	45058	Oh, it's September 9th, you know what that means.
45578	54065	Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Dreamcast, happy birthday to you.
54165	54686	Okay, speed mix.
54946	56546	I was going to say, it's a little early for my birthday.
58167	59927	We're almost to your birthday, though.
60267	60808	That's right.
60928	63128	Your birthday's just two days away, Tech Master Loki.
64228	65629	We've gone and screwed up the intro.
65669	66789	Everything is all amiss.
66809	68089	Sorry, I can't talk yet.
68210	68690	That's all right.
68710	69510	I've been shunned.
69530	71530	You can't talk until you've been introduced, Loki.
72771	75011	Please say hello, everybody, to Tech Master Loki joining us tonight.
75271	75491	Hi.
75812	77292	You can introduce Jamie first.
77952	79572	I've decided to do things different tonight.
79893	80453	Differently.
81773	86181	Also say hello to Grammar Master DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
87403	88144	She'll cut a bitch.
88385	89146	I will cut a bitch.
90408	91190	I don't even care.
91330	91891	How are you doing?
93113	93193	Um...
94830	95050	Yeah.
95330	95830	Okay, great.
97231	106514	We are live, of course, at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, where we do tape our show every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
106834	108334	I got to say, props to Bobby.
108494	113836	I know we plug his show a lot, but hey, we've been doing this stuff together for what, like six, seven years now?
114476	115376	Had our shows back to back.
115436	116637	He had an A-plus show tonight.
116957	120898	He had an interview with Gearbox Software and some of the guys over there.
121138	123839	It addressed the whole girlfriend mode controversy.
124419	128222	Bobby went on a rant about games journalism and how that whole thing started in the first place.
128622	129563	Must listen episode.
129743	130083	Loved it.
130383	132665	So check that out at vognetwork.com.
132685	133986	It'll be posted later tonight.
134206	135187	I love when Bobby rants.
135307	136468	But hopefully you'll listen to our show.
136488	146755	I know usually he's so nice and inviting and, you know, oh, we're going to have the listeners on the show and he doesn't get angry very often, but that was... I also did find it amusing that someone said he looks like Mick Foley.
149437	149797	Bang, bang.
150273	150974	A little bit, a little bit.
150994	151234	All right.
151394	154576	He needs more flannel vests in order to pull that off.
154616	158299	He needs more flannel and jumping off of the top of the cage and landing on the announcers.
158599	172589	Well, look, we may not have an exclusive AAA interview with the game developer this week, but we do have something you guys over at Orange Launch Radio, the OL Army, have been asking for for quite some time.
172629	177652	We have the return, surprise, of a favorite guest of yours here at Orange Launch Radio.
178053	179033	Say hello, everybody, to...
180194	180655	Dan.
180975	181916	Dan is back tonight.
182296	182997	Yo, what up?
183157	183958	How you doing, Dan?
184198	184859	I'm doing good.
185339	187801	For those that don't know Dan, I'm sorry.
188962	190824	For those who don't know Dan, you're lucky.
191725	194167	Dan is DarkSakura's husband.
194488	194748	Yes.
195288	195649	Or me.
195949	197150	Shut up.
197290	197571	See?
198792	200754	It's going to be one of those shows tonight.
201174	203336	They are just going to fight all night long.
203556	204117	Good times.
205165	207727	Dan, how long has it been since you've been on the show?
207747	209147	It's been a good at least six months, right?
209748	210028	I don't know.
210048	210568	It's been a while.
210588	210948	All right.
210968	214770	Well, I like to think we've probably landed some new listeners between six months ago and now.
215210	217852	So tell us a little bit about your gaming history.
217972	219312	Why do you love video games?
219332	220313	And I know you love video games.
220353	221013	Don't even try to lie.
221233	222294	I like to keep it special.
223815	224895	I show up once in a while.
224935	225596	You know, at random.
225876	226816	Nobody knows when I'm coming.
226956	228157	But the games, the games.
228177	228857	I'm like a ninja.
228957	230318	Why do you like video games?
232165	232545	I don't know.
232945	234326	He's really having to think about this one.
234386	235306	They've just always been there.
235687	236947	Video games have always been there?
237547	237867	Yeah.
238088	239268	Even when Jamie's yelling at you?
240048	241029	You can turn to video games?
241329	243350	No, no, I mean like in the past.
243770	245511	That's kind of how we met, kind of.
245651	247352	That and anime.
248932	249252	Yeah.
249412	252014	Our mutual hatred of bad Ranma fanfiction.
252134	252894	Kind of more anime.
255797	257858	What is your favorite video game of all time?
258278	278464	I always like to ask guests on the show this It's a tough question It's supposed to be a tough question Symphony of the Night Castlevania That's a damn good game Metal Gear Solid You can go back a little bit further There's a couple other good ones Super Metroid Gunstar Heroes How do you feel about that?
278484	279885	I like Gunstar Heroes a lot
280532	282273	Now, we were off last week.
282653	284073	We didn't have a show last week.
284513	288575	I hope you guys all had a good Labor Day at the various conventions going on everywhere and what have you.
288995	291575	So we were gone last week, so we missed some of last week's news.
292776	295857	You being a Metal Gear fan, Dan, how do you feel about that new Metal Gear game they announced?
296516	297297	I'm feeling pretty good.
297477	297697	Yeah?
298017	300639	I was watching the trailer and I'm just like, oh my god.
301219	301980	It's so long.
302000	302900	He changed his wallpaper.
302920	304482	And they keep introducing all these people.
305522	307163	Okay, okay, whatever.
307223	308284	Hey, it's Solid Snake!
308464	309445	Well, Naked Snake.
309565	310186	Hey, it's Snake!
310626	310926	Awesome.
311506	312447	He changed his wallpaper.
312687	314549	Yeah, I put my Snake wallpaper back up.
314949	316070	Or the Big Boss wallpaper.
316430	316670	Yeah.
317591	319732	Because Big Boss is a fucking gangster!
322394	324155	Jamie doesn't like it though because it terrifies her.
324455	325116	No, it doesn't.
326189	333574	It's like this big intense face and he's like looking out of the screen like I kind of like it better than the GLaDOS error blue screen of death that you had before.
333674	334394	That one is awesome.
335415	336216	That's old.
336236	337376	Yeah, but it's awesome.
337557	338217	But it's old.
338457	339078	But it's awesome.
339738	341239	My wallpaper is far better than yours.
341339	341659	Thank you.
341819	342240	I don't care.
342400	349244	So Dan, one of the other big games that was announced while we were off on break was Final Fantasy 13 Lightning Returns.
351986	352647	No, no, no.
352847	355048	It's Lightning Returns Final Fantasy 13.
356189	357530	Excuse me!
358130	359691	Excuse me!
360111	361031	How dare I?
361231	361952	No, that's not worthy.
362272	363752	It's Final Fantasy XIII 3.
364153	364753	Let's be real.
364773	365473	That's what it is.
365653	369655	But it's one of those weird Square Enix games where they're like, hey, you know what?
370095	371856	We're going to put that subtitle first.
372296	373477	It's not going to be a sub anymore.
373617	374417	It is a title.
375378	377258	Final Fantasy, we'll take the back end.
378199	379419	We'll just step down for a second.
380960	382403	We'll take the back end this time.
383124	384486	We're giving them the money shot.
384606	385908	Lightning's going to explore the back door.
385928	388291	They like to savor the last shot before popping the heat sink.
394131	394471	All right.
396093	397374	We're going to start off the show tonight.
397414	402859	We will get into our gaming weeks here in a little bit, but I have a little bit something – I have something special to get into at the top of the show tonight here.
404100	410105	I'm going to play something for you guys, and unfortunately, you only get to see the audio – or you only get to hear the audio of this because it is a podcast.
410786	413488	But this trailer will soon be making its way to YouTubes.
414049	415470	I'm going to give you guys the premiere –
416811	421354	of the new Xbox Live indie game, Bungie Ferret Tossing.
421714	423115	It is coming out very soon.
423175	428699	In fact, the designer is going to be on the line with us in just a minute after I play this trailer for you guys to talk a little more about this game.
428719	431481	And yes, it is an OLR-inspired game.
431901	436144	You might remember we used to come up with these little dream games, things we wanted to see.
436264	437465	Like, what was the one we had?
437505	443949	The WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, which is like Pokemon Snap, but it's two gay guys holding a dismembered head shouting, "'Fuck.'"
444589	447530	It's like a really old reference to a news article from like 2008.
448030	450011	Like right now you probably just think that's insanity and it is.
450051	450571	That's a fun thing.
451271	452751	What on the show is it saying?
452911	465795	I don't even remember what inspired it but we added the game Bungie Ferret Tossing to the list and Aaron went and he actually made a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing and it looks awesome.
466295	468776	Here's the debut trailer here on Orange Lounge Radio.
469261	470862	Do you love flying a helicopter?
471042	471882	Yeah!
472082	473983	Do you love swinging from a bungee cord?
474123	474904	Yeah!
475224	476744	Do you love blowing stuff up?
476865	477845	Yeah!
478245	479546	Do you love terrorists?
480406	483388	Awkward... Do you love blowing up terrorists?
483448	484448	Yeah!
484908	490111	Do you love flying a helicopter, swinging from a bungee cord, and blowing up terrorists with small exploding animals?
491209	494031	Because that's what you do in Bungie Ferret Tossing!
494392	496634	That's right, Bungie Ferret Tossing!
497034	504700	The story begins when a terrorist base is discovered in Arizona, which is good because now there's something in Arizona, but it's bad because it's a terrorist base.
505141	510365	So armed only with the most advanced ferro-weapons technology, you must attempt to storm their desert base.
510725	518011	They'll come at you with guns, rockets, high-powered rifles, hired ninjas, and even insane laughter.
520748	527889	But you're armed to the teeth with timed ferrets, proximity ferrets, homing ferrets, and even cluster ferrets.
528249	529050	Will it be enough?
529310	531830	Try it for free on Xbox Live Indie Games.
532130	540392	Bunch of ferret tossing also features two-legged cone, three difficult floors, bonus survival and time attack modes, and a great soundtrack.
540892	547493	Intense action, bullet-dodging thrills, and the combination of screaming and squealing that you won't find anywhere else.
549669	552949	Bungie Ferret Tossing on Xbox Live Indie Game
556644	557885	Love, love, love.
558105	561647	YYRgames.com for more information on that.
561927	562907	What'd you think, DarkSakura?
563247	563928	I am pleased.
564168	565769	I think that might have been your idea.
566189	567650	Are you happy with how that turned out?
567870	568230	Quite.
568410	570071	And I named the dude, the last name.
570091	570591	That's right.
570972	571332	That's right.
571352	572592	I forgot what I named him.
572873	576955	Let's get Aaron or YYR on the line right now to talk a little more about bungee ferret tossing.
577235	583398	And you guys are probably thinking there at home, like, God, Orange Laundry, are you really going to sit here and whore out this indie game at the top of your show?
583458	584098	Yes, we are.
584118	584979	Fuck yes, we are.
585519	587040	Heck, I'm thinking that and I'm at the show.
587200	591082	When it's something that, you know, was inspired by one of our ideas.
591142	591963	Hey, Aaron, you there?
594444	595025	I mean, yes.
595145	595625	Yes, I am.
595645	598326	Can I just start by saying, I love you, man.
600388	601128	I love you, man.
601328	601969	Seriously.
602509	603649	I love you guys, too.
603710	606131	You're making our dream come true, and I love it.
608682	611225	I, you know, I figured I'd take the ball and run with it.
611505	616129	I mean, it sat on my plate for a while, but hey, you guys told me to get on that.
616690	619132	And so, eventually, I did.
621380	622981	Well, we are happy that you did.
623041	625723	So how long of a process did it take to grow?
625743	630366	Well, actually, let me back up a little bit because Bungie Veritas-ing, it's almost done, right?
630406	632708	Like we're going to see it released very, very soon, right?
633268	651280	The game is in Xbox Live Indie Games peer review process right now where other game creators basically try it out, make sure it doesn't crash, make sure there's nothing objectionable, make sure that the ratings I put on it for violence, especially, and nudity and other things are accurate.
652020	671693	and then you know once they find that there's nothing wrong with it they pass it and once enough people pass it it's approved and then once it's approved I click a button and it's out so I've been basically reviewing other people's games all weekend let me tell you something there is some stuff up there right now I would not wish on any of you
673243	675005	I play the game, so you don't have to.
689278	691040	This is going to happen very soon.
691600	694202	I'm just saying Loki's birthday is in two days.
694362	695063	That's all I'm saying.
696444	697225	Oh, well.
698786	701448	I have to basically decide what day of the week I want to release it.
701809	706192	And I also want to take some time to go ahead and email anybody who's ever given me a business card.
706693	710416	I have quite a few contacts that I've been terrible at keeping in touch with.
711176	727763	so I'm just basically going to email everybody be like hey guess what's happening like right now this game it's coming out here's the trailer here's a press kit do you want to review code and I'd like to do that before the game comes out so basically it means I'll probably be doing this like pretty soon alright I understand yeah
728203	730264	Yeah, then I'm going to push the button.
730304	733105	I'm hoping to release it on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, to be honest.
733525	737387	I mean, Wednesday is the day lots of people are looking for new stuff on Xbox Live anyway.
737487	739228	And actually, this is kind of interesting.
740448	743550	Have you guys heard of the Xbox Indie Games Uprising?
743830	744290	I have.
744390	749092	This is kind of the answer to the summer games arcade and...
750213	754477	All the other promotions they do for the big boy games from the big companies, right?
754977	760382	Well, what's interesting is that the Indie Games Uprising 3 begins tomorrow.
760662	768089	And a new indie game that's part of the Uprising is going to be coming out every day for the next 10 days, I believe.
768690	770672	So I'm going to be right there with them.
771152	775635	So that's actually kind of exciting because I feel like I'm going to get more exposure that way.
776155	779737	And also the fact that it's a game called Bungie Ferret Tossing.
780338	783300	Okay, I have to get to some comments from our chat because this is too good.
783340	788723	And by the way, if you are listening at vognetwork.com, please make sure you're in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
789063	796708	Now, we understand that Bungie Ferret Tossing obviously is going to have the violence meter, but we have some people in our chat, starting with Frisbee, questioning if there will be nudity.
797068	799470	Will there be nudity in Bungie Ferret Tossing?
799910	810294	Other than the fact that people are exploding in blood everywhere, and of course it's very fake and cartoony looking, no, there is going to be no other objectionable content of any kind, including nudity.
810334	817876	And by the way, I apologize to the chat room for not actually being there at this particular moment, but it's hard enough for me to focus on two things at once.
817916	819217	That's all right, I'll tell you what you need to know.
819437	821678	Alright, and you gotta save something for the sequel.
822018	823639	I mean, you know.
823659	824420	I'll tell you something.
824580	829062	I have a wish list for the sequel that is just ridiculous.
829223	832524	In fact, if you want, I will give you that list in a few minutes.
832564	833205	Amazing.
833565	834986	Well, let's put boobs on the list.
835606	838067	No, I'm not putting boobs on the list, I'm sorry.
838087	839988	I have to draw the line somewhere.
840628	843169	I wanted to be as family friendly as possible.
843189	846831	You should have darkly colored chickens.
847992	849372	Huge, dark chickens.
850293	850993	Dark chickens?
851753	853614	Yeah, from another old joke, Big Black Cock.
853894	854555	Oh, stop.
855555	856676	We do Dark Chickens.
856696	857617	I'll put that on the list.
857837	858698	Alright, that'll work.
859659	860659	Let me say this real quick.
860679	871208	Jessica Harper from our good pals at Under Station Live Saturday nights here at VOG says, The irony of releasing ferrets attacking terrorists in a game on September 11th is not lost on me.
872309	873330	Oh my god.
874431	875492	Did you even think of that?
876012	876673	I did not.
878350	883133	We've got to be careful because obviously we don't want to make light of a terrible, terrible situation.
883253	889176	But, you know, at the same time, some of us, some people heal through, you know, methods like this.
889497	891238	Like floating ferrets.
893759	894960	This is a fantastic idea.
897881	899722	At least now there will be something in Arizona.
899822	900263	There you go.
902184	903905	Honestly, everyone I've ever talked to,
904775	909797	who's either lived or worked or studied in Arizona has basically said the same thing to me.
909937	910958	There's nothing there.
911538	914499	So that is the whole reason why I put that in there.
915300	916800	Basically, I'm acknowledging what they said.
917081	917581	Very nice.
917681	918021	Very nice.
918341	918601	All right.
919362	919982	So let me think.
920222	924664	I got to ask you any last questions here so we can actually get started with our show tonight.
924684	928266	But I wanted to bring you on because you've done such a huge, huge thing for us here.
928606	930827	And even though you're the one that's ultimately going to profit from it,
931187	932208	I still think it's great.
932248	933508	It has my full blessing.
933548	941693	If this game does really well, I am totally going to fly out there and take you guys out and buy you dinner and beer and all kinds of crazy stuff.
941953	943974	That is going to be... Beer works.
945075	946495	You can pay us in beer, sir.
948176	948677	You got it.
948857	949337	Amazing.
949617	952258	It'd be awesome to hang out with all you guys anyway.
952799	953239	We're fun.
953719	954220	We promise.
954860	956361	No exploding ferrets in person, though.
956401	957641	Let's stay away from that.
957701	959983	I don't know if we can put a firecracker in one of the little...
960763	962044	A little more about the game.
962744	966045	One thing I noticed from the trailer, because I unfortunately have not been able to play it yet.
966125	969207	I did not go to one of the conventions that you were at showing off the game and what have you.
969647	976090	But I can tell it has a great old arcade-style look and feel to it, as all your previous games really have.
976150	979391	You're very inspired by old-school 80s arcade games, aren't you?
979812	983173	Just arcade games and intense action-packed games in general.
983213	986114	That's the only kind of game I'm ever going to make because that's what I'm most into.
988573	996798	So, yeah, I don't know if it has an old-looking vibe or what, but it's probably more like a programmer art kind of vibe, because I'm not very good at it.
997018	1005763	I wouldn't say it's old-looking, it's just old, like the gameplay style looks very like if an Atari 2600 game was modern, and that's certainly not a bad thing.
1005823	1008725	We killed hours and hours and hours with the boom and stuff, you know what I mean?
1009685	1012227	It has a Defender-ish look to it.
1013587	1015889	Actually, you're not the first person that compares it to Defender.
1016429	1018051	Obviously, you're not saving people.
1018251	1019852	You're destroying them with ferrets.
1020072	1020953	As you should.
1023755	1026377	But yes, it has been compared to Defender before.
1027307	1027587	Nice.
1027647	1030190	But it's a whole new... It's not a Defender clone at all.
1030230	1032172	It's a whole new... There's bungee cords and everything.
1032252	1034154	Defender meets Bionic Commando.
1034254	1035175	Kind of.
1035275	1037497	It's just... Exploding ferrets.
1037637	1038017	With ferrets.
1038438	1040420	It's new while feeling retro.
1040600	1041241	And I think that's cool.
1041261	1042202	And that's true in all your games.
1042222	1043162	It's just awesome.
1043983	1044704	So... Boom.
1045405	1045725	All right.
1045825	1051831	Well, Erin, before I let you go and we get into the rest of OLR and what's going on in the gaming world this week, is there anything else you want to say on bungee ferret tossing?
1053145	1053626	You know what?
1053866	1055627	It's been a very long process.
1058048	1060410	I actually started this project last May.
1061610	1063772	So it's been in the works for a very long time.
1064612	1070916	Nonetheless, I've had a very, very huge amount of fun working on it, and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.
1071296	1072077	It'll be a dollar.
1072497	1073878	It'll be free to try.
1074198	1077220	And yeah, I hope you guys all go and enjoy and play it.
1077860	1081222	Do you want to hear very quickly the wish list for the sequel?
1081402	1081983	Absolutely.
1082043	1082163	Yay!
1082643	1084605	Okay, I'll see how quickly I can tear through this.
1085105	1096656	Unlockable ferret sounds, versus mode, network ranking, alpacas with saddlebags filled with stuff and lasers homing lasers, elemental ferrets, fire, ice, and lightning, strife amethysts,
1098140	1100782	Yes, not Chaos Emeralds because we can't rip off anybody.
1101163	1102824	Credits will contain a rhythm game.
1103265	1106368	Other vehicles besides helicopter, like Bungie from a motorboat, yes.
1106788	1108229	Dedicated sound for missile launch.
1108269	1110591	Screen clearing bombs that can be stored and triggered at any time.
1110892	1112213	Ferrets equipped with milk tea.
1112613	1113975	Money should be used to buy stuff.
1114835	1115316	Oh, yes.
1115516	1118879	Raise ferrets and train them and feed them a la Derby Owners Club.
1118979	1122362	These trained ferrets will then develop unique abilities that can be used in-game.
1123303	1133420	Deformable landscapes Summon killer train to attack enemies An eagle operating a crane Needs to be a stage boss Flying body parts and at least one stage set in a city
1133786	1134666	I would love to bring that to you guys.
1134686	1135446	I got a quick question.
1135466	1135706	Yes, Dan.
1135726	1136367	Are there any zombies in it?
1159750	1160190	Not yet.
1160811	1162913	There are no indie games without zombies.
1163934	1165075	There's plenty of indie games.
1165095	1166356	So you gotta put some zombies in.
1167036	1168257	Every indie game has zombies.
1168738	1173482	There are at least five games in peer review right now that are all zombie killing games.
1174122	1176364	I'm saying every indie game has zombies.
1177205	1178746	So we need some zombie ferrets.
1178786	1180228	You know what there is in the game though?
1180248	1181809	I hope I'm not spoiling anything.
1181849	1183691	There are kittens in the game.
1183831	1184511	Are they zombies?
1186013	1186433	Maybe.
1187634	1188695	You are fucking this up for me, Rob.
1188715	1192958	There's a screen when you run the game that says please don't throw animals in real life.
1194900	1196141	Yeah, we can't do that with my cat.
1196181	1196842	She's too huge.
1197402	1199044	Oh, I could.
1199204	1205109	There might be cameos from some familiar cats that show up on those screens, but we'll see.
1205429	1210033	Anyway, okay, Aaron, I gotta wrap up and let you go, but everybody, be on the lookout for Bungie Ferret Tossing.
1210073	1211894	It will be out in the coming days.
1212014	1216258	We can't pinpoint an exact day yet because of the whole Xbox Live process, but it will be out very soon.
1216698	1240437	and it's a dollar for heaven's sake we never ask you to buy anything here at Orange Lounge Radio but we're gonna say buy this because it's gonna be very hard for Aaron to stand out amongst all these other indie games that are having a lot of spotlight this week we really want Aaron to be able to do well so when the news goes out please spend one whopping dollar you probably already have it in your leftover points anyway and go buy this game
1241218	1241618	You'll have fun.
1241638	1244699	If you follow YYR Games on Twitter, you'll know exactly when it comes out.
1244820	1247140	I will tweet the moment it releases.
1247501	1251962	And check out the website, of course, yyrgames.com where you have other games.
1252243	1258665	We didn't even get around to mentioning tonight, but you have other games on the marketplace like Snake 360 and Falling that are worth checking out.
1258805	1259306	Absolutely.
1259486	1260186	Thank you.
1260226	1261066	I appreciate that.
1261286	1262747	Old arcade game style stuff.
1263067	1263307	All right.
1263967	1265368	Aaron, have a good one, buddy.
1265408	1265968	Thank you again.
1266349	1267109	Hey, you too.
1267209	1268389	Thanks so much for having me on.
1268509	1268750	All right.
1268790	1269110	Of course.
1269150	1269530	Anytime.
1269610	1269930	Take care.
1270590	1270891	Bye-bye.
1270951	1271111	Bye.
1271791	1276893	You know, and if you're going to make a game inspired by an Orange Lounge Radio idea, I'll bring you on at the top of the show too.
1277593	1278294	Let's be real.
1279294	1280435	I am super excited.
1280635	1281795	I know, I can't wait to play it.
1281955	1285176	And I'm not just saying that because we're involved.
1285236	1286417	It looks like fun.
1286937	1289538	Ionotropic said Ferret Returns, Bungie Ferret Tossing 13.
1291258	1295900	I love that everybody's already thinking about the sequels, but we gotta make this one a success first.
1295920	1302863	Because if this is a flop, then Aaron's gonna be like, maybe I should do a zombie game to get more money.
1303883	1305444	Zombies are overrated.
1305904	1306444	Alright, alright.
1307184	1309225	Let's move into how was your gaming week?
1309265	1310306	What types of video games?
1310626	1314748	You obviously haven't been playing Bungie Veritas and it's not out yet, but what have you been playing this week?
1314828	1315848	Let's start with DarkSakura.
1316729	1318149	WoW and Mass Effect.
1318790	1319030	Three.
1319130	1319910	For a change.
1319930	1320270	And two.
1320751	1321431	Shut up!
1322892	1325333	Mr. I'm gonna play Red Dead Redemption all night.
1327334	1328294	It was the zombie one.
1329235	1329575	See?
1329715	1330135	Zombies.
1330215	1330735	Overrated.
1331075	1332296	And I hadn't played through it yet.
1332856	1335117	So... What the fuck, man?
1339627	1342508	I have also been doing school stuff this week and writing.
1342528	1343589	That has nothing to do with gaming.
1343769	1344310	And writing.
1344890	1346271	So I have a life.
1346611	1348452	Neither of which have anything to do with your gaming week.
1348492	1349413	How about you bite me?
1351254	1352635	How about you bite me?
1353535	1354896	That has nothing to do with gaming either.
1355397	1357418	How about you shut the fuck up and then bite me?
1358018	1364702	Ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio where every gamer has a voice and they might use it to fight with their spouse live on air.
1367873	1370115	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, DarkSakura?
1370415	1372197	And then I shot my husband in the face.
1373638	1375659	It's just Mass Effect and World of Warcraft.
1375679	1378522	Alright, Dan, show us how it's done, Dan.
1378562	1379442	How was your gaming week?
1380343	1383566	I played all the way through Red Dead Redemption on Dead Nightmare.
1384546	1384987	That was it.
1387830	1388490	But zombies!
1388731	1389491	It was pretty good.
1389751	1389992	Yeah?
1390532	1395976	Yeah, I bought it like, what, when it came out, and it just sort of sat on the shelf, and then for whatever reason this week, I was like, you know what?
1396336	1397777	I'm gonna kill some motherfucking zombies.
1398417	1398998	Oh, and I did.
1400219	1402460	Uh, you like to do a lot of- Oh, and he cursed a lot, too.
1402660	1403701	Oh, yeah!
1404642	1407864	You like to do a lot of watching of game playthroughs, too.
1408084	1412627	Like, you guys have the YouTube rigged to the TV, so you can kind of like watch people play games and stuff, right?
1412727	1416390	Strangely enough, yes, I deeply enjoy watching long plays on YouTube.
1416690	1417870	Yeah, you think that's a weird thing?
1417890	1418370	And wrestling.
1418450	1419271	I don't think it's a weird thing.
1419331	1420071	Kind of, to an extent.
1420111	1421591	Yeah, well, and old pro wrestling.
1421631	1422511	Well, I will say this.
1422711	1425252	I walked in on, what the hell were you watching this week?
1425292	1426632	It was something on the Game Boy.
1426692	1428652	It was like, was it DuckTales on the game?
1428692	1429933	No, it was something even more obscure than that.
1429953	1430333	Was it Mega Man?
1430653	1432313	No, it was even more obscure than that.
1432353	1433393	It was some licensed game.
1433453	1434133	Oh, The Simpsons.
1434534	1436214	It was a Simpsons game on Game Boy.
1436534	1438794	And I was like, that's an interesting one to watch.
1438814	1441275	Oh, yeah, it was Bart vs. the Juggernauts.
1441946	1471669	well because a lot of these games are stuff that like I've known existed but I was always just like what the fuck is this about and there's like this world of long plays channel on YouTube and they do just these really good high definition long plays of games and to an extent it's like I'd like to check this game out but God knows I'm not going to track it down and pay money for it so that's kind of the best way to go it's a good way to sample stuff too a lot of the new stuff yeah well you know a lot of these games suck so it's a lot better than wasting my time trying to play through them
1473741	1474842	All right, fair enough, fair enough.
1474862	1476922	All right, anything else you want to say about your game of the week, Dan?
1478363	1478543	No.
1478843	1480104	Okay, let's go to Loki.
1480124	1480424	Zombies.
1480704	1483185	Loki, how was your game of the week?
1483385	1487387	I played Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, a little bit of that.
1487967	1494710	And then I also played McPixel because I bought that on my Android phone.
1495250	1496251	And it's pretty fun.
1496311	1501333	It's like a cross between the old LucasArts point-and-click adventure games
1503300	1506668	and MacGyver, but really dirty.
1509044	1510085	Dirty MacGyver?
1510585	1511406	Dirty MacGyver.
1512306	1520310	Basically, every single puzzle in the game is you have 20 seconds to defuse a bomb.
1520610	1521691	You don't know where the bomb is.
1522331	1523632	You don't know how you have to defuse it.
1523972	1527133	You just have to figure out how to interact with stuff and what you need to do.
1527714	1530995	A lot of the puzzles involve kicking someone in the nuts.
1531015	1533096	To defuse a bomb?
1533517	1534517	To defuse a bomb.
1536178	1537519	That's how I play Scribblenauts.
1537539	1538780	Is the bomb in their pants?
1539841	1541962	Sometimes, yeah.
1542623	1546286	It's such a weird game, and it's awesome, though.
1546326	1552671	I don't know why, but I'm suddenly reminded of the game Don't Shit Your Pants, which was also kind of an adventure game, remember?
1552931	1554872	Yeah.
1554972	1560336	But yeah, it gets really strange, but it's definitely worth checking out.
1560537	1562278	I think it's also on PC as well, but...
1563433	1566754	Tell us more about this because we need more people on it.
1580854	1582455	Yes, it's a server.
1582575	1583977	It's a whitelisted server.
1583997	1594385	So basically you go to the forum thread on the VOG Network forums and you say, hey, I want to be let in and I add your name to the whitelist and you can go in and build.
1594445	1599590	And you start off in this kind of like a jungle biome and up on a hill is the clubhouse.
1599630	1607156	You go in there, take a set of tools, you know, or, you know, use that as a home base for a while until you figure out what you're going to do and then go off and build.
1607296	1608677	And it's just a survival thing.
1609077	1609558	It's kind of fun.
1610496	1610757	OLR Village
1629034	1655947	in retrospect though I think I might have built my set actually somebody on Twitter offered to do a YouTubey thing which I don't I'm not very good with the live streaming and all that so maybe we can get something on YouTube but anyway we'll work on that later but I was playing that this week on the server and I built a sad little house but I just I needed shelter because you're not in safe mode you do have limited mobs you're on like the easy mode but you gotta have you gotta have some mobs to give some challenge right
1656207	1659348	Well, easy mode still has all the mobs, they just don't do all the damage.
1659788	1665891	Although, I have to say, we were playing in easy mode, and the other day we were just fucking around.
1665931	1669692	Because, see, since I'm the admin, I can switch shit all the time.
1669752	1675115	Like, I have right now, I'm basically playing, or I was playing in creative mode because I was...
1676895	1677436	Let's put it this way.
1677536	1682097	Okay, when we first started the server, I built the clubhouse and it looked really cool and stuff.
1682478	1686359	And then I had Bobby telling me, hey, I can't go into the clubhouse.
1686559	1688920	I'm like, what the hell do you mean you can't go into the clubhouse?
1689340	1690421	Yeah, the door doesn't work.
1691201	1691461	Huh?
1691821	1692422	That's weird.
1692742	1693202	Okay, whatever.
1693402	1695843	Then Rob's like, yeah, I couldn't go into the clubhouse.
1696600	1696921	What?
1697441	1698402	Why couldn't you go in the clubhouse?
1698722	1701184	Well, apparently, I built it too close to the spawn point.
1701565	1705428	See, the admin, you can break stuff near the spawn point and build stuff and stuff like that.
1706329	1707090	Other players cannot.
1707270	1711433	So you could open the door, but you couldn't walk through because it wasn't updating the block that was there.
1711514	1714977	So I had to tear it all down and build it up on a hill, which is kind of funny.
1715517	1717559	It looks great, though, because now you have that waterfall and everything.
1717659	1719120	Yeah, so we were doing that.
1719160	1722503	But anyway, so like I said, I was fucking around because I was in creative mode.
1722583	1727026	And so you can spawn whatever you want, including monster eggs that spawn monsters.
1727066	1729508	So my friend's like, you know, I was talking about the Enderman.
1729528	1730929	He's like, yeah, I want to take on one of those.
1730949	1732970	I'm like, all right.
1734051	1737656	So, I spawned one and he fought it and he killed it pretty easily.
1737676	1739399	I'm like, he's like, oh, it was too easy.
1739419	1741462	I'm like, okay.
1741802	1743845	So, I spawned 20 of them.
1744386	1746869	But you will not make a habit out of spawning random enemies.
1746889	1747310	No, no, no.
1747550	1750474	This is just something we were fucking around for a while during lunch.
1751175	1752056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1771434	1772535	Yeah, there's stuff around.
1772675	1782662	I've got to figure out a way to, like, maybe we'll put up a sign on our house that's like, hey, property of... You know, so you don't, like, accidentally... I mean, because someone can go to my mine, and that's fine.
1782682	1783522	I don't really give a crap.
1784042	1786044	But, yeah, there's a ton of... Go ahead.
1786324	1791447	It just occurred to me that if I ever did play this game, I'd probably do exactly the same stuff I do in The Sims and build underground.
1792268	1792908	Live in a cave.
1792928	1793749	Which you can do.
1793829	1794189	Oh, yeah.
1794269	1794890	I mean, that's easy.
1795210	1796291	A lot of people kind of do that.
1796351	1799513	They have their main house, and they build little outposts as they're in the mine.
1799553	1800533	That's a very common thing to do.
1801614	1802395	Just Living Underground.
1802775	1809579	Now, I did see a cool video where someone tried to completely recreate whatever the dwarf area was in Lord of the Rings.
1810760	1811040	Nice.
1811120	1812081	It was really cool.
1812241	1812461	Nice.
1812501	1814002	Yeah, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like that.
1814062	1820106	It's more like just creative mode, which we can, you know, if no one wants to play survival mode, we can do that.
1820147	1826891	But I didn't want to do creative mode because it kind of defeats the purpose of exploring everything because it's like, eh, who cares?
1827271	1828192	I have all the objects.
1828232	1829573	I don't need to go find whatever.
1829653	1830273	I think it's fine.
1830313	1831054	I haven't died yet.
1831074	1831194	Yeah.
1831514	1833075	I've come close, but I haven't died yet.
1833115	1836116	This is still how I play The Sims.
1836256	1841799	When I'm not building that clubhouse, I am actually playing survival mode and I'm not actually cheating.
1841819	1843280	I don't have diamond armor or anything.
1844720	1849963	I'm just playing legit, but aside from building the start area, that obviously is doing creative.
1850293	1853155	So VOGnetwork.com forums if you want to join us and please do.
1853415	1855776	But don't destroy my house or I will find you and I will kill you.
1855816	1857757	And we've got plenty of server space.
1857997	1863980	I can host up to 35 people at a time and I don't even think we have 35 people that can play at once.
1864080	1864560	Good times.
1864800	1866161	So please join.
1866421	1866761	Not yet.
1867062	1867282	Yes.
1868082	1869023	Anything else for your gaming week?
1870183	1871424	No, that's it.
1871892	1873654	Well, I guess I talked about most of mine already.
1873794	1877817	I bought Minecraft PC this week solely for the fact that I could play on Loki's server.
1877877	1881220	So I'm exploring some of the things that are in there that are not in the Xbox One.
1881240	1882201	Is it worth the $20?
1883882	1884863	I think it's really fun.
1885063	1885404	I do.
1885864	1891349	I bought the 360 version I thought is pretty slick, and I started to get bored of it, and the PC version is so much better.
1891389	1894411	Yeah, the PC one you can mod and do all that stuff to as well.
1894952	1897394	Alan's helping me get a map mod, which I think would be very useful.
1897414	1897594	Yeah, yeah.
1897814	1902640	Any of that stuff's okay, as long as it's not like, hey, mod 2, you know, x-ray mod and stuff like that.
1902960	1911930	And, very awesome, you can have your own custom skin, so I look like Zangief from Street Fighter 2 right now, walking around in armor, so, you know.
1912526	1914268	Just like in real life!
1929267	1958040	I said fuck that so I actually have and I even linked it in there there's a program you can use with XPatter to map everything to an Xbox 360 controller and that's actually how it plays with an Xbox 360 controller and it's awesome it's great if you play the 360 version sweet alright the rest of my gaming week I'll keep it quick so we can get into gaming news because we've been pretty lengthy so far I'm just going to say more World of Warcraft surprise but I got my 6th level 85 cue the womp womp whatever don't judge me
1958884	1963369	and then I also played Borderlands on PlayStation 3 because it's free on PlayStation Plus right now.
1963449	1969855	So if you are a PlayStation Plus person you can get Borderlands for free which I think is a great idea to try and sell more copies of the sequel.
1970295	1977122	I don't know exactly how many people are on PlayStation Plus but I am not one to turn down a free game especially one that I was enjoying on the PC.
1977902	1983047	The only problem I'm having is that it was so much easier to aim with keyboard and mouse than it is with PlayStation 3 controller.
1983107	1983728	That's the only bummer.
1984048	1986029	But the game looks good, and it runs really smooth.
1986049	1987290	You know it's optimized for PlayStation 3.
1987911	1993294	Couple little graphical glitches here and there, but nothing that's a game-ruining experience.
1993915	1999478	A lot of you have told me to try Borderlands, and I really like the whole fusion of a role-playing game and a first-person shooter.
1999819	2001740	It makes the first-person shooters very accessible.
2002140	2003161	So, love it.
2004482	2008945	That's mostly it for this week that I can think of.
2010945	2014506	Let's do some housekeeping and then we're going to get into some big news tonight right at the top, right Loki?
2015267	2018268	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to join us on Facebook.
2018288	2029231	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to join us on Twitter and you can always follow us there and keep on top of what's new with the show and when we're going to have weeks off or what have you.
2029251	2034012	Speaking of weeks off, DarkSakura will not be here next week but we will still be doing a show.
2034072	2036333	Maybe we can get Dan to come back.
2037193	2037513	I don't know.
2037533	2037914	We'll see.
2038714	2039234	It's a holiday.
2040775	2041096	Alright.
2041656	2042156	Moving on.
2042397	2042937	Starting off.
2043918	2044278	News.
2044558	2044918	Tonight.
2045198	2045519	Loki.
2046099	2049641	So apparently there's a thing that went around the internet.
2049842	2051863	It's funny because I get to watch it happen.
2052423	2057026	There's a distributor that leaked the Wii U pricing and the release date.
2057186	2058067	That's just so weird.
2058747	2062610	And they listed three SKUs and the price is anywhere from $249.99 to $349.99 and
2066158	2066938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2084609	2085790	Yeah, that was the funny thing.
2086111	2086691	It wasn't me.
2086972	2092058	It was some dude that goes by Hound Dog on YouTube, which we tracked down.
2092198	2095082	It's a hilarious story about that, which I'll get into in just a second here.
2096584	2097946	So yes, it was a little weird.
2098026	2100189	I don't like to talk about where I work because, you know...
2101903	2102504	Thanks for watching!
2120498	2121779	But yeah, it's funny though.
2123220	2147277	This is not necessarily a story about information I pretty much already told you guys based off of this information that I've known for a while now and also other information pointing to the release date of the 18th which is PDP leak and of course some other games that are going to be announced probably this week that are going to be launching on the 18th that kind of point to that.
2148197	2172455	but here's the funny thing is how the gaming media works and watching how it works is really interesting how there's literally copy pasted stories no research done and then it starts playing the telephone game where it gets even more ridiculous and I kind of I don't know if anyone's followed my Twitter you kind of saw a little bit of that because I kept posting articles like lol did they really just do that you know
2173135	2175215	So it started off in GamesFAQs.
2175275	2176376	It went to GoNintendo.
2176396	2180676	Then all these other Nintendo kind of websites started running it.
2181117	2198100	And one of the things that kind of got back to the higher-ups at our company, because we started getting calls from our customers, was the fact that they go, oh, this distributor supplies Amazon overstock and blah, blah, blah.
2198140	2199120	And it's like, yeah, true.
2199200	2199580	We work...
2200040	2200560	Thanks for watching!
2222364	2223004	Thanks for watching!
2242031	2249635	But, like, CNET, I think out of all the stories I saw from the different blogs, CNET's probably the funniest one.
2250195	2256659	And I don't know who this guy is, but he first, he put the text, you know, that was the text information.
2256699	2259800	He's like, yeah, okay, so it was the Wii U system, 11.11, 249, 299, 349, three Cs.
2259820	2261221	But then I got this additional information.
2266684	2268485	A screenshot of the website.
2268605	2269786	Oh, that backs up the information.
2269966	2271887	Oh, wait, I got another source.
2272288	2273088	It's a video.
2273468	2274569	It's like, you're a fucking idiot.
2274589	2276230	They're all the same goddamn thing.
2277111	2283775	It's the same goddamn source, and you're sourcing two other things to make it sound like it's more legit.
2284676	2287778	Some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2287818	2289799	DungeonBuster says, copy pasta journalism.
2290740	2295202	Frisbee says, control C, control V. That's how the stories go from you to me.
2298338	2298778	I like that.
2298798	2300379	There's like a little song about that.
2300599	2306020	WhatUpG says it would be cool if it was November 11th, but November 18th makes sense, at least historically, for Nintendo.
2306040	2309382	That's the exact same day they released the Wii?
2309422	2310422	The GameCube?
2310462	2312242	One of the other systems was the exact same day.
2312843	2313983	So, Mr. Dan.
2315323	2319705	Having a background in video games retail, that actually does make a lot of sense as a release date.
2320565	2322546	Nintendo loves to release shit on Sundays.
2323066	2324066	It's really irritating.
2324146	2325827	And it does also make sense about the 11th that...
2327492	2331796	They will be sending them out early because the stores don't get it.
2331816	2334738	It doesn't just magically spawn in the store Sunday morning.
2335099	2338181	We have it hidden away somewhere so that you can't get it.
2338402	2339142	You can't steal it.
2339943	2340684	You could steal it.
2340824	2343926	So that GameStop managers can take pictures of it and post it on the internet.
2344207	2344867	I never did that.
2345047	2346609	No, you never did that, but other people did.
2348530	2349331	But here's the funny part.
2349971	2354814	Like I said before, there is this guy, this anonymous guy, Hound Dog, who leaked it.
2355855	2362899	Dude, first rule of the internet, anything that you post on the internet always stays on the internet.
2363359	2371585	So when you post a video or whatever, and then you think that we're not going to figure it out.
2371645	2375127	First off, his video basically was a video of a screenshot.
2376465	2378266	Had a time and date in the bottom corner.
2379407	2379988	Stupid.
2380829	2382150	Because you know what we could do?
2382550	2383070	We went back.
2383090	2384331	Look at the web access logs.
2384351	2386333	We looked at our web access logs, and guess what?
2386573	2389776	We query every single search on there.
2390056	2397002	Oh, and there was only four people that searched for Wii U. And during that time frame, there was only two.
2397342	2400424	And then it was basically two different customers.
2400965	2403107	Yeah, because it was my idea to go look at the web logs.
2404288	2405710	and then, oh, guess what?
2405970	2416222	You do a Google Cash search on Hound Dog and, oh, he has a trailer, an advertisement for a certain store that happens to be one of the two customers.
2416662	2417002	Uh-oh.
2417082	2419085	Uh-oh, Guerrilla Games and St.
2419145	2419685	Cloud.
2423470	2424271	Don't hold back now.
2425618	2426118	So what happened?
2426138	2428460	Did anybody go to the guy and say, why'd you do it?
2429500	2430461	Honestly, I don't know.
2431121	2435524	Because this was stuff that was to be handled by managers and upper management and stuff like that.
2435544	2438225	Because, funny enough, like I said, this had nothing to do with me.
2438525	2447710	I do item setup sometimes for a lot of games, but I don't do first party because our buyer, for some goddamn reason, wants to hold on to first party even though she fucks everything up.
2448191	2448351	But...
2450385	2452106	So she set that up.
2452307	2456750	She didn't flag it to not show up on our website, even though maybe she should have.
2457431	2460793	And it wasn't any of my customers that leaked the information.
2460914	2463916	So I just sat back and kind of let, lol.
2464977	2467479	Frisbee said she should have used the free Wi-Fi at Starbucks.
2468451	2468911	Seriously.
2469091	2471393	Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too, is IP pointed back to St.
2471433	2471873	Cloud as well.
2472093	2476495	But, I mean, whatever, anyway, this is all a moot point come Thursday.
2476555	2477215	It is, exactly.
2477255	2479496	It's all a moot point, and the whole thing blew over pretty fast.
2479717	2485499	I mean, except for the fact that Amazon's like, we need an apology from you, we need you to blah, blah, blah.
2485740	2490662	Nintendo, of course, on people's asses about, hey, this is not supposed to be...
2490982	2493887	Which only leads credit to the fact that it's probably true.
2493947	2496371	Well, except that the date's not right.
2496412	2500098	But, you know, I mean, some information's obviously accurate, like the pricing.
2500459	2502963	But, you know, and like I said...
2504694	2510576	If you've been listening to the show for the last few months, this is not news to you.
2510776	2511816	I mean, put it that way.
2512977	2519059	I just find it funny, though, how seriously copy-paste all these articles are.
2519299	2522720	IGN, what the fuck?
2522820	2524720	Seriously, let's step aside here.
2525400	2529822	What the fuck is it with IGN and GameSpot where you have an article...
2530402	2531443	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2546099	2547540	Why is it some British guy?
2547640	2548840	It's always a British guy.
2549360	2550300	People don't like to read.
2550560	2552981	They're having some intern guy read this.
2553241	2564164	Dude, and there's this distributor, but we can't get into their website because you need to log in and password, but this guy got in and he got this exclusive information and blah, blah, blah.
2564624	2565744	People don't like to read.
2566826	2567406	It's ridiculous.
2568347	2570427	You can't spell ignorant without IGN.
2570787	2586052	Well, it's funny you say that because people can't read, but there is somewhat truth to that because this makes a very interesting companion piece to Bobby's show before us tonight and the whole girlfriend mode thing and how that kind of got carried away and all that as well.
2586072	2588833	And that's because people didn't really want to read the entire article.
2589193	2594435	They just wanted to read the part where, oh, this guy calls the easy mode girlfriend mode because he clearly hates women.
2595155	2595395	Yes.
2596044	2596665	Joe Schmo I mean like
2621505	2625787	Seriously, MTV, it went everywhere.
2626007	2628568	It went to MTV's website, their gaming blog.
2628588	2630669	It went to IGN, it went to Yahoo, it went to CNET.
2630689	2634570	Well, CNET takes stuff from Yahoo, or vice versa.
2634590	2637751	I think that's just saying that people want to know the Wii U date already.
2637791	2645954	I understand that, but it's just so ridiculous how I literally got one email from an independent site asking to follow up on that.
2646374	2647595	One person.
2649349	2650190	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2675586	2675866	Really?
2676247	2676487	Really?
2676587	2678750	That is your fucking, like, proof?
2679270	2682334	This guy just says, yeah, that sounds like feasible information.
2682454	2685417	Wasn't that one of the lifelines on who wants to be a millionaire?
2685698	2686819	Ask the expert.
2687379	2688541	Are you on a game show?
2689001	2689922	It's like, yeah, I...
2690583	2691964	Yeah, that seems feasible.
2692224	2698309	Hey, Joe Schmoe, who plays some video games that delivers our mail, do you think that this release date sounds like it could be real?
2699931	2700651	Sounds right.
2701752	2702913	It was the release date.
2702953	2706576	I have the information to back that up, but it sounds like a date to me.
2706676	2712381	I mean, it is a date, and it hasn't happened yet, so I guess it could happen.
2712541	2717585	Anyways, let me just stop right here and reiterate what I've said in the past.
2719393	2742608	3 SKUs, 249, 299, 349, 299 SKU I speculate Wii U system, tablet that's it, it's in case you already have a Wii system speculate because I don't know any information other than 3 prices oh and November 18th release date but that's also speculation based on information but whatever not information I have from Nintendo nothing from Nintendo
2745125	2750290	299 SKU, System, Gamepad, Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck.
2750630	2754013	In case you don't own a Wii system.
2755875	2761580	349 SKU, System, Gamepad, Nunchuck, Remote Plus, Nintendo Land.
2762240	2764262	That's my guess, so we'll see you in a few days if I'm right.
2764863	2765924	Alright, we'll find out on Thursday.
2766426	2771530	It's gonna be a busy week between the iPhone 5 on Wednesday and then Nintendo on Thursday.
2772051	2777655	This is Tech Christmas in some ways, so the blogs will be busy this week copy-pasting from each other.
2778936	2782039	When they're not live blogging, because that's the other big thing.
2782119	2782880	Live blogging.
2784081	2786363	Anyhow, I think I just gave Loki an aneurysm.
2787103	2789925	Let's move on to something a little more indie, shall we?
2789966	2791227	Something a little more under the radar.
2791267	2793088	Maybe the thing you should be paying attention to.
2793168	2794549	It's Steam Greenlight.
2794669	2795850	Have you heard about Steam Greenlight?
2796191	2804938	It's a chance for you to basically help... I don't want to say it's Kickstarter because it's not, but it's helped generate buzz for indie games.
2805078	2810983	People that want to get their ideas out there to be approved by the community to be sold on Steam.
2811003	2811263	Okay.
2811483	2816045	Well, when this first went live, a lot of people were putting a lot of crap on there.
2816305	2821866	And things like Half-Life 3 showed up on Steam Greenlight and things of that sort.
2822647	2829709	So in order to kind of curb this, Valve decided to set a $100 fee to get your project listed on Steam Greenlight.
2830029	2832390	This fee goes to Child's Play.
2833030	2836751	Pretty interesting solution, a pretty ingenious way to figure it out.
2837831	2842852	The Valve UI designer Alden Kroll said, quote, the proceeds will be donated to Child's Play.
2843212	2847893	We have no interest in making money from this, but we do need to cut down the noise in the system.
2848273	2856055	Of course, this is causing a little bit of controversy because some people think, you know, well, for a true indie, $100 is a lot of money, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2856475	2857215	What do you guys think?
2857355	2857815	Is this fair?
2858855	2886063	I think it's a good way to make sure people are serious about it I think it's fair And especially the fact that it's a donation is kind of nice I don't see a lot of other companies doing that type of thing So, very cool Also, some other changes to the system Now when you log in and look at Steam Greenlight You're going to see a smaller list You're not going to get thrown everything at you Games that you haven't rated will be the ones that you see Popular games and new games on Steam Greenlight
2886403	2889224	I noticed there was a project on there called Project Gianna.
2889804	2892505	Does that have anything to do with Great Gianna Sisters from the 64 Days?
2892725	2893105	It's a sequel.
2893125	2893645	It's amazing.
2893685	2895886	It's the one that was on Kickstarter that I kept talking about.
2895926	2897446	I'm going to go upvote that right after the show.
2897466	2898286	They have a demo you can play.
2899387	2899667	Really?
2899827	2900147	Already?
2900487	2901387	Yeah, it's pretty sweet.
2901587	2904048	Over 700 submissions already since August 30th.
2904748	2910311	Now, one thing you can't do on Steam Greenlight, just for the record, sex games.
2910851	2916314	There was a game called Seduce Me that was on Project Greenlight and yes, it was removed.
2916835	2920857	And Doug Lombardi, a spokesperson for Valve, said, quote,
2927020	2927860	and what a shame.
2929140	2932961	All right, I guess we can understand why they don't want that stuff associated.
2932981	2933721	Sex is overrated.
2934241	2936562	Well, because of the media sensation that would occur.
2937182	2937702	Think about it.
2937902	2946503	If they were to sell Booby Game, then suddenly it's going to be on CNN and there would be the commentators on Fox News.
2947284	2951924	Oh my God, can you believe on Steam the Booby Games that are corrupting our children?
2951944	2953945	They don't let your dirty money.
2954045	2955065	It's Booby Steam.
2958811	2963321	So I can see why they don't want to be associated with that, but I wish people weren't so freaking...
2965109	2965489	Up tight.
2965910	2966550	Stick up their ass.
2966630	2971774	Let the mature people that want to tell a lot of booby jokes have their game, damn it.
2973256	2973636	Boobs.
2974476	2978960	You know what, that actually goes back to the same little thing when you tell a little kid they can't do something, what's the first thing they want to do?
2979601	2980461	Is go out and do it.
2981562	2991150	Well, I mean, if you put the same sort of taboo on things, you know, like foul language or fucking, people are just going to want to, you know, see it more.
2992755	3016791	Going to Frisbee in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Miss World Nude 13 for Greenlight Excellent suggestion Sague, who knows a thing or two about developing games, is in our chatroom saying The Greenlight stuff is cheaper than any other commercial game seller Steam is $100 for one time, iOS is $99 a year, Mac is another $99 a year, Xbox Creator Club $99 a year
3018072	3028262	So, very interesting perspective on what that $100, if that really is too much money or what, is that, you know, that's the same price you're going to pay for iOS, which is seen as a huge indie boom.
3029283	3034368	I'm sorry, it's the same amount for one year, and then you have to renew on iOS where you don't with Steam.
3035862	3040306	It's basically like the free-to-play model, if you think about it.
3040426	3044349	You buy the game, or you pay your hundred bucks, and you're done.
3047631	3053876	Degenerate Johnny in our chatroom says, yeah, like unbaptized babies lactating out of Cleopatra's nipple.
3054237	3055838	Oops, that was Dante's Inferno.
3058780	3059321	Good point.
3060181	3060882	All right, let's move on.
3060902	3063424	Let's move on with something a little more clean and wholesome, DarkSakura.
3063763	3072808	Well, I don't know how clean it is, but it's sort of really just more adding to the rumor mill about the whole Steam Box thing that we've talked about before.
3073589	3080933	There is a job listing for an industrial designer on Valve's website, and I'll read the quote on here.
3081053	3086016	We're frustrated by the lack of innovation in the computer hardware space, so we're jumping in.
3086977	3090499	Even basic input, keyboard and mouse, hasn't really changed in any meaningful way over the years.
3091109	3097313	So basically, they're trying to, I guess, expand further, but they're still kind of denying the whole Steambox thing.
3098913	3101695	Why do these rumors keep perpetuating everywhere?
3101775	3102736	It's interesting.
3102796	3106878	Although it does have me thinking, you know, if Valve does want to do a console, now might be a pretty good time.
3108019	3110440	It's because they keep hiring for people for that.
3111481	3111881	That's why.
3112301	3115523	When you have someone that's being hired for, like, hardware design, it's like,
3117133	3118013	Steam Software.
3118373	3121434	It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen next year or anytime soon.
3121474	3126855	For example, they hired console developers for Diablo 3 at Blizzard.
3127675	3130376	Doesn't mean that we've seen Diablo 3 on consoles yet.
3130496	3132777	Maybe it'll happen next year, or maybe not.
3132917	3135017	I don't even see it being its own sort of system.
3135077	3142039	I see maybe the potential of having something as a computer add-on.
3143239	3146640	Like a combination storage device, maybe graphics boosting...
3147890	3153075	It would seem so easy, though, to just do a little PC in a box that plays very basic Steam games.
3153355	3154576	You know, what the hell's Anuja?
3155037	3156338	It's kind of like that.
3156478	3160762	I mean, it's a very, very, very bare-bones type of system that just plugs in your TV.
3161582	3166947	Maybe Valve could pump another couple hundred dollars worth of tech into it and have something that could play Portal.
3167187	3168088	See, I could do that.
3168148	3169169	It's called my computer.
3170310	3171051	Well, they could sell it as a PC.
3171071	3171792	That I already have.
3173293	3174394	That I play Mass Effect on.
3175390	3175490	VALVE
3192570	3194012	Mass Effect 3 I have Half-Life News
3213099	3225971	So, in June 2004, to show off the, at the time, brand new Source engine that Half-Life 2 was going to come out on in November of that year, Valve put out Half-Life Source.
3226011	3232817	They basically piped the original Half-Life game into the Source engine, and it was probably one of the laziest things they've ever done.
3233138	3237001	It's like, okay, it has better lights and physics, but otherwise...
3237762	3239563	It's a Half-Life 1998 game.
3240044	3242005	And the fans were really kind of ticked off about it.
3242105	3245927	So a group of them formed the Black Mesa Source Project.
3246008	3247488	They are just amateur programmers.
3247529	3248449	They're not professionals.
3249030	3249890	Not getting paid to do this.
3249930	3259316	And they said, we are going to take Half-Life and literally redesign it and program it from the ground up into the Half-Life 2 engine.
3259356	3262599	They had a fiasco in 2009 where they released a really awesome trailer.
3263639	3288814	and eventually ultimately the game didn't come out because they're like this isn't done so they kind of shot themselves in the foot they went out on a on a media blackout for last three years and it's coming September 14th they finally announced that's very interesting so because they kind of got burned the first time they started saying it was entirely their their fault but yeah but they went just underground with it yeah but they didn't update the twitter they didn't put the youtube no leak screenshots they're like we are off the grid we're still working on it well
3290556	3291998	Dan just said, sounds like Valve to me.
3292599	3293380	But this isn't Valve.
3293580	3293700	No.
3293841	3295203	But Valve's kind of embracing it, right?
3295263	3295583	Oh, yeah.
3295603	3296905	They're very supportive of it.
3296985	3302594	Some companies would cease and desist the shit out of it, like we saw with that Chrono Trigger remake and Square Enix, right?
3302794	3302934	Yeah.
3302954	3305037	Valve is like, cool, let's help you get it out there.
3305538	3306879	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3325015	3325975	This is your thing.
3326696	3330376	I think it's already got its clearance on Steam Greenlight.
3331997	3333057	Shock.
3334277	3335557	Steam's probably going to host it.
3335758	3338398	What do you think this means for the future of Half-Life, if anything?
3340539	3350681	Get people interested in the franchise again considering that it's been eight years since Half-Life 2 proper came out and a good five years since Episode 2 came out.
3351841	3379330	and they're still not a peep about Half-Life 3 so they also said for this remake that they added some dialogue they did some plot tweaks to make the slower parts of it more interesting but otherwise it's a shot for shot remake the trailer is still on YouTube from three years ago if you haven't seen the trailer you should watch it it's really awesome and so I'm thinking you're going to be getting this the day it comes out it's free why wouldn't I and you'll be playing through it so I'll see you in a week alright
3379990	3382012	Anything else you want to say, Alan, before we say goodbye for now?
3383093	3383754	No.
3384234	3384855	Thank you for the update.
3384995	3385515	I appreciate it.
3386076	3388458	Because I, unfortunately, am very ignorant when it comes to Half-Life.
3388839	3390680	We don't have time to play every single game.
3391401	3393563	But Alan will make me play it at some point, I'm sure.
3393583	3396426	And this sounds like a good way to get exposed to it.
3397066	3402909	So, TigerClaw in our chatroom says, It's better they continue working on it and when they feel it's ready to release it.
3403110	3404671	No reason to release a buggy game.
3405071	3408233	If Half-Life 3 ever comes out, it'll probably go multi-platform.
3408493	3413436	You know, I've been teasing Alan with that idea is that maybe they're saving it for the next round of consoles.
3413616	3417718	Maybe it'll be a PC and PlayStation 4 exclusive or something like that.
3417778	3421901	That certainly would be a real great way to generate a lot of energy about the game.
3422721	3423982	We shall see, however.
3424602	3426964	All right, let's move on with some other news.
3427044	3427284	Loki.
3429226	3436112	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, thumb.
3436752	3438414	All right, so this is kind of interesting.
3438474	3441556	I talked about a game I played during the week, which is called McPixel.
3442237	3447101	And this weekend, they actually went about a unique way to advertise the game.
3447121	3447541	Okay.
3448602	3450744	It's on the front page of the Pirate Bay.
3451265	3455529	Pirate Bay being a very notorious website for piracy.
3457030	3461795	McPixel, they have basically a little bit of a letter to people.
3461875	3463276	It's like, hi, I'm SOS.
3463797	3467060	I make video games, but not in a big company.
3467220	3468722	I make games I want to make.
3469422	3486355	I know that not everyone can afford entertainment but everyone needs it and even though I make games for a living I am most happy to just see people enjoy them so today you can download a torrent of my game and if you like throw some coins in my general direction
3487576	3489238	And so they actually have that on there.
3489278	3493082	You can download a torrent for it and download it for free.
3494203	3499168	Or once you've done that and you play it, you can decide to donate money to them.
3500316	3503517	I think this is what Radiohead did for one of their albums like five years ago.
3503837	3518922	I don't remember, but I know that this is what also like, oh, the Riff Trax guys do because they're like, listen, we know that not everybody downloads these from us, but if you like them, maybe kick us some money.
3519882	3527811	Riff Trax is in a little bit of a stickier situation, though, because they are doing parody art of movies that you kind of already have to own.
3527831	3530194	They can't put it out there, attaching it to the movie.
3530594	3536161	So a lot of people will do the nefarious stuff for them to get that, but they're in a weirder place.
3536201	3538924	It's also a lot more convenient to try to have to sync that stuff up, because...
3539584	3556342	I've synced that stuff up before like I'll have we watch all the Twilight movies with the riff track stuff on there and I had the DVD for Twilight but man downloading the the already pre-synced stuff's way easier than having to have a second source to play the mp3 at the same time as auto because it gets off sync pretty easy
3558562	3558862	All right.
3560984	3561505	What do you think?
3562466	3568331	I mean, I don't know if there's a lot to think about this because clearly no big publisher is ever going to do anything like this.
3568391	3570593	But do you think the guy will actually make some money?
3570913	3571714	He'll probably make some money.
3571754	3573155	I mean, the game is not that expensive.
3573175	3575698	He probably didn't spend that much money on it.
3576198	3589768	So, I mean, it's exposure to him, and if he figures that people are going to pirate it anyways, getting in front of people's faces and saying, hey, you know what, at least donate some money if you like it, donate a dollar, five dollars, whatever.
3590048	3597833	It's certainly a great way, if nothing else, to generate publicity about a game that, let's be real, people probably wouldn't have been talking about on this scale anyway.
3598173	3600795	Unfortunately, it's really hard for indie games to get press.
3601216	3603057	Shit, this is a good way to get press everywhere.
3603325	3603886	Yeah, exactly.
3603966	3610571	And the other thing, too, is you look at some of the people, it's much like the Humble Bundle, where some people just pay a penny or whatever to get it.
3611012	3615015	But there's people that donated $141 for this game.
3615155	3620700	The Brony Bundle group on Twitter or whatever, I get a kick out of that.
3621060	3623042	People that band together to donate lots of money.
3623082	3624243	But it is a good cause.
3624603	3625604	I love those Humble Bundles.
3626124	3627545	Those are always a good time.
3627806	3628787	In fact, let's see here.
3628807	3631329	I was trying to see the...
3632289	3635930	There's a couple of people that did $140, $133, $67.
3636250	3638531	There's a bunch in the 50s.
3639111	3642471	And the average right now, this is the average price that people are paying for is $2.58.
3643452	3645392	Jamie, you said there's a really good chat comment?
3645552	3653314	Nish said Radiohead did this for their In Rainbows album and said it brought more money to them than all their other albums combined.
3653754	3654334	You know why?
3654374	3656895	Because they cut out the record label by doing that.
3657555	3658435	Well, yeah, but still.
3660447	3665855	And if you are, I mean, pretty much this would be just for the live listeners because this is only going for about another four hours.
3666416	3669240	If you do want to check out this game, I'd recommend go downloading the torrent.
3670745	3671445	Why you still can.
3672706	3679910	And you can do that guilt-free, and you are totally a law-abiding citizen, because the creator has given his blessing.
3679950	3681711	He wants this to happen, to get the word out.
3682392	3698541	Although, one little problem with that is that he says that you download the torrent, and it's only available for four hours, but once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and there's going to be someone always hosting that game, or hosting, seeding it, so...
3701485	3718543	Yeah, alright, well from one controversial viewpoint on piracy to another, Ubisoft, you know they're always on DRM that's kind of getting them a lot of crap over the years, or I should say over the years, it's only really been about a couple years, but Ubisoft is now changing their policy
3718803	3720165	on this always-on DRM.
3720185	3722087	You know, it's just been too much headache and so forth.
3722427	3729735	I think some of us saw this coming, but here's the new DRM policy according to Stephanie Perotti, who is the company's worldwide director for online games.
3730236	3738685	Ubisoft PC games are now going to require a one-time online activation when you first install the game, then you are free to play the game offline.
3739285	3751174	and they claim this has been Ubisoft's policy since June of 2011 but it's been noticed that maybe there's been some games that didn't get that memo because the always on we've seen in some more recent releases.
3751655	3755418	However, this is going to be their new policy moving forward.
3755878	3756839	A fair compromise?
3756919	3757499	What do y'all think?
3758560	3758980	That's fair.
3762062	3768384	I do think it's fair, but I always have concern for people that can't get that online connection.
3769064	3773205	And there are still some people in the world that can't get that online connection.
3773225	3777387	I'm not just talking about people that live in the sticks, but I'm talking about military service people overseas.
3778007	3782188	You know, sometimes I want to play some games to, you know, blow off steam a little bit.
3782828	3789650	And, you know, I do realize they can use the satellite connections and some of these things, but that's not always a reality or it's expensive or what have you.
3789690	3797392	So I just hope there might be some workarounds, some considerations made for people who really are trying to do the right thing.
3797532	3802773	They usually do that with a lot of software that phones home is they'll have, you know, the...
3803533	3810816	Alternate means of, you know, it usually involves, you know, calling up a number and you give them, you know, whatever and they give you authentication code or something.
3810856	3811496	That would be fair.
3811717	3820540	I hope there is some type of little plan B in the small print for people that truly can't, you know... Which is how they create a lot of those cracks out there for software.
3820600	3821961	But I'm just saying, you know, it's...
3823901	3830483	I mean, they were expected to be having 93% of their software pirated, so... Maybe they can drop that number down to like 85%.
3831803	3832104	All right.
3832224	3833224	Anyhow, let's move on.
3833664	3835885	We're running long this segment, of course, but we knew we would.
3835925	3836405	DarkSakura.
3836605	3837985	I'll try to keep this one short then.
3839065	3848728	Basically, the Mass Effect 3 for Wii U is being developed by... It looks like Straight Right, who is out of Australia.
3848748	3848828	Yeah.
3849708	3851089	And their big thing is that they don't want to mess it up.
3852210	3855031	Basically saying that they've been putting a lot of work into this.
3855112	3856652	It's not going to be a rushed deal.
3857093	3861235	They're going to have this ready for the Wii U's launch and that it's supposed to be amazing.
3862296	3865538	Well, thank God they didn't come out and say, you know what, we're going to half-ass it.
3866899	3870661	I'm just waiting for the game company that's going to come out and say, eh, whatever.
3871201	3872742	You know, you'll like what you get.
3873203	3873643	Deal with it.
3873943	3874604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3889806	3894569	Now, wouldn't you think with a new console coming out, you'd want to say better?
3894589	3896031	A new console using old technology?
3896771	3899633	I just... How can it be any better?
3899693	3903096	I'm just saying it's not helping the case of the Wii U. It's using old tech.
3903516	3904497	It's using the Wii.
3904617	3905338	I'm just saying.
3905678	3908722	So I would expect it to look as good as a Wii.
3908742	3912205	I'm being sensationalist and latching on to that one quote.
3912446	3914208	Here's my headline, my pull quote.
3914548	3921356	Mass Effect 3 will look about as good as it does on the other consoles on the Wii U. There's my pull quote.
3921916	3923238	Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.
3924659	3924900	Rob?
3925460	3925681	Yes?
3928689	3929430	There is a quote here.
3929450	3932972	It says, This is the biggest title we've worked on in a long time.
3933032	3940638	There is a significant technical challenge bringing the game from its original format to the Wii U. It's new, different, and sophisticated piece of hardware.
3941699	3942019	As of.
3942680	3947083	So there's a good deal of technical energy that's being expended to make that happen.
3949993	3954957	You have to see the size of the shoehorn we need to have in order to get that tablet to work.
3955418	3959781	Seriously, it's just ridiculous that they even make shoehorns of that size.
3960221	3961062	We used a hammer.
3961362	3968808	Look, I will say, because I'm a huge Mass Effect fanboy, I would love to get my hands on the Wii U version, at least for multiplayer.
3968968	3971490	I really kind of wanted to see how it works with the screen and everything.
3971931	3972651	I'm very curious.
3972711	3973432	It could be interesting.
3973857	3976558	This is me with no fucks left to give.
3977678	3978078	Stop.
3978238	3979638	I'm just going to play it on PC.
3979718	3980638	It's already fun.
3980918	3986100	Maybe someone will make a nice mod for having your side screen or something, but I don't care.
3986340	3993301	If in the future I had a Wii U sitting right there and a copy of Mass Effect 3, you know when you come over you'd be like, I want to kind of see it.
3993601	3994641	I'd watch you play it.
3994681	4001843	Yeah, I'd be curious, but it's not enough to make me buy a Wii U. What would be enough to make you buy a Wii U?
4002183	4002803	Fuck if I know.
4004716	4005797	How about a good system?
4006558	4007238	How about it being good?
4008179	4009700	How about it having good games?
4011322	4012583	I'm not saying it doesn't have good games.
4012603	4013343	We don't know yet.
4013463	4015205	This is the problem with Mass Effect 3.
4015825	4017206	I already have Mass Effect 3.
4020249	4021070	Shut up.
4021130	4022050	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
4022471	4023632	Dan's got something to say.
4023652	4024873	You wanted a Wii, too.
4026134	4028416	See, this is from the woman who wanted a Wii to start with.
4029355	4030496	She waited in line overnight.
4030536	4031777	I was like, fuck the Wii.
4032317	4033238	It's last gen.
4033718	4034218	Oh no!
4035559	4038101	This is the man who played Twilight Princess for hours.
4038161	4038661	There we go.
4038721	4039962	I didn't play Twilight Princess for hours.
4039982	4041723	I played through Twilight Princess.
4041783	4043104	The Zelda games were good.
4043604	4046606	The Zelda games are good, but at the same time it's, you know.
4047006	4047867	I try to do surgery.
4047887	4049048	I don't think the Wii U is that bad.
4049088	4050989	I mean, I just think it's a stupid idea.
4051169	4052810	He's completely missing the point of what I'm saying.
4054071	4055352	I already have Mass Effect.
4056596	4068921	Nobody gives a shit about Mass Effect Mass Effect is out Everybody who wants to play Mass Effect has played it Okay, goody goody gumdrops Oh Mass Effect, oh it's so good
4075723	4075923	No.
4077144	4081045	To be fair, Dan's making a point we've made on this show before.
4081285	4086287	It's hard to get excited about, you know, Arkham City redone, Mass Effect 3 redone.
4086507	4087668	It's not even that redone.
4087708	4092810	I mean, like, some of the... You can tilt the Wii U tablet to move the, you know, the Batarang around.
4093270	4096731	You could do that also with the 6-axis controller on the PS3 version.
4097031	4098532	I would love... Please.
4099172	4100112	Please, Nintendo.
4100853	4104294	Blow me out of the fucking water on Thursday and be like, here's what's coming...
4105279	4107340	It better have like... Shut up, Dan.
4107481	4109822	It better have Turian porn mode to make me buy it, okay?
4110643	4118928	But no, seriously, they could come out Thursday and say, you know, we've got this Zelda or this F-Zero or this new IP that looks really cute.
4119148	4121150	I would like for that to happen.
4121990	4123852	That would make me very happy and a little less skeptical.
4123872	4126233	The only thing I fear is that there's a new Excite truck.
4126754	4128435	I want the bite if it's a new Excite truck.
4128455	4129175	Dan says Metroid Prime 4.
4129215	4131137	Metroid Prime 4 would be fucking sweet.
4131157	4131677	Are you kidding?
4134670	4136071	It would be absolutely amazing.
4137452	4138072	Use a mic.
4140354	4140694	All right.
4142095	4142795	Let's move on.
4142815	4144376	I was still... Oh, I'm sorry.
4144396	4144836	Go ahead.
4144856	4145797	Go ahead.
4148059	4148759	Shut up.
4150600	4151040	I'm done.
4155443	4156424	Are you going to let him win?
4157565	4158165	I'll get him later.
4158746	4159066	All right.
4159086	4159767	Oh, okay.
4160307	4167071	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that are coming out a little sooner than a Wii U. There's actually some stuff coming out this week.
4167351	4174675	Finding Nemo, Escape to Big Blue, the special edition being re-released now by Disney Interactive as opposed to THQ because guess what?
4174695	4178337	They're doing a 3D version of Finding Nemo that they're re-releasing into theaters.
4178958	4179858	It's kind of appropriate.
4180198	4186062	But it also is coming out on the 3DS as well, so it's not just the DS this time because, you know, I'm sure they made all sorts of enhancements.
4186242	4187302	What happened to movies on the 3DS?
4187343	4187443	Yes.
4188527	4189507	Weren't that supposed to be a thing?
4219058	4220622	Okay, let me put it this way.
4221084	4225035	A lot of the stuff that Nintendo promises never comes to fruition, like online.
4227947	4231088	There's a dig at the Wii U. I'm telling you the online is going to suck.
4232568	4234688	Battlefield 3, the premium edition for $60.
4235048	4236689	You get all the DLC.
4236769	4239949	It's on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 this week.
4240570	4241990	NHL 13 on PS3 and 360.
4242030	4245471	Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for PS3 and 360.
4246931	4252252	Also NHL, the Stanley Cup Collector's Edition, which is probably a complete waste of money unless you like DLC.
4252792	4254852	That is coming out for $80 on PS3 and 360.
4254912	4254972	And
4259082	4285767	What I'm entitling the most ridiculous game for 2012 and probably 2013 NBA Baller Beats for Xbox 360 and Kinect The game where you have to dribble a basketball to the beat of the music On my carpet On your carpet in front of Kinect Because that's going to fucking work That is coming out this week This game is going to scare the shit out of the cats, I can't wait
4286207	4291928	One week from today, Kirby's Dreamland, I guess, Collector's Special Edition.
4292228	4294209	That's too many fucking adjectives.
4294949	4297810	Collector's Special Edition is too much.
4298550	4300790	Just call it a Special Edition or Collector's Edition.
4300810	4303611	It can't be a Collector's Special Super Wonderful Edition.
4304191	4304611	Limited.
4304811	4305131	Mega.
4305491	4307752	20 years anniversary edition.
4308424	4317622	just call it virtual console games we could have released but we decided to put them on a fucking cart or I'm sorry CD DVD whatever disc that has a cart painted on it
4318840	4319641	Hey, you know what though?
4319661	4320601	It will be in insert format.
4320621	4324124	And it comes with a special gold cartridge that has absolutely nothing inside it.
4324224	4335633	At the very least, at least there is more than one ROM on this fucking disc as opposed to just releasing Super Mario All-Stars as a limited edition and then having people buy it for $80.
4335673	4339335	It has that little retrospective hallway new thing in it.
4340636	4341157	Look at that.
4341874	4347417	Well, bravo for Nintendo for putting a minute bit of effort into it.
4348098	4351460	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Fuck you, Loki.
4351500	4353581	Kirby can have as many adjectives as he wants.
4355943	4359265	Orange Rite says, Super Hyper Kirby EX plus Alpha Zero Turbo.
4359625	4361166	And then I added, for matching service.
4361366	4361786	You know what?
4361966	4362707	Kirby sucks.
4363407	4364888	No, Kirby doesn't suck.
4365348	4366329	Actually, he does suck.
4366389	4366969	He does suck.
4366989	4367830	That is the truth.
4369617	4371039	He also blows.
4371079	4371939	Kirby blows.
4373981	4375343	He's gone from suck to blow.
4376860	4377401	Moving on.
4378101	4379102	Japanese releases.
4379202	4380463	Tekken Tag Tournament 2.
4380723	4382165	They get in on the fun this week as well.
4382225	4385147	September 13th is the big release there in Japan on the Xbox 360.
4385588	4387309	Going to the PlayStation 3, of course.
4387489	4388790	Same game there as well.
4389151	4390872	And a game called Excel World.
4391132	4393675	Ginyoku no Kakusei comes out.
4393895	4398079	Limited and regular editions from also... That sounds terribly boring.
4398119	4400240	A whole world based on a database program?
4401301	4402382	Not looking forward to that.
4402542	4402923	Stop.
4404063	4408485	Nothing on the Vita, though LittleBigPlanet is just a couple weeks away at this point in Japan.
4409245	4411206	Looking quickly at the 3DS for this week.
4412046	4415167	Metarot 7, Kabuto, and Kuwagata versions.
4415327	4422990	I don't know what game this... It's two separate editions, so it looks like little... Oh, this looks like fighting MechRobots type of game.
4423510	4426251	Looks like you collect little MechRobots and fight them to the death.
4426511	4429292	Oh, shoot, I know what this is.
4429512	4434033	Tell me that's not a total Pokemon-inspired screenshot right there.
4434073	4449737	This was, I watched some of this, where the guy gets these little robots, and it turned out that his dad played these two or something, and they all try to beat up his little robot, but his robot wins, and tears up his house in the meantime.
4450438	4452538	And then his mom's all sad because he's fighting the robots.
4452998	4454979	I don't remember, I only just saw it once.
4455698	4456859	Robots tear up a house?
4457220	4459282	Was that the premise of the Transformers movie?
4459922	4461164	No, a little teeny robot.
4461624	4465808	Sengoku Musou Chronicles 2nd on the 3DS as well.
4465828	4466949	You guys know what that is, right?
4466989	4467730	Devil Kings.
4468331	4468791	Once again.
4469532	4476799	And lastly but not leastly, Shin Igokoro Kaioshitsu comes out from Nintendo on the 3DS this week.
4478099	4481541	This game is not something that looks... It's an artist program.
4481981	4483521	Oh, this was one of the crazy, wacky games.
4483541	4484261	It's Art Academy.
4484582	4487223	It's something... I can't remember what it's coming out as.
4487643	4490864	It's art drawing things, like still life art.
4490924	4494045	We saw this at one of their Nintendo Direct conferences, and we're like, what the hell is this?
4494085	4495565	It's coming out in October over here.
4496866	4498927	I like that painting of the doggy that they did.
4499767	4500087	Not bad.
4501058	4501578	Alright, there you go.
4501618	4502718	That's Japanese releases.
4502738	4503759	I think it's like Art Academy.
4503779	4506499	You can draw everything, I think is what it's called or something.
4506519	4508139	I don't know.
4508159	4508739	It's an art game.
4508759	4509440	We'll figure it out.
4509480	4510160	Go into the UK.
4510860	4511260	I'm sorry.
4511300	4512900	I was still looking at this funny screenshot.
4513020	4513260	Okay.
4513820	4516901	So in the UK, on the 11th, we have Battlefield 3, Armored Kill.
4517621	4522822	On the 14th, Joe Danger 2, the movie, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and Chaos of Deponia.
4525062	4527383	And that's it.
4528423	4531607	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4531647	4532709	But first, Loki.
4533349	4534931	So, more Vita hacking.
4537014	4544523	Independent developer Yifan Liu has found an exploit that allows retail systems to run native homebrew Vita code.
4545524	4546645	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4564403	4572549	Of course, he's basically saying, I'm going to not make anything that will benefit piracy.
4573069	4581676	This tool, in fact, cannot be used for loading backups or pirated content even if I wanted to because of the physical limitations of the exploit.
4582276	4598913	However, he says that, you know, this kind of stuff could lead to people developing a better method that could lead to that stuff, but as of right now, he is in no way endorsing piracy, even though everyone thinks that homebrew equals piracy, but that's...
4600555	4616854	kind of the situation that we're in right now of course he hasn't released any information on it yet because like before whenever they would release an exploit they would patch whatever game was involved with it so hopefully this one isn't game reliant like the last few have been
4620453	4622394	How quick do you think Sony will patch this up?
4622454	4623455	I mean, here we go again.
4623615	4625336	If it's game-reliant, pretty quick.
4625516	4627357	If it's not, it might take a little bit.
4627637	4632059	Or if it's even something they can patch, I mean, they should be able to patch it pretty quick.
4632199	4635961	And so we don't know how they're doing it because obviously they don't want Sony to get the jump on patching it.
4636001	4648588	Because before it used to be like, even before they released something, hey, this is the game that you need to have in order to run this modified save that loads the bootloader for some PSP homebrew.
4649288	4675861	before that would run in PSP mode but now that it's in Vita mode you have more access to memory and processing power and that kind of stuff it's not throttled like it was before so hopefully I mean I understand he's hoping that by saying oh yeah it's not going to really run any you know sort of exploit that will allow you the pirate games that he's hoping that it lasts a little bit longer but I'm sorry Sony's still going to patch that shit as soon as they can
4677927	4679187	X-Play and Attack of the Show sometimes.
4702075	4707302	X-Play now doesn't have Adam Sessler, obviously, because he's gone.
4707502	4708403	Is Morgan Webb still there?
4708503	4710525	I think Morgan Webb's still there.
4711206	4716673	Even Attack of the Shows lost a lot of their cast that people would watch it for.
4717533	4722196	Variety published an article this week that G4 is going geek and more chic.
4722216	4734445	This is rumor right now, but because G4 is owned by NBCUniversal, Comcast, they want to change G4 into a direction that's more like GQ, the modern male magazine.
4735846	4740048	I don't know how it's more modern male, more refined, I guess.
4740169	4742350	I don't know what kind of programming that would entail.
4742390	4743751	So basically Spike...
4743911	4744692	Thanks for watching!
4759168	4764491	Me neither because Logo still has RuPaul's Drag Race and honestly that's the only thing on cable worth watching.
4764711	4771054	So Highbrow, are they talking about more like GQ so they're going to start re-running episodes of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something like that?
4771134	4771975	Is that how they're going?
4772035	4774476	Is it going to be like the Metrosexual channel or something?
4774516	4774956	Who knows?
4775696	4776077	I don't know.
4777157	4779820	Maybe the guys who flip the million dollar homes.
4780201	4781402	One of those type of shows.
4781462	4782383	The real estate shows.
4782443	4782704	I don't know.
4782724	4784125	It's going to be garbage, whatever it is.
4784746	4785187	We'll see.
4785227	4785607	We'll see.
4785687	4792796	But regardless, any video game ties you might have to this network are looking to be severed pretty soon.
4792836	4793536	And it's not surprising.
4793557	4796840	It hasn't been dumped from satellite providers at this point.
4797821	4798962	They're not doing too well.
4798982	4802085	And like you said, there's been a huge turnover and so forth.
4802985	4806208	American Ninja Warrior may not have a place on the new G4.
4806228	4806688	That's too bad.
4806708	4807789	That actually was a pretty good show.
4808310	4811992	The other important thing to say about this, it's probably going to get a new name.
4812173	4815615	That's the other reason that makes this a big deal is because G4 will probably become something else.
4815635	4818317	But I can tell you right now, American Ninja Warrior fit right in with Spike.
4818397	4820439	So I'm sure that won't be gone for long.
4823146	4824348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4843115	4843435	Outro Music
4866494	4867055	DarkSakura.com
4885476	4895848	In Japan, it was called Chou Wakusei Senki Metaphyte, which translates to Super Planetary War Record Metaphyte, which honestly is a really freaking cool name.
4896990	4898151	It came out in the U.S.
4898612	4899853	in November 1988 and in Europe on April 25, 1991.
4903197	4904959	Yeah, they had to wait a long ass time to get this.
4905219	4906781	We just had to wait a few months after Japan.
4908703	4916491	But yeah, this game went from having a killer story in Japan to having the dumbest story ever in the U.S.
4917512	4920154	I mean, that doesn't affect how awesome the game itself was.
4920595	4921316	Okay, get this.
4922877	4923757	The Japanese version.
4923857	4927819	You're like an explorer landing on Sophia the Third, the planet.
4929019	4936541	And you have to explore where this ancient civilization was and stop this evil emperor and go through the whole planet.
4936722	4937482	Dan, shut up.
4939482	4940943	Hold on, I'm getting Dan to comment.
4942307	4943208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4960263	4963224	Second of all, it's tough as fucking nails.
4963765	4967266	The game is really, really hard, even for a NES game.
4967326	4968587	I mean, it is Nintendo hard.
4968967	4975069	And there's no save function, which is pretty brutal, because it's not a short game, and you upgrade the tank.
4976050	4982833	And when you die, and the tank is called Sophia in the NES version, Sophia III, which I always thought was really kind of weird, but it's cute in a way.
4984207	5002478	and you can make it fly you can drive on walls you can upgrade the blaster and shoot through walls you can jump out of the tank and your little dude runs around or you can go into like caves and you run around like Zelda style and then you can upgrade the weapons independently of the character who's named Jason and the tank which once again is named Sophia
5003158	5009185	I don't know why my wife's bitching about the Japanese storyline, because who fucking cares?
5009285	5011588	The Japanese version was a failure.
5012248	5015432	The Nintendo version is a classic.
5016793	5017534	Both Nintendo?
5018415	5018996	No, no, no, no, no.
5019216	5019937	The NES version.
5022094	5024235	Whatever, you completely didn't listen to anything that I said.
5024275	5025056	Rob, take the mic, please.
5028257	5033779	The Nintendo version, you drive a tank to save a frog.
5034420	5035060	It's awesome.
5036461	5037221	Saves you a frog.
5038462	5040723	And you can use the pause trick and kill the boss, it's real easy.
5041663	5044484	The pause trick means throw a grenade, pause it, and then they die.
5050808	5059013	Now, to be fair, we might have somebody who's like 14 listening to this program with their parents' permission, of course, who maybe didn't... Alright, Jamie, please.
5059753	5062095	Let's continue telling the listeners about Blaster Master.
5062935	5065356	Well, as Dan said, there is no save feature.
5066037	5066477	Whatever.
5068398	5069199	Shut up!
5072521	5078144	Jason and Sophia have different power meters, so they can... They take...
5080546	5081667	Dan, you're flustering her.
5081727	5084508	Let her get through this segment and then fluster her while we're on break.
5084568	5085909	I'm about to cut a bitch.
5087870	5091752	At any rate, you've got different power meters you can power up separately.
5091812	5094113	You get five continues, which he didn't say.
5096590	5112605	and you can restart the game at the same level in which you lost all of your lives you have a hover gauge that controls how much thrust is left in your tank I don't believe you brought up that the tank flies I don't believe you did bring that up he did oh my bad
5118715	5120916	Are you the king of Blaster Master?
5121676	5122876	I'm the Blaster Master.
5124977	5126498	James is like, I play Blaster Master.
5126738	5128199	We could turn on the desk right now.
5128679	5132820	We could actually turn on two nests and we could have a Blaster Master race and I will fuck her shit up.
5135261	5137942	But if we played Mass Effect, yeah, that wouldn't even be a good race.
5139783	5140804	She'd murder the shit out of me.
5140864	5142104	It'd be kind of sad.
5142124	5144405	Give me the mic.
5147526	5155913	For other releases that came out, there was a re-release on the PlayStation for Blaster Master itself.
5156393	5159416	Actually, my apologies for Metafight.
5159716	5166221	And Ripple Island came out on PlayStation in the Volume 4 of Sunsoft's Memorial Series in 2002.
5167222	5170164	And then it came out on the Wii Virtual Console on December 14, 2009.
5170264	5170325	And...
5174749	5179134	There was, um, Metafight was re-released for the Virtual Console on June 29, 2010.
5180956	5188424	There was Blaster Master Overdrive that, um, honestly I didn't give a crap about, so I'm not gonna talk about it.
5189445	5189626	Yeah.
5189646	5189726	Yeah.
5191434	5195236	I actually played the Wii, believe it or not, I played the Wii remake, I have it.
5196076	5199318	It just didn't have the charm of the original for me.
5199418	5201999	I remember the controls bugged me.
5202279	5205740	It was a few years ago, but I remember the controls really bothered me.
5205800	5206341	That was an issue.
5207601	5209002	That was released by Victor Ireland.
5210168	5211008	from Working Design.
5211929	5212529	And rest in peace.
5214029	5215010	New company, Gaijin Works.
5215210	5215690	Yeah, Gaijin Works.
5215710	5221352	There was also a sequel on the Genesis, which was not produced by the original creator, which was not so good.
5221912	5226454	There was kind of a pseudo-remake for the Game Boy Advance called Enemy Within.
5226474	5229315	Actually, no, it was for Game Boy Color, which was also not as good.
5229675	5235437	And there was a punishment from God sequel on the PlayStation called Blaster Master Blasting Again.
5236037	5238238	So really, there's only one good Blaster Master game.
5240163	5249101	The whole reason why the story was changed is because You have to give them credit.
5249162	5250184	Frogs are pretty awesome.
5250876	5252016	No, they're slimy and stupid.
5252977	5253917	And they make you hallucinate.
5257018	5263019	Anyway, they changed it because they didn't think that the space exploration would be popular in the US.
5263059	5266060	That whole genre of anime hadn't really made it over.
5267180	5269481	And so they changed it to Jason and His Frog.
5270221	5272422	And used the name of the planet, Sophia the Third.
5272902	5276783	There was a portion of the map in the fourth level...
5277564	5285385	that did not map over, so actually you have to make this huge jump off a ladder, suspended in midair.
5288550	5289370	I'm not gonna say any more
5314338	5315819	How'd that Kickstarter go for them?
5316999	5317480	They made it, right?
5317500	5320721	They made more than initial... I figured they would.
5321922	5322382	Good times.
5323282	5323722	Alright.
5324263	5325483	This game is hard as hell.
5326964	5327564	Alright, there it is.
5327824	5328205	Blast off.
5328225	5331966	I was just watching the YouTube in the background, remembering having horrible, horrible nightmares of the game.
5332367	5337329	I thought that that particular playthrough was interesting because it was a non-machine-assisted speedrun.
5338957	5346801	That looks like you can kind of tell when it's an emulator and when it's that dirty connection to the TV through an RCA cable.
5346942	5350844	You can kind of tell the difference on YouTube, and that was definitely the TV being plugged in there.
5351444	5354646	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Blaster Master.
5355326	5357088	We're going to take a break here, but don't go anywhere.
5357548	5359029	We've got plenty more of show to come.
5359089	5360050	Yes, there's more.
5360470	5366875	We're going to talk a little bit about the OUYA in Part B tonight, as well as some Final Fantasy collections and, of course, Rapid Fire News.
5367235	5368736	Your phone calls as well.
5368776	5369457	You want to call in?
5369717	5372239	You want to get involved in Dan and Jamie's discussions?
5372359	5375161	Here's your chance during the Skype line.
5375261	5376903	I don't want to be involved in our discussions.
5376923	5378244	In Part B tonight.
5379224	5380645	But first, a break.
5380686	5383668	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5389944	5399429	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on September the 9th, 2012, Dreamcast Day at vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network.
5399469	5402591	We've had a pretty exciting show so far tonight.
5402991	5405673	DarkSakura, I think they hugged it out during the break, yes?
5406573	5407534	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5436154	5438676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5460521	5467264	In January, coming up next year, we will have been together for 15 years, but we've been married for 7.
5467304	5470706	Yes.
5472266	5473447	You are such a dork.
5473567	5474688	What was I supposed to say?
5476906	5478287	I don't know, I'm leaving you.
5478527	5482849	Okay, this is funny because Rob's cutting his quesadilla with scissors.
5487171	5488232	You use a pizza cutter.
5488272	5490533	Rob doesn't have mics, he can't hear any of this.
5490653	5491874	Anyway, so yeah.
5502185	5505028	I found them on the work message boards and told you about it.
5505048	5506749	No, I found them on the work message boards.
5506789	5507170	You are a liar!
5507190	5507470	No, I'm not.
5507490	5507750	Wait, wait.
5527836	5528917	You are such a liar.
5528977	5531878	Definitely married for seven years, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie and Dan.
5531998	5532659	Congratulations.
5533079	5533859	Thank you.
5534720	5534960	All right.
5535540	5537241	A couple quick, quick things.
5538162	5540143	We are just a couple weeks away from episode 475.
5540203	5542705	Wait, one more thing.
5542965	5543145	What?
5543405	5546727	The day after, on September 2nd, I converted.
5547407	5547888	I became Jewish.
5547908	5548568	Oh, is that your fool?
5548988	5549568	That was my conversion day.
5549589	5550609	I thought you'd already had that.
5550949	5552110	No, not this last one.
5552130	5552690	That was two years.
5552750	5553871	It meant two years past my conversion.
5554631	5555992	Oh, okay, it was the anniversary, I see.
5556453	5558294	And that's why you're not here next week, because there's a holiday.
5558494	5559875	Yes, because Rosh Hashanah starts.
5559895	5561576	So Happy New Year, all the Jews out there!
5561876	5562337	Understandable.
5562717	5563357	Have a good week off.
5563878	5565439	Hope you listen to the podcast during the week.
5565919	5566279	Maybe.
5567820	5569982	Anyhow, episode 475 is coming up.
5570542	5573464	We might have some surprises in store, so be sure you're here that night.
5573724	5577087	And I'm talking mostly for the longtime OLR fans.
5577427	5581930	There's something brewing where you longtime OLR fans are going to be like...
5582470	5582910	What?
5583991	5584791	That's all I'm going to say.
5585391	5586752	Episode 475, be here.
5587572	5587872	All right.
5589633	5590694	Because reasons.
5591974	5593895	Rapid Fire News is up next.
5594595	5598437	While I finish cutting my quesadilla, which by the way, smells delicious.
5598897	5605580	You take all the pictures you want of my delicious quesadilla from the work-provided quesadilla maker that I won.
5605720	5606020	Thank you.
5607561	5608381	Picture with scissors.
5609645	5612647	So there's a new free Vita game that you can download.
5613128	5622855	It's called Treasure Park, and basically it's a game that allows you to create your own grid-based puzzles with hidden objects and bombs and stuff, and you can share them with your friends in your app.
5624056	5628599	That might be a reason for me to play my Vita that I haven't played.
5628639	5630861	Sound Shapes is a reason to play your Vita if you haven't yet.
5630881	5632262	Yeah, I heard it was really short, though.
5632762	5634323	It is, but they have all the online levels.
5634383	5635204	It's a good game.
5637657	5660934	and that pinball, that pinball now that I haven't really played but I hear it's good I played it on Xbox the Ego and Shadow of the Colossus collection as well as the God of War PS3 collections those have been given an update to allow for remote play on the Vita so now you can get your Shadow of the Colossus fix on the go which is pretty sweet
5662794	5667696	Of course, those include the first two God of War games, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus.
5668476	5669336	So that's pretty sweet.
5669856	5684080	And last but not least, Angry Birds is getting yet another spin-off, this time in the form of Bad Piggies, where you're going to take the villains, I guess, of the game and play as them in puzzle-like fashion, I'm sure.
5684200	5687221	And that's coming out on iOS, Android, and Mac.
5688201	5696326	September 27th with other versions Windows Phone, Windows 8 and PC later on I guess.
5699348	5702890	It doesn't sound very exciting but I'm not a big Angry Birds fan.
5705892	5708833	I'm sure it'll sell millions and billions like all the others did.
5708953	5709374	Of course.
5709914	5710154	Metroid
5715319	5717620	On the Wii U. Do I have your attention?
5718341	5719601	Alright, well here's the unfortunate part.
5719981	5721562	It's just part of Nintendo Land.
5721582	5723943	But I gotta say, it does look kinda neat.
5724904	5728426	A lot of people are saying it looks like a souped up version of the Battle.me prototype.
5728446	5729866	If you ever saw that during the trade shows.
5729886	5730547	They showed this.
5731809	5732329	DarkTetsuya, listen up.
5755478	5757840	La Mulana, finally on WiiWare.
5757940	5759881	September 20th is the big day.
5760482	5762463	This is a big sordid story here.
5762483	5765765	It was going to come out and then it wasn't because they didn't think it would make money.
5766706	5768227	They said it was going to be canceled.
5768287	5769328	Then the internet got mad.
5769388	5769868	So here it is.
5770108	5770769	There's a lot of QQ.
5771469	5776172	The most complete archaeology action and exploration game ever created.
5776252	5787919	So that Indiana Jones game that was in the arcades, the Temple of Doom arcade game, I guess that can suck it because this is the most complete archaeology action and exploration game ever created.
5787959	5788879	Over 40 hours of play.
5789219	5792881	No, for real, for like retro looking games, it looks awesome.
5793662	5797184	I got a ton of Nintendo news tonight because here, okay, I got to admit,
5798755	5800897	The only reason I'm covering this is because it's on all the game blogs.
5800917	5803199	Because I think this is the biggest fucking duh in the world.
5803459	5807402	But the game blogs are saying, Wii U Zelda coming in 2014?
5808203	5809644	No shit.
5809944	5814348	Saying a Zelda game is coming out on the Wii U is like saying the sun is going to rise in the morning.
5815008	5816289	That bears shit in the woods.
5816510	5818852	That's what you call a safe bet.
5819672	5822975	And also what you call a headline that will get people to go, almost!
5823655	5824056	Oh my god!
5824076	5825216	There's a Zelda game coming!
5825277	5826938	I need to reblog this everywhere!
5828439	5829940	So your site gets, you know, hits.
5830240	5831881	It's all about the hits, folks.
5831941	5832681	Here's the thing, though.
5833502	5834082	Why would it be 2014?
5835143	5835884	Why not next year?
5836224	5840867	Because they haven't announced one yet, and people think that, oh, they've already announced everything that they've got coming.
5841067	5842528	So what's going to be their big thing next year?
5842608	5844670	They've got to have something big, big, big next year.
5844850	5847192	Next year... The Donkey Kong poop-throwing edition?
5847472	5848954	Well, unless it's a 3D Mario.
5849554	5850775	A Donkey Kong poop-throwing game?
5851416	5851656	Maybe.
5851696	5854658	Smash Brothers, they're thinking, remember?
5854758	5855179	In 2013?
5855879	5857541	Those Smash Brothers games always take forever.
5858582	5858882	I don't know.
5859397	5860958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5881186	5882747	No news yet on Circle of Evermore?
5883508	5883808	No.
5885069	5888653	And then Ace Attorney 5 will be coming out
5891153	5891514	Emma?
5891694	5891974	Emma?
5892194	5892314	Emma?
5915831	5921494	and then Rhythm Thief is supposed to be coming to the IOS this winter.
5922694	5928917	So this one is just going to be one player and I think should have leaderboard options.
5930998	5931398	So that's it.
5933959	5935700	Sorry, my mouth is full of quesadilla.
5937001	5938261	Rhythm Thief, I want to play that though.
5938281	5939242	Okay.
5939262	5939382	Okay.
5940245	5941406	I'm not stopping you.
5941426	5942006	I'm not stopping you.
5964554	5967895	Facebook, Google, put them together, you get Fugle.
5968556	5972497	And we ask a question every week and we read some of the answers.
5972517	5975979	I want to reiterate that because some people sometimes get a little upset that I don't read their answers.
5976019	5979080	But like, if I read all the answers, it would be a five hour show.
5979760	5984322	So we pick some of the answers to read from Google Plus and Facebook about the question.
5984822	5990066	The question ties into a story from Part A. There's a rumor going around that G4 is going through some changes.
5990587	5995351	Although G4 stopped being exclusively games and tech some time ago, we want to ask you about video game television.
5995871	5999994	Do you think a dedicated video game television station could work in today's world?
6000535	6002977	If you do, what kind of shows would you want to see on it?
6003597	6005279	If you don't think it would work, why not?
6006474	6008255	Redertainment on Google Plus starts.
6008895	6009336	Interesting.
6029066	6029467	You know what?
6029847	6030248	But true.
6031930	6035113	I actually equivalent the Nielsen system with using BMI to track health.
6035834	6038137	Both of them are inherently flawed and useless.
6039278	6043783	Technus replied on Google Plus and said, I think a dedicated video game channel on cable is long gone.
6044344	6048207	The problem with G4 in the early days is that they used to air reruns so much it was nuts.
6048707	6053871	I remember getting the channel as a preview channel and they would air the same old episodes that I saw a few months ago.
6054371	6061957	When they merged with Tech TV, I thought they could coexist pretty well with finally cutting out the excess of reruns and shows that nobody really watched from both networks.
6062598	6067021	And he goes on and on to talk about Tech TV and then they flushed it down the drain and so forth.
6068402	6086893	he says at the end though it's all about video on demand and IPTV services these days and I think that's where a video game network can thrive so he thinks in the traditional sense it's done and Jim replies and says it would never work the channel wouldn't be able to be very critical of games or the industry in general because that's where the bulk of their advertising dollars would have to come from
6088334	6091135	Interesting, because he thinks that the conflict, it would never work.
6092556	6093676	I think there's some truth in that.
6094877	6096258	They can be pretty mean sometimes.
6097338	6103961	All right, going over to Facebook and checking out some of the answers on Facebook, which there's a lot, and I'm never going to be able to get through some of these.
6105921	6133168	another comment from DarkCharger about IPTV becoming the norm Nutman says I think a video game channel could work but TV executives need to step out of the way G4 like many other TV endeavors failed because guys in suits thought they knew better than the people they hired Scott Rubin and others behind G4 were met with opposition on everything and eventually just gave up entirely executives set it up for failure and then asked everybody why it failed so they need to get rid of the management
6134468	6135449	RedTheHaze says, Nope.
6136130	6138151	Every now and then I remember Tech TV and G4.
6138171	6140673	I miss those channels, but then I remember we have the internet now.
6141774	6143195	Ronnie says, Yes, it would work.
6143615	6147158	There will always be the casual market that doesn't know as much as we do on the internet.
6147498	6149700	I don't expect it to ever be like the original G4.
6149900	6151701	I imagine it would be extremely casual.
6152722	6160228	TigerClaw says the problem with having a cable network dedicated to video games is you've got to appeal to a certain demographic, which is relatively small to a mass audience.
6160528	6165412	Who needs a 24-hour cable network devoted to video games when you can find all the video game coverage you can imagine online?
6167869	6185243	um looking at some of the other answers Degenerate Johnny says honestly with the YouTube channels and internet shows being dedicated to video games I think that a cable network channel would not work for long so many of these e-shows and podcasts such as OLR feature an overwhelming amount of content to satisfy gamers of all ages
6185723	6189888	Such features include up-to-date news, the latest reviews of games and DLC, etc.
6190268	6192931	These features are all that the average video gamer requires.
6192951	6198017	It would be a waste of time to watch something on TV for something that could easily be accessed on the internet in an entertaining fashion.
6198197	6199198	We killed G4.
6199259	6199839	Confirmed.
6199859	6201801	According to Degenerate Johnny.
6203143	6203243	Um...
6204304	6205966	Mike simply says, yes, it would work.
6206346	6210109	I'd like to see reviews, strategies, how-to, achievement type shows.
6210970	6215393	Wicked says, I think a dedicated gaming channel could be viable in today's market.
6215453	6222559	With how diverse and expansive the internet is, gaming content that would be on a television network is numerous, but too far and wide for some.
6223000	6230146	A channel that specifically caters to the video game masses would concentrate a lot of good shows, topics, and games in one location for easy digestion.
6230706	6232948	As for what should be on the network, that simple.
6233308	6236490	Look at G4 Tech TV, both separate entities, and during the merger.
6236971	6238412	And name some various shows there.
6239112	6242134	It was easy to fill up the network with gaming, though a lot of it was tech.
6242194	6243855	But also, hey, they knew the demographic.
6244276	6246357	And I think, if done properly, it could thrive again.
6246537	6247538	Just not as G4.
6247718	6248419	God, I hope not.
6249199	6252782	Lastly, Picaruno says, Charlie Brooker's Game Swipe.
6252982	6253922	Watch it now.
6254883	6256004	Those are some of the answers, but...
6256226	6258848	from our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6258888	6261270	Check that out if you want to see the complete list of the answers.
6261310	6263211	Thanks to everybody and Google Plus as well.
6263831	6266833	Search for Orange Lounge Radio Plus and you'll find that.
6267254	6268314	Thank you to everybody who answered.
6268635	6269875	How about you folks here in studio?
6270756	6272177	Would it work or is it done?
6272437	6272777	It's done.
6273298	6273418	Why?
6274600	6279782	Well, I mean, really, everyone said, it goes back to what the other people said, the internet's taken over.
6280683	6287645	And besides that, I know plenty of people who would rather sit and play a game on their TV than watch a show on their TV.
6288146	6289826	I mean, me, I don't even watch TV.
6290267	6292047	I download my shows on the internet.
6292127	6293888	I watch Supernatural and Doctor Who and that's it.
6294488	6300591	If there was a dedicated video game station, or station, a channel on TV, I still wouldn't watch it.
6301442	6305064	I remember there used to be a show on G4 that just showed nothing but gameplay footage.
6305985	6308406	Like, little five-minute clips of gameplay footage.
6308426	6309907	It was a way to sample all the new games.
6310027	6310607	It was interesting.
6310707	6311668	I have the internet for that.
6312829	6322934	I mean, there's plenty of times when, like Dan said, I can sit with my netbook while I'm playing a game and look up a particular path in a game that I want to do.
6324215	6327637	Or, you know, he watches playthroughs of stuff all the time.
6328618	6329658	It's really just...
6331099	6334042	I don't think that it would have to be one or the other.
6334523	6338286	If TV was the only way to get the information, then yeah, then it would work.
6338407	6339648	But there's so many other outlets.
6340048	6345914	They're a lot more convenient and you don't have to wait for programming times or wait for it to record.
6346375	6347596	It's there when you want it.
6348657	6349678	The chatters jumped in.
6349758	6351900	Cinematheque was the show I was thinking of.
6352441	6352681	Loki.
6354057	6355718	Um, yeah, it's gonna be hard for them.
6356219	6356779	I mean, I don't know.
6356799	6366546	I think the problem would be is that they would, it's too niche for them to have enough revenues, revenue dollars from ads and stuff to warrant keeping the station.
6366566	6374913	It's just too, I mean, that's why you see like G4 going away where it's so generic now that, you know, it gets more viewers, I guess.
6375073	6377895	People like watching cops and stuff at weird hours at night.
6378015	6379256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6397145	6402469	And I think you see a lot of it with tying into the Xbox style content.
6402509	6409393	You see a lot of networks trying to get in on that, even Comcast getting in on that, and a lot more of that on-demand style stuff, Hulu, Netflix.
6410314	6423343	I think if a gaming company could kind of build itself around that primary and be a cable network secondary, they'd be in a much better place than, say, somebody coming around and just trying to copy G4.
6423703	6426024	If a station can't evolve, it's going to be doomed.
6426405	6426645	Dan?
6427865	6429986	It could have been doable.
6430346	6433047	I mean, I don't know if it still could be doable because, again, the money's hard.
6433107	6435808	But the problem is that they never played it straight.
6437168	6443050	Like, even the biggest names, you know, when they had the video game shows, like Sessler, that dude was a douchebag.
6443250	6445411	He was just such a fucking retard.
6445691	6448672	And you'd watch and you'd just be like, I don't want to be associated with this guy.
6449423	6477345	and then they had the girl who wasn't really good looking but she was good looking enough to be kind of eye candy and people were just like well they're not really talking to gamers they're kind of just doing their thing and I believe that they were gamers I believe that they cared about what they were doing I just never thought that they were good I don't think that they played up real I think that if there was a show I don't think there could be a network but I think there could be a show that did the trick
6478281	6480482	You know, if it played it real and not douchey.
6482150	6482790	I get what you're saying.
6482870	6487792	I sometimes felt like a lot of those shows really felt like they were catered to 12-year-old boys and it gets old, you know?
6488172	6490833	Like, talk up to me, not down to me, you know?
6492033	6494534	Some folks in the chat room... JDR Dollar Bill agreed with you.
6495334	6496514	He says Sessler was a tool.
6496534	6497655	But Fifth Dream does not.
6497715	6498955	Sessler really is pretty awesome.
6499115	6508958	Sessler was pretty awesome, but Sessler was pretty awesome on tech TV because that's all they really needed is one show dedicated to video games and the rest was pretty awesome as its own.
6509498	6512860	That's the network you need to copy if you're going to try to copy a network.
6512900	6513920	Don't copy G4.
6514240	6516542	Copy Tech TV because that was awesome.
6516642	6521204	That's a network I think that could have actually made it given a little bit more advertising.
6521984	6522264	All right.
6522585	6523605	Well, go ahead.
6523805	6524205	One last thought.
6524225	6530068	I just don't really understand why TV is still big when you've got the internet.
6530088	6534851	I mean like what Dan watches like one show on TV now, MasterChef.
6536011	6539754	and the rest of it we use the internet.
6539774	6540394	We have Hulu.
6540454	6541615	We have everything else.
6541775	6542316	Yeah, me too.
6542396	6544437	I'm really paying an insane amount for cable.
6544637	6545298	Cable's gonna go.
6545498	6545758	Yeah.
6546259	6546779	It's not worth it.
6546819	6549501	The reason we still have cable TV is because we have cable internet as well.
6551302	6552203	And Dan likes MasterChef.
6553357	6553557	GameStop
6569958	6570619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6597864	6612154	And of course, they're used to selling DLC, so assuming that this is kind of like Steam or Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network or something like that, they would probably have codes that could be redeemed for apps and stuff on there.
6612195	6622222	But at the same time, I don't think you can go to GameStop and buy an app that's on the Android Marketplace or something like that or Google Play.
6622262	6623343	You can't just go, hey...
6625450	6626832	Dan, no one can hear you when you don't have a mic.
6630123	6630463	I don't know.
6630824	6637708	I just don't know if people would really... They're kind of pointless when it comes to buying stuff online.
6637728	6643272	Because why would I drive down to a store to buy something that I can purchase online without having to drive down to the store?
6643852	6645914	Aside from I'm trading in something.
6646874	6649056	But that only works if you're trading in a console game.
6649076	6652098	Because right now there's no trading on digital games.
6652638	6659943	So if really you're playing on a system, let's say you only own an Ouya, you're probably not going to be going down to them for anything.
6661524	6670067	except for maybe hardware and accessories assuming you need another Ouya controller or something if you didn't want to buy it online.
6671907	6684852	Well, this is all kind of about evolving to match what people want because if Ouya is going to be this big deal, GameStop wants a piece of it because GameStop is another one of those companies where its digital distribution becomes more and more.
6684932	6685953	They're getting a little worried.
6686773	6686933	Yeah.
6687193	6692497	And then another thing, there was a game that was on Kickstarter, Mercenary Kings.
6693097	6700482	Of course, they've surpassed their goal that they had, but now they're saying they're going to be putting it on the OUYA as well.
6701583	6707927	So right now, they're allowing anybody that's ordered a digital copy of the game, which is $15 pledged,
6709848	6719094	You'll get a copy of the Steam key and you'll get a copy of the OUYA key, which they believe that there's going to be a key system for that, although that obviously hasn't been confirmed yet.
6719154	6723717	But in some way they'll try to get it so that you can play that.
6724097	6730141	And for those who are not aware, Mercenary Kings is a game that's kind of a cross between Metal Slug and Minecraft, I guess.
6730641	6734344	You craft things based on the components that are dropped.
6735004	6751188	by the enemies and it's also animated by Paul Robinson who does really kick-ass 8-bit, 16-bit animated GIFs and he also did the animation in the Scott Pilgrim game that was on Xbox Live Arcade so it is worth checking out.
6751828	6752328	I backed it.
6753248	6754148	I love Paul Robinson.
6756569	6757729	Sounds like something to check out.
6758291	6765139	He's got an awesome animated GIF with a dog with an eye patch and a robotic dog shooting bullets and glowing dogs.
6765739	6765940	Nice.
6767096	6767316	PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6
6788656	6789636	is not worth your time.
6789696	6792857	But you might have heard of things like EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
6792897	6793418	DC Universe.
6793918	6794678	Oh, Derp.
6794718	6795198	That's a big one.
6795218	6795498	Thank you.
6797119	6797999	These are all big games.
6799699	6804861	SOE is looking into something where you, the player, can create in-game items.
6805761	6810963	And if Sony Online Entertainment adds them to the shop, you would get a kickback.
6812239	6812339	S.O.E.
6834056	6843520	Now before you get too excited or wonder how SOE would not drown under these requests, keep in mind, to create these items, you're going to have to know how to do 3D modeling.
6843901	6848683	So if you don't know Maya or 3DS Max, you may not exactly get to get on this.
6849523	6851024	Also, you don't get to pick stats.
6851644	6853785	That's something Sony gets to do.
6854685	6862506	You can do the design, you can do the item and the lore behind it, but ultimately it will be up to Sony Online Entertainment.
6862947	6869928	Very interesting sort of prospect, but maybe they're thinking word of mouth to help these games succeed.
6869968	6872989	Because let's say I have an item in a game that you can go buy and make money off of.
6873949	6877790	I'm likely to start advertising for the game and tell all these people, hey, go buy my item.
6878031	6878511	Exactly.
6878731	6889074	And it kind of helps the game get more exposure and possibly generate more sales, which, you know, Sony gets a cut of, not unlike the iOS marketplace or what have you.
6889595	6892876	So it's definitely a neat idea.
6894286	6899227	I think people will probably use it if they're talented enough and maybe make a little cash.
6899307	6899647	We'll see.
6900788	6902788	So there you go.
6904068	6905289	Next story, DarkSakura.
6905649	6907129	Sorry, I had a little debate in the chat room.
6907669	6908569	Oh, anything you want to share?
6908729	6909169	Progress.
6910950	6915711	Why I think radio is going to go away and why TV is going to go away.
6917332	6918153	Yeah, but not tomorrow.
6918453	6924461	No, no, I didn't say that at all, but I'm saying that, I mean, it may not even happen in our lifetime, but those formats aren't going to be around anymore.
6925137	6927098	I gotta admit, I really like radio, though.
6927218	6931081	I mean, obviously, we're a podcast, so there's a radio element to it.
6931101	6936425	But traditional radio is in trouble because of things like us and satellite and so forth.
6936605	6939006	How many traditional radio stations do you think would air us?
6940167	6941108	Yeah, exactly.
6941668	6945491	But in the car, I find myself listening to a lot of radio.
6945511	6946972	And I do a lot of driving sometimes.
6947492	6948653	So I think a lot of us do.
6948693	6952916	And I know a lot of people listen to OLR specifically at work while they're doing something.
6952936	6954096	Oh, I feel sorry for them.
6955277	6955737	Some type of job.
6955757	6956358	Oh, they have headphones.
6956378	6957538	I've listened to Horde House at work.
6957578	6959419	I've listened to BBC podcasts on history.
6959519	6959739	Yeah.
6960379	6964541	So, I mean... But, I mean... So, I think there is still a demand for the audio only.
6964981	6966782	It just might be the traditional radio.
6966902	6971544	I mean, it's the same thing I just mentioned earlier where traditional TV is in trouble.
6971684	6973025	I don't think it's shutting down tomorrow.
6973045	6973085	No.
6974125	6975486	But eventually it is going to go away.
6975526	6983493	I mean, I can guarantee you that the TV set that I owned when I was in high school wouldn't work now.
6983513	6985114	It doesn't have any HD input.
6986055	6988417	Almost all the stations have gone to an HD format.
6988677	6991139	And there's a bunch of TVs out there that just won't play it anymore.
6991759	6995122	I've got video game systems that we can't play because we don't have the right kind of TV for it.
6995542	6997264	Like that Odyssey that we have, we can't play it.
6997364	6998285	We don't have anything it'll work on.
6999886	7003589	When was the last time you saw a videotape new?
7005014	7005274	Radio Shack
7024859	7030444	Game Guru in our chat room says, unless you can get internet over the air with an antenna, radio and TV won't disappear.
7030545	7031606	You kind of can.
7031666	7032466	It's getting really close.
7032887	7033948	Well, think of it this way.
7034829	7037771	20 years ago, we got to the internet on dial-up.
7038192	7039953	Let's see, 20 years ago would have been 92.
7040094	7042456	So I would say maybe we were at the stage where like,
7044118	7061080	28.8k dial up was kind of the big thing about then you know that was how we were connecting online and all that so we progressed that much from dial up modem 28.8k to where we're at now so think where we're going to be in 20 years I think that whole internet off an antenna
7061520	7062341	is right around the corner.
7062381	7063541	That's not already kind of there.
7063561	7074729	I was thinking about this earlier because there was actually a Cracked article talking about technology then and now and saying that half of a level of Angry Birds would not fit on a Duck Hunt cartridge or something.
7075910	7076010	And...
7078181	7079162	Dan says way less than that.
7079622	7080982	It's just a matter of progress.
7081162	7081963	It's going to change.
7082883	7086625	Stuff that they're going to have 10 years from now doesn't exist today.
7086925	7089266	And the stuff that we have today will probably fall down the wayside.
7089886	7104373	One of the reasons that they were making everybody go digital anyways, the whole switchover, is the analog frequencies and stuff that are out there that was for terrestrial broadcast and stuff, that's all up in the air now.
7104413	7107454	So now they can use that for broadcasting internet.
7108280	7110444	and Stanlearn InDesign if you're going to do print media.
7110585	7113931	Let me ask a crazy question and maybe this is a little bit too... You're crazy!
7115695	7117960	Maybe this is a little too heavy for our show.
7119554	7124939	But what if maybe there comes a time... What if we just ask God to broadcast the internet?
7125039	7126960	I'm not even going into that territory.
7127661	7131824	Well, what if society rejected that technology?
7132125	7133866	Like, I'm not saying everybody goes Amish.
7134086	7134787	Like the Betamax?
7135067	7136669	But there are Amish people in the world.
7137069	7137609	They have a phone.
7138630	7141353	Well, not everybody is necessarily always going to embrace technology.
7141373	7142373	And they have a neighborhood computer.
7143234	7150157	Well, that's kind of my point, is that what if society doesn't want to keep going that direction?
7150257	7152458	Or do you think... Do you really think that's going to happen?
7152538	7153239	That's not going to happen.
7155620	7157441	If war broke out over it, it might happen.
7158101	7158241	Nope.
7158961	7159562	Not even then.
7160422	7164764	Because if war broke out over it, then that means that they really want it.
7164924	7166825	If war broke out over it, it'd be who controls it.
7167881	7168842	Too heavy for the show.
7168922	7169182	All right.
7169222	7172463	Because the people that wouldn't want it, they would just die eventually.
7172523	7174925	I do like what Technus said about it not going away.
7174965	7175625	It will evolve.
7176045	7177406	That's more what I'm thinking of.
7177526	7185510	But I mean, you're going to look, say, 15 years down the line when we've all got pocket broadband radios.
7186050	7189352	We don't have wireless FM radios anymore.
7189392	7190552	We don't use radio waves.
7190592	7191873	We're using broadband signals.
7191893	7195875	Well, technically, a 4G phone broadcasting Pandora is a broadband radio.
7196836	7197196	Exactly.
7198336	7198796	in my pocket.
7199837	7205558	But I mean, older forms of the same idea are going to fall by the wayside.
7205618	7206378	That's what progress is.
7206699	7207319	That's just how it happens.
7207339	7209159	I mean, who uses a Victrola?
7209919	7210940	Do you have a Victrola, Rob?
7211040	7211620	Do you know what one is?
7212380	7213600	It's not that old wind-up radio.
7213640	7214961	A hand-cranked phonograph.
7214981	7216861	Yeah, not radio, the record player.
7216881	7218802	When was the last time you used a mimeograph?
7221277	7224539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7242588	7267295	and they think they added it on August 28th and on its Japanese support site they just said we're sorry for the inconvenience the reception of delivery is being addressed now please wait for a while yeah nothing else they just said that we're looking into it don't worry I'll receive this about the same time we decide to release a patch for the Xbox 360 version of Silent Hill HD Collection never
7268669	7269990	Or the next DDR game.
7270030	7272091	They're just going to hope everyone forgets about it.
7272151	7272691	On consoles.
7274572	7275753	Well, I mean, if it did have a lot of problems.
7275993	7277534	Well, at the end of the day, how was it selling?
7277554	7280475	If it was selling decent enough, they'll find a reason to put it back on there.
7280535	7284137	But if not... Okay, Stan, your friend may have a Victrola, but tell me.
7284757	7287879	Does he use the Victrola all the time or listens to his iPhone?
7287939	7289440	It's for the retro kitsch of it, right?
7289640	7291281	Yeah, it's a kitsch collector's thing.
7291301	7293122	Of course people like to collect retro stuff.
7293182	7294723	I would love to have a Victrola.
7294743	7295003	Mm-hmm.
7295883	7296763	I still have albums.
7296883	7298124	I don't have anything to play it on.
7298264	7308986	I used to have this rockin' bitchin' record player when I was like five years old that I could play Sesame Street records on and it would light up like these really awesome red and green colors in tone with the audio.
7309066	7310646	I would love to have that shit again.
7310826	7311387	You know what I had?
7311627	7312547	An 8-track player.
7312687	7313027	You know what?
7313067	7314607	I don't care if I ever have again.
7315067	7315748	An 8-track player.
7318149	7320731	I downloaded my favorite song from my Muppets 8-track.
7321412	7322593	It was Lydia the Tattooed Lady.
7323774	7324254	Just saying.
7324894	7325855	Not the Rainbow Connection?
7326316	7327757	No, it was Lydia the Tattooed Lady.
7327817	7331099	Someday we'll find it.
7331860	7332761	This was in 1979.
7333902	7334982	When did the Muppet movie come out?
7335363	7336043	The original one?
7336424	7336704	Yeah.
7336724	7337184	79 or 80.
7339366	7343048	I had a Muppet show best of 8-track.
7343108	7348470	It was yellow and I remember how many times I had to fish the damn tape out of the 8-track player and fix it.
7350951	7352932	Let's see, the Muppet movie was 1979.
7352972	7355773	So it was right around the same time.
7355793	7356413	There you go.
7357967	7360688	Unfortunately, see, I would have been one year old when this movie came out.
7360788	7365411	But I remember when I was a kid, the big deal was Sesame Street, Follow That Bird.
7365991	7370553	And that scarring scene of the blue big bird in the cage.
7370673	7371613	I know, that was awful.
7371674	7374815	Oh my God, just kill me as a child.
7374955	7375936	And then Return to Oz.
7376276	7377316	There was a lot of fucked up movies.
7377336	7378117	Return to Oz was great.
7378137	7380518	There was a lot of fucked up movies for kids in the 80s.
7380558	7382659	Well, it was closer to the books anyway, but yeah.
7384461	7385202	Oh yes, gaming news.
7385242	7385683	Hi, Loki.
7385963	7388026	Well, you know, he did start off as a blue bird.
7390069	7391271	It was still... An homage.
7391371	7393054	He was sad and it was hard to see.
7395967	7398930	Let's talk about TV.
7398990	7403833	There's a series of games that were out on the PSP called Invisibles.
7403933	7406715	Well, now it's supposed to be coming out on the Vita.
7406995	7413259	They're going to get a new game, apparently, and it's going to be tied into a TV show or a cartoon show that's going to be coming out.
7413519	7422886	It's going to have a section of the show that's augmented reality where basically you'll take your Vita, point it at the screen, and something fancy will happen, unlocking new content in your game.
7424827	7425227	Cool.
7426508	7431271	I'm guessing that it's probably going to be some sort of AR code or QR code or something like that.
7434793	7444199	Is that going to be like those old VHS tapes they used to sell where you'd have a little spaceship that interacted with the thing on TV and all it was doing, it was kind of like a light gun type technology.
7444259	7448382	It just could see what was on the screen and light does its little things accordingly.
7448982	7451564	Like, and you think you're interacting with the movie, but you're really not.
7452967	7453969	Action Max Action Max
7465524	7466024	Thanks for watching!
7485774	7487797	My cat used to sit on top of my Nintendo.
7487837	7488739	Have you tried the iPad game?
7488759	7489379	Because it was warm.
7490101	7492845	I haven't because I'm freaked out about the scratching thing.
7493005	7494086	They can't scratch a screen.
7494928	7496450	Everybody says that, but I don't believe it.
7496470	7497491	Cut their claws.
7497952	7498052	No.
7498193	7498573	Why?
7498693	7499234	I cut Shermie's.
7499254	7500836	No, that's like cutting their little claws.
7501637	7502177	DarkSakura.com
7520970	7523092	Yeah, well, you just have to do it anyways, because, you know.
7523912	7528616	But anyways, yeah, so if you're afraid of them scratching the screen, just cut their claws.
7529077	7531599	Really, their claws aren't sharp enough to scratch glass.
7531879	7540426	I mean, my cat used to paw at the TV, like my LCD TV all the time, and if that thing's not scratched up already by them, then it's no big deal.
7541149	7542790	I like what Infinel says in the chatroom.
7542810	7544111	Put little gloves on their paws.
7544731	7545772	Kitten mittens!
7546332	7548773	Is your cat being too loud?
7548793	7552515	You should get the little cat claw cappers that look like nail polish.
7553636	7554757	Those things are awful.
7556158	7557979	Again, not my cats, not my decision to make.
7557999	7560560	Shermie would probably just take a big shit on the rug if I did that to her.
7560920	7564962	Speaking of It's Always Sunny, my wife gave me the It's Always Sunny board game for my birthday.
7565583	7565923	Really?
7566203	7569265	Yes, I have no idea when I'll ever play that, but it's cool.
7571621	7573302	My Struggles With Cats goes back to my weekend.
7573322	7575703	Oh, that's the freaking... Play it, play it, play it.
7575763	7577104	No, that's not the actual commercial.
7577144	7579185	That's the promo for the episode.
7579645	7580906	I think it's this one.
7583267	7584228	My Struggles... No.
7585228	7585849	Not that one.
7586309	7587970	Rob keeps clicking the same link.
7587990	7588450	Great radio.
7589170	7589931	Great radio.
7590051	7591792	I saw it, I saw it.
7594478	7596419	and Cat Enthusiast.
7596879	7600722	Is your cat making too much noise all the time?
7601043	7605966	Is your cat constantly stomping around, driving you crazy?
7609549	7612711	Is your cat clawing at your furnitures?
7613812	7615053	Think there's no answer?
7615193	7616795	You're so stupid.
7617195	7617895	There is.
7618416	7619597	Kitten Mittens.
7621380	7625288	Finally, there's an elegant, comfortable mitten for cats!
7631318	7632759	I couldn't hear anything.
7633139	7634540	Is your cat one-legged?
7634861	7637602	Is your cat fat, skinny, or an in-between?
7637622	7640204	That doesn't matter, because one size fits all.
7640264	7641185	Kitten Mittens.
7641525	7642626	You'll be smitten.
7642886	7645108	So come on down to Patty's Pub.
7645288	7648670	We're the home of the original Kitten Mittens.
7648930	7651052	Meow.
7652645	7653725	What the hell was that?
7653985	7654825	That's awesome.
7654965	7661407	An amazing fucking television show, which is why you should watch your TV once in a while because that show is fucking hilarious.
7661427	7662207	And order a dick towel.
7663967	7664988	The official dick towel.
7666248	7666508	Okay.
7667788	7669108	Shermie would just shit.
7669228	7669849	That's all she'd do.
7672089	7675250	My favorite is when the cat's walking across the table.
7676210	7680231	I surely PETA called in on that because I was borderline inhumane.
7680271	7680511	All right.
7682153	7682634	Serious Face.
7683876	7684558	Back to gaming news.
7685895	7686875	Oh yes, it's my turn, hey.
7688056	7689017	Final Fantasy!
7690238	7691278	There is no transition.
7692339	7703387	You know, if you have a lot of money and you've bought a lot of kitten mittens, maybe have some more disposable income, say $450, you could get the Final Fantasy Ultimate Compilation.
7703447	7704408	It's coming out in Japan.
7705068	7712213	Every game in the series up through Final Fantasy 13 in the Ultimate Compilation.
7712233	7712694	Does it have 11?
7712734	7713234	Yeah.
7713374	7713955	It even has 11.
7714075	7714876	Does it have 14?
7715076	7716197	The Vanadil Collection.
7716297	7716938	No, it does not.
7716998	7717938	Does it have Mystic Quest?
7717958	7719240	Because 14 didn't happen.
7719380	7720781	Does it have all of the four items?
7720801	7722583	Will you shut up and let me talk about it?
7723824	7725285	Just the numbered ones.
7725305	7727507	Does it have Dirge of Cerberus?
7727528	7731231	Now I know how you felt when Dan kept interrupting you during the Classic Game of the Week.
7731251	7731591	Hey, Rob.
7731932	7732052	What?
7732092	7732272	What?
7732292	7732492	I can't.
7737085	7740728	Final Fantasy 1-13, no 10-2s, no 13-2s PlayStation 1 versions of 1 and 2
7746297	7750939	The PSP version of Final Fantasy 3, because they're not going to bother to port it somewhere new, sorry.
7751760	7753601	PlayStation 1 versions of 4, 5, and 6.
7755021	7756482	PlayStation 1 version of 7, 8, and 9.
7757723	7765066	PlayStation 2 version of 10, as well as 11, and 12, and PlayStation 13 on the PlayStation 3.
7765346	7768768	Are they even running the servers for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 still?
7768848	7769809	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
7772571	7773311	Wait a second here.
7774312	7777935	But the problem is, though, you're going to need to have an old-style PlayStation 2 for that to work.
7777975	7779616	I don't see a hard drive attached there, too.
7779636	7782959	I know, it is kind of a little bit like, won't work, but whatever.
7783359	7785041	Why couldn't they just put a PC version?
7785081	7789004	If you have an old-ass PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility, I believe there's a way to do it.
7789324	7789845	That would be us.
7789905	7791747	I think they patched it in at one point.
7791847	7793469	Anyway, 35,000 yen.
7793990	7795271	That's about $450.
7796012	7803901	There will also be a commemorative DVD, an art collection, and a two-disc soundtrack because there have not been enough Final Fantasy soundtracks released in Japan.
7804842	7805583	There just haven't.
7806144	7806945	There needs to be another.
7809758	7811460	There it is, Final Fantasy Ultimate Collection.
7811800	7813963	Something I probably won't be buying.
7814343	7816205	Just because I have all the ones I want already.
7817507	7820991	I don't have $450, but if I had $450, I'd like pay to go to DragonCon.
7821031	7825276	And who really needs the PS2 version of Final Fantasy XI at this point?
7825376	7827018	I mean, come on, seriously.
7827118	7827859	Get the Xbox 360 version.
7829617	7833998	Seriously, if you're going to buy a console version right now, the 360 version is probably the way to go.
7834258	7835079	But PC is pretty good.
7835239	7835719	Alright, anyhow.
7836539	7836959	Mailbag.
7837199	7838700	Oh my god, we haven't even done the mailbag yet.
7839500	7840780	It's 8.30, we haven't even done the mailbag.
7841600	7845301	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails every week.
7846622	7847422	There's the mailbag music.
7849783	7851803	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7851823	7853984	DarkSakura dives in, picks your favorites, reads them now.
7855109	7858831	This comes from Sam.
7859831	7860331	Hi, Sam.
7860811	7861692	Hello, OLR crew.
7861792	7862932	I probably love the show.
7863292	7864693	This was a message sent.
7868595	7870315	I might love the show.
7871036	7877698	Do any of you think the Wii U will become the lead platform for development since it will be released before the next PlayStation and Xbox?
7878079	7878239	No.
7878919	7879079	No.
7879099	7879919	No, not at all.
7879939	7880940	Look at what's happening now.
7882172	7907861	let's look to the Dreamcast possibly on a couple games maybe if there's going to be some stuff that's coming out during that time I can see them having slightly better looking games but maybe I don't know if they're going to necessarily be developing for Wii U first and then porting over it's hard to say it depends on when the next platforms are coming out I mean everyone assumes that's going to be the end of next year but it could be in a couple years in which case yeah you may have a few games that are like that
7908209	7914432	I am dying to see if there is going to be a game that is Wii U and PS3, PS Vita.
7915213	7916073	Because it could happen.
7917194	7918635	I'm dying to see if that happens.
7920476	7921336	A third party could do it.
7922237	7924638	Or Xbox 360 and tablet.
7925238	7928780	Oh yeah, that whole thingy thing they said at E3.
7928860	7929481	Yeah, smart glass.
7929501	7930701	We haven't heard anything on in a while.
7931462	7931862	That's true.
7931882	7933123	They should call it smart ass.
7934483	7935784	Okay, next email.
7935864	7936384	This comes from...
7938740	7944349	I was playing Rock Band Blitz the night it came out on Xbox Live Arcade and up popped Green Skies playing Rock Band Blitz.
7945171	7949678	I was thinking that would be a great name to play with someone but there's no multiplayer.
7950079	7951942	I just remembered the game I forgot to review.
7953781	7973222	then I saw then I saw score war mode and I thought surely you'll be able to pick from your friends list nope it just matches you up with any random guy 64 so no friends list competition either it's just the leaderboards like many games before it the game is meant for a social gaming crowd but it isolates you from your friends fantastic
7974258	8001591	I think Robbo found this because after he sent the email because he sent me challenges through the Facebook app that's the interesting thing about Rock Band Blitz is there's a lot of enhanced things that are through Facebook which is good and it's bad and I'll leave it at that I need to talk more about Rock Band Blitz at the top I knew I was fucking forgetting something this week and I was just thrown off by all the other stuff we had at the top of the show I will talk Rock Band Blitz next week I have played an awful lot of it the short answer it's good
8002751	8005553	Bless them at Harmonix.
8006454	8007835	They're standing by their guns.
8008255	8010036	I just think there's some mistakes they made.
8012578	8012998	Some?
8013839	8015780	No, I mean, to be fair, they make a lot of great games.
8015820	8017201	And I do like Rock Band Blitz.
8017802	8020884	But I kind of don't agree with one of the things they tried to do.
8020964	8022865	But bless them for trying and sticking to it.
8023766	8024487	That's all I'll say for now.
8025147	8025347	Okay.
8026248	8028710	This last email is from Nasty Canesta.
8028730	8030471	Okay.
8032102	8032543	DarkSakura.com
8048562	8049943	Yeah, Bobby Grumpwolf.
8050063	8052465	Well, Mr. Blackwolf, here is my response.
8052985	8060070	I left in the email a Steam code for Depths of Peril, an action RPG with some strategy elements and random level generation.
8060490	8065233	I'll leave it to the OLR crew to come up with a way to give this code away to a lucky listener.
8066034	8070557	Also, have fun dealing with the brony fandom once again at the next DragonCon, Mr. Blackwolf.
8071698	8078262	In addition, if DarkSakuraSky or Loki is interested, I have one copy of Hybrid RTS FPS Nuclear Dawn to gift on Steam.
8080944	8086869	After you three fight to the death, Dance Battle, or whatever it is you three do to decide on things, please add me on Steam to get the game.
8086969	8088570	I apologize for not having a code.
8088590	8095075	The Nuclear Dawn developers decided on gifting the option for those who have purchased the game as part of a promotion.
8095636	8097657	I promise to keep things discreet and platonic.
8097777	8098458	No homo, maybe.
8099864	8100364	Maybe a little.
8100865	8101145	All right.
8102266	8103466	We'll make this very simple.
8103667	8105908	Email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
8106028	8106989	Tell us you want the code.
8107009	8107649	What's it for again?
8108330	8109290	Thank you, by the way, for the code.
8109811	8112412	For Depths of Peril.
8112693	8113293	Depths of Peril.
8113333	8116075	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we'll give it away to one lucky listener.
8116315	8116675	There you go.
8117076	8118897	Okay.
8120238	8122239	But that's just for not the live listeners.
8122499	8123640	That was for podcast listeners.
8124826	8151668	well you're not going to know if they're one or the other so it really ends up being for everybody okay how about this you can't email we won't take the emails until after the podcast airs oh well duh yeah yeah absolutely Black Wolf says and there are furries and bronies all over Dragon Con Tara Strong was a guest I barely saw them meaning they were all up on Tara lastly for Loki did you know there's an official sequel to Chip's Challenge called Chuck's Challenge 3D
8153413	8156015	Yeah, but the problem is I don't really care too much about Chips Challenge.
8156055	8159978	I mean, I cared about it back in the 90s, but now it's just like, eh, don't care.
8161139	8166382	Okay, so you said there was a Kickstarter project that was recently funded in April, and it's on Steam Greenlight.
8167323	8167603	Cool.
8167883	8168484	It's just, yeah.
8168504	8171005	You know what one I wish I did get in on?
8171046	8172026	It was GunCraft.
8172066	8174788	Apparently it's a knockoff of Minecraft, but with guns and stuff.
8174848	8176129	That would have been pretty cool.
8176269	8177310	That does sound kind of neat.
8179411	8179672	Okay.
8179792	8180472	That's it for emails?
8180953	8181133	Yep.
8181213	8181533	All right.
8182165	8185874	We'll get to Twitter in a minute, so your last chance to get the tweets in, twitter.com.
8186476	8190506	But first, it's time to get a little bit angsty in a segment we call FU.
8208463	8237482	um fuck this bad headache I've had for the last two days I want it to go away I want my neck to stop hurting and I want my whatever it is in my butt that's hurting and no it's not like that it's one of the muscles around my left hip has been really killing me I would like for it to stop done um I feel for no one being on when I'm on Minecraft all the time like I'm on a lot and there's no one there
8239737	8241958	This is the first week you've been able to mention it on the podcast.
8241978	8242758	Well, that's true, yeah.
8242778	8243938	I mean, literally, I started it.
8244518	8249260	And a few myself for accidentally kicking Bobby off the server a few times back.
8249660	8250700	You did it on purpose.
8250800	8253241	I was just getting... Revenge is yours.
8253481	8255522	I figured out how to... Take that, Bobby Grumple.
8256162	8258963	I just figured out how to finally do things on the server.
8259023	8262624	I mean, I've never run a Minecraft server before, so it's a little tricky.
8263364	8264364	But now I figured it out.
8264804	8266685	Ignorance is no excuse, Rah.
8268163	8270926	And just for that, Enderman will be spawning in my house later tonight.
8271947	8272948	I can make a lot of them.
8273028	8274650	No, no, I don't want that.
8274810	8276432	They're actually really easy to kill.
8276632	8277453	And they're afraid of water.
8277694	8277934	Alright.
8278054	8278254	Look.
8278975	8280096	Oh, so it's like signs.
8280897	8281558	Yep.
8281618	8282539	Water damages them.
8284421	8284681	Alright.
8285823	8286263	My FU.
8286363	8290468	I also give an FU to Headaches because I've been getting some killer ones lately and it's no fun.
8291068	8296732	F you to kind of like stress, because I've taken on a lot of projects, and it's going to keep me very busy over the next month.
8296792	8301475	It's already keeping me busy, and I'm starting to feel the pressures of a lot of that stress.
8302315	8312102	I would have done it if I didn't want to, but kind of just F you to the fact that I haven't been hanging out enough with people I don't see enough, basically.
8312662	8317125	So because I'm taking a lot on, it's a good thing, because it's allowing me to hang out with people I haven't seen enough.
8317285	8319267	FU to their not being 48 hours in a day, basically.
8319287	8321409	And FU to needing sleep, although sleep feels so good.
8321429	8322951	Dan, do you have any FUs you wanna give?
8322971	8323751	He's busy playing Game Boy Advance.
8340066	8343129	He's lying out on the floor like a kid playing the Advance.
8343449	8344189	It is kind of funny.
8344370	8345130	You gotta admit that.
8345751	8346031	Alright.
8346151	8347192	My husband is adorable.
8348522	8350002	I didn't go that far, but all right.
8350142	8355064	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8355104	8355904	But first, Loki.
8356564	8361965	There's a little bit more information coming out now about the whole Stardock lawsuit.
8362726	8375949	I think we talked about it a couple weeks ago where Stardock was accusing one of their employees who recently left the company of ruining a game because they claimed that she deleted stuff for it, and because of that,
8376269	8376849	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8402344	8411646	Before the whole, you know, leaving the company thing, seeking, I guess, was it $25,000 in damage or something?
8414347	8416987	I'm sorry, unspecified damages in excess of $25,000.
8417107	8428470	And she, you know, had filed complaints with the EEOC and, you know, claiming basically that the, you know...
8429770	8449514	Head of the company had done a lot of lewd things including, you know, linking to a sexually explicit YouTube video, making comments like, you know, oh, you're not chosen to go to some place because you're not, just because you're hot or, you know, asking her to take a purity test question thing that had, you know, sexual taboo questions and stuff on there.
8449534	8450575	Stuff that's no one else's business then?
8450595	8452395	You know, have you engaged in group sex?
8453075	8455776	I'd like to know that, you know, because I think I've, you know...
8456916	8457277	Wow.
8457317	8457377	Wow.
8479246	8499958	But like any court case or anything, there's people on both sides and her people or whatever made all those comments that she, of course, sent him a message basically saying, okay, I don't want you to touch me or any parts of my body, not even jokingly.
8499998	8504800	I don't want you to make comments about my boyfriend or future husband or anything like that.
8504820	8507562	I don't want you to make sexually charged jokes.
8507742	8524115	which is an email that shouldn't have to be sent let's remind ourselves that email should not have had to have been sent praise this girl for having the amazing self-restraint to be professional at this point about it
8524955	8539819	Despite whatever other allegations are out there, fucking A. But apparently, he responded though to this email saying, you know, I don't recall item one, but I'll certainly endeavor to be extra careful.
8539999	8542280	I understand number two, but I'll be more conscious.
8542920	8548285	3.
8542940	8548285	I am an inappropriate, sexist, vulgar, and embarrassing person.
8548906	8550447	I am not inclined to change my behavior.
8550488	8552670	If this is a problem for you, you need to find another job.
8552690	8552670	4.
8553230	8557014	I am not willing to adapt my behavior to suit others.
8557474	8562058	If you find my behavior problematic, I recommend finding another job.
8562419	8564321	I am not some manager or co-worker of yours.
8564421	8565301	I own the company.
8566062	8569705	It and your job here exists to suit my purpose, not vice versa.
8570605	8580893	The company is not an end unto itself and is a means to an end on which to further the objective of its shareholders, in this case, me.
8582554	8583555	Yeah, but there's still laws.
8583755	8587498	If you're going to operate a company that you have employees at, that's a law.
8588038	8589219	You can't get around that.
8589299	8591520	Even if you're a disgusting shithole like...
8593823	8603107	Sorry, I take it a little, you know, I mean, a man has no excuse to ever act that way to another, to a woman or any human being.
8603407	8606428	A person has no right to act that way towards another person.
8606468	8607629	Person, at all.
8609150	8614992	And then, of course, he responded, you know, the whole thing, basically, to this website, Quarter of Three.
8615792	8615912	Um...
8617353	8620538	You know, saying, okay, I'm going to go ahead and respond to this.
8620558	8621800	The incident happened back in 2010.
8622521	8632375	Myself, Alexandria, and a few others were at a pub going to the QT3 dinner that Lloyd Case had set up.
8634017	8637300	and while there, Alexandra got teased and got mad at the time.
8637340	8640703	I didn't realize she was so upset about it and blah, blah, blah.
8642125	8644307	Later, she emailed me about the incident and stuff like that.
8644347	8648450	Basically, he plays it off saying, oh, this stuff didn't happen or wasn't as bad.
8648470	8649111	Smoke and mirrors.
8649631	8650212	Smoke and mirrors.
8650772	8665514	and basically saying this is retaliatory and or the charge that you know basically the whole thing was insinuating that the retaliatory or the alleged retaliatory lawsuit of her ruining their game was because she filed this lawsuit in the first place.
8667179	8669820	So it's all going to come out.
8669840	8678662	They're accusing her of deleting all this stuff or whatever, but it doesn't like it's one of those things where like, you know, the old saying, if the shoe fits, wear it or if the shoe, whatever.
8679602	8686764	My point is her incredible professionalism in that email and lack of restraint.
8687504	8690865	I mean, praise her for for being able to show that kind of restraint.
8691505	8695186	doesn't match that of somebody who would go in and delete everything.
8695326	8695786	You know what I mean?
8696206	8698286	It's kind of like you got this over here and then this over here.
8698306	8699387	It doesn't line up.
8699867	8700947	You know what I mean?
8701107	8701647	How do we know?
8701807	8704108	And again, I'm not going to pretend to know dick about this case.
8704268	8709769	So I'm being a total couch jury right now, which is probably bad, but just throwing it out there.
8710429	8718831	If that's the environment this person created at this company where it's like you deal with it because it's my company or what have you, how do we know it just wasn't somebody else who deleted it?
8720819	8722660	Maybe somebody else chose not to take the high road.
8723120	8723881	Just throwing it out there.
8724461	8731545	Also, the thing, too, is they're talking about how she knew where the files were and had access to relevant Google Docs.
8731745	8733425	Why are you using Google Docs?
8733646	8735967	A lot of businesses use Google Docs.
8736147	8738108	I've heard of that before.
8738528	8741390	I use Google Docs for a number of stuff through my school, too.
8741410	8745752	It seems like you'd have your own intranet or something that you'd do that on.
8746472	8769337	uh anyhow uh the moral of the story is um people need to like like not do this to other people and i'm talking the whole harassment thing in the first place like and and that kind of bugs me that in the response it's very smoke and mirrors like well there was teasing and da da da but that doesn't give anybody the right to delete whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
8773220	8776641	There's no excuse for what happened here.
8777002	8779382	He doesn't even apologize for it.
8779402	8787746	Now you can argue that I was a jerk in how I responded to her, but it doesn't justify her getting pissed off and quitting without notice and using her network access to wipe out our marketing access.
8788106	8791427	How dare this person... Oh my god, it's so infuriating.
8791467	8793248	How dare you try to blame her?
8793868	8794528	How dare you?
8794628	8794909	That is...
8796489	8797730	I'd love to see somebody do it to him
8823342	8826511	Thank you Fucking psychotic behavior
8828905	8830145	Well, I don't even know how to
8854770	8858632	had too many competing sub-series.
8859252	8861093	Quote, Thanks for the suggestion.
8861553	8871757	I, and probably I alone, so please don't ascribe said belief to Capcom, think one of the problems Mega Man has had as a brand is that we've had too many competing Splinter sub-brands within it.
8872197	8880341	I'm not sure starting yet another is the way to get the franchise as a whole back on track, more than creating greater brand confusion, but will take it under advisement.
8881081	8885863	I think there's a bunch of shit right there because the different series that they have were on different platforms.
8886043	8887364	They didn't have the other Mega Man games.
8887684	8893347	It was like you want a Mega Man game on Game Boy Advance, then you're playing Mega Man Power or something or other.
8893367	8893987	I don't remember what it was.
8894407	8901751	But it wasn't like, oh, hey, we're going to have Mega Man this and Mega Man that, and they're going to compete against each other.
8901771	8903051	I don't think they really had that.
8903132	8903512	It was just...
8904272	8905452	Didn't the Mega Man creator walk?
8928581	8931083	Well, yeah, they kind of let him go where he walked.
8931103	8932945	That never stops people in the industry.
8932965	8935427	I'm saying, if he was, I mean, he was a big wig.
8936148	8942593	If he was the one driving Mega Man development, and he's like, okay, I'm out, and everyone else is just like, uh, what the fuck do we do?
8943574	8944655	Let's just go ahead and put that one away.
8946640	8958143	I kind of think this points towards there's going to be some big reboot, because that's always the fucking answer to every problem, reboot of the Mega Man franchise in the future.
8958163	8965484	I bet you anything there's going to be a new Mega Man game that's just Mega Man, and it's a reboot, and there's some new creative person at the helm.
8966245	8968105	And it's not Grin making it.
8968825	8996170	yeah it's not it lends itself perfectly to some type of reboot whether that be on the next consoles or you know maybe a 3DS game probably or a Vita game I think there will be a Mega Man reboot just Mega Man speculation rampant whatever fanboy wank call it what you want I just kind of think that's where all the signs point towards especially with that type of rebuttal there's too many franchises so they're going to bring it back to one we'll see
8997679	8998399	I bet it's a reboot.
8999780	9002720	Hey, let's go to the Skype line.
9002740	9005361	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9005381	9006802	We've had a heck of a show so far tonight.
9006882	9008462	Let's see what you guys want to talk about.
9008762	9010082	The Skype line is open.
9010122	9014544	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9014884	9019005	I'm going to get to the tweets here in a moment, but first let me ask Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9019185	9021566	Or DarkSakura, of course, if you have anything you want to throw out as well.
9021606	9023006	No, I'm still in the middle of being disgusted.
9023322	9029867	There's some stupid stories, you've probably heard all these before, where, you know, some teenager drives cross-country to meet her boyfriend.
9030768	9039716	So, this girl, Beth Robinson, who was 13, met somebody on Xbox Live who was 12, actually 12, not necessarily a 40-year-old pretending to be 12.
9040516	9050663	and he lived in Houston and she lives in Kentucky and I guess she ended up chatting with him and then eventually stole her brother's car, her mother's ATM card and then drove to his house.
9051443	9055326	And I guess she got as far as Nashville, Tennessee before being stopped by police.
9059048	9067334	And of course, we must blame Xbox Live for this, not because her parents are retarded or she's stupid for
9069319	9092755	I have a belated FU to everyone taking a crap on Mass Effect Paragon Lost I'm sorry it looks good and I'm gonna watch the hell out of it so shut up I'll reserve judgment until the first ep's out but I'm not gonna hate on it just cause it's Vega Vega was pretty cool he's like the bro of the ship shall I do some tweets?
9093336	9094757	he's totally getting on with Cortez
9095186	9098648	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
9099209	9104572	DarkTetsuya tweets this and says, How might one acquire episode 169 from the Encore last week?
9104933	9106574	I thought y'all would be recording it.
9107174	9112638	But since you asked nicely, DarkTetsuya, talk to me offline and we'll talk.
9115860	9143000	Let's see, another tweet from Salacious Pop I know who that is Who tweets something I forgot to mention earlier on the show But it is definitely important, it's going on Rest in peace, City of Heroes That's right, Paragon Studios is closing Taking City of Heroes with it, it will be shut down by the end of the year And they got blindsided, they did not know it was coming Because one day there's a post about Oh, here's all the cool stuff coming at the end of the year And then the next day it's like, bye
9144341	9148403	No firm date yet sent for the closure, but that's kind of a bummer.
9149124	9151125	I know Alan played a lot of City of Heroes.
9151365	9152146	He was into that game.
9153006	9157169	I did not really get into it, but I saw it, and it looked good.
9159070	9161932	I guess maybe because I didn't play it is part of the reason it's closing.
9161972	9162333	I don't know.
9163493	9164514	There's a lot of people like me.
9165595	9166275	Let's go to the phones.
9166315	9167256	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9167276	9167636	Who's this?
9168437	9169477	Legend of Zaku here.
9169757	9170558	Hey, Zaku.
9170598	9171299	Long time no talk.
9171319	9171799	What's up, buddy?
9172783	9175905	Nothing much, just chilling on this sleepy Sunday.
9176245	9177146	Yeah, what's on your mind?
9177986	9180447	Just finishing off a little bit of Skyrim.
9181048	9183009	Not finishing the game, but just finish playing.
9183269	9184890	You can never finish Skyrim.
9186511	9188031	That's pretty much the story of my life.
9188172	9190613	One does not simply take an arrow to the knee.
9191468	9192649	Yeah, that whole thing.
9193810	9208021	I'm looking right now through Kotaku for a particular PAX incident that happened recently in one of the Minecraft party where basically this, apparently this pervert
9209338	9217602	Exposed himself, and more importantly, actually took the hand of a female and actually placed it on his junk.
9218042	9219042	I don't know if you heard this.
9219062	9225025	This is like a big deal for the past couple of days that I was catching up on.
9225345	9225945	Hold on, hold on.
9226386	9227086	I didn't hear what he said.
9227106	9227246	I know.
9227726	9233068	I'm going to say, before I let him finish the story, if that last thing made you mad, this will set you on fire.
9233529	9236290	This is so fucked up, this story.
9236410	9237170	Go ahead, Zaku.
9237690	9238451	Go ahead and tell us.
9238651	9239691	I got it.
9239711	9240292	I got the link.
9240332	9240932	This is bad.
9241792	9242112	Okay.
9243093	9243553	Let me see.
9244313	9247915	It was in Mojang, obviously, for Minecraft.
9248255	9249856	And this vlogger...
9251584	9255187	Who happens to have a boyfriend in the video game industry, long story short.
9255668	9261513	She was in the VIP section when a guy right there, she was just minding her own business.
9262333	9266397	And all of a sudden, a guy started off showing her pictures of...
9268638	9272581	You know, of chicks, of girls they actually took, you know, of their breasts.
9272841	9277524	Like, he actually, this guy actually took pictures of women's breasts throughout the party.
9277664	9292014	So, I mean, at first it was a bit creepy, but then it got, then he really ratcheted up when he basically exposed his penis and he grabbed her hand and placed it in his, right there, in his crotch.
9292930	9293912	The Penis Exposed
9305509	9327256	The police, your security Okay, I'm going to stop you there I'm going to stop you there Because there's a little bit of the telephone game going on here If you go to the source and read the original story Because this is the part that infuriated me She went to the security at the club And she told her friends about what was going on Because you can read this at the source She talked to the security guards And the security guards, the answer was basically like Well, what are we supposed to do about it?
9327636	9330677	Throw the fucker in jail That's what you're supposed to do
9333838	9340360	The problem is, at the end of the day, this really doesn't have anything to do with video games or what have you.
9341261	9343121	Except for the fact that it's giving us all a bad name.
9343342	9347183	It gives male gamers like myself a bad rep.
9348243	9350604	I have a girlfriend of mine.
9351064	9352685	She's an awesome gamer.
9352985	9354386	Just as hardcore as I am.
9355526	9357107	But the bottom line is that
9357907	9358708	Thank you for watching!
9378566	9389010	See, and this is just what I have to say this because I'm thinking back to my, before I hurt my ankle, I used to take a couple different styles of martial arts.
9389690	9392531	First thing that we learned is that if a guy exposes himself, you punch him in the dick.
9393571	9396714	Seriously.
9396774	9399316	That would be assault.
9401197	9403299	I don't condone that.
9403379	9409323	If it's somebody putting you in a situation, because technically he grabbed her, that could be assault.
9409503	9411265	Let us all agree.
9412186	9413266	If you grab somebody...
9414227	9421332	Without, I mean, batteries, like, if you, like, hurt them and they don't, you know, if you touch them without necessarily hurting them, that is battery.
9421372	9422093	He touched her first.
9422693	9422914	This?
9422954	9426196	Yeah, and it's sexual battery if it... Here's the deal.
9426236	9431820	You guys are going into this crazy what if, whatever, because obviously in the moment... But part of the problem is that the police couldn't do anything.
9432020	9438325	In the moment, she didn't know... If the security guards called the cops, then it would be her word against his.
9438805	9441107	And trying to sort out that mess, unless they have witnesses...
9442588	9451016	There's no way they can convict him, or at least put him in cuffs.
9452137	9458163	If there were actual witnesses that can attest to her story, then she could easily press charges.
9458243	9459464	Otherwise, a cop would just leave.
9462270	9463571	So they're going to believe him over her.
9464452	9467555	You're basically saying that they're all sexist and they're going to take his word immediately.
9468256	9472840	He said, she said, which is... Even when he's got photos of people from the post.
9473100	9473601	That's right.
9473721	9476463	He's got photos on his phone.
9476584	9480267	Don't tell me there's not going to be cameras at the club that could see what's going on.
9480427	9480828	Exactly.
9481028	9483910	But the incident, it's at the heart of the matter where...
9485011	9487832	He basically grabbed her hand into his crotch.
9488512	9493014	Unless you have someone actually seeing that, then you can't, then the cops can't really do anything.
9493294	9495014	But there is other evidence.
9495074	9498856	Phone for stuff that is just like circumstantial at best.
9499156	9500896	That doesn't mean you ignore it.
9501056	9501717	You have to.
9501737	9502417	I understand.
9502637	9504938	It was totally wrong what the security guard did.
9504958	9506298	You're not going to convince me otherwise.
9506318	9509779	If he did it to her, that's likely not the first time he's done this.
9509859	9511240	Probably in the same night.
9511260	9511920	That's a huge problem.
9513380	9516542	They would separate everybody and question all the witnesses.
9517042	9519582	Everybody in that room would be questioned if it became a big enough deal.
9520783	9524844	I'm not talking about security guards, I'm saying if police were called in.
9525004	9525785	That's legal procedure.
9525805	9527985	So basically you're saying it would be, it's acceptable.
9528285	9529446	So why are you defending them?
9534506	9535446	I'm not trying to defend them.
9535466	9539267	I'm just saying that given the circumstances that it's really hard.
9539368	9540868	It's kind of like a no-win scenario.
9540928	9549510	You either call the police and see whether or not they're able to have enough grounds to arrest him on that particular charge.
9550150	9556132	Or you do nothing and you basically get chided for inaction.
9556512	9559573	It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.
9559853	9560653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9575851	9576392	Yeah, of course.
9577152	9577553	No doubt.
9577633	9580695	I mean, but there was not that much he could have done.
9581596	9582597	He could have called the cops.
9582737	9586220	No, it's the victim's responsibility if she wants to get the police to call the police.
9586621	9588883	The security guard is there to maintain the security in the club.
9588963	9590684	He's not there to enforce the law.
9590724	9591345	That is true.
9591365	9593407	He's private.
9593587	9596550	He's not a peace officer or any sworn officer.
9597170	9600533	He can only ask them to leave, and if he assaults,
9602865	9607446	If the patron in question assaults the security guard, then yeah, he has a right to defend himself.
9607967	9611188	Other than that, he can't really physically detain them.
9611848	9620392	You can only ask them to leave, and only after that point, if they resist, and they start being aggressive, then the guard has like...
9621365	9622806	has the right to defend himself.
9623226	9625068	The security guard is not a cop.
9625248	9627009	I'm going to let you go so we can get some other calls.
9627029	9631713	Thank you very much for calling in and sharing this unfortunate story with us.
9632033	9632333	Take care.
9636296	9638598	I just... I don't know.
9639158	9640719	What does it say about our culture?
9640779	9642181	I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
9646002	9654171	I don't think, I mean, there's so many people that I just, how much of the, can we all agree, how much of this fault is hers?
9654791	9655812	Zero.
9655972	9656193	None.
9656393	9657354	Zero.
9658535	9661919	People, you don't, the behavior has to be addressed.
9661939	9662759	The guy's a sociopath.
9663881	9664161	I just,
9666762	9669145	It's something that went back and said in the chat room.
9669265	9674832	It's like, you know, we have this environment here where they're telling women, oh, well, don't dress provocatively.
9674872	9675613	You could get raped.
9675873	9679598	Or, you know, I don't care if you are out jogging by yourself.
9679618	9680259	You could get raped.
9680559	9682461	It shouldn't be don't get raped.
9682501	9683483	It should be don't rape.
9683923	9684524	Don't assault.
9687176	9696219	To Zaku's credit, and in the interest of fairness, I get where he's going kind of down this line of, you know, well, in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and da-da-da-da-da.
9697379	9700980	But all I'm saying is that an investigation needed to be done.
9701340	9702681	An investigation needed to be done.
9702761	9710483	And I do think it's on the onus of the club and, you know, the people that knew about it to make sure that investigation takes place.
9710643	9714004	It kind of sucks that this trial is all happening now on the internet.
9714654	9717677	The job of the security guard is to protect the interest of the club.
9717997	9722561	Protecting the interest of the club also includes protecting the safety of those who are there.
9722661	9723562	Yeah, you're right.
9723622	9724683	And protecting the interest of the club.
9724723	9730028	Because if I were a game company or whatever, if I was Mojang, I sure as hell wouldn't be using this club for any future event after this story.
9730828	9731629	Or nor would anybody.
9731729	9737574	And if I was the owner of the club, I would have basically ended my contract with that security firm and gotten one with a better reputation.
9737594	9739496	Sigh.
9742463	9743863	The victim does need to contact the authorities.
9743883	9744584	That's what Dan just said.
9746744	9751806	I hope the internet has made her feel like she can do that.
9751986	9753206	I don't know what else to say.
9753426	9761429	One thing that I think men need to understand is that we still live in an environment where women are basically still treated as second class citizens.
9762189	9765510	Dan's saying that's bullshit, but it happens.
9765590	9766350	It's happened to me.
9767010	9769111	You don't get it because you're a guy.
9772503	9779188	And just because you see it in the pornos where a woman catches sight of a penis and all of a sudden wants to fuck that penis, that doesn't happen in reality.
9779908	9781289	Guys, don't see it.
9781569	9788654	If you look at yourself as someone who's going to be treated second class and you allow yourself to be treated second class... It happens whether you think it's going to happen or not.
9788854	9790295	You believe that it's happening.
9790755	9792276	That's why you feel like it's happening.
9792617	9794898	No, that's exactly the problem.
9794978	9796139	Let's cut this shit off.
9796179	9797300	We'll talk about this later.
9799326	9801708	What was that last story we just talked about then?
9802309	9802889	It's happening.
9803389	9805091	What was that last story in the game industry?
9805711	9806012	It could.
9806612	9808634	I'm not even saying woman, man.
9808694	9809895	I'm saying person, person.
9810596	9812777	A person has... I said that in the last story too.
9812957	9814559	What if it was a guy?
9814579	9816801	A guy whips it out from another guy.
9816921	9817561	Same story.
9818642	9820103	I would say the exact same thing.
9820764	9822165	Or a woman doing it to another woman.
9822205	9823046	It's inappropriate.
9827352	9828152	Yeah, absolutely.
9828553	9829693	Absolutely still inappropriate.
9833854	9837935	Just because somebody doesn't tell doesn't mean there wasn't a crime.
9843237	9844117	No one can hear what you're saying.
9845017	9845517	Hold on.
9847678	9848478	That's not the point.
9848618	9850559	The point is she needs to stand up for herself.
9852503	9854143	That's how the citrus is going to get fixed.
9854223	9856624	That's how the slime ball is going to get his fucking comeuppance.
9857004	9861585	If he victimizes somebody and that victim steps up and fucking puts him down.
9861785	9864946	There is a degree of having to choose not to be a victim.
9865326	9869426	Which I don't understand why anyone would choose to keep a victim's mentality.
9871167	9872187	I don't think it's a choice.
9872447	9876208	But you have to be able to go ahead and say, look, this happened to me.
9876788	9878148	I accepted this happened to me.
9878648	9881669	And this is the action I'm going to take to rectify that.
9885898	9888760	And also pointing and laughing at his penis would have been funny too.
9888780	9890541	Because that would have probably got him to leave pretty quick.
9890561	9894563	He'd be like, tiny penis, tiny penis.
9894643	9897805	But again, hindsight is 20, hindsight is 20-20.
9898345	9901747	If you're the, hindsight is 20-20.
9902127	9905049	You know, it's easy to sit here and say, I would have done this.
9905909	9906891	Someone should have done this.
9907371	9909534	I mean, it's easy to sit here and do that.
9909574	9913138	But when it's happening to you in that moment, you don't have that luxury.
9913339	9917524	And that doesn't make what she did wrong by any means.
9918265	9923111	And we need to have a society that still protects people from having this happen to them.
9923795	9926258	Anyhow, let's move on.
9927359	9928501	Do we have a gaming story?
9928641	9933066	Let me go to Twitter because the tweets were sent in a long time ago so we might have some gaming tweets.
9933386	9937672	Although I do have to say in my defense one of the first moves I learned in karate was how to squeeze a guy's balls painfully.
9938893	9939253	Just saying.
9939634	9940135	Moving on.
9940820	9943782	Ossifer on Twitter with Mass Effect content.
9943862	9947123	That's always a good thing to help bring us back to OLR.
9948244	9950886	Ossifer says, just started Final Fantasy 13 too.
9951666	9953367	And yeah, Final Fantasy 13 too.
9953407	9957089	And I freaked out a little when I saw DLC for N7 armor for the main characters.
9958430	9959030	That's true.
9959070	9962891	There was some really awesome DLC in Final Fantasy XIII too that incorporated the games.
9963171	9965252	Wasn't there Assassin's Creed DLC as well?
9965852	9966352	I think so.
9968152	9968593	Let's see.
9968793	9969813	Other tweets.
9969873	9970933	A couple from Tigerclaw.
9971193	9979915	Bethesda currently has no plans for Wii U. According to an article on GameSpot that Tigerclaw has linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
9980215	9986397	It's not loading for me right now, but I do remember reading something similar to this earlier in the week that basically right now Bethesda's got nothing in the pipeline for Wii U.
9987057	9997164	I don't think that necessarily means... I don't think they really have anything in the pipeline beyond... I don't know, they just released... Surely there's something, we just don't know about it.
9997205	9999046	I mean, there's something being done, but nothing that they've announced.
9999066	10005230	Any future titles that Bethesda's really announced that have yet to come out.
10005250	10009153	I mean, they have Dishonored coming out, but that's pretty much it.
10009513	10014217	I guess if you count ZeniMax releasing the Doom 3 BFG edition...
10014698	10022478	but aside from stuff beyond 2012 there really isn't anything that's been announced yet so yeah I guess that's a true statement
10024099	10026940	Alright, another tweet from TigerClaw about Double Fine.
10026980	10030422	Double Fine turns an iOS slip-up into an accidental beta test.
10030442	10036385	He links us to a clip on Gamasutra about... This is not the big Kickstarter thing.
10036725	10040347	It's a free-to-play superhero management game called Middle Manager of Justice.
10041667	10042828	Okay, you have to admit that's kind of funny.
10043688	10047410	It's a mobile title coming from Double Fine, obviously, because it's on iOS.
10048270	10048751	Here's the thing.
10048811	10051132	The game was not supposed to be out for several weeks...
10051752	10053313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10075610	10086981	Once we submitted the game, we realized we had a lot of things we still needed to tweak and fix, but at the same time, we didn't want to remove it from the submission process in case Apple catches other things we need to take care of, and we didn't want to do a double submission.
10088923	10093547	At least they're trying to make lemonade out of lemons on getting the stuff released early.
10094608	10095568	That's it for Twitter tonight.
10095688	10096769	One last call for calls.
10096789	10100089	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10100729	10103970	Although I can't fault people for not wanting to follow that last topic of discussion.
10105871	10108731	Obviously, there's been a lot of debate on a lot of topics tonight.
10109131	10111732	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a great place.
10111992	10113872	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10113912	10118634	We don't want it just to be the four of us in the studio and those of you in the chat room and so forth.
10118674	10120474	We want everybody to be able to have their say.
10120894	10124437	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to get your two cents in.
10124897	10129620	Of course, there's always Facebook and Twitter as well, Google Plus and what have you.
10130501	10131622	Skype line ain't lighting up.
10132362	10133864	I guess that means I'm going to go ahead and close it.
10134404	10135365	We'll try again next week.
10136425	10138127	In the meantime, I guess that does it for the show tonight.
10138627	10140688	We did all last-minute stories or do we have any more, Loki?
10141549	10142310	Not really anything.
10142410	10142630	I mean...
10144795	10145655	This week will be interesting.
10145896	10156680	Yeah, this coming week is going to be very interesting between the iPhone 5 and the... A possible iPad mini or... I don't know if we'll see that, but before the holidays.
10156700	10159201	What do you think of the new Kindles that they have coming out?
10159361	10160242	Any of those look interesting?
10160302	10162923	I didn't really read up on them enough because we already have a Kindle.
10162963	10164163	I'm not really in the market for a new one.
10164183	10169806	The only one that sounded interesting was... I'm not in the market for a tablet at all, but I like how they're doing their data plan.
10170426	10176628	It's the Kindle Fire HD, the one that has a 9-inch screen or whatever.
10177188	10186852	But the 4G one has a $50 a year data plan, 250 megabytes a month data you get with that.
10187512	10188593	for $50 a year.
10188693	10189453	That's not bad.
10189593	10204563	I mean, if you're not using a ton of data, unless you're streaming... For me, I normally wouldn't use that much data, but I do stream Pandora, so I've used up like 600, 700 megabytes this month, but that's like the most I've ever used.
10204583	10207124	I don't know.
10207264	10208145	It looked interesting.
10211161	10215602	But, you know, we'll see with the Google Nexus and stuff being the same, you know, $199.
10215642	10220864	They did drop the original Kindle Fire down to $160, though, to try to kind of undercut Google a little bit.
10220924	10223164	But still, you're getting a better spec machine for $199.
10223304	10225825	Can't you flash those or something?
10226125	10227505	You can flash any Android system.
10227946	10229046	Any of those can be jailbroken.
10230226	10230466	Huh.
10230906	10232567	Yeah, my wife's Nook's jailbroken.
10233827	10234327	It's kind of fun.
10234347	10236148	You can get to do a bunch of shit that it's not supposed to.
10236428	10236628	Oh, yeah?
10236648	10236928	Like what?
10237897	10246060	Well, they don't have the Google Play Store on the Nook, so I added that with an optional bootloader and stuff on there, and so she can do that.
10246100	10250141	Plus, if she wanted to, she could pirate apps for it.
10250341	10255523	I didn't do that, but it mainly was for the other app store.
10255803	10257104	So I'm like, okay, so you can get other apps.
10257144	10258704	She's like, I don't want to get other apps.
10260545	10262165	Fine, I did that all for nothing then.
10263006	10264186	Yeah.
10265543	10268805	All right, I guess that's it for... Someone call, please.
10268825	10269826	No, I shut the skyline.
10269866	10270226	It's done.
10270246	10270686	Oh, dang it.
10270826	10271747	I want something happy.
10271887	10273008	Well, we're after 9 o'clock.
10273028	10274148	Dan's going to take me to Pinkberry.
10274368	10275369	That's a happy subject.
10275509	10276370	Pinkberry's always a good thing.
10276690	10279912	I was very sad, though, they did not respond to our tweet from Pinkberry last week.
10279932	10280512	I know.
10280732	10282013	When we didn't have a show, you and I went there.
10282033	10288297	We celebrated the show by going shopping for candles in the mall at Yankee Candle, and then went to Pinkberry, and it was wonderful.
10288557	10292960	And Dan had made some type of comment like, oh, even when you guys aren't supposed to be hanging out, you're hanging out...
10294963	10295223	Yep.
10297205	10300067	Well, he didn't call, so I gotta put this out there.
10301088	10304231	Don't know if he's listening, but if he is, Ranma, stay black.
10305757	10333170	I think he just joined us not that long ago so there you go I was just talking to him in private message so about private things I know right alright anyhow we're gonna wrap up the show Dan thank you very much for being here tonight and bringing your always controversial opinions I mean that in a great way to the program and best of all the fights we all love it and keep on blasting keep on blasting Dan do you have any last words for our listeners tonight final thoughts stay black everyone will do
10334661	10336242	DarkSakura, you're his wife.
10336262	10336923	Why don't you go next?
10337143	10337864	Your final thought tonight.
10338304	10338985	Fuck bitches.
10339805	10340246	I'm kidding.
10341607	10341787	Yeah.
10341827	10343308	Because dudes can be bitches too.
10344690	10345090	You know what?
10345330	10346551	Sociopaths need to be locked up.
10346631	10347032	End of story.
10349076	10357822	My final thought is I want to thank Alan for getting me Clue on Blu-ray because it's about time I have such an amazing movie on Blu-ray.
10357902	10360924	And if you haven't seen Clue from the 1980s, you're doing yourself a disservice.
10360964	10363846	They rerun it on TV all the time and it's a cult classic.
10364586	10366047	1 plus 2 plus 2 plus 1 is?
10367888	10369229	Please, there are ladies present.
10370109	10371090	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10371730	10372551	Go play Minecraft.
10374555	10375476	Join the VOG server
10393184	10396165	You can basically log in with that.
10396305	10404628	It's a patched proxy server or something like that that you run the client through.
10405008	10408109	But it will only connect to what they call cracked servers.
10408229	10413390	Cracked servers are where they have the mode online toggled to false instead of true.
10413490	10414731	I have mine on true right now.
10415171	10422533	However, yesterday when their authentication server went down, I had it toggled to false so I could log in still without having to authenticate it.
10423833	10426434	Technically, there's some security holes if you leave it to false.
10427034	10435737	People can spoof stuff, but being that we're a closed-knit group, I could set it to false, but I'm going to stick to the true right now.
10436617	10436937	All right.
10437717	10442759	We want to thank you guys, as always, for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and showing us your support.
10443059	10444239	We are an indie podcast.
10444279	10449661	We don't have a giant website or commercial backing or what have you, so all we have is word of mouth.
10449981	10451362	Please tell people about the show.
10451962	10452703	And you know what?
10452723	10454344	Spread the word of other indie podcasts.
10454484	10459307	You know, at vognetwork.com, there's a lot of great indie podcasts, and there's a lot of great indie podcasts all over the internet.
10459667	10460768	Help spread the word, guys.
10460828	10461929	It's all we got.
10461949	10462489	Hey, Rob.
10462649	10465491	The podcasting scene won't die unless you guys let it.
10465991	10466952	We want oral love.
10467832	10468713	A-U-R-A-L, right?
10468993	10469173	No.
10470314	10471034	Oral, with mouth.
10472355	10473216	Right, all right, whatever.
10474296	10475157	Spread the love.
10475617	10476758	That's something I can get behind.
10477659	10478279	Or in front of.
10481001	10482241	We'll talk to you guys next week.
10482281	10485483	Thank you guys for staying up late with us and participating with the show.
10485503	10486223	We'll see you next time.
10486503	10488424	Big week next week with the Nintendo Conference.
10488464	10489144	Be ready for it.
10489684	10491485	I'm sure Loki's going to have a lot to say.
10491505	10493646	I'm ready to be underwhelmed.
10493666	10494566	Is your body ready?
10494946	10495807	Oh, my body's ready.
10495907	10496887	What time is it at?
10496907	10500028	Because I know it's on... Is it in the morning?
10500249	10500649	In the morning.
10501349	10504250	I'll be live tweeting all my snarky shit.
10504570	10506531	I mean, we'll see if this is actually impressive.
10506671	10507832	Another live blog.
10507992	10508572	I can't wait.
10509099	10511200	It's gonna be with, what the hell is this shit?
10511460	10512001	What the fuck?
10512101	10512481	What the crap?
10512501	10516503	We need to talk to Bobby real quick and see if there's a way to incorporate that into VOG Network.
10517283	10523927	There's all these live streaming software, live blogging software things, but I'm at work at that time, so we'll see.
10524147	10525027	Excuse me.
10525168	10527909	Alright, so your body is ready for the press conference.
10528939	10530280	My body's ready for disappointment.
10530600	10531101	Seriously.
10532161	10533542	And the iOS conference as well.
10533723	10538186	Yes, the iPhone and iPad is gaming, so I'm curious to see what the next thing is.
10539066	10539987	So we'll see them next week.
10540487	10541248	Have a good week, everybody.
10541368	10545671	Are they going to call it the new iPad or the new iPod or the new iPhone?
10545711	10546732	Because that would be hilarious.
10546792	10547112	We'll see.
10547212	10547413	All right.
10547893	10548894	Lastly, lastly.
10549935	10550555	Oh, my God.
10551116	10551476	Oh, my God.
10551596	10552457	Actdeft reminded us.
10552897	10553798	We didn't even talk about it.
10554659	10556721	You finally dressed as Tingle.
10557181	10560284	And we didn't even talk about it on tonight's show because it was like a week ago at this point.
10561425	10563026	Quickly, tell us about the Tingle thing.
10563627	10566069	I finally won that contest, the retweet thing.
10566149	10568471	So she drew me as Tingle.
10568872	10569953	That's the closest you're going to get.
10572231	10573672	And they did hit their goal.
10574092	10578617	So Evilot is going to get their orchestra soundtrack now.
10578697	10579617	So that's pretty awesome.
10579918	10580558	Congrats.
10581059	10582400	But yeah, she's awesome.
10582420	10584002	Beatrix is awesome.
10584082	10586304	And she drew a wonderful picture of me.
10586764	10591008	And my wife said, you should have used that to get a picture of Josh.
10591108	10593570	I'm like, crap.
10593650	10594731	But, you know, whatever.
10595372	10596333	Nah, the one he used is funnier.
10596713	10597314	You know what?
10597354	10598756	First of all, how old is your son now?
10598796	10598956	Two?
10599196	10599316	Two.
10599336	10600117	He'll look different.
10600137	10601058	He wouldn't appreciate it.
10601979	10602740	We'd appreciate it.
10603201	10605964	Like for five seconds and then his attention span would go off to something else.
10605984	10608327	You need to make your Twitter picture or something so we can see it.
10608968	10609268	Alright.
10609769	10610590	Have a great week everybody.
10610610	10611911	We really are closing down shop now.
10611931	10612332	See you next week.
10613228	10616250	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
