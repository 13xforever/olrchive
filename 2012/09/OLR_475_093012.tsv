7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	Tonight, September 30th, 2012. EA cancels a major sports title. DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros. 2.
22000	27000	And can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 475 of our program for this September the 30th of 2012.
47000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and all that good stuff.
54000	58000	With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura.
58000	60000	Hi. How you doing, Jamie?
60000	63000	I'm caffeinated, thank you.
63000	65000	You had two cups of coffee.
65000	72000	Yes. I've made a new rule, by the way. The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.
72000	76000	What's your thing against sports ball? Some people like sports ball.
76000	78000	Boring!
78000	80000	We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.
80000	82000	Boring!
82000	85000	I like rugby. And I like real football.
85000	91000	There was a comment that actdeft made this week. I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG network post.
91000	94000	But he said, yes I am a hater and I am hating.
94000	96000	And that's you right now.
96000	98000	I agree with that. I agree with that.
98000	101000	I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.
101000	103000	Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
103000	104000	Hi.
104000	105000	How you doing, Loki?
105000	106000	Doing good.
106000	107000	Awesome. What's new with you?
107000	109000	Um, Minecraft.
109000	111000	Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?
111000	116000	Yeah, and I played no Minecraft. I played Borderlands 2.
116000	117000	Okay.
117000	120000	Which is sadly the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
120000	123000	Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
123000	126000	My wife's been occupying TV so I've been occupying Minecraft.
126000	129000	Well, not a problem. It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.
129000	133000	Yeah. There's actually people on now. I see people when I go on there.
133000	136000	Nice, nice. And I hear they've been defacing my house.
136000	138000	My little, or my shack.
138000	147000	We haven't been defacing it. We've been, um, applying temporary tenants.
149000	152000	Interesting. Would you fill my house with creepers?
152000	154000	No. That would be destructive.
154000	161000	Alright. Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.
161000	166000	So, um, yeah. What else do I want to say? Oh, this poster came, right?
166000	167000	Yeah.
167000	169000	This was from that guy who called in last week, right?
169000	170000	Yeah.
170000	172000	I think it was. Can I see it? Can I open this?
172000	173000	Yeah, go ahead.
173000	175000	No, Rob, you're physically incapable.
175000	178000	Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.
178000	183000	It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.
183000	185000	It's stuck in there. Hold on.
185000	187000	Open the other side.
187000	191000	That's still awesome. I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.
191000	192000	Okay.
192000	195000	It's called, I call it Disco Panda.
195000	202000	And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.
202000	211000	And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mr. Pandaria. So it was Disco Pandas.
211000	213000	That poster's rad, by the way.
213000	216000	Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
216000	217000	I guess.
218000	221000	What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
221000	224000	I can do that in a minute when we get into gaming weeks.
224000	226000	So just give me a little bit of time.
226000	231000	Let's see. Before we get into gaming weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic as we usually do.
231000	236000	A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral.
236000	239000	And it wasn't really intentional for that to happen.
239000	243000	But apparently a lot of media companies, for whatever reason, aren't really covering this.
243000	245000	Because it has to do with the indie community.
245000	249000	And I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community.
249000	252000	But this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.
252000	254000	Now remember when XNA Games first came out?
254000	260000	I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA.
260000	264000	And there's been some good and there's been some not good.
264000	269000	In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.
269000	274000	Obviously we're a little partial to YYR in some of his efforts, like Bungie ferret tossing and so forth.
274000	279000	I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on.
279000	282000	Like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.
282000	284000	I made a game with zombies in it.
284000	286000	Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.
286000	288000	The Breath of Death and all that started on XNA, right?
288000	291000	Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was on there, that was pretty good.
291000	297000	There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.
297000	299000	Right, and then there's the bad.
300000	305000	The controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.
305000	307000	Okay, so all these things fill niches.
307000	312000	It's the fart app that you'll find on the iPhone, I mean it's that whole thing.
312000	318000	And then you get the really weird stuff, like the launch a baby from your vag game.
318000	320000	It's funny.
320000	323000	It's hilarious for like three seconds, but it's a little bit strange.
323000	326000	What is it, Techno Kitten Adventure?
327000	330000	Yeah, oh yeah, Techno Kitten Adventure started there.
330000	334000	That was that interview and everything, which I think he sold it to somebody, but anyway.
334000	341000	My point is, there's been some good, there's been some not so good, but overall we've seen some things born from there.
341000	344000	So why did Microsoft just suddenly stop paying attention to it?
344000	346000	Here's the deal, here's what's going on.
346000	350000	There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com, very well done from Bobby.
350000	354000	He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.
354000	362000	So we spent some time shedding a little light on it for people, and it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.
362000	367000	Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.
367000	372000	They used to be able to generate 50 review codes, and it's broken.
372000	376000	No press release saying they took it away, maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly,
376000	381000	because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.
381000	383000	I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.
383000	389000	I can't believe it's a super major bug that can't be fixed with a day's worth of work if they would allocate somebody to it.
389000	392000	But that hasn't happened, and it's been going on a couple weeks now.
392000	398000	YYR, who did Bungee Ferret Tossing, the OLR game, can't get review codes generated for it.
398000	404000	And that sucks, because that's one way that your game gets out there on the internet, is the reviews on websites.
404000	407000	And people would see it go, Bungee Ferret Tossing, what's this?
408000	413000	And then they check it out, and that's how YYR can make sales on his game.
413000	418000	But now, a lot of that is stifled, because Microsoft has this bug on the site.
418000	420000	It's not just affecting him.
420000	427000	These big indie games, or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing,
427000	434000	which is the indie answer to Microsoft Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree, or whatever the hell they call those things,
434000	440000	which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.
440000	444000	Remember when Microsoft said, oh yeah, we're gonna promote XNA games?
444000	446000	Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice?
446000	450000	Actually, there have been a few that were going to be indie games, and then didn't.
450000	454000	Like, Dust and Elysian Tail, or whatever, that was gonna be an indie game.
454000	458000	And there was also a few that have been in these contests that they do.
458000	463000	I don't remember what it's called, but they've been promoted from there, too.
464000	470000	Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chat room, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be.
470000	476000	He says, not just for review, but for giveaways. Ever wonder why VoG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferretossing?
476000	481000	Perfect example. We can't give it to you for free. Although, seriously, guys, it's one fucking dollar.
481000	487000	And it is a really fun game, so, just, you know, you probably have the points left over in your wallet.
487000	491000	But, yeah, and SSJ100Matt says you would think they want to get this fixed.
491000	494000	They're promoting games that they profit off of, and that's the weird thing.
494000	500000	It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this, but, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money?
500000	504000	Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games or selling it?
504000	508000	Well, then, do something about it. Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games.
508000	514000	Oh, is there too much crap indie games that's bogging down the system so people don't want to go find the stellar indie games?
514000	516000	Fix it!
516000	522000	This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console. I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.
522000	525000	It'd be a little sad if that was the case. Or maybe it's-
525000	531000	I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and, of course, they don't want people developing apps for it.
531000	540000	And probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow, so, you know, wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?
540000	548000	You know, indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam and, oh, a lot more sales there!
548000	566000	It's just a bummer that it had such potential to be so awesome to let people kind of control what was going on on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side and it's just kind of gone.
566000	573000	So, um, Brakeman in our chat says there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games. There are. It's-
573000	579000	What went wrong with this? Why is this not doing better? Loki, any thoughts?
579000	589000	Because they haven't done anything with it. They haven't really- they haven't promoted it. They hid it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.
589000	595000	So, it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out, they did.
595000	601000	Sj100Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.
601000	614000	Well, but like YYR, he's been doing Bungie Ferretossing for two years, you know, and two years ago, XNA looked, you know, a lot better than maybe it does now, so it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.
614000	629000	I've always thought, though, and I could be wrong, I am not a developer, I've not made games, I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff from XNA on Xbox to PC. Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?
629000	630000	I think so.
630000	632000	So, I don't know, maybe-
632000	638000	Well, because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that, yeah, it's probably pretty easy to, you know, port it over.
638000	657000	I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC, like for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the gib tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.
657000	658000	That's cool.
658000	661000	So, the programming there is pretty much the same.
661000	679000	I used to love editing files, like I remember Civilization 1 on the PC, like a bunch of the scripting ran off text files, so as long as- like there were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were kind of within the boundaries, you could like get the Queen of England to like, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.
679000	690000	I'm gonna declare war on your ass. You could like, change things and do a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious. Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.
692000	710000	Anyhow, going to more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, because of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.
710000	717000	There's articles there too, there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life, but there will be more very soon.
717000	720000	Meanwhile, Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort.
721000	727000	Let's see, WhatUpG says, by that I mean the big budget games, the ones that seem to get more press, etc.
727000	731000	Microsoft is more about the AAA games, is the comment that preceded that.
731000	737000	So, maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games, I don't know.
737000	741000	Not that a lot of those end up being very good all the time, but whatever.
742000	752000	Anyhow, let's talk about our gaming weeks, and the video games that we have been playing this week, and whether they be indie, or AAA, or whatever the case may be.
752000	758000	We'll start with Dark Soccer, I bet you all can predict her week, I bet you all can think about it. What is it?
758000	773000	I played Mass Effect 3, and played Pandas, I've made Rob over 10,000 gold, selling gems, in less than a week.
773000	785000	So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion, it's been slow, slow, slow, and I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level.
785000	803000	Which is fine, I mean, I do have other things going on. But yeah, it was a lot of Pandas. It was Pandemonium. Yeah, that's it.
803000	810000	How do you feel about the new expansion? I know this isn't Horde House, but it is a major PC game release.
811000	821000	Slow. I really like the areas, and I really like the music when it's not, oh my god, Disco Pandas going on over it. Because, like I said earlier, Dan's been playing Borderlands 2.
821000	827000	Which makes me want to throw up. It's pretty, it looks like fun, I would be so sick.
828000	837000	I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit.
837000	849000	Which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly. But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City, and just hands out Justice stuff.
849000	856000	You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.
856000	858000	That's stupid!
858000	866000	So it's going to take a little time, but this, well, I can see why they did that, because they said there's not enough to do at 90.
866000	880000	So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do. There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.
880000	886000	I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90, I've had too much going on in my personal life, I can't sit there and just grind to 90.
886000	888000	I'm just 88.
888000	890000	I know, I know, I know.
890000	892000	And Shane's already got a 90.
892000	896000	Yeah, most of my guild, raiding guild, already has 90s.
896000	898000	Some of us have lives.
898000	904000	I don't like to say it that way, because I know Shane has a life and what have you.
904000	908000	But we have other stuff going on that isn't OMG Pandas.
908000	910000	Some of us have Mass Effect to play.
910000	912000	Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.
912000	920000	Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog. I want a corgi bull.
920000	923000	You're silly. Alright, let's move on. I'll talk about-
923000	927000	And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.
927000	931000	I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my gaming week, but Loki, go ahead.
931000	938000	So I played Borderlands 2 last week. Well, kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show.
938000	942000	So I've been playing that and leveling up my assassin.
942000	946000	And the game's pretty fun. I'm digging it.
946000	951000	I wish I could play it a little bit more. I want to play it a bit more this week, take a little break from Minecraft.
951000	956000	Since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week.
956000	959000	And of course we switched the server over to creative, so it's been fun.
959000	963000	Everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things.
963000	968000	I haven't really finished my castle, but I'm taking a break from it. I think it's pretty much done.
968000	977000	I've got all the grounds done. I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens.
977000	982000	I built an underground blacksmithing thing.
982000	985000	Farmer Loki had a farm. E-I-E-I-O.
986000	992000	I'm just trying to think of things to put on the ground so that I'd have something there.
992000	995000	It's a big open space. So I have that all pretty much done.
995000	999000	I just have to fill the rooms with stuff. I haven't done that yet.
999000	1005000	I've been taking a break from it to do other things. Explore and build other things.
1005000	1011000	So yeah, I think that's pretty much it this week. That's all I played. Those two things.
1011000	1016000	Alright, my gaming week. I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.
1016000	1022000	When I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year,
1022000	1030000	that's at least the goal is to do Disney detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.
1030000	1035000	If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.
1035000	1044000	But anyway, as far as video games that I have been playing, I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time.
1044000	1053000	I love the music. I love the scenery. I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world,
1053000	1058000	all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast. There's so much to do.
1058000	1063000	I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.
1063000	1068000	In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit,
1068000	1072000	is I don't like that they made it not possible really. I mean, you can.
1072000	1077000	But they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it.
1077000	1082000	But they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore,
1082000	1085000	which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it.
1085000	1091000	But I guess to match the style of the fact that you have to get reputation with all these factions
1091000	1095000	to get the end game rewards, you have to do a little bit of questing, so whatever.
1095000	1103000	But anyway, I will elaborate more on my thoughts on this week's Hoard House, www.hoardhouse.com.
1103000	1108000	Another game that I checked out this week though for a little bit, I only played this in between the time
1108000	1113000	that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.
1113000	1120000	And that is Torchlight 2. Torchlight 2 is released and it is available on Steam.
1120000	1126000	And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam
1126000	1131000	and probably other places too that I'm not thinking of. I just own it on both places.
1131000	1136000	It's basically Diablo. It's a lot of the same people that made Diablo 1 and 2 made this game.
1136000	1143000	It's kind of like a reimagining of that whole thing, although obviously it's a little more DungeonCrawler
1143000	1146000	and a little less Satan. It's not Diablo.
1147000	1155000	Torchlight 2 is out and it has kind of a different feel right off the bat because you're not dipping right into a dungeon.
1155000	1160000	Like you do in Diablo or like you did in the first Torchlight. A lot of it is taking place in the outworld
1160000	1167000	or the outside, outdoors, very grassy areas. It's not to say that there aren't dungeons at all,
1167000	1172000	but I noticed right off the bat that a lot of the scenery is very varied.
1172000	1176000	I love some of the class design in Torchlight 2 is great as well.
1176000	1180000	Like I play this dual-wielding gun chick and she's a lot of fun.
1180000	1188000	I've had a real joy playing it and dare I say, I kind of had more fun with it and I've been more interested in that than Diablo 3.
1190000	1197000	So I don't know really what that says, but yeah, Torchlight 2, big fan. Thumbs up.
1197000	1202000	And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet
1202000	1207000	and you can also be in the same room and do internet that way. There's the LAN is in there.
1207000	1211000	None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.
1211000	1214000	That is a great word. Fuckery.
1214000	1220000	Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word too. That was total fuckery.
1220000	1227000	And this had very little fuckery. Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day,
1227000	1232000	but it didn't really ruin the experience. It was a good time.
1232000	1237000	ActDeft says, internet multiplayer? Wow. Well, the first game didn't have it.
1237000	1242000	So there you go. Let's see, and Ray Deer in our chat room says,
1242000	1246000	I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now. Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.
1246000	1253000	So yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.
1253000	1259000	So if you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.
1259000	1263000	It's going up and down a little bit. So I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off
1263000	1267000	so that way we don't hiccup. But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.
1267000	1270000	Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.
1270000	1274000	I closed Dropbox, right? Sometimes big files come in through there. Yeah, that's closed.
1274000	1280000	So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on. Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.
1280000	1288000	Torchlight 2 and Pandaria. And Disney games. Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, Dark Soccer?
1288000	1295000	Because in chat, Brakeman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland, in my country we have a word for you.
1295000	1299000	Liar. And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.
1300000	1312000	You know what, Rob? I have faith in you. And if you don't, if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.
1312000	1315000	I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.
1315000	1318000	Okay.
1318000	1322000	Oh boohoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here.
1322000	1329000	No, stop. Alright. Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping.
1329000	1334000	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1334000	1339000	And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio.
1339000	1344000	We'll get to the FUGL question of the week a little later. But before we get to that, some news!
1344000	1347000	Loki's starting us off with the gaming news this week.
1347000	1357000	Alright. So, this is a little shocking. Not entirely shocking, I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA.
1357000	1365000	And this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, on the 27th.
1365000	1370000	Seriously, kind of out of nowhere. I mean, it was being delayed for a while.
1370000	1376000	You may remember they tried relaunching the whole franchise with NBA Elite 11 back in 2010.
1376000	1383000	And that got pulled right before it shipped the stores. Actually, some of them did ship the stores.
1383000	1388000	And I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.
1388000	1396000	And they were going to kind of, they took a break last year and then this year they were going to try launching it again with NBA Live 13.
1396000	1401000	And once again, they just cancelled it before you even got a chance to get sent out.
1401000	1406000	And this was literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website.
1406000	1410000	Their executive vice president, Andrew Wilson, just wrote,
1410000	1420000	Hey, it's cancelled and here's why. Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.
1421000	1430000	So, I don't know. It's interesting, but I think at this point, you know, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game.
1430000	1434000	And from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying,
1434000	1438000	Hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.
1438000	1444000	Maybe if it was that terrible, I mean, this far into the development cycle, then,
1444000	1451000	God, I don't know if next year's going to be any different. I mean, we may run into the exact same situation again with NBA Live 14.
1451000	1455000	And at that point, I mean, NBA 2K is going to be so far ahead.
1455000	1458000	I don't even know if they'll be able to catch up with their market share.
1458000	1466000	I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally new NBA game.
1466000	1469000	You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.
1469000	1476000	I did like it, though, because I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.
1476000	1484000	One of the first comments I read on the Asports.com site was like,
1484000	1487000	I'm going to kill your family. I'm going to kill all the employees.
1487000	1490000	I'll burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA Live.
1490000	1496000	Call the Popo on that. Why do people feel like they could just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?
1496000	1503000	I'm about to go down a much bigger path on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get hurt.
1503000	1508000	Well, there's Facebook, too, but I hate the anonymity that the Internet gives us sometimes.
1508000	1514000	Like, really? You're going to kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game? Really? Really? Really?
1514000	1516000	Geez.
1516000	1518000	Why don't we just set them all on fire?
1518000	1521000	How are you being any better by saying that?
1521000	1526000	Calm down, woman.
1526000	1528000	Hey, I said it very calmly.
1528000	1530000	Anyhow.
1530000	1536000	I don't know. I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.
1536000	1539000	They're just like, meh. Not surprised.
1539000	1541000	And honestly, I'm not surprised either.
1541000	1548000	I thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet and the game was scheduled for October.
1548000	1555000	I kind of thought that you would have a little something. So, yeah. Not a big shocker.
1555000	1560000	Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?
1560000	1569000	There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision because if the game was going to suck
1569000	1575000	or was just going to be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then good on them for making the right decision.
1576000	1583000	Because there's a story later about maybe a not-so-great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.
1583000	1585000	I found that comment finally. It was funny.
1585000	1588000	You've got to be fucking kidding me. We stuck our neck out for you.
1588000	1594000	We've been fans of you guys for years getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.
1594000	1596000	I swear, if there's no game that...
1596000	1599000	Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.
1599000	1606000	There's no game that released this year. I'm killing every employee in EA slash NBA Live building, dude.
1606000	1612000	I'm so heartbroken, literally. I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.
1612000	1620000	I can't believe we're stuck playing with only one game after you guys have three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.
1620000	1626000	If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.
1626000	1633000	I need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid writes that comment.
1633000	1641000	Of course. But I just think it's funny that people think that you don't have to play a new NBA game.
1641000	1647000	It's not like, oh shit. It's not like choosing a president or something like that. A choice needs to be made.
1647000	1652000	It's just, you know, you can play that same NBA game that you have.
1652000	1658000	Oh, well, I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.
1658000	1663000	Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?
1663000	1669000	It's supposed to be fun. Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.
1669000	1673000	I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.
1673000	1675000	So...
1675000	1677000	We actually got a copy of that.
1677000	1679000	Did you? Why did you get a copy of it?
1679000	1680000	Why not?
1680000	1682000	Because my boss had one in his office.
1682000	1683000	Baller Beats!
1683000	1685000	And I laughed at it. I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.
1685000	1686000	I'll play it.
1686000	1689000	No, it's... No. No, we're not.
1689000	1696000	Alright. Alright, I guess... Oh, I want to ask about the 2K game. Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?
1696000	1700000	Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?
1700000	1701000	Jay-Z.
1701000	1703000	Well, I was just talking...
1703000	1704000	I'm looking forward to that.
1704000	1708000	Well, hold on. I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.
1708000	1711000	About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.
1711000	1714000	Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.
1714000	1718000	And, you know, say what you will about her music and so forth, but...
1718000	1721000	I mean, that woman is a well-oiled pop machine.
1721000	1725000	She's putting out so many albums. She puts out an album a year.
1725000	1729000	And all these music videos, wins all these Grammys, has all these catchy songs written for her.
1729000	1733000	You know, whether it might be your cup of tea or not, you can't ignore that she writes some really...
1733000	1738000	Or, she doesn't write, probably, but she has some really good pop music that she puts out.
1738000	1742000	And, yet again, she's got like another new album coming out this year. It's crazy.
1742000	1746000	Like, Jay-Z is working her and she's an extraordinarily famous woman.
1746000	1748000	Just like a pimp.
1748000	1749000	Hey, if Jay-Z...
1749000	1750000	Work your best hoe.
1750000	1751000	If... Shut up.
1751000	1759000	If Jay-Z can make 2K basketball, like, if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music,
1759000	1761000	I actually think it could be a really good thing.
1761000	1764000	He's not doing shit. All he's doing is picking up the soundtrack.
1764000	1769000	Ooh. Fucking awesome.
1769000	1772000	I mean, whatever. You know, that's cool.
1772000	1776000	I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care,
1776000	1780000	because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.
1780000	1781000	I mean, that's it.
1781000	1787000	I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.
1787000	1794000	Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out, and then it was like, ehhh. Not so exciting.
1794000	1799000	Why does the chat room think I said pot music? I said pop music.
1799000	1801000	Pot music would be like...
1801000	1802000	Fog Hat.
1802000	1806000	It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews Band. That's pot music.
1806000	1810000	Fog Hat.
1810000	1812000	And maybe a little bit Journey, too.
1812000	1816000	I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once, and damn, I think I got a contact high.
1816000	1818000	Anyway, back to games.
1818000	1824000	Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way, because you know, Motorola, although it is really Google,
1824000	1831000	they got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s,
1831000	1833000	among some other Microsoft devices.
1833000	1837000	This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.
1837000	1842000	It's actually owned by Motorola. It's licensed for use in MS devices.
1843000	1845000	Now, here's the interesting thing.
1845000	1850000	It's been ruled in the US that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.
1850000	1855000	Well, now why would the US talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?
1855000	1861000	Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the US.
1861000	1866000	So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the US law.
1866000	1868000	And the court's ruling says, quote,
1868000	1874000	At bottom, this case is a private dispute under Washington state contract law between two US corporations.
1874000	1880000	So if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here, you're okay.
1880000	1885000	So, like, if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three-year warranty, you're okay.
1885000	1887000	You can still get one.
1887000	1889000	Phew.
1889000	1893000	Well, technically, they wouldn't be selling it. They would just be shipping a replacement.
1893000	1898000	No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.
1898000	1900000	Because, you know, that's what happens to people now.
1900000	1904000	It used to be that they'd red ring after a week and that's just part of like growing up.
1904000	1908000	Well, they don't red ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of...
1908000	1910000	Did you say that was just part of growing up?
1910000	1912000	Yes.
1912000	1914000	Because every Xbox...
1914000	1916000	You take the good, you take the bad.
1916000	1921000	Yes, you take the good, you take the bad and you take them both and there you have a 360.
1921000	1923000	360?
1923000	1925000	Stop.
1925000	1930000	You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the robot chicken thing where they did...
1930000	1932000	Never mind.
1932000	1934000	No, no, okay.
1934000	1936000	One chick's on Survivor.
1936000	1938000	Which one, Tootie?
1938000	1940000	Blair, on Survivor.
1940000	1944000	They are really, really stretching for celebrities.
1944000	1946000	You and your reality shows, Rob.
1946000	1948000	I know, what can I say, I'm a whore for trash reality shows.
1948000	1950000	You have a problem.
1950000	1952000	We have a commercial for the next Xbox.
1954000	1956000	You take the good, you take the bad.
1956000	1958000	You take them both and there you have...
1958000	1960000	The 720.
1960000	1962000	The 720.
1962000	1964000	There's a time you gotta go and show your...
1966000	1968000	There's a time you get to play...
1968000	1971000	Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.
1971000	1973000	What?
1973000	1975000	Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.
1975000	1977000	What was her name?
1977000	1979000	I just remembered she was Tootie.
1980000	1983000	I'm probably gonna horribly mispronounce this name, but it's Entitlitis.
1983000	1986000	Inflammation of the entitlement.
1986000	1990000	Entitlitis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.
1990000	1992000	You never forget.
1992000	1994000	Did the red ring come after the blowjob?
1996000	1998000	That would be a whole other problem.
1998000	2000000	That means you need to go see a doctor.
2000000	2002000	Yes, Kim Fields, that was her. Thank you, Rama.
2002000	2004000	I knew Rama would remember.
2004000	2006000	Alright. Moving on, Dark Sakura.
2007000	2013000	So there was a big, horkin' interview about the PlayStation 3
2013000	2018000	and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.
2018000	2021000	And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying
2021000	2024000	because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.
2026000	2030000	So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.
2030000	2034000	Not visual, the casual... casual visual.
2034000	2036000	It rhymes. Don't give me that look.
2038000	2042000	More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do, you know,
2042000	2045000	with games, things that are a little bit more reflective of that.
2045000	2049000	And that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.
2049000	2052000	As far as how well the Vita's doing,
2052000	2055000	they say they're not gonna reduce the price this year.
2055000	2057000	That is probably gonna be sometime next year,
2057000	2061000	so it's not a matter of if it's when.
2061000	2063000	But definitely not this year.
2064000	2069000	And this... so really it's just more of what we knew.
2069000	2075000	I think it's just... I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses.
2075000	2080000	They don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fuckin' TV
2080000	2086000	and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to, you know,
2086000	2088000	have their friends see it.
2088000	2091000	I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter
2091000	2096000	and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week
2096000	2098000	for like $199 or something.
2098000	2099000	Really?
2099000	2100000	I know, I was like...
2100000	2102000	Cool, were they teeny?
2102000	2108000	We, sir, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.
2108000	2110000	I guess that didn't do too well, did it?
2110000	2116000	Yeah, who's gonna buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price? Sure.
2116000	2118000	Which it may have. I should check that out.
2118000	2122000	They were also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK,
2122000	2125000	there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now
2125000	2128000	and then a 12 gigabyte version that's gonna be out on October 12th,
2128000	2133000	but that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.
2133000	2136000	It's the shops that are setting the price.
2136000	2139000	I don't really get that since it's their system, but...
2139000	2142000	Well, they gotta charge them a cost, so, I mean,
2142000	2146000	obviously the price is gonna be as low as they can get while making a profit.
2146000	2149000	And they're also trying not to be worried about the Wii U.
2149000	2152000	So, I'm not worried about the Wii U.
2152000	2154000	Well, of course, they're not gonna ever say openly,
2154000	2157000	why, yes, we're shitting our pants over the Wii U, actually.
2157000	2159000	They have nothing to worry about with the Wii U.
2159000	2162000	I know, no one has anything to worry about with the Wii U.
2162000	2166000	The Wii U doesn't have Ridge Racer!
2166000	2171000	You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer.
2171000	2173000	What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know,
2173000	2178000	re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?
2178000	2180000	Same damn tracks.
2180000	2183000	Oh, does that not fit into your plan of, you know,
2183000	2188000	releasing one track with, you know, half a car and you have to buy the rest later?
2188000	2191000	So, just throwing this out there, it's still on sale on Best Buy site,
2191000	2196000	$179.99 for the TV, MotorStorm Apocalypse, and glasses, and a little cable.
2196000	2198000	Eh, give it more time.
2198000	2200000	You think it could get even lower.
2200000	2202000	Black Friday's right around the corner.
2203000	2207000	Don't remind me, I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.
2207000	2209000	Since I'm not working retail.
2209000	2211000	Yay.
2211000	2213000	Alright, let's move on, Loki.
2213000	2219000	Alright, well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV, no actually I'm not.
2219000	2222000	They were kind of cool though, I've got to plan those a few times.
2222000	2227000	So, they have this new Xbox Live reward thing,
2227000	2231000	where they're allowing people with high gamer scores
2231000	2236000	to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.
2236000	2240000	And it's a whopping, I know you're going to get excited here,
2240000	2246000	it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points,
2246000	2249000	and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.
2249000	2251000	That's right, 2%.
2251000	2253000	Woo!
2253000	2255000	I'm getting excited already.
2256000	2262000	And of course, also, apparently if you have a gamer score of over 3,000,
2262000	2266000	you get a special gift during your birthday month,
2266000	2269000	which in the fine print says is only worth 25 cents.
2271000	2274000	Here's a quarter, call somebody who cares.
2274000	2280000	What about, it's probably going to be some stinkin' avatar item like a birthday cake.
2280000	2283000	It's stupid, I mean seriously, 1% back?
2283000	2288000	Okay, so you buy $100 worth of fuckin' Microsoft Point stuff
2288000	2293000	on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you get a dollar.
2293000	2295000	That is fucking stupid.
2295000	2301000	The 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom.
2301000	2303000	It's a fuckin' birthday hat.
2303000	2307000	I guarantee you it's a birthday hat.
2307000	2310000	That is it, for your avatar.
2311000	2315000	So that everyone can go, hey look, he has a birthday hat on.
2315000	2317000	Cool.
2317000	2319000	I want them to send me a quarter.
2319000	2321000	I want them to mail it to me.
2324000	2327000	If it has like a value, you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.
2327000	2330000	So how is it that they can assign a value to that,
2330000	2333000	because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter?
2333000	2336000	Well, I always thought it was akin to like,
2336000	2338000	have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?
2338000	2340000	Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.
2340000	2344000	One one-hundredth of a cent or one tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.
2344000	2347000	Like, maybe that's the actual cash value of a, you know,
2347000	2350000	40 point item in the marketplace or something.
2350000	2352000	It would be 25 cents.
2352000	2354000	That's just stupid.
2354000	2360000	Cool, thank you for, you know, the money back, I guess.
2360000	2363000	But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.
2363000	2365000	I don't know who this Entitelitis is,
2365000	2367000	but I like the comments from this individual tonight.
2367000	2369000	So I have 7,000 points.
2369000	2372000	What do I get, a coupon from Arby's?
2377000	2380000	No, no, the idea is to like, get you to be loyal,
2380000	2382000	not to like, scare you off.
2382000	2386000	Like, you know, a lifetime supply of horsey sauce.
2386000	2390000	Who's gonna spend a hundred dollars on DLC in a month?
2391000	2395000	I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game
2395000	2398000	that comes out in a whole bunch of DLC.
2398000	2401000	I mean, those people are gonna have to be really sipping the, you know,
2401000	2403000	Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.
2403000	2407000	That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.
2408000	2412000	Cause, you know, that's the new thing now, is free to play mechanisms.
2412000	2415000	Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers, you get some money back.
2415000	2417000	Yeah.
2417000	2419000	It's not so bad. Hey!
2419000	2422000	I got all this money stolen from me,
2422000	2426000	but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back. Sweet!
2427000	2430000	It's not so bad anymore.
2431000	2434000	And a birthday hat! Yeah!
2436000	2439000	Maybe the hat's a fuckin' sign that says,
2439000	2442000	Sucker, you spent all this money.
2442000	2444000	You're an idiot.
2445000	2450000	Oh, boy. Alright, let's move on, talk about something in the PlayStation camp.
2450000	2454000	The PlayStation 3, you might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3
2454000	2457000	is gonna be a PlayStation brick, and it won't really be useful for anything anymore,
2457000	2462000	cause of course the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.
2463000	2469000	But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.
2469000	2472000	All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.
2472000	2473000	Nope.
2473000	2476000	Well, when did it first, when did the system first come out, 2006?
2476000	2478000	This is about a nine year window.
2478000	2480000	So I guess that's not terrible.
2480000	2485000	That's not your fuckin' ten year life cycle that you promised me, I want my money back.
2487000	2488000	Uh-oh.
2488000	2490000	Dark Sucker, did you have a problem?
2490000	2493000	Your soap spat on my shirt. It left white foam on my shirt.
2493000	2494000	It likes you a lot.
2494000	2495000	I guess so.
2495000	2500000	Alright, anyhow, PlayStation 3, good for until 2015.
2500000	2505000	That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.
2505000	2506000	2016.
2506000	2507000	That's what's targeted.
2507000	2511000	Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to, you know, re-emphasize,
2511000	2514000	you're not just buying something that's gonna suck in a couple years.
2514000	2515000	So, there you go.
2515000	2519000	We're gonna continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely,
2519000	2522000	and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long,
2522000	2525000	but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.
2525000	2527000	Same thing with PlayStation 2.
2527000	2531000	It's kinda stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch.
2531000	2533000	But there's still games launching for it.
2533000	2538000	That was a comment from John Kohler to GameSpot.
2538000	2541000	So, your PlayStation 3 will still be good through 2015.
2541000	2545000	I hope so. We've already had it for years and years.
2545000	2548000	What about the PlayStation 2, DarkSakura?
2548000	2552000	Well, there's actually some stuff going on for the PlayStation 2.
2552000	2557000	Did you realize that there's still a game coming out?
2557000	2559000	One whole game?
2559000	2561000	One whole game.
2561000	2562000	One game?
2562000	2566000	One whole game. One game that's going to be out in Japan.
2566000	2569000	Ooh, there will be one more game.
2569000	2577000	And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.
2577000	2581000	I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.
2581000	2584000	Adullino Macchio?
2584000	2588000	Yeah, the English version is something like Something of Anderlin
2588000	2590000	or something is the English title.
2590000	2595000	Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name
2595000	2597000	so I can't actually read it properly.
2597000	2598000	Scroll.
2598000	2599000	Well, no, it's not working.
2599000	2601000	Macchio.
2601000	2603000	Adullino Macchio.
2603000	2606000	So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.
2606000	2611000	It's the one that has geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.
2611000	2614000	Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.
2614000	2615000	I know.
2615000	2617000	I can see why people are still playing it.
2617000	2619000	But we have pandas.
2619000	2624000	But it's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going
2624000	2626000	because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.
2626000	2628000	I am so surprised it hasn't gotten free to play yet.
2628000	2629000	Me too.
2629000	2631000	If it went free to play, I'd play it again.
2631000	2633000	Who wouldn't?
2633000	2635000	I know a few people who wouldn't.
2635000	2638000	You know what? I told you what made me quit that game, right?
2638000	2642000	Being a white mage.
2642000	2647000	Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, dammit.
2647000	2650000	That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.
2650000	2652000	Fuck this, I'm teleporting Holla.
2652000	2653000	Yeah.
2653000	2656000	So I was just like, I'm done.
2656000	2659000	After all these years, you still can make jokes like that.
2659000	2661000	That game had quite an impression.
2661000	2663000	This is like, oh, you made a bad pull.
2663000	2664000	Eh, fuck you guys.
2664000	2666000	No heal and I'm out.
2666000	2670000	I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.
2670000	2671000	That was pretty funny.
2671000	2672000	Yeah, Sublegar. Always a good time.
2672000	2674000	They had Sublegar in XIV too,
2674000	2677000	which was probably the only interesting thing about Final Fantasy XIV.
2679000	2681000	Leather underwear.
2681000	2682000	SSJ-100 Matt in our chat room says,
2682000	2684000	Jamie, heal please. Protect please.
2684000	2686000	Bite my ass please.
2689000	2690000	Ah, good times.
2690000	2697000	At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online.
2699000	2701000	Port, port please.
2701000	2705000	Port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.
2705000	2707000	Port, port please.
2710000	2715000	Hey, pretty impressive though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?
2715000	2719000	And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013.
2719000	2720000	Although, let's be real.
2720000	2725000	It's like, there's been one game this year and one game next year.
2725000	2727000	It's on life support at this moment.
2727000	2733000	But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.
2733000	2736000	You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.
2736000	2738000	And I'm never gonna.
2738000	2739000	Hey, it's not that bad.
2739000	2741000	You know, I have it. And I should sit down and play it.
2741000	2743000	You should. It's a good time.
2743000	2744000	But I also have pandas.
2744000	2745000	Balthier and Fran.
2745000	2746000	Pandas.
2746000	2749000	You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.
2749000	2750000	Pandas.
2751000	2752000	Fran's a bunny.
2753000	2754000	So?
2754000	2755000	Alright, let's move on.
2755000	2759000	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.
2759000	2763000	Alright, this week actually there's a few things coming out.
2763000	2769000	I know that there's Resident Evil 6.
2769000	2771000	Some people might be looking forward to that.
2771000	2775000	That's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2775000	2783000	Also NBA 2K13 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2783000	2785000	Wii.
2785000	2788000	Vita? No. No Vita.
2788000	2791000	But PSP for some goddamn reason.
2791000	2796000	Go2K for supporting PSP still.
2796000	2797000	Because no one else is.
2797000	2799000	And PC.
2799000	2804000	And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.
2804000	2806000	Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.
2806000	2809000	And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.
2809000	2811000	I think that's what it's called.
2811000	2813000	Including a penis.
2813000	2815000	It said everything.
2815000	2818000	I think it's lessons for everyone.
2818000	2820000	But yes, it's You Can Draw Everything.
2820000	2821000	That's basically how I'm calling it.
2821000	2823000	Including a penis.
2823000	2824000	Including a penis.
2824000	2827000	And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.
2827000	2831000	Carry Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.
2832000	2835000	And what else do we have here?
2837000	2839000	Let's see here.
2839000	2842000	Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.
2842000	2845000	17 Command & Conquer games in there.
2845000	2846000	Holy fuck.
2846000	2848000	That's a lot of Command & Conquer.
2848000	2849000	That's too much Command & Conquer.
2849000	2852000	Or is it over 17 years where the Command & Conquer.
2852000	2854000	I can't read the cover there.
2854000	2856000	Nope, 17 games.
2856000	2858000	Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.
2858000	2861000	50 bucks and you get all of the Command & Conquer games.
2861000	2863000	All the Red Alert games.
2863000	2865000	Generals.
2865000	2866000	Wow.
2866000	2868000	That's pretty sweet.
2868000	2870000	Ron Munnar says 17 Command & Conquer games.
2870000	2872000	Shut up and take my money.
2872000	2874000	You'll never get through it all.
2874000	2878000	I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.
2878000	2880000	I think I played one game for two seconds.
2880000	2882000	I did that with the Doom pack.
2882000	2884000	XCOM is fucking great though.
2885000	2892000	Also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty Edition of Resident Evil.
2892000	2896000	No, NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil.
2896000	2899000	They have the archives and anthologies.
2899000	2904000	Which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3.
2904000	2909000	Including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1, 3, 4.
2909000	2911000	It's like all these random ones in there.
2912000	2914000	MXC1 to clarify in our chat room.
2914000	2916000	17 games but they're all digital.
2916000	2918000	Even if you buy the VOX you just get codes.
2918000	2919000	That's stupid.
2919000	2921000	I hate it when they do that now.
2921000	2924000	Thank you Origin! Thank you!
2924000	2926000	Thank you for sucking.
2926000	2927000	Fucking awesome.
2927000	2929000	That comment and more in our chat room.
2929000	2931000	Live.vognetwork.com
2931000	2933000	Oh and of course I should mention a week from today.
2933000	2935000	There's...
2936000	2938000	Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.
2938000	2940000	Someone might be interested in that.
2940000	2942000	No one I know likes that game.
2943000	2945000	Okay I have to digress for a moment.
2946000	2948000	Have you done any pet battles?
2948000	2950000	Yeah they're pretty fun actually.
2950000	2952000	I went and did that for like an hour.
2954000	2958000	But they will not let you according to our guildie Gwen.
2958000	2961000	They will not let you name your Phoenix hatchling Fox.
2961000	2963000	Well you know what's funny?
2963000	2967000	I have been naming all of my little pets after Mass Effect characters.
2967000	2968000	Shut up.
2968000	2970000	Because my priest is Dr. Chacwas right?
2970000	2973000	And so my kitty is Jack.
2973000	2976000	And I tried to name my little mechanical.
2976000	2979000	Like if you have a mechanical creature what are you going to name it?
2979000	2980000	Legion.
2980000	2982000	I was going to try and name it Legion.
2982000	2983000	It wouldn't let me name it Legion.
2983000	2984000	Because it's biblical.
2985000	2986000	Oh my god.
2986000	2987000	Yeah.
2987000	2989000	So I named it Geth Legion.
2989000	2990000	Still.
2990000	2991000	For the record Rob.
2991000	2994000	I did actually prove you wrong from something on Hoard House.
2994000	2995000	What?
2995000	2996000	I got Jane Shepherd.
2996000	2997000	On Proudmoore.
2997000	2998000	Oh.
2998000	2999000	Good for you.
2999000	3000000	Just saying.
3000000	3001000	Have a cookie.
3001000	3002000	Alright.
3002000	3003000	Going back to Jamie.
3003000	3004000	I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.
3004000	3005000	Well they do.
3005000	3008000	This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy 12.
3008000	3011000	SG100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.
3011000	3013000	No, Garrus isn't in it.
3013000	3016000	ActDef says, tell her it has Panda Corgi Garrus.
3016000	3017000	Ew.
3017000	3018000	That just is wrong.
3018000	3019000	No.
3019000	3021000	Although did you see the ferret effect?
3021000	3022000	Uh uh.
3022000	3023000	Oh yes I did.
3023000	3024000	No yes I did.
3024000	3025000	That was awesome.
3025000	3026000	That was pretty rad.
3026000	3027000	The listener of OLR.
3027000	3028000	I guess we can't take all the credit for it.
3028000	3032000	No it was in our Mass Effect secret community.
3032000	3038160	Fifth dream about the World of Warcraft expansion in our chat room says Mists of Pandiaria is
3038160	3040160	what my wife and I have been calling it.
3040160	3041160	That's pretty good.
3041160	3042160	I'm going to use that on Hoard House.
3042160	3044000	I'm going to call it Mists of Pandemic.
3044000	3045820	Mists of Pandiaria.
3045820	3049000	By the way, do you know what name I got for my Tauren Monk?
3049000	3050800	I'm really excited.
3050800	3051800	You told me.
3051800	3052800	Calvin.
3052800	3053800	That's awesome.
3053800	3055200	I told Dan and he just rolled his eyes.
3055200	3056200	You know what I got?
3056200	3057200	What?
3057200	3058200	I have Sunny Gummy.
3058200	3059200	Uh huh.
3059200	3060200	I love that name.
3060200	3061200	From Gummy Bears.
3061200	3062200	And then I have Shampoo.
3062200	3063200	Spelled X-I-A-N-P-U.
3063200	3069760	Oh hey, let's travel to Japan and check out release dates over there.
3069760	3075420	Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012 both
3075420	3076660	on the Xbox 360.
3076660	3082320	There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know to try and like sell
3082320	3086760	some Microsoft Xbox 360s I guess.
3086760	3091000	I believe there are full consoles coming out too.
3091000	3093840	There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition.
3093840	3095120	Oh no.
3095120	3096880	This is the one with the jacket, isn't it?
3096880	3100240	Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?
3100240	3103360	$1700 if you want to get this.
3103360	3107260	This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.
3107260	3108320	Remember that?
3108320	3109480	That's happening in Japan this week.
3109480	3110800	But not a full metal jacket.
3110800	3111800	No.
3112280	3114440	I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.
3114440	3117440	They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.
3117440	3118940	The jacket's pretty freaking rad.
3118940	3122760	Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.
3122760	3123760	It's cute.
3123760	3127400	I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.
3127400	3129240	Yes, we know.
3129240	3134120	Alright, going to the Playstation 3, I imagine it's mostly the same shit.
3134120	3137360	Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.
3137360	3141760	You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your Playstation 3 with Biohazard
3141760	3142760	symbols.
3142760	3145480	So your Playstation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.
3145480	3146800	Wouldn't that be awesome?
3146800	3149000	F1 2012.
3149000	3150560	And you got right over there?
3150560	3152080	No, they just made me laugh.
3152080	3154000	Because I had mental imagery then.
3154000	3157600	World Soccer winning 11, 2013.
3157600	3161880	Well they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes and so
3161880	3164800	because of that they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.
3164800	3166440	I know.
3166440	3167440	Now you can't unsee that.
3167440	3170060	Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick
3170060	3171120	blowing a giraffe.
3171120	3174080	You can't unsee that now that that's been said.
3174080	3177520	So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go, you're welcome.
3177520	3179120	How about on the Nintendo 3DS?
3179120	3181680	Coming out this week, nothing.
3181680	3186160	But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.
3186160	3191240	I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.
3191240	3192240	There you go.
3192240	3193240	That's the Japanese release dates.
3193240	3194800	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
3194800	3196800	Oh, a few things.
3196800	3202600	On the first, which it already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.
3202600	3207160	And then on the second, Resident Evil 6, oh my god, you are so correct.
3207160	3208160	Right?
3208160	3212200	Well, I've tried, I've kind of been ignoring it.
3212200	3213920	Tried the R&C but you can't.
3213920	3217800	Because did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?
3217800	3218800	What?
3218800	3219800	For the release of that?
3219800	3224040	They did like a fake human meat market for Resident Evil 6 in East London.
3224080	3226080	It was all raccoon.
3226080	3227080	Ew!
3227080	3228080	No.
3228080	3231600	Have you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?
3231600	3232600	No.
3232600	3237040	Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid
3237040	3238400	I didn't watch it again for like two years.
3238400	3239400	It's really gross.
3239400	3242920	I almost put it in show roll, but it's really, really gross.
3242920	3243920	I'll just link pictures.
3243920	3250720	They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and pork.
3250720	3253200	The best, ew, that's gross.
3253200	3254200	The best episode ever.
3254200	3256360	You can also buy fake penises.
3256360	3260360	The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kittenman's, was the
3260360	3262560	episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.
3262560	3265160	That was my favorite.
3265160	3266800	I haven't seen that one yet.
3266800	3268160	Oh, it's fantastic.
3268160	3274400	But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically
3274400	3275400	for helping amputees.
3275400	3280880	Well, I guess that's cool that it had a, you know, a good cause at the end of the day.
3280880	3283800	So back to the releases.
3283800	3284800	What were you gonna say?
3284800	3287840	I was gonna say, actually I do think I did see the episode where they were all in the
3287840	3289720	U-Haul trailer or something like that.
3289720	3291600	Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?
3291600	3292600	Yes.
3292600	3293600	Okay, okay.
3293600	3294600	Oh yeah.
3294600	3295600	That was hilarious.
3295600	3300240	Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah, Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.
3300240	3303600	And the 4th is Anno2070 Deep Ocean.
3303600	3306080	And the 5th NBA 2K13.
3306080	3308640	So something every day this week.
3309400	3313720	Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week
3313720	3317640	where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.
3317640	3319480	But first, Loki.
3319480	3322000	And it's of the week, so.
3322000	3331280	So Notch, the, you know, wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to, you
3331280	3337800	know, perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in
3337840	3343040	Windows 8, you know, so that it would be on their closed platform.
3343040	3349800	And they even asked, hey, you can help certify, you know, Minecraft for Windows 8.
3349800	3355120	And you know, he said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all
3355120	3360320	rather than to, you know, play along with what Microsoft wanted.
3360320	3365560	And basically, you know, said, no, I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms
3365560	3366560	around.
3366560	3372200	And if it was locked down Windows 8, it would be very, very bad for indie games and competition
3372200	3373200	in general.
3373200	3376520	If we can keep open platforms around, there's going to be a lot of very interesting games
3376520	3381440	in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.
3381440	3386400	I think it would have been, what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can
3386400	3388880	show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.
3388880	3391560	They're certified for it in Minecraft.
3391560	3396440	Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but, you know, he doesn't want to do that.
3396440	3397440	Why would you?
3397440	3402000	I mean, you have a, basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm
3402000	3406840	assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because, you know, it's
3406840	3412080	their closed app store versus he sells the game off his website, he gets all the profits
3412080	3413080	for it.
3413080	3414080	So why?
3414080	3419400	Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason,
3419400	3420400	you know.
3420400	3423800	Of course, he's going to say no.
3423800	3427640	This is a little different when you're putting your game on, you know, the Xbox 360 where
3427640	3433400	no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.
3433400	3435920	You just can't do that.
3435920	3441760	Rama in chat says, oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.
3441760	3443680	I'd like to explore this a little bit as well.
3443680	3449400	I mean, if I want to just write a silly little Windows program, I can do that.
3449400	3451920	Like, Windows 8 isn't going to, like, stop me from doing that, right?
3451920	3453200	I'm pretty sure you can.
3453200	3456360	I think it's just mainly it's the marketplace, the marketplace.
3456360	3457360	Yeah.
3457360	3460760	That's where it's more locked down because it's trying to combat piracy and all that,
3460760	3461760	right?
3461760	3462760	Yeah.
3462760	3464920	I'm just saying that's why they do it.
3464920	3469740	Windows, the operating system that is pirate proof.
3469740	3471320	No one pirates windows.
3471320	3472320	Please.
3472320	3477400	If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.
3477400	3479760	I don't buy operating systems.
3479760	3484320	I actually don't think I've paid for one in, like, 20 years.
3484320	3489280	Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.
3489280	3490280	Same here.
3490280	3493880	Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Frugal Question of the Week a little
3493880	3495960	later when it comes to Windows 8.
3495960	3501080	I'm still really torn on it, like, I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like
3501080	3504200	if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.
3504200	3506240	There's a lot of mystery around it.
3506240	3511320	If there's anything that people, like, find about Windows 8 that they really must have,
3511320	3514920	someone's gonna fuckin' develop a program that runs in Windows 7 that does the same
3514920	3517560	damn shit.
3517560	3522160	I mean, probably does it better, so... no.
3522160	3524760	No thanks.
3524760	3527880	Not into it.
3527880	3533280	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
3533280	3535400	use the passphrase, danger.
3535720	3541800	Alright, well, if, you know, you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason
3541800	3545440	you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe
3545440	3546840	you're on Linux.
3546840	3551460	And of course, Linux is gonna be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form
3551460	3553400	of Steam.
3553400	3558360	Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.
3558360	3563480	1,000 users will be testing the client, they also get one Valve game with that.
3563480	3566680	It's probably gonna be Left 4 Dead 2, because that, of course, is the game that they already
3566680	3568720	said would be on Linux.
3568720	3572520	The beta will support... and please forgive me if I mispronounce this, because I'm not
3572520	3573520	a Linux user...
3573520	3574520	Ubuntu?
3574520	3575520	Is that how you say it?
3575520	3576520	Yep.
3576520	3578640	Ubuntu 12.04 and above.
3578640	3581920	It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.
3581920	3585960	So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.
3585960	3589800	Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to
3589800	3591280	the user install experience.
3591280	3595440	Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?
3595440	3597320	Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?
3597320	3606640	Yeah, I think so, but I'm not an in-depth programmer or anything like that, so I might
3606640	3607640	see if I can't get into it.
3607640	3610880	And what was your logic for using Linux Mint again?
3610880	3616480	First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.
3616480	3622680	You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more
3622680	3626920	sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.
3626920	3633240	On top of that, you have basic, immediate root access to anything in your system.
3633240	3638340	On top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.
3638340	3644920	It's respected, it's versatile, and the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's
3644920	3648920	a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for
3648920	3652360	anything, and it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.
3652360	3655480	And what's specific about Mint?
3655480	3657160	It's just a really easy interface.
3657160	3659860	Do you just like the name Mint because it's minty fresh?
3659860	3664620	It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.
3664620	3667680	It's a really good introductory into Linux.
3667680	3669720	Minty fresh scattles.
3669720	3670720	You remember that?
3670720	3672840	A 10-year-old joke from understation live.
3672840	3673840	Look at that.
3673840	3674840	Look at that.
3675760	3681280	Hey, you know, on my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.
3681280	3682280	I'm going to find it now.
3682280	3684440	Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?
3684440	3685760	I probably did.
3685760	3688160	Actually, I think I made it before I had a live journal.
3688160	3689160	Or your Zonga.
3689160	3690160	I never had a Zonga.
3690160	3691160	Never had a Zonga.
3691160	3694560	Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week, and I was like, oh yeah.
3694560	3696480	I'm going to go find the mint scattles.
3696480	3697480	Hold on.
3697480	3699760	You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.
3699760	3702800	Have you seen the new MySpace?
3702800	3703800	They're trying.
3703800	3704800	You mean Pinterest?
3704800	3706520	It's basically Pinterest.
3706520	3707520	But like, no, here's the thing.
3707520	3709940	Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.
3709940	3713440	But I was looking at the new MySpace, I'm like, oh, okay.
3713440	3716320	So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.
3716320	3719860	That's what it is.
3719860	3720860	Still won't use it.
3720860	3721860	I kind of use Pinterest.
3721860	3722860	Do you?
3722860	3724040	What do you pin on Pinterest?
3724040	3728400	Usually like recipes and supernatural and mass effect.
3728400	3729400	You're such a girl.
3729400	3730400	All right.
3730400	3734400	You know what?
3734400	3735640	I love the car.
3735640	3737560	The car really makes me happy.
3737560	3739320	All right.
3739320	3742080	Going a step further here with Steam.
3742080	3746640	Did I get the, oh yeah, sorry.
3746640	3750240	There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game McPixel.
3750240	3753880	It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.
3753880	3756480	It is now, excuse me, Steam Greenlight.
3756480	3760160	I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.
3760160	3762820	Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.
3762820	3765400	It is now available for $4.99.
3765400	3770160	It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by
3770160	3772020	using available tools.
3772020	3773020	It's awesome.
3773020	3775460	It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.
3775460	3776460	It's really awesome.
3776460	3777460	Is it?
3777460	3778460	It's ridiculous.
3778460	3779460	Yeah.
3779460	3780460	Did you play it?
3780460	3781460	Yeah.
3781460	3782460	I beat the whole game.
3782460	3783460	I have it on my phone.
3783460	3784460	Nice.
3784460	3785460	Yeah.
3785460	3786460	I paid for it and it was ridiculous.
3786460	3789640	It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.
3789640	3798280	It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games, MacGyver, and something really
3798280	3799280	retarded.
3799280	3800280	I don't know.
3800280	3805400	It's just like, the guy, the guy's just, a lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people
3805400	3807880	in the nuts.
3807880	3808880	It's so noted.
3808880	3809880	OMG, spoiler.
3809880	3810880	Spoiler.
3810880	3814880	Well, if you, which puzzles though?
3814880	3817880	I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in
3817880	3818880	the nuts.
3819120	3820120	Oh, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.
3820120	3821120	Yeah, seriously.
3821120	3822120	See if it works.
3822120	3829800	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time, a time when kicking
3829800	3834760	people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.
3834760	3839160	It's the classic game of the week, a chance for Dark Soccer to take a trip down memory
3839160	3844880	lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this and shut
3844880	3845880	up.
3845880	3846880	Seriously.
3846880	3849880	I'm going to post the Mint Scabbles picture in chat.
3849880	3850880	You found it that quick.
3850880	3851880	I did it ages.
3851880	3852880	It was on my deviantart, duh.
3852880	3854880	I did it a long time ago, though.
3854880	3856880	Along with your, uh, Garris Shep picks.
3856880	3857880	You know what?
3857880	3858880	I haven't done any Garris Shep picks.
3858880	3861880	I'm actually getting, when did I do this?
3861880	3864880	Like, years ago.
3864880	3865880	Anyway.
3865880	3866880	Here we go.
3866880	3867880	Classic of the week.
3867880	3868880	What'd you pick, Dark Soccer?
3868880	3870880	I picked Donkey Kong Country.
3870880	3871880	Good pick.
3871880	3875880	So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.
3877880	3879880	How many of us cheered when we heard that?
3882880	3883880	Yay.
3900880	3902880	Fuckin' love this game.
3903880	3905880	Oh, Rare.
3905880	3907880	Oh, Rare.
3907880	3912880	So, um, I also have to say it's funny because, yeah, I do actually use Wikipedia for some
3912880	3913880	of my references.
3913880	3915880	And I'm like, DKC redirects here.
3915880	3919880	For the genetic disease, see, dyskeratosis congenita.
3919880	3921880	It just made me laugh for some reason.
3921880	3922880	I was like, what is that?
3922880	3924880	Sounds like something to its skin.
3924880	3927880	Anyway, um, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare.
3927880	3931880	It came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.
3931880	3938880	It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.
3938880	3939880	It was done by Tim Stapler.
3939880	3941880	By some dude.
3941880	3943880	Um, this game was really cool.
3943880	3946880	There was so much going on with this one.
3946880	3949880	It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.
3949880	3952880	The Game Boy Color version had 41.
3952880	3957880	And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by krumlings.
3957880	3960880	So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines,
3960880	3963880	you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls.
3963880	3965880	You can do all kinds of stuff.
3965880	3969880	And you can spell out K-O-N-G.
3969880	3972880	And get extra life balloons.
3972880	3974880	You can do all kinds of stuff.
3974880	3976880	I love the rhino.
3976880	3981880	And I like that you can ride a barrel and just not shit over while you're riding the barrel.
3981880	3984880	So you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew Diddy.
3984880	3986880	And you can switch between them.
3986880	3989880	Diddy is more agile but not as powerful.
3989880	3992880	And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the rhino,
3992880	3995880	Espresso the ostrich,
3995880	3996880	Enguarde the swordfish,
3996880	3997880	Winky the frog,
3997880	3999880	and Squawks the parrot.
3999880	4003880	I want to know who thought of those names because those are some dumb names.
4003880	4005880	You have two player mode.
4005880	4007880	So you can do contest or team.
4007880	4011880	So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.
4011880	4013880	And team, you play together.
4013880	4017880	You work together. One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.
4017880	4020880	And you can track your progress during the map.
4020880	4024880	You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.
4024880	4030880	And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.
4030880	4034880	I want to know where he got that name.
4034880	4040880	Now Bobby Black Wolf and Chad is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music.
4040880	4042880	So here you go, some underwater music.
4043880	4046880	Oh, I love this music.
4050880	4052880	Here you go.
4052880	4068880	So, anyway, it was really, it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed.
4068880	4072880	So it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it.
4072880	4078880	And it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong.
4078880	4080880	And that's pretty much become the standard now.
4083880	4090880	So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.
4090880	4094880	So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.
4094880	4098880	It was lots of fun. There were different ways to play through each level.
4098880	4104880	You had secret rooms that you could get. You had all kinds of different things that were going on.
4104880	4106880	You had all the balloons you could...
4106880	4108880	Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.
4108880	4110880	I'm actually just going to hang up on them.
4110880	4112880	I'm hanging up on you.
4112880	4114880	Who was it?
4114880	4116880	I don't know. 800 number.
4116880	4124880	But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.
4124880	4126880	It had really fun music.
4126880	4132880	In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like popping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.
4132880	4134880	So that was pretty funny.
4134880	4142880	So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was...
4142880	4150880	It was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.
4150880	4154880	And Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.
4154880	4162880	So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006, and in Europe on December 8th.
4162880	4166880	And North America on the 19th of February, 2007.
4166880	4168880	There were sequels. There were other ones.
4168880	4172880	There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.
4172880	4178880	There was three, Dixie Kong's Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64, and Donkey Kong Country Returns.
4178880	4180880	So, that was it.
4180880	4184880	This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.
4190880	4192880	Nice.
4192880	4194880	Not bad.
4194880	4196880	So that's it.
4196880	4198880	There you go.
4198880	4200880	Classic game of the week.
4200880	4202880	Donkey Kong Country.
4202880	4206880	That happens when you try to say all those words too fast.
4206880	4208880	Oh, good times.
4208880	4210880	Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.
4210880	4212880	Please.
4212880	4216880	I found an NPC called Chef Yan or something.
4216880	4218880	Or Cookmaster Yan.
4218880	4222880	So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yan.
4222880	4224880	And Yan can cook.
4224880	4230880	But it was Walk with Yan that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.
4230880	4232880	So I've actually been...
4232880	4234880	Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.
4234880	4236880	Got me cooking.
4236880	4238880	There you go.
4238880	4240880	Alright.
4240880	4242880	I think it's time for a break.
4242880	4244880	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4244880	4246880	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4246880	4248880	We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.
4248880	4250880	The recent shows have been very long.
4250880	4252880	But hey, it happens sometimes.
4252880	4260880	But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including rapid fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4260880	4262880	You know what? The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.
4262880	4266880	That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.
4266880	4268880	That's all fixed tonight.
4268880	4270880	So I'm sure people will be getting in.
4270880	4272880	Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line.
4272880	4274880	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
4274880	4280880	We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
4280880	4297880	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.
4297880	4302880	We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.
4302880	4307880	If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night, of course, at vognetwork.com.
4307880	4310880	Be sure to join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com.
4310880	4313880	And Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.
4313880	4321880	Alright, so let's see. Let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about.
4321880	4328880	And I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is.
4328880	4334880	But Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.
4334880	4342880	And, of course, one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play, so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go.
4342880	4348880	And that is coming. They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.
4348880	4350880	That's pretty awesome.
4350880	4355880	I haven't had a chance to play Tokyo Jungle yet, and I'm really upset because it's one of those games I really wanted to check out.
4355880	4357880	But I've been hearing it's not bad.
4357880	4358880	I want to play it.
4358880	4359880	Yeah, me too.
4359880	4361880	They have a picture of an elephant with roller skates on, so I mean...
4361880	4363880	How could that be bad?
4363880	4365880	How could that possibly be bad?
4365880	4366880	Yeah.
4366880	4372880	And, of course, there's a new indie bundle that you can check out. It's the Indie Royale.
4372880	4381880	They're doing their Oktoberfest bundle, and it features a bunch of different things in there, including Zoe Mode's Chime,
4381880	4385880	all three episodes of Hector, Badge of Carnage by Telltale Games,
4385880	4394880	the Smudged Cat Games' Adventures of Shuggy, and also Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble.
4394880	4395880	Yep.
4395880	4397880	That sounds like a winner.
4397880	4405880	And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two Chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.
4405880	4408880	So, it's pretty sweet.
4408880	4416880	And I guess you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.
4416880	4418880	Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?
4418880	4423880	Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too. I think they added some more games to that.
4423880	4425880	They did. You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.
4425880	4428880	Wizorb. Oh my god, I already bought all these games.
4429880	4439880	I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.
4439880	4443880	Oh, well, I can't be too upset. I mean, I paid money for really good games.
4443880	4446880	Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.
4446880	4451880	No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use...
4451880	4454880	Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.
4454880	4457880	Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah, you should give one away. It's a good deal.
4457880	4460880	Good deal. One day left, by the way.
4460880	4464880	And last but not least, a game I'm very excited about.
4464880	4469880	Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week.
4469880	4474880	And not to be outdone by that, D3 of America decided,
4474880	4479880	Hey, guess what? Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US.
4479880	4481880	Fuck yeah!
4481880	4483880	John, Loki was very happy.
4483880	4488880	So that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.
4488880	4491880	Oh, that's a... Oh, okay. I was like, winter 2013?
4491880	4494880	Yeah, yeah. Remember, it's considered fall.
4497880	4499880	Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.
4499880	4500880	No, no, not at all.
4500880	4501880	That's good.
4501880	4507880	And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.
4507880	4509880	A reason for you to own a CD.
4510880	4513880	And apparently the people that played it at the Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.
4513880	4519880	Like, they actually added physics this time around, and, you know, the details a little bit better, and...
4519880	4520880	Wait, they're trying to legitimize?
4520880	4525880	No, seriously, I don't care. It doesn't matter. It's sandbox making the game. It's gonna be awesome.
4525880	4528880	I have no doubt it's gonna be awesome.
4528880	4531880	But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.
4531880	4535880	That's something that doesn't happen very often.
4535880	4537880	I still need to get LittleBigPlanet Vita.
4537880	4538880	Yeah, me too.
4538880	4542880	Alright, moving on. With some rapid-fire news over here.
4542880	4546880	I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.
4546880	4549880	It's dated Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams.
4549880	4553880	The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64,
4553880	4558880	when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers.
4558880	4561880	Like, really, really similar. They kind of had a point.
4561880	4566880	But since then, it always had a bit of a cult following, because the music was very different,
4566880	4568880	and the music was very, very good.
4568880	4571880	And now, the series has had a cult following ever since then.
4571880	4573880	They had the DS game not that long ago.
4573880	4578880	Well, now there was a Kickstarter, and the success of that, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams,
4578880	4581880	will come out on PC October 23rd.
4581880	4583880	I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.
4583880	4584880	Yes.
4590880	4595880	They show it a little bit in the trailer about the shifting between different worlds.
4595880	4596880	Yeah, yeah.
4596880	4598880	And the music changes when you switch, too.
4598880	4599880	Oh, that's pretty cool.
4599880	4603880	So, they're saying it's like a platformer Igaruga, almost.
4603880	4608880	Okay. That's kind of a neat concept, and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.
4608880	4610880	They have a demo out there you can check out for free.
4610880	4613880	I actually backed it, so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.
4613880	4617880	Nice. Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013,
4617880	4621880	which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there, so...
4621880	4622880	Yeah.
4622880	4623880	Very cool.
4623880	4626880	Congrats to the team there for getting that out.
4626880	4629880	The final title was voted upon by the community.
4629880	4633880	Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.
4633880	4635880	Yeah, I totally missed that.
4637880	4639880	Broken Sword Kickstarter.
4639880	4644880	It did not hit beneath a Steel Sky 2 goal, but a sequel is going to happen anyway.
4644880	4645880	Here's what happened.
4645880	4651880	Revolution Software, they asked for $400,000 to kickstart the fifth installment of Broken Sword,
4651880	4653880	called Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.
4653880	4658880	The Kickstarter closed with $771,000, so that's good.
4658880	4660880	They way out did that.
4660880	4665880	Now, there were stretch goals after getting the initial amount.
4665880	4670880	The $1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky.
4670880	4674880	However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal,
4674880	4675880	because, quote,
4675880	4678880	We are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky,
4678880	4681880	and are currently discussing ideas for this project,
4681880	4686880	which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.
4686880	4687880	So, there you go.
4687880	4691880	The original game dates all the way back to 1994.
4692880	4693880	Well, that's pretty cool.
4694880	4698880	If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project,
4698880	4703880	Final Fantasy VI, its overclocked remixed Final Fantasy VI album,
4703880	4706880	there was a Kickstarter for it, it was shut down,
4706880	4710880	and it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.
4710880	4713880	It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.
4714880	4716880	But apparently, all those issues have been worked out.
4716880	4718880	The fundraiser is back.
4718880	4723880	Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI celebration,
4723880	4728880	but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.
4728880	4732880	It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.
4732880	4738880	The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes, or at events, or what have you.
4738880	4746880	It's apparently trying to raise $30,000, but with 29 days left to go, they are looking pretty good.
4746880	4747880	So, there you go.
4748880	4752880	You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.
4752880	4755880	Let's hope, for act-def's sake, there's another Chocobo wrap on it.
4755880	4757880	That would be phenomenal.
4759880	4760880	Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.
4760880	4761880	Chocobop.
4763880	4765880	There's a whole little, I love this song he wrote about...
4766880	4768880	Or, I love this song? Question mark.
4769880	4770880	This song's okay.
4770880	4775880	Alright, Final Fantasy Star Online 2 is free-to-play on the Vita.
4776880	4777880	Yay!
4777880	4779880	It needs to be free-to-play on PC!
4779880	4780880	Well, free-to-play on the Vita...
4780880	4781880	That's in Japan.
4781880	4782880	Hopefully that's here, too.
4783880	4790880	Yeah, but it was on the Phantasy Star Fan Blog that Vita players will be able to play with PC players.
4790880	4792880	There's going to be certain lobbies open to both.
4793880	4795880	And then, Arcade Heroes.
4801880	4806880	Had a thing about the Family Fun Arcade closing January 2013.
4807880	4809880	Why must arcades close?
4810880	4811880	They don't make money.
4812880	4813880	Oh, shut up. That's no excuse.
4813880	4815880	I think this particular one, that wasn't the case, though.
4815880	4821880	The guy had been running it for 30-plus years, and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.
4821880	4824880	So I actually don't think, in this case, it was a money thing.
4824880	4825880	Yeah.
4825880	4828880	But it was a landmark arcade. I mean, it was a big deal.
4828880	4829880	Yeah, one of the big ones.
4829880	4834880	But, it was a big home for fighting games, too.
4834880	4837880	Because, I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.
4839880	4841880	And then, Prison Architect.
4842880	4852880	Basically, they had a paid alpha version, and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.
4853880	4855880	The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.
4856880	4862880	Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one, because apparently everybody's making money on there.
4863880	4864880	Just kidding.
4865880	4866880	Maybe you are.
4867880	4868880	Ha ha ha ha.
4868880	4870880	Okay. That's up.
4870880	4873880	Alright, let's go to the Fugu question of the week.
4873880	4877880	Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities.
4878880	4880880	And we answer them. Read the answers for you here.
4881880	4882880	Right on the show.
4883880	4885880	This week it's all about Windows 8.
4886880	4890880	The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.
4891880	4895880	With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?
4895880	4896880	Is it something you're picking up?
4896880	4899880	Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?
4899880	4904880	Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows, because I knew if I did that, somebody would say,
4905880	4907880	Fuck Windows. I'm on Linux. Fuck Windows. I'm on Mac.
4908880	4909880	So there was kind of a two-part question.
4910880	4912880	Well Mac, you don't have a choice. You just have to upgrade when they come out with a new one.
4913880	4914880	Otherwise your computer will stop working.
4915880	4917880	Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too,
4918880	4921880	what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?
4922880	4925880	Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?
4926880	4927880	So let's go to Google Plus first.
4927880	4929880	I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E.
4930880	4931880	I used to know him when he lived out here.
4932880	4933880	He answered the question saying,
4934880	4937880	I use Linux for many reasons, but games are not one of them.
4938880	4942880	I'd say, however, that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene.
4943880	4945880	I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OSes,
4946880	4948880	but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now.
4949880	4952880	I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped,
4953880	4956880	but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux.
4957880	4961880	And, of course, all Android devices run Linux, but that's a different world of gaming.
4962880	4966880	Now if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.
4967880	4969880	I do want to add something, actually, Rob.
4970880	4972880	You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.
4973880	4976880	Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.
4977880	4978880	That's cool.
4979880	4981880	Flaco Jones responded on Google Plus saying,
4982880	4983880	I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.
4984880	4986880	I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs
4987880	4988880	and I can't stand it.
4989880	4990880	Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.
4991880	4992880	I love all the Mac OSes I've used.
4993880	4994880	There isn't a lot of variation between them.
4995880	4997880	They are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.
4998880	5001880	Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.
5002880	5003880	I do wish there were more games for Mac,
5004880	5006880	because whenever I do play on a Mac it feels a lot smoother than the PC version,
5007880	5009880	even though my PC has slightly better specs.
5010880	5011880	ActDeft replied on Google Plus saying,
5012880	5015880	The Win 8 Metro UI, look at all these people on Google Plus this week,
5015880	5018880	is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.
5019880	5022880	That interface is made for a tablet and it would totally work for that really well,
5023880	5024880	but not for a keyboard and mouse.
5025880	5027880	Also considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them,
5028880	5031880	Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture
5032880	5033880	if your internet connection goes down or something.
5034880	5035880	I'm currently using Win XP.
5036880	5039880	I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.
5040880	5041880	Facebook.
5042880	5043880	I love this nickname.
5043880	5045880	I Am Super Lazy replied and said,
5046880	5048880	It's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.
5049880	5051880	My thought is that it works best as a media center PC,
5052880	5054880	but as a traditional PC it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.
5055880	5056880	There might be better options.
5057880	5059880	Code Man said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs,
5060880	5062880	but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.
5063880	5066880	You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.
5067880	5068880	What happened to the Windows XP days?
5069880	5070880	The good old days.
5071880	5072880	The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it
5073880	5075880	and if you use Steam you're really shit out of luck.
5076880	5078880	You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now
5079880	5082880	because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.
5083880	5084880	Of course.
5085880	5086880	I'm not looking forward to it.
5087880	5088880	VX Jason XV.
5089880	5093880	Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.
5094880	5096880	Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe N and Notch have talked about
5097880	5099880	will eventually set it up and if they don't already,
5100880	5102880	quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface
5103880	5104880	on Windows 7 again.
5105880	5107880	Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the Surface.
5108880	5110880	Any gamer that owns or runs a non-Windows platform
5111880	5113880	has complained about the lack of games at one time or another.
5114880	5116880	Even boot campers moan when they have to switch OS just to play.
5117880	5119880	I'm always disheartened when I only see the Windows icon on a title on Steam
5120880	5122880	and I'm always so delighted when they both are there.
5123880	5124880	No Mac exclusives as far as I know of.
5125880	5126880	That's surprising to me.
5127880	5130880	I'll be awfully surprised if Steam does in fact appear on Linux in the next 365 days,
5131880	5132880	even two years.
5133880	5134880	I don't expect it to happen.
5135880	5136880	Hmm.
5137880	5139880	Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet but from what I've seen it looks messy.
5140880	5142880	I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.
5143880	5145880	I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.
5146880	5147880	We only just migrated to Windows 7.
5148880	5149880	Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.
5150880	5154880	And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.
5155880	5158880	I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on
5159880	5160880	even back when I had a PC.
5160880	5161880	Macs have World of Warcraft.
5162880	5163880	That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.
5164880	5166880	I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows
5167880	5169880	to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.
5170880	5173880	Tigerclaw says personally I don't think you would notice any performance increase
5174880	5175880	going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.
5176880	5177880	Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.
5178880	5180880	Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI
5181880	5183880	and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro style UI
5184880	5186880	that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard and Windows Phone.
5187880	5189880	I hate though actually about the UI real quick.
5190880	5193880	It's the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.
5194880	5195880	Really?
5196880	5197880	Yeah, because remember it's made for tablets
5198880	5201880	so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.
5202880	5203880	Fuck that.
5204880	5208880	Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.
5209880	5211880	Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.
5212880	5213880	With all due respect for the creator of Minecraft,
5214880	5215880	I think he needs to get off his high horse.
5216880	5217880	Apparently from the way I understand the story
5217880	5218880	is that he fears that with Windows 8
5219880	5221880	it will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.
5222880	5224880	He states that he would not have his game run on Windows 8 at all
5225880	5227880	than work with Microsoft which I think is a very bad decision.
5228880	5229880	It seems like he thinks that the Microsoft App Store
5230880	5231880	is going to be the be-all end-all for applications
5232880	5234880	and that he is getting his game certified for it
5235880	5237880	but is basically contributing to the so-called walled garden.
5238880	5239880	It's funny because last time I checked
5240880	5241880	his game is freely downloadable off his website
5242880	5244880	and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.
5244880	5248880	But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores
5249880	5250880	that you have to go through a certification process
5251880	5252880	to get your app on there in the first place?
5253880	5255880	It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.
5256880	5257880	I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game
5258880	5259880	for the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear
5260880	5261880	on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go
5262880	5263880	and it's right there when I start the PC up?
5264880	5266880	Hell, last time I checked you are not being held up at gunpoint
5267880	5268880	to buy Windows 8. Interesting point.
5269880	5272880	But I think the thing is though is for all those three platforms that you mentioned
5272880	5276880	there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.
5277880	5279880	Like he cannot sell you a copy from his website.
5280880	5283880	Maybe you can for Android because I know you can do third party apps and stuff like that.
5284880	5287880	But for everything else you cannot buy straight from his website.
5288880	5289880	Isn't some of that contracted out too?
5290880	5292880	Because technically he didn't develop the Xbox Live version.
5293880	5294880	Yeah, that was 4J. 4J Studios did.
5295880	5297880	But here's the thing, it's like why, once again,
5298880	5300880	why would he give Microsoft a portion of his profits
5300880	5302880	to have the game on their App Store?
5303880	5308880	Which, let's be honest, they had the whole Windows Live App Store thing
5309880	5311880	and did anyone give a shit about that? Nope.
5312880	5314880	So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits
5315880	5317880	and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?
5318880	5321880	And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.
5321880	5326880	Microsoft charges for updates on your games.
5327880	5330880	And how often is Minecraft updated? About once a week.
5331880	5333880	You know, granted those are beta updates and stuff like that,
5334880	5338880	and you don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.
5339880	5343880	So why would he want to pay money to do that?
5344880	5346880	That's the same reason why his game's not on Steam,
5347880	5349880	because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.
5349880	5351880	Fair question. Okay.
5352880	5354880	Just a few more answers here from Zether.
5355880	5356880	It says Windows 8 is like Vista.
5357880	5359880	Every other release of Windows has been bad for the past few years.
5360880	5363880	I'd rather wait for Windows 9. So they're like Star Trek movies.
5364880	5367880	Seriously, it is. Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.
5368880	5370880	That's a bummer, because that means the next Star Trek movie is going to be bad.
5371880	5372880	And I don't want it to be bad.
5373880	5374880	But maybe.
5375880	5376880	We might, we might.
5376880	5381880	After seeing a few things going on, and it's got Sherlock Holmes in it. I mean, just saying.
5382880	5385880	Wait a minute. I thought Sherlock Holmes was on CBS now.
5386880	5388880	No. No.
5389880	5390880	Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?
5391880	5391880	
5392880	5394880	I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.
5395880	5397880	Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it,
5398880	5399880	so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.
5400880	5403880	But after the little bit I watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.
5403880	5409880	They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson.
5410880	5415880	Nice. Alright, Hitstun says, Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2, and PC users will certainly skip it,
5416880	5420880	and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting.
5421880	5425880	What the hell? UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting? Really?
5426880	5427880	Yeah. Lame.
5428880	5431880	Windows 8 looks pretty bad for a typical PC application that you use with a keyboard and mouse,
5431880	5435880	and if it's like the current Xbox 360 dashboard, it's awful for games, too.
5436880	5438880	It does look like a fine interface for touch screens,
5439880	5442880	and if they decide to make a phone that runs the full PC version of Windows 8, I'd probably go for it.
5443880	5444880	People treat their phones like computers nowadays,
5445880	5449880	so a phone running a full computer OS specialized for touch screens sounds really cool.
5450880	5452880	It's just not going to replace Windows 7 on my desktop.
5453880	5456880	And lastly, Sean L. replies, saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.
5457880	5459880	I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down,
5459880	5461880	and I write software for a living.
5462880	5465880	If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?
5466880	5470880	I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two, maybe.
5471880	5474880	Wow. Very interesting.
5475880	5476880	Alright, that's it for the football question of the week.
5477880	5480880	How about you guys? Windows 8? Yes? No? Maybe so?
5481880	5482880	Never. Never? Why?
5483880	5484880	Unless they make it like Windows 7.
5484880	5491880	Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000
5492880	5495880	into whatever the hell one came after that.
5496880	5497880	XP or Vista?
5498880	5500880	XP. Because I actually had to get a new computer.
5501880	5503880	Because something happened and it fucked up my hard drive.
5504880	5508880	I think my hard drive was already going out because I know that an OS just won't screw it up automatically, but still.
5509880	5510880	I hated Vista.
5511880	5516880	I really like Windows 7, because it took the stuff that was good in Vista,
5517880	5523880	took actually a few bits and pieces from memory management from Linux, and it's pretty solid.
5524880	5530880	On top of that, I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users,
5531880	5538880	and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable,
5538880	5544880	and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.
5545880	5550880	The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5, because I used 6 at school.
5551880	5555880	That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.
5556880	5560880	I mean, it's a really good OS. A lot of people use it.
5561880	5567880	It's got great graphical management, clearly, because that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.
5568880	5577880	However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually is a lot more versatile.
5578880	5582880	You really can do a lot more with Linux. I think that Linux should really replace both of them, but that's just me.
5583880	5585880	That's just me. Don't shoot me or anything.
5586880	5590880	Windows 8, it's basically, Microsoft has this whole micromanagement thing,
5591880	5596880	and Windows 8 is really going to limit, it's basically going to be the PC for idiots.
5596880	5602880	Except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and trying to figure out how to do things, and it's just not working.
5603880	5608880	It's, I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.
5609880	5614880	Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off. That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.
5615880	5621880	Yeah, I just, I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.
5622880	5625880	It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.
5626880	5627880	Loki?
5628880	5633880	Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs, like back in, you know, the 90s and 80s?
5634880	5636880	I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.
5637880	5645880	I mean, seriously, it's like, come on, the people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.
5646880	5650880	You know, kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs,
5650880	5662880	but yet, why are we like, you know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use?
5663880	5666880	I know, it's because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit. I guess that's it.
5667880	5671880	Got that, you know, retirement money burning a hole in the through their pocket, I guess.
5672880	5678880	And Raman, no, a PC for idiots is not a Mac. A PC for idiots is Windows 8. End of story.
5678880	5683880	You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use Mac OS.
5684880	5687880	And no, I would not buy it. I'm not getting a Windows 8.
5688880	5694880	I'm going to take the wait and see approach that somebody else said. I'm going to be honest, this is going to make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.
5695880	5706880	The fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.
5706880	5708880	Shut up.
5709880	5711880	For once, I'm not judging you.
5712880	5718880	If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go about replacing it?
5719880	5725880	Just wait. Wait for Windows 9 or something else.
5726880	5732880	Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.
5732880	5733880	Good job.
5734880	5743880	So there you go. If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5744880	5745880	Let's get back into some news. Loki.
5746880	5757880	One thing. Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.
5757880	5773880	Alright. So, there's a word out there, a phrase out there, that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community. It's called fan service.
5774880	5780880	And what do fans want? Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.
5781880	5783880	Amen to that.
5783880	5792880	Team Ninja, they were saying that, you know, earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.
5793880	5794880	Where's the fun in that?
5795880	5802880	However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.
5802880	5812880	But, the fans who had played the early demos, we got a lot of feedback from them saying, we want bigger breasts. Make the characters more like that.
5813880	5817880	That was kind of surprising, giving, you know, the suggestions to tone down the sexuality.
5818880	5822880	And, so, Team Ninja being Team Ninja.
5823880	5828880	Look, Team Ninja, props for, like, trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.
5828880	5829880	Gold star, you tried.
5830880	5836880	Let's be real, Dead or Alive is all about excess, and, like, if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.
5837880	5838880	Then you have Virtua Fighter.
5839880	5840880	And a really shitty volleyball game.
5841880	5844880	No, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit. I hate Virtua Fighter. I love Dead or Alive.
5845880	5846880	Now, how do you feel about bigger boobs?
5847880	5848880	I'm all for it.
5849880	5850880	Can you imagine?
5851880	5853880	Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio. Even the women want bigger boobs.
5853880	5859880	Can you imagine, like, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts? Fuck that. Nope, not buying it.
5860880	5866880	Well, you know what? But, hey, you know what? I don't want small-chested women to feel, you know, there's fan clubs for that, too.
5867880	5869880	The itty-bitty titty committee. There's fan clubs for that, too.
5870880	5875880	But, in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.
5876880	5877880	It really is.
5878880	5887880	I really think we should, like, you know, ramp up Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 with, like, hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.
5888880	5890880	Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress-up for dudes.
5891880	5897880	That's why I'm saying we throw the orgy and sex and nudity and all the X-rated content in there.
5898880	5899880	It's girly dress-up for dudes.
5900880	5904880	Because then it's girly dress-up to then have them take it off and have sex with each other.
5904880	5906880	You've already got the butt-floss string.
5907880	5911880	Yes, but, you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.
5912880	5918880	I really want there to be a part three with pillow-fight mode. I think that would be a lot of fun.
5919880	5920880	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5921880	5922880	And, like, as you're doing pillow-fight mode, like, pieces of clothing, just, oh.
5923880	5925880	Pillow-fight mode? Using Connect.
5929880	5931880	No, we don't have panda boobs. Shut up.
5931880	5934880	Why are they talking about pandaren in chat?
5935880	5936880	I don't know.
5937880	5938880	Furry boobies.
5939880	5941880	That might take you out of the experience a little bit.
5942880	5943880	Alright.
5944880	5946880	Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5.
5949880	5950880	Moving on.
5951880	5955880	This is the story that just won't go away. Remember 38 Studios and how they closed?
5956880	5960880	And how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?
5961880	5965880	Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits.
5966880	5967880	Because, you know, that's what happens.
5968880	5969880	Those things never leak out.
5970880	5972880	When they liquidate you, they auction all that shit off.
5973880	5978880	So, they were going to sell those on October 23rd when the auction was slated to happen.
5979880	5983880	However, Microsoft is requesting that Rhode Island return those developer kits.
5984880	5985880	Or what?
5986880	5988880	And they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.
5988880	6000880	Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.
6001880	6012880	We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 Studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.
6013880	6014880	Here's something kind of scary though.
6015880	6018880	If you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.
6019880	6021880	You know, you license a game from...
6022880	6028880	So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying,
6029880	6033880	Hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us? Yeah, we need those back.
6034880	6037880	You licensed it, so you need to send them back.
6038880	6043880	Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have? Yeah, well, the license is up. Yank.
6045880	6049880	Fun. But yeah, seriously, those XDKs do get out there.
6050880	6052880	I would know from personal experience.
6053880	6055880	And how much approximately would one set you back?
6056880	6064880	Not very much anymore because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and J tags are pretty out there, there's not much use for XDKs anymore.
6064880	6068880	Like 300, 400. Oh, that's not too bad.
6069880	6073880	I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.
6074880	6075880	Interesting.
6076880	6078880	Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer.
6079880	6082880	Well, I was actually playing with my iPad. Yeah, I can tell.
6083880	6084880	Pay attention! Hey!
6085880	6090880	I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class. You can't. How about a really trippy ass game?
6091880	6092880	Called Middens.
6093880	6094880	Kitten Middens.
6095880	6101880	I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.
6102880	6113880	It basically is an indie RPG, so it's got, it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy ass backgrounds.
6113880	6124880	So it looks like you're running, you know, head first through a combination of a Dali or even, you know, going back to Hieronymus Bosch.
6125880	6127880	Yeah, I know. I'm going all art history on you guys.
6128880	6133880	It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.
6134880	6139880	Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.
6140880	6146880	Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this, because it's really fucking weird.
6147880	6148880	Well, at least you get a gun.
6149880	6151880	And you can try it out for free.
6152880	6153880	I like free.
6154880	6156880	Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.
6158880	6160880	Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.
6161880	6164880	You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.
6165880	6166880	Oh, that's right. You're not here next week.
6167880	6168880	That's right. I'm going to be at Disneyland.
6169880	6171880	It's all right. She won't play it anyways by next week.
6172880	6177880	She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.
6178880	6179880	No, I'm just playing for Becky.
6180880	6182880	There you go. We should start a foundation.
6183880	6185880	We should. We should start a foundation.
6186880	6187880	Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.
6188880	6190880	We'll play Mass Effect for money.
6190880	6200880	It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation. I shouldn't. I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.
6201880	6204880	I don't play 24-7. I basically play Mass Effect once a week.
6205880	6206880	Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is...
6207880	6208880	Pandas! Shut up.
6209880	6210880	My bad.
6211880	6212880	Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.
6213880	6218880	Actually, Bobby Black Wolf is volunteering. He needs that foundation, so he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.
6218880	6220880	That means that he has to come over to my house.
6221880	6228880	Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.
6229880	6229880	
6230880	6231880	And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.
6232880	6238880	The Church of Garish Foundation. Thank you, ass-deft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos. Now they're little asses.
6239880	6243880	Also, AlphaKananagram asked about me having an iPad. Yeah, I didn't actually bring it up on the show.
6243880	6257880	Dan traded his Transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card, power supply, and got Borderlands 2, and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad.
6258880	6259880	So he made it up to me.
6260880	6261880	He traded a Transformer? Like a doll?
6262880	6266880	No, he traded his shitty android shit.
6267880	6268880	He didn't like it anyway.
6268880	6272880	I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.
6273880	6274880	We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.
6275880	6276880	Alright, I get it now, sorry.
6277880	6279880	But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway. He was going to sell it.
6280880	6282880	Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.
6283880	6288880	But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it, and he was going to sell it anyway, so he got me an iPad instead.
6289880	6291880	What do you think this is, RobG4?
6292880	6293880	I'm just a pretty face.
6293880	6300880	Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day. I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Rep.
6301880	6304880	The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.
6305880	6310880	I mean, seriously, he just sits there and is like, okay, what retarded thing can I say next?
6311880	6313880	Funny joke, hahaha, I'm funny.
6314880	6317880	And they're just like, what the fuck did that have to do with anything?
6317880	6325880	You know, it's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.
6326880	6327880	Alright.
6328880	6338880	And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android. I've used it. I've given it a chance.
6339880	6341880	I hate Windows tablets even more.
6342880	6346880	iOS has what I want to do, and Wacom loves it. The end.
6347880	6353880	DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see. What is the old saying? She's a hater, and guess what she's gonna do?
6354880	6355880	I'm gonna hate!
6357880	6358880	Exactly.
6359880	6361880	Y'all can bite my tuchus.
6362880	6365880	Uh, BlackWolf in our chatroom says S3 greater than iPhone. You know it's hilarious.
6366880	6366880	
6367880	6370880	You know it's hilarious. No, this is what's hilarious. iPhone 5 comes out, right?
6371880	6378880	My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old ass Blackberry. He has like one of the first Blackberries.
6379880	6383880	Only a long time ago. It was an old ass phone, right? He finally decides he's gonna join the current generation of phones.
6384880	6387880	So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches? Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.
6388880	6394880	Bravo. Bravo. Wise choice. Keeper. He's a keeper.
6395880	6399880	Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.
6400880	6407880	But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile.
6408880	6414880	Which apparently is treated him very well over the years, so he didn't want to, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.
6415880	6418880	I love my iPhone 4S. I really do.
6419880	6421880	There's several people in chat going, Alan is awesome.
6421880	6428880	He could technically get a phone and then unlock it and have it, I think, work on that service, an iPhone.
6429880	6439880	I heard T-Mobile was actually doing, sorry, I'm eating crackers live on air. I heard T-Mobile was actually doing some type of advertising campaign targeting jailbroken iPhone users.
6440880	6450880	Because I have a, well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's, actually it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.
6451880	6465880	You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is 30 bucks for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use, and even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data.
6466880	6481880	I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3. I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever. The only thing, the reason why I like it is in a whole what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that, let me play with that.
6482880	6486880	And he can do the same thing with my iPhone, right? He probably uses my iPad more than I do.
6486880	6498880	But the reason, the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T, we don't get the free text messages, and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that, so that's the one thing I don't like.
6499880	6501880	I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?
6502880	6503880	I do.
6504880	6505880	Well, way to go. Great provider.
6506880	6509880	Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.
6510880	6511880	I have a cheap plan, 30 bucks a month.
6512880	6513880	Alright.
6514880	6515880	T-Mobile.
6516880	6518880	Moving on. Loki, you got a story.
6519880	6531880	Alright. Borderlands 2. There's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.
6532880	6544880	They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on, I forget what fucking service it is.
6545880	6549880	It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.
6549880	6561880	And when you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff, you know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.
6562880	6573880	So your badass rank goes away, all your, not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.
6573880	6583880	Because the way the badass points work is all of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters.
6584880	6590880	Or all of your characters. And then you get perks like, you know, plus 1% to your damage or something like that.
6591880	6592880	And it's spread across all your characters.
6592880	6608880	So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people if it has happened to you that you submit your save and stuff so they can take a look at it.
6609880	6610880	And they're investigating.
6611880	6615880	Mm2k in our chat room wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?
6616880	6617880	Yes, it's all platforms.
6618880	6619880	Uh oh.
6619880	6626880	It's because it's tied to, it's not Premium Club, it's, fuck I forget what it's called.
6627880	6629880	They have it on the front page there. You can sign up for it.
6630880	6639880	And it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get and once you've signed up they give you one additional key.
6642880	6643880	So they have that.
6644880	6649880	Honestly, if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up, I mean, I think there's save it or not.
6650880	6652880	Throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families.
6653880	6654880	Does that work so well for other people?
6655880	6663880	Exactly. I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to.
6664880	6667880	Not that anyone would do that, but you can.
6668880	6674880	And not only does it erase your badass points, it's basically everything that's tied to your account.
6675880	6680880	So all your skins and faces that you've unlocked, and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions, are gone.
6681880	6685880	And some of those, there may be no way to get those back. So that kinda sucks.
6686880	6691880	Alright. Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.
6692880	6693880	There was another one?
6693880	6695880	There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.
6696880	6698880	And it was about New Super Mario Bros. 2 and the DLC.
6699880	6710880	The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros. 2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.
6711880	6712880	Wow, they're not late to the party?
6713880	6714880	No. Well, you know what?
6715880	6721880	Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is a-okay arriving late to this party.
6721880	6728880	But, you know, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra, and some of the levels that will be available.
6729880	6735880	GoGo as Gold Mario Pack. Three gold Mario themed courses up to 30,000 coins.
6736880	6740880	Challenge the Record A Pack. It will post the top scores on the game's website.
6741880	6747880	And Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels. Those will all be in the Coin Rush mode.
6747880	6751880	So, are they, like, legitimizing Asshole Mario? Because that's kind of awesome, if true.
6752880	6764880	October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan. 200 yen each. I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind. And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.
6765880	6776880	Once again, like, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have. You know, kind of crossing Nintendo, like, Mario with LittleBigPlanet. Can you imagine if they did that?
6777880	6787880	Like, first party Nintendo games, but like, you know, like a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, in like a LittleBigPlanet setting where you design your own levels and games and shit.
6787880	6803880	Nintendo would never let that happen, because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters. Because people, like, if Mario, like, Mario Mario was in LittleBigPlanet, people would be building levels that's like, Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that. And Nintendo would never let that happen.
6804880	6813880	Well, no, it wouldn't necessarily be like that. It would be just like, um, you know, you design your own levels. Not necessarily like you design a giant penis. Although, you could probably build a penis at the time.
6813880	6817880	Mario sucks a penis. That would be a level that would get uploaded instantly.
6818880	6833880	Well, that's why there's peer review. They can label that stuff. I mean, come on. You can't just let a few people ruin a great idea. Because there's always gonna be some dude out there. I'm sure there are people that have dedicated their lives to, I'm gonna create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.
6834880	6843880	I think I have a rule about design. Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm gonna have to run this by Dark Sakura. So, you ready? Tell me if this is a true statement or not.
6844880	6852880	This is a very zen statement. I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria. Where there is design, there is penis.
6854880	6855880	No.
6855880	6856880	What do you mean no?
6856880	6858880	When there...
6861880	6865880	Where there are immature minds, there is penis.
6865880	6867880	And where isn't there immature minds?
6868880	6872880	Clearly not in the internet. The internet is quite mature. Thank you very much.
6873880	6875880	Think about it. I want you to go ask your teacher.
6876880	6880880	I heard this on an internet radio show. Where there is design, there is penis. What do you think?
6881880	6884880	He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.
6884880	6886880	That is so true, is what he'll say.
6887880	6891880	No, he'll roll his eyes. I know he would do it. And he'd just go, what?
6892880	6894880	Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.
6895880	6898880	I've seen his art. It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.
6899880	6900880	Yet.
6901880	6902880	No.
6902880	6904880	Where there is design, there is penis.
6904880	6906880	No, I sense an art book possibility.
6909880	6913880	Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.
6913880	6914880	Thank you!
6915880	6916880	It will be rated M.
6917880	6922880	There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was, guess who drew the penis.
6923880	6928880	And somebody would take her on a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.
6929880	6931880	And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.
6932880	6933880	And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.
6934880	6938880	We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire. Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama. Shut up.
6939880	6942880	We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.
6943880	6944880	Oh, that game.
6945880	6946880	Yeah, we would do that.
6947880	6949880	But I have to tell you, it wasn't Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.
6950880	6954880	And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.
6955880	6956880	I took a picture of it.
6957880	6958880	There you go.
6959880	6960880	Do you have any other fanboy wank ideas, Loki?
6961880	6962880	No, that's it.
6963880	6967880	I would really dig a game with a level editor.
6968880	6971880	Anything from Nintendo. I mean, maybe not Ice Climber or something like that.
6971880	6980880	Mario Kart, Mario, Zelda. Not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.
6981880	6982880	That'd be awesome.
6983880	6989880	Alright. Black Wolf says excite bike. Can you do a penis and excite bike? It would probably be very difficult.
6990880	6991880	No, because they have, you know, it's...
6992880	6994880	I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.
6994880	7002880	Well, I remember that you could draw things in excite bike based on letter.
7003880	7005880	Like, you would choose a letter and that would be the...
7006880	7007880	So you could technically make a corset with penis.
7008880	7010880	Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.
7011880	7015880	So, think about it. Think about it. Or don't think about it.
7016880	7020880	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, alright, true story here.
7020880	7024880	When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.
7025880	7031880	So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.
7032880	7035880	Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.
7036880	7041880	The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.
7042880	7045880	We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.
7045880	7049880	I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the fries penis on the Orange Elder Radio website.
7050880	7051880	Nobody cares. Alright.
7052880	7053880	It's got hairy balls.
7054880	7055880	Oh, hooray. Hooray.
7061880	7064880	I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.
7065880	7072880	I've had a really crazy week. I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.
7073880	7079880	Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.
7080880	7083880	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first and pull out an email that she thinks, hey.
7084880	7084880	
7085880	7085880	
7086880	7086880	
7087880	7087880	
7088880	7089880	It's kind of sticky.
7090880	7095880	Good evening. I have to object to something Dark Soccer said on last week's OLR.
7096880	7097880	Well, too fucking bad, Skip. No, I'm kidding.
7097880	7102880	Last week, Dark Soccer called Dan's reference to the fake game, Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition, reprehensible.
7103880	7104880	I find this to be abhorrent.
7105880	7110880	How is Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference, Beaten Groovy, the Ike Turner Experience?
7111880	7111880	
7112880	7117880	In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.
7118880	7126880	Britney's Dance, Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent.
7127880	7128880	Ew!
7129880	7131880	Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.
7132880	7135880	That is a list list in development there.
7136880	7137880	Yeah, we're going to need to do that when you come back.
7138880	7140880	Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game.
7141880	7142880	Next email.
7143880	7148880	Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game I hope to see launched on the Xbox 720 or Xbox Lube or whatever.
7149880	7150880	Next email.
7151880	7154880	First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.
7154880	7164880	I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey collection when I tried to redeem the 30 day voucher.
7165880	7170880	The system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it. Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?
7171880	7174880	That's a great question for Sony. I don't know.
7175880	7177880	I don't think so because it's auto renewing.
7178880	7180880	You could turn that off though. You could turn off the auto renewing.
7180880	7184880	You could turn off the auto renewing. They want you to, you know, the catch is they want you to do that.
7185880	7188880	The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.
7189880	7198880	Hold on though. Tip, get one of those pre-paid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.
7199880	7202880	Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.
7203880	7208880	Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the MacFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?
7208880	7210880	Fuck if I know.
7211880	7218880	The answer is I don't. I wanted the Sylvanas figure. That was it because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.
7219880	7224880	Believe it or not, I don't have any of that stuff. The last like game figure I bought is that Balthier from Final Fantasy 12 because...
7225880	7228880	You did have the Final Fantasy 12 clock. No, the 11 o'clock.
7229880	7230880	You had the 11 o'clock.
7231880	7232880	That was a gift. I don't think I bought that.
7232880	7240880	Well, to finish reading, I don't really play the game myself, but I did get the Worgen Death Knight with Swift Griffin set because, hey, Worgen with a Griffin.
7241880	7242880	Keep having a good show, Robert M.
7243880	7254880	Now, here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards. I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.
7255880	7260880	Tigerclaw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.
7260880	7266880	SGA 100 Matt says, the thing is that by law, they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto charge thing, of course.
7267880	7272880	So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.
7273880	7274880	So, yeah.
7277880	7282880	Next email. And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.
7283880	7284880	So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping.
7285880	7290880	Sylvanas figure. Oh, Garris. Garris. I really want the Garris. Garris greater than Sylvanas. Just saying.
7291880	7292880	Yes, ma'am.
7293880	7294880	Or a plushie panda. Actually, I have a plushie panda.
7295880	7296880	Why not all three?
7297880	7300880	I have a plush panda. No, for real. Okay. I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid.
7301880	7307880	I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant. And when I was in fourth grade, my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off.
7307880	7311880	So that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck.
7312880	7317880	And I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon.
7318880	7319880	True story.
7320880	7321880	Okay.
7322880	7324880	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7325880	7328880	Here's my review of Borderlands 2. Awesome for the PC.
7329880	7335880	My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.
7335880	7340880	Then I played it on my gaming PC. Blood and ashes. It's incredible.
7341880	7346880	It's beautiful to look at the art. It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.
7347880	7351880	The huge levels. The game improves upon the first in every way there is.
7352880	7357880	The voice acting is great. The dialogue is genius. The clap and claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.
7358880	7359880	I highly recommend it.
7360880	7367880	What system is Loki playing the game on and has he played it on a gaming PC? Your loyal turtle in Philly?
7368880	7371880	Xbox 360. No I have not because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.
7372880	7373880	You'll wait until Steam sale anyway, right?
7374880	7377880	If my laptop doesn't run it then there's no reason for me to buy it.
7378880	7380880	No reason but it doesn't mean I won't do it.
7380880	7389880	Well I mean it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought. It was like 7 bucks for Portland State.
7390880	7395880	And that would be something I'd have to buy the game of the year edition. I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.
7396880	7399880	Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?
7400880	7401880	Let's shall.
7402880	7403880	That was the last email right?
7403880	7404880	Yes.
7405880	7412880	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week. And you should, dammit. I want to get more emails, dammit.
7413880	7414880	And you can read them.
7415880	7416880	Dammit.
7417880	7418880	Dammit.
7419880	7420880	Oh god please don't.
7421880	7422880	All this is bad.
7423880	7424880	Here is justice.
7425880	7426880	Here is punishment.
7428880	7429880	This is fucked up.
7430880	7453880	Um, my FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raichan. Which I actually still need some kind of money for.
7454880	7458880	You weren't able to get that. You weren't able to get that and find that.
7459880	7460880	Gone.
7460880	7468880	I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key. But I've lost my 18 year old Bats Maru keychain.
7469880	7475880	The one that I've had. It's metal. Actual metal. I've had it for years. I moved out here with it. It's gone.
7476880	7477880	Very sad about that.
7478880	7479880	But I do have a Hello Kitty house key.
7480880	7481880	That's black.
7481880	7482880	Um.
7483880	7485880	Yeah, just not please.
7487880	7488880	FU.
7488880	7491880	FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.
7492880	7493880	Done.
7494880	7496880	Fucking the people that drift into other lanes.
7497880	7505880	Because it seems like all the time. Like driving here today there's like four or five of them. Like seriously, people pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.
7506880	7509880	Like texting or just plain stupid.
7509880	7511880	Urgh, I'm in another lane now.
7511880	7512880	I hate it.
7514880	7522880	My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night but today. And headaches can be very disabling. Especially when you're really busy.
7523880	7527880	And I wonder if it's not a stress caused headache. FU to the fact that I've had a lot of stress.
7528880	7534880	I'm just very very very very very very very busy right now. Now granted, don't cry for me Argentina. I'm the one that signed up for all this stuff.
7535880	7542880	So you know I have no one to blame quote on quote about myself and I know they'll be great rewards but it's just. Oh my god.
7543880	7551880	So, um, FU to the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland. It had nothing to do with Disneyland or work. It was all here back at home.
7552880	7559880	Um, nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip.
7559880	7566880	However, everything happens for a reason. What is the kill that makes us stronger? La la la la la la la la. So whatever.
7567880	7573880	Why can't everything be perfect 24-7? Damn it. And easy. I like easy. Because I'm lazy.
7574880	7580880	Yes, also I had nothing to do with VOG. That's important. Thank you Bobby. If it had something to do with VOG you'd know.
7581880	7594880	Alright, moving on. A few more news stories for you guys and then twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and the skype line. Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Laundry Deal on skype. Loki.
7595880	7603880	So in part A we talked about how NBA Live 13 got cancelled because the game wasn't very good and they just needed more time.
7604880	7615880	Well, here's a game the EA released that, and you know we always talk about roster updates and make that kind of joke and stuff, but it literally was a roster update.
7616880	7631880	FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii. They actually, there was an article that was run on Nintendo Gamer and apparently looking at the game.
7631880	7643880	And I guess Wayne Rooney, they've replaced him or I guess with one of Lionel Messi as one of the examples of just the simple changes in the game.
7644880	7650880	Basically the games are identical except for the cover star has been changed. The title is FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.
7650880	7661880	They've done the roster updates and changed the uniforms and added I guess the clubs that they've updated and stuff in there.
7662880	7670880	Aside from that, the game is exactly the same. So that's kind of disappointing. I guess they figured that no one would notice.
7671880	7674880	I mean, put minimal effort into it.
7675880	7689880	Yes, so very interesting. And there was I guess a review on the official Nintendo Magazine UK that they were kind of talking about those as well.
7690880	7695880	And it's just funny.
7696880	7700880	Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual? 60 bucks?
7701880	7712880	I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think. 50 or 40. But yeah, it's still pretty full. It's not like a $20 game or something like that.
7713880	7724880	Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year. So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.
7725880	7733880	It's just decent. It's bad. I mean, it's pretty blatant that they would do that.
7734880	7741880	Alright, let's go to this last story here which is about, and this is one of those things where I'm like please stop, don't, no.
7742880	7746880	This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody. It's going to just kill the industry. Watch.
7746880	7756880	It's about Ubisoft. Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free to play games for the marketplace. Now that in itself is not a bad thing.
7757880	7766880	But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions. And yes I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction.
7767880	7769880	I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron.
7769880	7785880	On this particular article, yeah. Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free to play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free to play model.
7786880	7792880	The next generation will offer more and more item based content. This will benefit our game's profitability.
7793880	7802880	No it won't. When we start rejecting that bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, no.
7803880	7804880	Do not want.
7805880	7814880	Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible. It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character, level up a little faster.
7814880	7820880	And then some of them disguise, hey, here's a mission. We're gonna get some more money for free.
7821880	7825880	You know, if you find these 10 things, you get all these money, all these different monies.
7826880	7835880	And so yeah, that's not a good example of DLC. Also EA, very notable for charging for cheats.
7835880	7847880	One of the, one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer. Like, you know, to basically cheat.
7848880	7852880	And I'm sure those things sell like crazy. FIFA and FIFA's got, you know, the whole ultimate thing.
7853880	7856880	I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off.
7857880	7868880	Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the, um, the DLC for, uh, the other stuff.
7869880	7870880	Don't encourage them.
7871880	7872880	So I bought like two packs, but anyway.
7873880	7880880	Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs. So yeah, I don't see a downside for them.
7881880	7886880	People are going to go, oh, those are terrible. Why are you doing? It's going to ruin the industry. And then people buy them.
7887880	7892880	So that's why there's DLC in those games. The free to play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.
7893880	7901880	I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House. I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount. People pay $25 for a mount.
7902880	7903880	Never have done that.
7903880	7907880	That's too much. I know lots of people that have done it. Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.
7908880	7914880	And hey, you know what? It's your money. Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose. But I just don't, like the price of the expansion was $40.
7915880	7920880	Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion. I don't get that logic at all.
7921880	7929880	The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet. No, there were two charity pets and that's it. That's all I bought.
7929880	7939880	I like that. There's a comment on the story here. Basically they coined the phrase pay to pay. So that's what we're going to call these games. Pay to pay games.
7940880	7949880	Pay to pay games. I like that. And I think these should be called out. And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.
7950880	7968880	You know? Saints Row the Third, perfect example of DLC gone wrong. If it's locked in the game, if it's like locked costumes in the game, not additional stuff that they, hey we made this new character class or something like that, that's just, it's bullshit.
7968880	7981880	You shouldn't have to pay for that stuff. And yes I understand you don't have to pay for it, but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought, but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want.
7982880	7992880	And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing. Like all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing. Like really? Really?
7992880	8009880	I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight. We are going to go to the Skype line. The Skype line is open right now. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We will start taking calls here. Go ahead and give us a call.
8010880	8016880	You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about. That is just fine as well.
8016880	8030880	Meanwhile we'll also go to our Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those. And also, Loki you'll probably have some last minute news right?
8031880	8032880	Noooo.
8033880	8034880	You don't have last minute news tonight.
8035880	8037880	No I don't have any last minute news.
8038880	8044880	Oh my gosh. Alright well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones. Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8044880	8045880	Legend of Zaku here.
8046880	8047880	Hey, what's up?
8048880	8053880	Nothing much. Just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed. Trying to get in one call.
8054880	8067880	But yeah, I just wanted to bring up a little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.
8068880	8071880	We did talk about this in part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?
8071880	8090880	So I don't know, I'm kind of puzzling the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms, and yet he's having a fit with Microsoft again.
8090880	8102880	So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back. I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others. They're just the same.
8103880	8105880	Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?
8105880	8120880	Yeah, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different platform.
8121880	8127880	Hey kettle, this is pot. Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, I'd be great.
8128880	8129880	Stop being rude, Rob.
8130880	8132880	Again, this is pot. That's P-O-T.
8133880	8134880	It's Zaku.
8135880	8137880	Did you say black or back?
8138880	8141880	Back. The pot calling the kettle back.
8142880	8145880	It's the pot calling the kettle black. The phrase.
8146880	8148880	The saying is usually the pot calling the kettle black, but that's okay.
8149880	8173880	Alright, yeah, it's one L, but you get the idea. It's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.
8173880	8182880	So, in other words, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of asteroid block complaining about another. That's pretty much what it is.
8183880	8188880	Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.
8189880	8190880	What was that?
8191880	8194880	I said the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that.
8195880	8196880	Unless you're Google.
8197880	8199880	You have a different set of rules than Google.
8200880	8207880	Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps.
8208880	8217880	Here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either. He contracted or somebody bought the rights to it.
8218880	8224880	He didn't really do it for the 360. Somebody else did. So is he really supporting the closed platform?
8224880	8229880	I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand. He's representing the game itself.
8230880	8239880	The fact that I don't think it's not as relevant, the fact that he contracted, he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform.
8240880	8250880	But in the end of the day, it's still his game that it just went beyond PC. It went beyond like a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.
8251880	8262880	Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.
8263880	8277880	And that's where I see the hypocrisy. You basically greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.
8277880	8282880	And I don't see where it adds up. I don't.
8283880	8287880	Alright. Well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8288880	8299880	Let me see. This just came in to Kotaku today. 38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG, won't be facing federal charges.
8300880	8316880	So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds, even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.
8317880	8332880	And it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself.
8333880	8340880	From what I'm hearing, Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game.
8340880	8346880	Don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you, or really to do any professional project for you.
8347880	8366880	Exactly. That's it. At the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who work their asses off at the studios trying on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.
8366880	8375880	And none of them have been held accountable in that sense. They walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.
8376880	8380880	Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?
8381880	8400880	People's Court would have been better, but I'm not surprised that there will be lawsuits over this. Curt Schilling, he's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.
8400880	8411880	One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just going to gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't making payroll.
8412880	8425880	So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities. So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.
8426880	8432880	Alright, Zach, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much. Take care. Have a good night. Bye.
8433880	8445880	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to call. Just missed one. Sometimes people will call and wait and hope to get through. I just missed it. Sorry about that.
8446880	8460880	Alright. Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing. You might have pinged out for like, oh man, that pisses me off. I didn't get to see the comments and chat to the call me back comment.
8461880	8465880	I do see one from Act Deaf that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.
8468880	8470880	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8471880	8473880	What up, guys? It's Zeno from the OKC. How you guys doing?
8473880	8475880	Geez, Zenocor. Haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?
8476880	8478880	Well, you know, staying employed. Same old, same old.
8479880	8480880	That's a good thing. What's on your mind, buddy?
8481880	8483880	I've been playing a bit of PlanetSide 2, actually.
8484880	8485880	Ooh, alright. How's that going for you?
8486880	8498880	Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this. Now, every single base is different, tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game is going to be free on release. So why not?
8499880	8501880	Wait, this is a totally free game?
8501880	8505880	Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.
8506880	8508880	Oh, of course, of course. That's how things are going.
8509880	8516880	Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?
8517880	8522880	Well, you know, Ubisoft's got Ubisoft. I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.
8522880	8531880	Mm-hmm. I did not realize that PlanetSide was originally 2003, the first one. That's really old.
8532880	8534880	Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making, the E3 2001 when I went.
8535880	8535880	
8536880	8542880	And it looked damn good then. You know, just the playability and everything else. And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?
8543880	8543880	
8544880	8549880	And then here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up. They got at least three years with the development of this one based off what it looks like.
8549880	8553880	Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?
8554880	8555880	It's closed beta right now.
8556880	8557880	Ah, okay, I gotcha.
8558880	8564880	But you can buy your way in. You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.
8565880	8568880	And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.
8569880	8575880	So what is it that draws you to PlanetSide? Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day. What is it that draws you to this game versus...
8576880	8578880	Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?
8579880	8584880	Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly. I played the first PlanetSide, I played Earth and Beyond, I played a whole bunch of them myself.
8585880	8589880	You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi planet-y space games. Is that a thing?
8590880	8591880	Well, it's one of my things, yeah.
8592880	8599880	Okay. Well, no, I think that's cool. I just noticed that little trend going on there. Well, what is it about PlanetSide specifically that draws you to that series?
8599880	8611880	It's more like a full military exercise than it is just a first-person shooter. It encompasses not just vehicles, armored vehicles, but logistics.
8612880	8619880	Some strategy, you know, actual rewarding of leadership. If people are actually doing a decent job leading a unit, they get rewarded for it.
8620880	8628880	Then, you know, I somewhat flash back a bit to my days in the Air Force. I can actually use some of the stuff I learned doing air support.
8629880	8634880	Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.
8635880	8643880	I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide 2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this. I had no idea.
8644880	8657880	Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal that the sequel's title was PlanetSide Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.
8657880	8661880	Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?
8662880	8664880	I think he's depressed.
8665880	8667880	Hey, wait a minute. I have a live journal. You shut up.
8668880	8675880	He just recently posted to it, too. August 11th, 2012. That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.
8676880	8678880	PlanetSide 2, what is it, and why do I want to play it?
8678880	8688880	PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE. The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.
8689880	8693880	When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.
8694880	8701880	All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles that aren't forced into tiny little arenas like other FPS games.
8701880	8708880	Each player chooses to play on one of three empires. It takes place in the distant future, and each empire has a unique play style.
8709880	8717880	Probably the closest comparison would be a game like Starcraft 2, where each of the different races has a very unique play style and feel to it. Interesting.
8718880	8723880	I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry. It's a very interesting way to put up your press releases.
8724880	8727880	Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.
8728880	8729880	Good to know. Good to know.
8729880	8732880	Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?
8733880	8745880	Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC. I'm really loving FTL. That game is freaking amazing.
8746880	8748880	And Dark Souls, oh my gosh, that game is ruthless.
8748880	8762880	I know, as all games should be. This namby-pamby, you know, you leveled twice, so you win. Bullcrap. Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.
8763880	8765880	You press the button in time with the music. You win an internet.
8766880	8767880	Yeah, exactly. Screw that.
8768880	8771880	Alright, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8772880	8773880	Nah, that's pretty much it. Y'all have a good show.
8774880	8775880	You too, buddy. Take care. Don't be a stranger.
8776880	8777880	Alright, later.
8778880	8782880	Well, let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?
8783880	8783880	
8784880	8785880	Hey, Shane. How you doing?
8786880	8786880	
8787880	8788880	Did you have fun on the live Hoard House this week?
8789880	8791880	No, I was too distracted playing WoW.
8792880	8794880	Aww. How's WoW going for you?
8795880	8805880	I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90, so I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else, ever.
8806880	8807880	What level is your main pet?
8808880	8815880	I keep rotating all of them out. I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now and I've got like almost 100 pets.
8816880	8819880	What is the name? Oh my. You've leveled all of your pets to 5?
8820880	8822880	I'm starting to. I've got maybe about 10 of them done.
8823880	8825880	What do you name your pets? Do you custom name all your pets?
8826880	8829880	No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.
8830880	8833880	I've named mine after Mass Effect characters. Mine are better.
8834880	8837880	No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?
8838880	8839880	It doesn't make sense.
8840880	8842880	I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.
8843880	8844880	You named your dog Helo?
8845880	8847880	Yes, but that's adorable.
8850880	8854880	Rob, did I tell you? I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character.
8855880	8856880	Which one? I had a few.
8857880	8858880	Cuddles.
8859880	8860880	I named my hyjal cub Cuddles.
8861880	8864880	What was Shane's? Shane had a cute character name too. It was like...
8865880	8866880	Fluffles.
8866880	8867880	Fluffles. That was it.
8868880	8869880	Well, maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.
8870880	8872880	Alright, there you go. Shane, would that be happy for you?
8873880	8874880	That'd be okay.
8875880	8877880	Shane, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
8878880	8882880	I picked up, because it was free, DJ Max Ray on iOS and it's amazing.
8883880	8884880	Apps are freaking lutely amazing.
8885880	8889880	Dark Sakura immediately picked up her iPad and started going into the app store.
8890880	8892880	You should have seen that. The minute those words left your mouth, she's like,
8892880	8894880	shit, picked up her iPad.
8895880	8896880	Stop judging me.
8897880	8898880	What was that?
8899880	8900880	I told Rob to stop judging me.
8901880	8904880	I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.
8905880	8906880	I had a headache.
8907880	8909880	That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.
8910880	8911880	I've been leveling my character.
8912880	8914880	It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.
8915880	8916880	I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?
8917880	8919880	Is it D Space? Whatever.
8919880	8925880	I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not, but it was like number six on the list of things that found.
8926880	8927880	It didn't make any sense to me.
8928880	8931880	Like it picked up Rerave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.
8932880	8933880	Rerave's not bad.
8934880	8937880	No, it's not. I'm not saying it is, but DJ Max is better.
8938880	8941880	Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.
8942880	8948880	Yeah, I think it just stretches, but it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad, but it's just so freaking good.
8949880	8955880	Like I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it, and I can't quit playing that as well.
8956880	8958880	So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now too.
8959880	8960880	I don't want to get yelled at again.
8961880	8962880	I am not buying this game.
8963880	8966880	Good job. Don't buy it. Don't give in to him. He's a jerk.
8967880	8977880	It's free unless you want the song packs, and you can get a pretty good deal, like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out, and then you get some extra note skin.
8977880	8980880	What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?
8981880	8983880	I don't know. It sounds stupid. Get DJ Max.
8984880	8986880	With the little anime chick, she commands me.
8987880	8989880	The anime chick wants a dollar. Don't buy it, Rob. Don't give in to the...
8990880	8993880	I don't see DJ Max. I seriously don't. Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps. Hello.
8994880	8998880	I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?
8999880	9000880	Yeah.
9001880	9003880	I don't listen to her. How many years has it been?
9004880	9005880	Rob?
9005880	9007880	Okay, I got it. DJ Max Ray, right?
9008880	9009880	Yeah.
9010880	9011880	Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?
9012880	9014880	Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?
9015880	9016880	Yes, and I agree three times.
9017880	9018880	The rules have changed.
9019880	9020880	I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.
9021880	9033880	Make sure to create an account too. It takes like two seconds. You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise, and that really sucks if you do that.
9033880	9035880	I'll have to download it later.
9036880	9037880	I don't understand. I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says...
9038880	9039880	It's doing the same thing to me.
9040880	9041880	...the terms and conditions have changed. I haven't heard that that's happened.
9042880	9043880	The conditions have changed!
9047880	9049880	I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.
9050880	9053880	There is some kind of dumb over there right now.
9054880	9055880	Shut up, Rob.
9056880	9057880	Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.
9058880	9060880	You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.
9060880	9065880	By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.
9066880	9067880	Oh yeah, the Jane Shepherd.
9068880	9070880	Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.
9071880	9072880	I was actually a little surprised too.
9075880	9078880	I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.
9081880	9083880	Call it Shepherd Commander.
9084880	9087880	Oh, Alan is yelling from the other room. That is actually a thing.
9088880	9091880	It won't let me download it because I can't get past that stupid pop-up box.
9092880	9093880	That's what it did to me. I'm going to try it on my phone.
9094880	9095880	Do you have fingers? Because usually that's all it takes.
9096880	9100880	You have sold me on the Wonders of the Eye awesome platform.
9101880	9102880	I am a believer now.
9104880	9107880	Wow, I can't find the title that I'm looking for.
9108880	9111880	Oh, and I have to agree to these change conditions.
9111880	9113880	And I can't shut down my iPad.
9114880	9118880	Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.
9119880	9122880	Shut up. No one asked you.
9124880	9125880	I'm actually trying it on my phone.
9126880	9130880	Ray Deer in our chat room says it's Tap Sonic but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.
9131880	9139880	That's exactly right. And it's got, well I mean it's all real DJ Maxx music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.
9139880	9141880	Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?
9142880	9145880	No, it's freaking DJ Maxx.
9146880	9149880	Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.
9152880	9153880	So I think it's that app.
9154880	9155880	Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.
9156880	9159880	It's fine. Alright, what else did you want to talk about tonight?
9160880	9165880	I was mostly going to talk about DJ Maxx and then some stupidity happened and so...
9166880	9168880	Well, was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Maxx?
9169880	9170880	That you didn't get out there?
9171880	9181880	Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts.
9182880	9189880	And then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability.
9190880	9196880	And then there are, I want to say, five more packs of songs that you can get.
9196880	9201880	So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.
9202880	9204880	So it's really, really good and everybody should get it that can.
9205880	9210880	Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.
9211880	9218880	Alright, sounds good and I'm still pet battling and Pokemon is this week and I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.
9219880	9222880	Well, you're just going to be the happiest person ever. It's like Christmas for you.
9223880	9224880	I know, this week is great.
9225880	9226880	Well, congratulations.
9227880	9229880	Now all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.
9230880	9233880	I wish I was having a good week. Alright, well Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.
9234880	9235880	Alright, go end it. Bye.
9236880	9239880	Alright, let me, oh, I've got to go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.
9240880	9244880	Thanks to all those that called in tonight. If you didn't get through, tough. Try again next week.
9245880	9248880	Or send us an email with your thoughts. 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9249880	9254880	Orange Riot wanted to point out in the chat room about DJ Max, it's key sounded and that is pretty important as well.
9255880	9259880	It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music like some other apps that are out there.
9260880	9264880	It actually does have the key sounds in it. That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.
9265880	9268880	It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.
9269880	9274880	Tigerclaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight and he sent us some tweets about this one.
9275880	9279880	First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.
9280880	9286880	I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out? I don't know.
9287880	9292880	There are quite a few, two this year. I think two, is there two last year?
9293880	9299880	Lego Harry Potter 2 last year and Lego Star Wars last year. Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.
9300880	9304880	Lego Lord of the Rings is this year. Actually three if you include that Lego City Stories.
9305880	9310880	Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.
9311880	9312880	And they already have Lego Batman 2.
9313880	9317880	Let's see, Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.
9317880	9324880	Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute strategic and competitive point of view.
9325880	9327880	And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.
9328880	9332880	There's always something new, there's always something different, we're always looking to add different layers.
9333880	9338880	Whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which will have the luxury of having over the next few years.
9339880	9342880	So it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance.
9344880	9345880	Of fruits and vegetables.
9347880	9350880	Alright, let me see, I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here.
9351880	9356880	And it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games.
9357880	9362880	And the quote he pulled there is, you run the company like you're in danger of starving.
9363880	9367880	I guess this has to do with kind of the high stress nature of running a game company.
9367880	9377880	Let's see, this was a quote in Edge Online in the magazine E246.
9378880	9385880	Quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.
9386880	9390880	I mean you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.
9390880	9397880	They're saying when Platinum Games started in 2006 it had 50 staff, six years it had 200 if you counted the contractors.
9398880	9399880	Wow.
9400880	9404880	The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer Capcom.
9405880	9411880	The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.
9412880	9415880	But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.
9415880	9420880	Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4, just an enormous amount of people.
9421880	9422880	Didn't help them, did it?
9423880	9424880	Oh snap.
9425880	9432880	Again that comment from an article on EdgeOnline.com sent to us via Twitter by TigerClaw.
9433880	9435880	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9436880	9441880	Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?
9442880	9445880	Uh, no I didn't see anything that stood out.
9446880	9448880	Not much has been going on this week.
9449880	9451880	Left 4 Dead sells 12 million. Cool.
9452880	9454880	Alright, well that tangs us to the end of the show.
9455880	9458880	A little bit shorter of a show tonight, but hey sometimes you have busy news weeks, sometimes you don't.
9459880	9462880	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we close out Shop for Tonight.
9463880	9465880	Dark Sakura, thank you for being here as always.
9466880	9468880	I have a choice and I choose O-L-R.
9468880	9469880	I choose O-L-R.
9470880	9472880	But not next week. Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over O-L-R.
9473880	9474880	Yes, I choose the gay.
9475880	9476880	And I'm not going this year. It's kind of sad.
9477880	9478880	I choose a lot of gay.
9479880	9480880	Send me pictures.
9481880	9482880	The Sea of Red.
9483880	9484880	Have fun. Your final thought tonight?
9485880	9486880	I'm actually going to wear my O-L-R shirt.
9487880	9488880	Oh wait, that's right you didn't get the vog one this time.
9489880	9493880	I have my red and black O-L-R shirt that Kristen and I had way back when.
9493880	9494880	Very cool.
9495880	9499880	Because I have hit my first goal. I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.
9500880	9501880	Congrats.
9502880	9503880	So my message is actually very important.
9504880	9505880	Span, neuter your cats.
9506880	9507880	Thank you Bob Barker.
9508880	9511880	Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?
9512880	9514880	I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.
9515880	9516880	Poor soul. It's a great show.
9517880	9518880	I did back in the 80s.
9519880	9520880	I didn't remember because I didn't care.
9520880	9526880	But seriously, rescue a cat. Everyone go out and rescue a cat.
9527880	9528880	Unless you're allergic to cats.
9529880	9530880	Then take some Benadryl.
9531880	9532880	Rescue a dog.
9533880	9534880	Alright, Loki your final thought?
9535880	9536880	I never rescued enough cats.
9537880	9538880	I had 11 at one time.
9539880	9540880	That's a lot of cats.
9541880	9542880	Then I didn't feed them and then they went away. At least I think they did.
9543880	9544880	I think they're waiting in the shadows.
9545880	9546880	Waiting to hunt me down.
9546880	9551880	My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December.
9552880	9554880	Because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.
9555880	9556880	I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.
9557880	9558880	We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.
9559880	9560880	It's really good. I just had Pinkberry last night.
9561880	9562880	I don't care. Let's go get some.
9563880	9565880	Alright, that's it. That does it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio tonight.
