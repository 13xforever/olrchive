13965	21429	Tonight, September 30th, 2012, EA cancels a major sports title, DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros.
21790	25892	2, and can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?
32065	32305	DarkSakura
57904	58244	Hi.
58625	59386	How are you doing, Jamie?
60707	62228	I'm caffeinated, thank you.
62369	62609	Yeah?
63530	64831	You had two cups of coffee.
65291	65552	Yes.
65692	66192	Coffee!
66352	67934	I've made a new rule, by the way.
68435	70617	The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.
72719	75081	What's your thing against sports ball?
75121	76122	Some people like sports ball.
76162	77243	Boring!
77323	80286	We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.
80306	80947	Boring!
82164	85066	I like rugby and I like real football.
85166	87668	There was a comment that Actdeft made this week.
87688	94112	I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG Network post, but he said, yes, I am a hater and I am hating.
95593	96753	And that's you right now.
96873	97634	I agree with that.
98655	100776	I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.
101716	101977	All right.
102037	103838	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
104018	104238	Hi.
104438	105019	How you doing, Loki?
105219	105539	Doing good.
106196	106557	Awesome.
106678	107300	What's new with you?
109148	109650	Minecraft.
109750	111598	Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?
112062	114383	Yeah, and I played no Minecraft.
114443	116143	I played Borderlands 2.
117224	117524	Okay.
117544	120185	Which is, sadly, the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
120365	122966	Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.
123686	126307	My wife's been occupying TV, so I've been occupying Minecraft.
126487	127647	Well, not a problem.
127687	129488	It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.
129768	129948	Yeah.
130268	131809	There's actually people on now.
131869	133469	I see people when I go on there.
133649	134270	Nice, nice.
134290	135850	And I hear they've been defacing my house.
136450	137811	My little... Or my shack, should I say.
138071	139331	We haven't been defacing it.
140132	140492	We've been...
142792	146375	Applying temporary tenants.
149257	149918	Interesting.
150178	151639	Would you fill my house with creepers?
152119	152360	No.
152600	153641	That would be destructive.
154902	155222	All right.
155522	160386	Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.
160946	162768	So, yeah.
162928	163568	What else do I want to say?
163688	166110	Oh, this poster came, right?
166771	166951	Yeah.
166991	168952	This was from that guy who called in last week, right?
169253	169413	Yeah.
169593	170093	I think it was.
170113	170654	Can I see it?
170694	171194	Can I open this?
171494	171895	Yeah, go ahead.
173175	174176	No, Rob, you're physically incapable.
174196	177697	Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.
177717	182759	It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.
183579	184559	It's stuck in there.
184639	185019	Hold on.
185220	186160	Open the other side.
186180	187660	That's still awesome.
188201	190501	I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.
190521	191722	Okay.
191742	191922	Okay.
192694	194595	I call it Disco Panda.
195776	202319	And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.
203660	209763	And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mists of Pandaria.
210303	211424	So it was Disco Pandas.
212318	213459	That poster's rad, by the way.
214379	216220	Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
216481	216861	I guess.
216881	217701	Our little picture feed.
217741	220863	What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
221824	225746	I can do that in a minute when we get into Gaming Weeks, so just give me a little bit of time.
226106	226567	Let's see.
226727	230289	Before we get into Gaming Weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic, as we usually do.
230909	252257	A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral and it wasn't really intentional for that to happen but apparently a lot of media companies for whatever reason aren't really covering this because it has to do with the indie community and I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community but this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.
252637	259980	Now remember when XNA Games first came out I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA and
260860	263641	and there's been some good and there's been some not good.
264042	268524	In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.
269164	274166	Obviously, we're a little partial to YYR and some of his efforts like bungee ferret tossing and so forth.
274847	282010	I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.
282030	283351	I made a game with zombies in it.
283991	285511	Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.
285531	288672	The Breath of Death and all that started on XMA, right?
288692	290773	Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was pretty good.
290813	296914	There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.
297214	298294	Right, and then there's the bad.
298394	304816	There's the controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.
305336	306277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
327082	329464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
345180	345760	Here's the deal.
345800	346520	Here's what's going on.
346560	348801	There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com.
348841	350301	Very well done from Bobby.
350621	354222	He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.
354542	357103	So he spent some time shedding a little light on it for people.
357163	361744	And it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.
362764	367145	Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.
367765	371789	They used to be able to generate 50 review codes and it's broken.
372510	374492	No press release saying they took it away.
374572	381619	Maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.
381979	383621	I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.
384201	384902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
405800	407501	Bungie, Ferret tossing, what's this?
407941	418044	You know, and then they check it out and that's how YYR can make sales on his game but now a lot of that is stifled because Microsoft has this bug on the site.
418385	419765	It's not just affecting him.
420685	421906	These big indie games
422666	440082	or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing, which is the indie answer to Microsoft's Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree or whatever the hell they call those things, which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.
440402	443885	Remember when Microsoft said, oh, yeah, we're going to promote XNA games?
444105	445727	Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice.
446027	446688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
464246	475754	Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chatroom, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be Says, not just for review, but for giveaways Ever wonder why VOG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferret Tossing?
475934	487003	Perfect example, we can't give it to you for free Although, seriously guys, it's one fucking dollar And it is a really fun game, so You probably have the points left over in your wallet
487503	514570	But yeah, and SH100Matt says You would think they want to get this fixed It's promoting games that they profit off of And that's the weird thing It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this But, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games Or selling it Well then do something about it Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games Oh, is there too much crap indie games That's bogging down the system So people don't want to go find the stellar indie games Fix it!
516124	519106	This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console.
519146	521688	I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.
521708	523969	It would be a little sad if that was the case.
524470	530774	Or maybe it's... I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and of course they don't want people developing apps for it.
531414	533996	Probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow.
534116	540720	Wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?
540841	545484	Indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam.
546524	547365	One more sales there.
548585	554149	It's just a bummer that it had such potential.
554869	565876	It had such potential to be so awesome, to let people kind of control what was going on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side, and it's just kind of gone.
566496	570659	So, Breakman in our chat says, there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games.
571179	571599	There are.
571719	571819	It's...
573835	575736	What's what went wrong with this?
575876	577317	Why is this not doing better?
577977	578877	Loki, any thoughts?
579678	581219	Because they haven't done anything with it.
581259	583760	They haven't really they haven't promoted it.
583800	589042	They hit it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.
589963	594345	So it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out.
594565	594945	They did.
596645	601627	SJ100 Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.
602067	605229	Well, but like YYR, he's been doing bungee ferret tossing for two years.
606249	611011	And two years ago, XNA looked a lot better than maybe it does now.
611091	614013	So it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.
614733	616834	I've always thought though, and I could be wrong.
616894	617934	I am not a developer.
617994	618715	I've not made games.
619055	622056	I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff online.
622396	626420	from XNA on Xbox to PC.
627281	629083	Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?
629103	631606	I think so.
631826	637832	Because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that it's probably pretty easy to port it over.
638231	641574	I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC.
642695	657549	Like, for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the Gibb tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.
658350	660812	So the programming there is pretty much the same.
661348	663189	I used to love editing files.
663229	665711	I remember Civilization 1 on the PC.
665731	669113	A bunch of the scripting ran off text files.
669133	678880	There were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were within the boundaries, you could get the Queen of England to, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.
680121	681622	I'm going to declare war on your ass.
681942	683963	You could change things.
684403	686185	And to a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious.
687145	689867	Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.
692649	693010	Anyhow.
694671	709586	Going to more comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com because, of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.
710266	736856	there's articles there too there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life but there will be more very soon meanwhile Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort let's see WhatUpG says by that I mean the big budget games the ones that seem to get more press etc Microsoft is more about the AAA games is the comment that preceded that so maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games I don't know
737916	738296	DarkSakura
761634	762695	and PlayPandas.
764676	772322	I've made Rob over 10,000 gold selling gems in less than a week.
773603	776085	So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion.
776765	780828	It's been slow, slow, slow.
781148	786952	And I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level, which is fine.
787253	787533	I mean...
789947	791368	I do have other things going on.
792048	796751	But yeah, it was a lot of pandas.
797652	799193	It was pandemonium.
801754	802795	Yeah, that's it.
804241	805002	and Garrus.
828121	840328	I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit, which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly.
840728	849193	But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City and just hands out Justice stuff?
849773	855977	You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.
855997	856817	Okay.
856957	857817	That's stupid.
859198	860798	So it's going to take a little time.
861599	866100	Well, I mean, I can see why they did that because they said there's not enough to do at 90.
866220	870702	So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do.
871502	879965	There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.
880585	882486	I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90.
882906	884606	I've had too much going on in my personal life.
884666	886007	I can't sit there and just grind to 90.
887467	887887	I'm just 88.
888247	890088	I know, I know.
891248	892509	And Shane's already got a 90.
893009	896590	Yeah, most of my rating guild already has 90s.
897090	898711	Some of us have lives.
899651	902452	I don't like to say it that way because I know Shane has a life.
902772	903492	But you know what I mean?
904192	907013	But we have other stuff going on that isn't Oh My God Pandas.
908213	909534	Some of us have Mass Effect to play.
910754	912335	Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.
912475	916498	Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog.
917618	918319	I want a corgi bull.
920460	921040	You're silly.
921440	922401	All right, let's move on.
922481	926624	I'll talk about... And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.
927024	929685	I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my evening week.
929705	930426	But Loki, go ahead.
931489	955123	so I played Borderlands 2 last week well kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show so I've been playing that and leveling up you know my assassin and games pretty fun I'm digging it wish I could play it a little bit more I want to play a bit more this week take a little break from Minecraft since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week
956224	981645	of course we switched the server over to creative so it's been fun everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things I finished I haven't really finished my castle but I'm taking a break from it I think it's pretty much done I've got like all the grounds done I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens and I built a underground blacksmithing thing and
982185	984926	Farmer Loki had a farm E-I-E-I-O
1011818	1013238	Alright, My Gaming Week.
1013278	1015819	I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.
1016039	1022441	So, you know, when I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year.
1023701	1030123	I mean, that's at least the goal, is to do Disney Detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.
1030583	1035064	If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.
1035684	1036164	But anyway...
1038786	1058127	as far as video games I have been playing I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time I love the music I love the scenery I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast there's so much to do
1058667	1062788	I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.
1063208	1071409	In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit is I don't like that they made it not possible, really.
1071509	1085612	I mean, you can, but they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it, but they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that, so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore, which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it, but...
1086212	1087073	Horde House www.hordehouse.com
1104372	1106894	Another game that I checked out this week, though, for a little bit.
1106954	1113358	I only played this in between the time that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.
1113938	1115919	And that is Torchlight 2.
1117440	1120102	Torchlight 2 is released, and it is available on Steam.
1120842	1130368	And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam and probably other places, too, that I'm not thinking of.
1130428	1131389	I just own it on both places.
1131829	1133210	It's basically Diablo 2.
1133470	1134371	Torchlight 2 is out Torchlight 2 is out
1150109	1152611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1172669	1173189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1196843	1197363	Thumbs up.
1197584	1201746	And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet.
1202587	1205809	And you can also be in the same room and do internet that way.
1205889	1207090	There's the LAN is in there.
1207650	1211633	None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.
1211753	1212674	That is a great word.
1213294	1213615	Fuckery.
1215056	1218879	Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word, too.
1218939	1220040	That was total fuckery.
1220660	1222282	And this had very little fuckery.
1222362	1228887	Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day, but it didn't really ruin the experience.
1230269	1231530	It was a good time.
1232671	1234412	Actdeft says, Internet multiplayer?
1234552	1235033	Wow.
1235293	1236414	Well, the first game didn't have it.
1237575	1238456	So, there you go.
1239236	1244683	Uh, let's see, and Ray Deer in our chatroom says, I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now.
1244703	1246064	Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.
1247025	1252712	So, uh, yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.
1253372	1253513	So...
1254734	1259256	If you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.
1259316	1264740	It's going up and down a little bit, so I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off so that way we don't hiccup.
1264780	1267502	But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.
1267562	1270324	Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.
1270624	1271845	I closed Dropbox, right?
1271905	1273346	Sometimes big files come in through there.
1273646	1274366	Yeah, that's closed.
1275027	1276568	So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on.
1278129	1280850	Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.
1280950	1282451	Torchlight 2 and Pandaria.
1283632	1284612	And Disney games.
1286433	1288374	Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, DarkSakura?
1288415	1292417	Because in chat, Breakman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland.
1293738	1295399	In my country, we have a word for you.
1295759	1296139	Liar.
1297079	1299441	And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.
1302833	1303334	You know what, Rob?
1303954	1304134	What?
1304194	1304835	I have faith in you.
1306356	1311982	And if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.
1312062	1314324	I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.
1316206	1316406	Okay.
1319208	1347081	Oh boo hoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here Oh stop, alright Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio We'll get to the Fugle question of the week a little later But before we get to that, some news Loki starting us off with the gaming news this week
1347581	1362315	Alright, so this is a little shocking, not entirely shocking I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA and this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday?
1362795	1364476	Yeah, I think so, yeah, on the 27th.
1365337	1366799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1384100	1390125	I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.
1390765	1396250	They took a break last year and then this year they're going to try launching again with NBA Live 13.
1396951	1401795	Once again, they just canceled it before it even got a chance to get sent out and this was...
1402976	1413001	Literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website, their Executive Vice President Andrew Wilson just wrote, Hey, it's canceled and here's why.
1413401	1419884	Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.
1421065	1421305	So...
1423280	1423600	I don't know.
1424641	1437870	It's interesting, but I think at this point, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game, and from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying, hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.
1438730	1440331	Thank you for watching!
1456041	1457983	I don't even know if they were able to catch up with their market share.
1458003	1465648	I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally a new NBA game?
1466729	1468611	You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.
1469852	1471333	I did like it though because...
1472990	1476211	I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.
1476751	1485353	One of the first comments I read on the esports.com site was like, I'm going to kill your family.
1485393	1487094	I'm going to kill all the employees.
1487114	1490435	I'm going to burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA life.
1490595	1492095	Call the po-po on that.
1492175	1496216	Why do people feel like they can just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?
1496856	1498557	I'm about to go down a much bigger path.
1499097	1508342	on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get, or, well, there's Facebook too, but I hate the anonymity that the internet gives us sometimes.
1508362	1508882	Like, really?
1509202	1511763	You're gonna kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game?
1511923	1512223	Really?
1512463	1512764	Really?
1513244	1513544	Really?
1515525	1515925	Jeez.
1515945	1517606	Why don't we just set them all on fire?
1518766	1520687	How are you being any better by saying that?
1524529	1525230	Calm down, woman.
1526350	1527711	Hey, I said it very calmly.
1529033	1531815	Anyhow, I don't know.
1532095	1536578	I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.
1536638	1538900	They're just like, eh, not surprised.
1539260	1540881	And honestly, I'm not surprised either.
1540901	1544523	I kind of thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet.
1545144	1547305	And the game was scheduled for October.
1548246	1550768	Kind of thought that you would have a little something.
1551608	1553549	So, yeah, not a big shocker.
1553569	1555751	I don't know.
1557213	1560297	Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?
1560397	1572894	There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision, because if the game was gonna suck, or was just gonna be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then...
1573374	1575396	Good on them for making the right decision.
1575416	1582982	Because there's a story later about maybe a not so great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.
1583062	1583983	I found that comment finally.
1584123	1584844	It was funny.
1585064	1586225	You've got to be fucking kidding me.
1586245	1587746	We stuck our neck out for you.
1588046	1593791	We've been fans of you guys for years, getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.
1594251	1598455	I swear, if there's no game that... Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.
1599075	1600998	There's no game that released this year.
1601198	1605703	I'm killing every employee and EA slash NBA live building dude.
1606123	1609347	I'm so heartbroken, literally.
1609487	1611550	I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.
1611690	1613292	I can't believe we're stuck playing...
1613832	1619958	with only one game after you guys had three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.
1620419	1625724	If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.
1625784	1633231	You need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid wrote that comment.
1633892	1636534	But I just think it's funny that people think that...
1637755	1640997	You don't have to play a new NBA game.
1641557	1645738	It's not like, oh shit, it's not like choosing a president or something like that.
1646079	1647239	A choice needs to be made.
1647699	1652041	It's just, you know you can play that same NBA game that you have.
1652301	1656503	Oh, well I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.
1659113	1661235	Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?
1663877	1664877	It's supposed to be fun.
1666198	1669020	Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.
1669040	1672463	I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.
1675125	1677367	We actually got a copy of that.
1677407	1679048	No, I didn't get a copy of it.
1679068	1679568	Why not?
1680209	1682090	Because my boss had one in his office.
1682110	1682891	Baller Beats!
1682951	1683591	And I laughed at it.
1683611	1685072	I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.
1685212	1685793	I'll play it.
1686133	1687674	No, we're not.
1690081	1692382	Alright, I guess this one.
1692462	1694263	Oh, I wanted to ask about the 2K game.
1694303	1696444	Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?
1696744	1699886	Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?
1699906	1700506	Jay-Z.
1701166	1704548	Well, I was just talking... I'm looking forward to that.
1704568	1705088	Well, hold on.
1705369	1707830	I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.
1708690	1710951	About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.
1711411	1714353	Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.
1715153	1738307	and you know say what you will about her music and so forth but I mean that woman is a well-oiled pop machine she's putting out so many albums she puts out an album a year and all these music videos wins all these Grammys has all these catchy songs written for her you know whether it might be your cup of tea or not you can't ignore that she writes some really or she doesn't write probably but she has some really good pop music that she puts out and
1738827	1764737	and yet again she's got like another new album coming out this year it's crazy like jay-z is working her and she's a extraordinarily famous woman hey if jay-z work your best hoe if shut up if jay-z can make 2k basketball like if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music i actually think it could be a really good he's not doing shit all he's doing is picking up the soundtrack
1765257	1768940	Ooh, fucking awesome.
1769981	1771081	I mean, whatever.
1771202	1771902	You know, that's cool.
1772102	1780248	I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.
1780288	1781309	I mean, that's it.
1781589	1787353	I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.
1788374	1793841	Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out and it was like, eh, not so exciting.
1795202	1797525	Why does the chat room think I said pot music?
1797625	1798967	I said pop music.
1799728	1801670	Pot music would be like... Foghat.
1801990	1804493	It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews band.
1804513	1805435	That's pot music.
1806836	1807377	Foghat.
1810566	1812128	and maybe a little bit Journey too.
1812148	1816654	I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once and damn, I think I got a contact high.
1816834	1817756	Anyway, back to games.
1818837	1825326	Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way because you know Motorola, although it is really Google, they...
1825486	1833611	They got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s among some other Microsoft devices.
1833671	1837434	This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.
1837794	1839355	It's actually owned by Motorola.
1839455	1842237	It's licensed for use in MS devices.
1844138	1845199	Now here's the interesting thing.
1846099	1847700	It's been ruled in the U.S.
1847960	1850642	that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.
1851182	1852744	Well, now, why would the U.S.
1853024	1855265	talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?
1855665	1861229	Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the U.S.
1861709	1865492	So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the U.S.
1865572	1865792	law.
1866352	1867853	And the court's ruling says, quote,
1874798	1892369	so if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here you're okay so like if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three year warranty you're okay, you can still get one phew well technically they wouldn't be selling it they would just be shipping a replacement
1893812	1897755	No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.
1898075	1899716	Because you know that's what happens to people now.
1900737	1904120	It used to be that they'd Red Ring after a week, and that's just part of growing up.
1904140	1908223	Well, they don't Red Ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of it.
1908243	1909804	Did you say that was just part of growing up?
1910024	1910304	Yes.
1912966	1915808	Because every Xbox... You take the good, you take the bad.
1915848	1919531	Yes, you take the good, you take the bad, and you take them both, and there you have a 360... A 360...
1925724	1931445	You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the Robot Chicken thing where they did... Never mind.
1931645	1932365	No, no.
1932565	1933626	Okay.
1934586	1935646	One chick's on Survivor.
1936826	1937186	Which one?
1937226	1937526	Tootie?
1937546	1937886	Blair.
1938387	1938587	Oh.
1938607	1939167	On Survivor.
1939887	1943988	They are really, really stretching for celebrities.
1944008	1945748	You and your reality shows, Rob.
1945908	1946428	I know.
1946488	1947068	What can I say?
1947108	1949048	I'm a whore for trash reality shows.
1949068	1949849	You have a problem.
1949869	1951589	I have a commercial for the next Xbox.
1954326	1954627	The 720?
1954667	1954747	The 720?
1966738	1971382	Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.
1971862	1972022	What?
1972383	1974564	Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.
1975465	1976586	What was her name?
1977367	1978388	I just remember she was Tootie.
1978668	1983051	I like this name in the chat room that I'm probably going to horribly mispronounce, but it's Entitle-itis.
1984793	1986014	Inflammation of the entitlement.
1986374	1990317	Entitle-itis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.
1990357	1991218	You never forget.
1991839	1993180	Did the red ring come after the blowjob?
1993260	1993380	No.
1996209	1997310	That would be a whole other problem.
1997330	1998672	That means you need to go see a doctor.
1999933	2000934	Yes, Kim Fields.
2000994	2001535	That was her.
2001595	2002296	Thank you, Ranma.
2002696	2003757	I knew Ranma would remember.
2004158	2004478	Alright.
2005099	2005599	Moving on.
2005639	2006200	DarkSakura.
2007117	2017682	So there was a big Horkin interview about the PlayStation 3 and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.
2018463	2023565	And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.
2025767	2030169	So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.
2030909	2033491	Not visual, the casual... Casual visual...
2034611	2035031	It rhymes.
2035252	2036753	Don't give me that look.
2038674	2048901	More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do with games things that are a little bit more reflective of that, and that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.
2049962	2054625	As far as how well the Vita's doing, they said they're not going to reduce the price this year.
2055165	2063030	That is probably going to be sometime next year, so it's not a matter of if it's when, but definitely not this year.
2064711	2085381	and this so really it's just more of what we knew I think it's just I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses that you don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fucking TV and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to you know
2086842	2087803	Have their friends see it.
2088263	2098426	I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week for like $199 or something.
2098647	2098967	Really?
2099167	2100427	I know, I was like, kind of want.
2100447	2101107	Were they teeny?
2102488	2107610	We saw, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.
2108050	2109830	I guess that didn't do too well, did it?
2110491	2114952	Yeah, who's going to buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price?
2115532	2115872	Sure.
2116112	2116892	Which it may have.
2117252	2117772	I should check back.
2117812	2118853	I don't think it's been down that.
2118953	2127935	Also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK, there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now and then a 12 gigabyte version that's going to be out on October 12th.
2128715	2132396	But that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.
2133196	2135437	It's the shops that are setting the price.
2136577	2136917	Rage Racer
2166246	2177323	You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know, re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?
2178743	2196778	same damn tracks oh does that not fit into your plan of you know releasing one track with you know half a car and you have to buy the rest later so just throwing this out there it's still on sale on Best Buy site $179.99 for the TV, Motorstorm, Apocalypse and glasses and a little cable give it more time
2198619	2199780	You think you can get even lower.
2199900	2201642	Black Friday's right around the corner.
2201662	2202203	There you go.
2203183	2203804	Don't remind me.
2203864	2206246	I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.
2207207	2208408	Since I'm not working retail.
2209089	2209589	Yay.
2210911	2211952	All right, let's move on, Loki.
2213320	2213761	All right.
2214281	2217824	Well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV... No, actually, I'm not.
2218805	2219686	They were kind of cool, though.
2219786	2221148	I've got to play on those a few times.
2222489	2236182	So they have this new Xbox Live reward thing where they're allowing people with high gamer scores to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.
2237083	2245733	and it's a whopping, I know you're getting excited here, it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.
2245753	2246714	That's right, 2%.
2246754	2246874	Woo!
2246914	2246994	Woo!
2253772	2254892	I'm getting excited already.
2257293	2268678	And of course, also, apparently, if you have a gamer score of over 3,000, you get a special gift during your birthday month, which, in the fine print, says is only worth 25 cents.
2272220	2272980	Here's a quarter.
2273060	2274161	Call somebody who cares.
2275342	2279825	What about... It's probably going to be some stinking avatar item like a birthday cake.
2279905	2280425	It's stupid.
2280465	2281066	I mean, seriously.
2282487	2283247	1% back?
2283327	2283568	Okay.
2283888	2293054	So you buy $100 worth of fucking Microsoft Point stuff on the Xbox Live Marketplace and you get a dollar.
2293995	2295256	That is fucking stupid.
2296076	2319979	the 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom it's a fucking birthday hat I guarantee you it's a birthday hat that is it for your avatar so that everyone can go hey look he has a birthday hat on cool I want them to send me a quarter I want them to mail it to me
2324119	2326620	If it has a value you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.
2326720	2329641	So how is it that they can assign a value to that?
2329661	2332702	Because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter.
2333222	2337963	Well, I always thought it was akin to like... Have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?
2338083	2339124	Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.
2339144	2343585	They're always like one one-hundredth of a cent or one-tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.
2344245	2349567	Maybe that's the actual cash value of a 40-point item in the marketplace or something.
2349587	2350607	It would be 25 cents.
2351608	2352788	That's just stupid.
2354309	2354750	Cool.
2354970	2359394	Thank you for the money back, I guess.
2359594	2362237	But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.
2363398	2367362	I don't know who this Entitle-itis is, but I like the comments from this individual tonight.
2367642	2369344	So I have 7,000 points.
2369725	2370405	What do I get?
2370545	2372067	A coupon from Arby's?
2377699	2377979	No, no.
2378319	2382421	The idea is to get you to be loyal, not to scare you off.
2384942	2386682	A lifetime supply of horsey sauce.
2386702	2390183	Who's going to spend $100 on DLC in a month?
2391644	2397786	I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game that comes out and a whole bunch of DLC.
2398346	2403228	I mean, those people are going to have to be really sipping the Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.
2403248	2406649	That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.
2408712	2412273	because, you know, that's the new thing now is free-to-play mechanisms.
2412333	2414334	Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers.
2414354	2415334	You get some money back.
2417395	2418456	It's not so bad.
2418496	2424558	Hey, I got all this money stolen from me, but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back.
2424678	2425278	Sweet!
2427979	2429740	It's not so bad anymore.
2431200	2432281	And a birthday hat.
2432701	2433121	Yeah!
2436707	2440931	Maybe the hat's a fucking sign that says, Sucker, you spent all this money.
2442552	2443433	You're an idiot.
2445855	2446336	Oh, boy.
2446436	2449598	All right, let's move on and talk about something in the PlayStation camp.
2450399	2451200	The PlayStation 3.
2451640	2462450	You might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3 is going to be a PlayStation brick and it won't really be useful for anything anymore because, of course, the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.
2463601	2469243	But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.
2469963	2472523	All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.
2473124	2475824	Well, when did the system first come out?
2475844	2475824	2006?
2475984	2478485	This is about a nine year window.
2478925	2481086	So I guess that's not terrible.
2481366	2484007	That's not your fucking ten year life cycle that you promised me.
2484027	2484967	I want my money back.
2488061	2488301	Uh-oh.
2488841	2490102	DarkSakura, did you have a problem?
2490242	2491943	Your soap spat on my shirt.
2492063	2493684	It left white foam on my shirt.
2493764	2494664	It likes you a lot.
2495065	2495665	I guess so.
2495825	2496045	All right.
2496085	2499147	Anyhow, PlayStation 3, good until 2015.
2501788	2504669	That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.
2504929	2504669	2016.
2505150	2507711	That's what's targeted.
2508571	2514874	Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to reemphasize you're not just buying something that's going to suck in a couple years.
2515374	2516174	So, there you go.
2516555	2525779	We're going to continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely, and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long, but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.
2526239	2527339	Same thing with PlayStation 2.
2527999	2533802	It's kind of stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch, but there are still games launching for it.
2535600	2536180	Jon Kohler, GameSpot
2560587	2561368	One whole game.
2562328	2563109	One whole game.
2563269	2565751	One game that's going to be out in Japan.
2566551	2568373	Ooh, there will be one more game.
2570294	2576759	And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.
2577960	2580742	I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.
2581442	2582283	Adelino Macchio.
2584764	2590407	Yeah, the English version is something like something of Andolin or something is the English title.
2590687	2596870	Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name so I can't actually read it properly.
2596970	2597330	Scroll.
2597910	2599011	Well, no, it's not working.
2599431	2600291	Makyo.
2601292	2602252	Adolin no Makyo.
2603112	2606134	So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.
2606234	2610536	It's the one that has like Geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.
2610556	2610756	Huh!
2612454	2614576	Hey, Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.
2615016	2615276	I know.
2615716	2617137	I can see why people are still playing it.
2617277	2618318	But we have pandas.
2618878	2621019	But it's funny that... Pandas in the mist.
2621259	2625622	It's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.
2625662	2627663	I am so surprised it hasn't gone free-to-play yet.
2628104	2628604	Me too.
2629084	2630465	If it went free-to-play, I'd play it again.
2631245	2631686	Who wouldn't?
2632946	2634007	I know a few people who wouldn't.
2635748	2636188	You know what?
2636548	2637989	I told you what made me quit that game, right?
2638570	2639190	Being a white mage.
2641926	2645667	Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, damn it.
2646947	2649628	That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.
2649668	2651108	Fuck this, I'm teleporting hola.
2651849	2652209	Yeah.
2653029	2654289	So I was just like, I'm done.
2655830	2658470	See, after all these years, you still can make jokes like that.
2659050	2660431	That game had quite an impression.
2660771	2662531	It's just like, oh, you made a bad pull.
2662771	2663731	Eh, fuck you guys.
2664012	2665332	No heel, and I'm out.
2666172	2669173	I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.
2669813	2673155	Subligar Leather underwear Bite my ass please At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online
2699286	2704095	Port, port please, port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.
2705477	2706359	Port prompt please.
2710231	2713793	Hey, pretty impressive, though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?
2715114	2719256	And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013?
2719316	2724299	Although, let's be real, it's like there's been one game this year and one game next year.
2725980	2727620	It's on life support at this moment.
2727660	2732703	But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.
2733443	2735565	You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.
2737085	2738026	And I'm never gonna.
2738607	2739487	Hey, it's not that bad.
2739587	2740348	You know, I have it.
2740688	2741768	And I should sit down and play it.
2741788	2742248	You should.
2742628	2743109	It's a good time.
2743169	2744609	But I also have Pandas.
2744629	2745690	Balthier and Fran?
2745790	2746170	Pandas.
2746670	2749331	You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.
2749411	2749811	Pandas.
2751412	2752032	Fran's a bunny.
2753232	2753572	So?
2753592	2755493	Alright, let's move on.
2755533	2758594	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.
2759755	2760195	Alright.
2760755	2762776	This week, actually, there's a few things coming out.
2763656	2765997	I know that there's
2768542	2768963	Resident Evil 6
2786314	2787154	Vita... No.
2787434	2787855	No Vita.
2788115	2790836	But PSP for some goddamn reason.
2792176	2795537	Go2k for supporting PSP still.
2796257	2797118	Because no one else is.
2798558	2798938	And PC.
2799659	2803820	And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.
2803880	2805641	Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.
2806901	2808902	And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.
2809522	2810622	I think that's what it's called.
2811063	2812183	Including a penis!
2813903	2814604	It said everything.
2814624	2814904	Nice!
2816621	2818022	I think it's lessons for everyone.
2818382	2819703	But yes, you can draw everything.
2819723	2820863	That's basically how I'm calling it.
2821864	2822604	Including a penis.
2823005	2823605	Including a penis.
2824165	2826887	And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.
2827387	2831169	Courier Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.
2832350	2834191	And what else we had here?
2836823	2838244	Let's see here.
2839405	2841887	Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.
2841907	2844189	17 Command & Conquer games in there.
2844889	2845930	Holy fuck.
2846110	2847612	That's a lot of Command & Conquer.
2847632	2848933	That's too much Command & Conquer.
2849013	2851435	Ours is over 17 years worth of Command & Conquer.
2851815	2853716	I can't read the cover there.
2854596	2855816	Nope, 17 games.
2855896	2857257	Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.
2858257	2864099	50 bucks and you get like all of the Command & Conquer games, all the Red Alert games, Generals.
2865620	2867561	Wow, that's pretty sweet.
2868121	2870622	Ranma says, 17 Command & Conquer games?
2870702	2871682	Shut up and take my money.
2872122	2873323	You'll never get through it all.
2873663	2877764	I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.
2878104	2880025	I think I played one game for two seconds.
2880546	2882217	I did that with the Doom pack.
2882643	2910416	XCOM is fucking great though also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty editions of Resident Evil NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil they have the archives and anthologies which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3 including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1 3, 4, it's like all these random ones in there
2911836	2934222	MXC1 to clarify in our chatroom 17 games but they're all digital even if you buy the box you just get codes that's stupid I hate it when they do that now thank you Origin thank you thank you for sucking fucking awesome that comment and more in our chatroom live.vognetwork.com oh and of course you know I should mention a week from today there's uh
2936465	2938306	Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.
2938866	2940447	Someone might be interested in that.
2940487	2941667	No one I know likes that game.
2943048	2945129	Okay, I have to digress for a moment.
2946289	2947449	Have you done any pet battles?
2948850	2950051	Yeah, they're pretty fun, actually.
2950071	2951931	I went and did that for like an hour.
2954832	2960715	But they will not let you, according to our guildie, Gwen, they will not let you name your Phoenix Hatchling, Fox.
2961482	2961782	Legion Legion
2985817	2986738	Oh my god.
2987058	2987258	Yeah.
2987978	2989259	So I named it Geth Legion.
2990059	2990480	Still.
2990580	2993921	For the record, Rob, I did actually prove you wrong from something on Horde House.
2994322	2994562	What?
2994622	2997263	I got Jane Shepard on Proudmoore.
2997664	2998044	Good for you.
2998104	2998484	Just saying.
2998664	3000885	Have a cookie.
3000945	3003867	Going back to Jamie, I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.
3004087	3004587	What'd they do?
3004607	3007489	This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy XII.
3008629	3011071	SJ100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.
3011571	3012652	No, Garrus isn't in it.
3012892	3015455	Actdeft says Tellard has Panda Corgi Garrus.
3016976	3017116	Ew!
3017597	3018958	That's just wrong, no.
3019478	3020960	Although, did you see the ferret effect?
3020980	3022121	Uh-uh.
3022561	3023182	Oh, yes I did!
3023442	3024903	That was awesome.
3024983	3026805	I was like, was that a listener of OLR?
3026905	3028086	I guess we can't take all the credit for it.
3028146	3030889	No, it was in our Mass Effect secret community.
3031819	3054354	uh fifth dream uh about the World of Warcraft expansion in our chat room says mist of pandyria is what my wife and I have been calling it that's pretty good I'm gonna use that on our house I'm gonna call it mist of pandemic mist of pandyria by the way do you know what name I got for my uh tauren monk I'm really excited you told me Calvain that's awesome I told Dan and he just rolled his eyes
3055174	3056196	You know what I got?
3056397	3056637	What?
3056877	3064471	I have Sunny Gummy I love that name From Gummy Bears And I have Shampoo But spelled X-I-A-N-P-U Ah
3066064	3068786	Oh hey, let's travel Japan and check out release dates over there.
3069627	3076552	Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012, both on the Xbox 360.
3076592	3086539	There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know, to try and like sell some Microsoft Xbox 360s, I guess.
3087000	3090883	I believe there are full consoles coming out too.
3090903	3093765	There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition, which
3094205	3096787	Oh no, this is the one with the jacket, isn't it?
3097147	3101329	Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?
3101789	3103190	$1,700 if you want to get this.
3103290	3106632	This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.
3107052	3107532	Remember that?
3108193	3109413	That's happening in Japan this week.
3109433	3110594	But not a full metal jacket.
3110814	3110994	No.
3111495	3114336	Sorry, I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.
3114376	3117318	They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.
3117338	3118738	Yeah, the jacket's pretty freaking rad.
3118898	3122180	Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.
3122701	3123181	It's cute.
3123201	3123541	Thank you.
3124505	3126546	I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.
3128007	3128908	Yes, we know.
3129888	3131269	Alright, going to the PlayStation 3.
3131309	3134091	It matches most of the same shit.
3134131	3137012	Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.
3137312	3142055	You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your PlayStation 3 with Biohazard symbols.
3142335	3145097	So your PlayStation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.
3145397	3147578	Won't that be awesome?
3147919	3150360	F1 2012 and... You alright over there?
3150808	3151769	No, they just made me laugh.
3152129	3153530	Because I had mental imagery then.
3153931	3155012	World Soccer Winning 11 2013.
3155512	3161537	Well, they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes.
3161657	3164700	And so because of that, they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.
3164880	3165200	I know.
3166421	3167362	Now you can't unsee that.
3167402	3171065	Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick blowing a giraffe.
3171105	3173527	You can't unsee that now that that's been said.
3174047	3176069	So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go.
3176149	3176569	You're welcome.
3177450	3178991	How about on the Nintendo 3DS?
3179051	3180792	Coming out this week, nothing.
3181533	3186136	But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.
3186176	3189498	I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.
3191059	3191740	There you go.
3191860	3193121	That's the Japanese release dates.
3193141	3194442	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
3194982	3195783	Oh, a few things.
3196823	3201847	On the first, which already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.
3202527	3204148	And then on the second, Resident Evil 6.
3204789	3206290	Oh my god, you are so correct.
3208189	3208489	Right?
3210010	3210690	Well, I've tried.
3211210	3212290	I've kind of been ignoring it.
3212310	3213231	Try the unseen, but you can't.
3213611	3217732	Because, did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?
3217932	3218092	What?
3218112	3218773	For the release of that?
3219033	3219253	Yeah.
3219273	3221233	They did like a fake human meat market.
3221494	3221654	Ew.
3221834	3222754	For Resident Evil 6.
3223054	3223214	Ew.
3223234	3224114	In East London.
3224134	3224975	It was all raccoon.
3226275	3226455	Ew!
3226835	3227095	No.
3228456	3230577	Haven't you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?
3230597	3231397	No.
3231517	3231637	No.
3233487	3238289	Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid I didn't watch it again for like two years.
3238309	3239070	It's really gross.
3239170	3242852	I almost put it in show role, but it's really, really gross.
3242952	3243772	I'll just link pictures.
3243792	3249075	They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and... Here.
3253196	3262424	The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kitten Mittens, was the episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.
3262524	3263425	That was my favorite.
3265286	3266427	I haven't seen that one yet.
3266447	3267788	Oh, it's fantastic.
3268029	3275315	But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically for helping amputees.
3275965	3280468	Well, I guess that's cool that it had a good cause at the end of the day.
3280808	3282129	So, back to the releases.
3283069	3284630	What were you going to say?
3284650	3289513	I was going to say, actually, I do think I did see that episode where they were all in the U-Haul trailer or something like that.
3289653	3291134	Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?
3292695	3292895	Yes.
3293415	3294436	Okay, okay.
3294476	3295176	That was hilarious.
3295636	3297938	Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah!
3297958	3298898	Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.
3300159	3302981	And the 4th is Anno 2070 Deep Ocean.
3303561	3304462	And the 5th, NBA 2K13.
3306041	3307542	So something every day this week.
3309824	3310304	All right.
3310344	3311666	A couple more news stories for you guys.
3311686	3317070	And then the classic game of the week where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.
3317590	3318751	But first, Loki.
3319492	3320252	And it's of the week.
3320433	3329360	So Notch, the wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to...
3331221	3343088	and perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in Windows 8 so that it would be on their closed platform.
3343929	3348711	They even asked, hey, you can help certify Minecraft for Windows 8.
3350913	3359598	He said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all rather than to play along with what Microsoft wanted.
3360198	3365822	and basically said I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms around.
3365882	3372686	If Microsoft decides to lock down Windows 8 it would be very very bad for indie games and competition in general.
3373166	3379530	If we can keep open platforms around there's going to be a lot of very interesting games in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.
3381528	3388454	I think it would have been what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.
3388754	3391036	They're certified for it in Minecraft.
3391256	3395880	Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but he doesn't want to do that.
3396400	3396921	Why would you?
3397861	3409131	Basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because it's their closed App Store versus...
3409631	3411074	He sells the game off his website.
3411094	3412436	He gets all the profits for it.
3412536	3419047	So why... Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason.
3421130	3422032	Of course he's going to say no.
3423662	3432785	It's a little different when you're putting your game on the Xbox 360 where no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.
3433305	3434205	You just can't do that.
3436006	3439967	Ranma in chat says, Oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.
3441738	3443159	Windows, the operating system that is pirate-proof.
3469711	3471092	No one pirates Windows.
3472494	3473074	Please.
3473515	3476958	If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.
3478879	3479820	I don't buy operating systems.
3479840	3483804	I actually don't think I've paid for one in like 20 years.
3484044	3488828	Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.
3489108	3489709	Same here.
3490560	3495382	Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Fugo Question of the Week a little later when it comes to Windows 8.
3496102	3497703	I'm still really torn on it.
3497743	3504105	I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.
3504145	3505706	There's a lot of mystery around it, too.
3505726	3506166	Let me put it this way.
3506226	3515609	If there's anything that people find about Windows 8 that they really must have, someone's going to fucking develop a program that runs on Windows 7 that does the same damn shit.
3517690	3519491	I mean, it probably does it better, so...
3521426	3522647	No, no thanks.
3524649	3525290	Not into it.
3527852	3535039	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, danger.
3535820	3546070	Alright, well, if you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe you're on Linux.
3546790	3552495	And of course, Linux is going to be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form of Steam.
3553215	3558259	Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.
3558799	3560561	1,000 users will be testing the client.
3560581	3563363	They also get one Valve game with that.
3563423	3567986	It's probably going to be Left 4 Dead 2 because that, of course, is the game that they already said would be on Linux.
3568747	3574211	The beta will support, and please forgive me if I mispronounce this because I'm not a Linux user, Ubuntu.
3574331	3574912	Is that how you say it?
3575152	3575292	Yep.
3575672	3577773	Ubuntu 12.04 and above.
3578614	3581656	It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.
3581876	3584938	So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.
3585818	3590901	Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to the user install experience.
3591262	3594283	Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?
3595404	3597125	Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?
3597565	3598266	Yeah, I think so.
3598326	3602008	But I'm not like an in-depth programmer or anything like that.
3602108	3602368	Right.
3602488	3602789	So...
3605617	3607799	I might see if I can't get into it.
3607819	3609900	What was your logic for using Linux Mint again?
3610721	3614103	First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.
3616425	3625951	You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.
3626912	3632456	On top of that, you have basic immediate root access to anything in your system.
3633156	3635818	And on top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.
3637419	3640061	It's respected, it's versatile.
3641082	3649287	And the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for anything.
3649747	3652249	And it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.
3652329	3654270	And what's specific about Mint?
3655371	3656572	It's just a really easy interface.
3656612	3658453	Do you just like the name Mint?
3658493	3659614	Because it's minty fresh.
3659794	3663136	It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.
3664557	3667399	It's a really good introductory into Linux.
3667479	3668579	Minty fresh scattles.
3669680	3670400	You remember that.
3670701	3672702	A 10-year-old joke from Understation Live.
3672762	3673282	Look at that.
3673622	3674163	Look at that.
3674263	3674903	Bringing it back.
3675223	3675844	Hey, no.
3676444	3681307	On my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.
3681347	3682028	I'm going to find it now.
3682328	3684069	Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?
3684895	3685696	I probably did.
3685876	3687738	Actually, I think I made it before I had LiveJournal.
3687758	3688359	Or your Zonga.
3688379	3689721	I never had a Zonga.
3690161	3690822	Never had a Zonga.
3690902	3694907	Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week and I was like, oh yeah.
3695327	3696448	I'm gonna go find the Mitzcattles.
3696468	3696749	Hold on.
3696889	3700092	You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.
3700153	3701394	Have you seen the new MySpace?
3702735	3703195	They're trying.
3703215	3703896	You mean Pinterest?
3704256	3706117	Yeah, it's basically Pinterest.
3706457	3707417	But like, no, here's the thing.
3707457	3709598	Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.
3709878	3711179	But I was looking at the new MySpace.
3711219	3712179	I'm like, oh, okay.
3713379	3715700	So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.
3716141	3716981	That's what it is.
3719722	3720302	Still won't use it.
3720742	3721683	I kind of use Pinterest.
3722303	3722523	Do you?
3722543	3723604	What do you pin on Pinterest?
3724064	3728485	Usually like recipes and Supernatural and Mass Effect.
3728506	3729426	You're such a girl.
3729606	3729906	All right.
3730226	3730826	You know what?
3734491	3735394	I love the car.
3735634	3737499	The car really makes me happy.
3737980	3741650	Alright, going a step further here with Steam.
3745543	3746523	Did I get the... Oh, yeah, sorry.
3746543	3749885	There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game, McPixel.
3750225	3753806	It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.
3753866	3756448	It is now... Excuse me, Steam Greenlight.
3756508	3759289	I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.
3760149	3762410	Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.
3762810	3764011	It is now available for $4.99.
3764731	3771614	It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by using available tools.
3771954	3772494	It's awesome.
3772614	3775236	It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.
3775376	3776336	It's really awesome.
3776456	3776757	Is it?
3777277	3778097	It's ridiculous.
3778317	3778938	Yeah, did you play it?
3779378	3780439	Yeah, I beat the whole game.
3780459	3782220	I have it on my phone.
3782380	3782640	Nice.
3782880	3785922	And yeah, I paid for it and it was ridiculous.
3786102	3789323	It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.
3789583	3793406	It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games.
3794466	3798809	MacGyver, and something really retarded.
3799029	3799530	I don't know.
3799610	3805794	It's just like the guy's just... A lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people in the nuts.
3807776	3808536	That's so noted.
3808897	3809997	OMG, spoiler.
3811018	3811679	Spoiler.
3811779	3814901	Well, if you... Which puzzles, though?
3814921	3818283	I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in the nuts.
3818323	3820265	When in doubt, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.
3820285	3820905	See if it works.
3820925	3821466	Yeah, seriously.
3823092	3826973	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time.
3826993	3833595	A time when kicking people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.
3834715	3845158	It's the classic game of the week, a chance for DarkSakura to take a trip down memory lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this, shut up.
3845778	3849201	Seriously, by the way, I did post the Mint Scattles picture in chat.
3849882	3850823	You found it that quick.
3850883	3851443	I did it.
3851863	3852744	It was on my DeviantArt.
3852784	3853165	Duh.
3853625	3854746	I did it a long time ago, though.
3854826	3857048	Along with your Garris Shep pics.
3857188	3857528	You know what?
3857568	3858909	I haven't done any Garris Shep pics.
3858970	3860771	I'm actually getting... When did I do this?
3861972	3865435	Like... Years ago.
3865835	3866176	Anyway.
3866556	3867096	Here we go.
3867157	3867797	Classic of the week.
3867817	3868658	What'd you pick, DarkSakura?
3869058	3870139	I picked Donkey Kong Country.
3870740	3871080	Good pick.
3871733	3875115	So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.
3877497	3880199	How many of us cheered when we heard that?
3882781	3883201	Yay!
3904927	3905627	Oh, rare.
3906448	3906928	Oh, rare.
3910029	3914171	Also, I have to say it's funny because I do actually use Wikipedia for some of my references.
3914651	3917592	And I'm like, DKC redirects here for the genetic disease.
3917652	3920133	See, Diskeratosis Congenita.
3921154	3922354	It just made me laugh for some reason.
3922374	3923034	I was like, what is that?
3923174	3924175	It sounds like something to do with skin.
3925055	3931237	Anyway, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare and it came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.
3932377	3938259	It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.
3938879	3941160	It was done by Tim Stapler, by some dude.
3943030	3944391	This game was really cool.
3944411	3946432	There was so much going on with this one.
3946992	3950074	It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.
3950254	3951434	The Game Boy Color version had 41.
3952935	3957257	And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by Kremlings.
3957897	3974486	So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines, you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls, you can do all kinds of stuff, and you can spell out K-O-N-G, and get extra life balloons, you can do all kinds of stuff.
3975466	3980789	I love the rhino, and I like that you can ride a barrel and just notch it over while you're riding the barrel.
3982165	3986749	So, you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew, Diddy, and you can switch between them.
3986849	3989051	Diddy is more agile, but not as powerful.
3990072	3999201	And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the Rhino, Espresso the Ostrich, Engard the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot.
3999701	4002364	I want to know who thought of those names, because those are some dumb names.
4003705	4003845	Okay.
4004532	4007534	You have two player mode, so you can do contest or team.
4007994	4011537	So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.
4012137	4013658	And team, you play together.
4013758	4014579	You work together.
4014759	4016820	One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.
4018021	4020623	And you can track your progress through the map.
4020903	4024546	You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.
4024906	4029849	And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.
4031570	4033251	I want to know where he got that name.
4034912	4042517	Now, Bobby Blackwolf in chat is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music, so here you go, some underwater music.
4044418	4046699	Oh, I love this music.
4046719	4047359	There you go.
4054472	4082385	so anyway it was really it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed so it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it and it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong and that's pretty much become a standard now um
4084719	4091100	So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.
4092861	4095861	So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.
4095941	4096821	It was lots of fun.
4096861	4099502	There were different ways to play through each level.
4099982	4102122	You had secret rooms that you could get.
4102222	4105223	You had all kinds of different things that were going on.
4105283	4109384	You had all the balloons you could... Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.
4109804	4110924	I'm actually just going to hang up on him.
4112512	4113373	I'm hanging up on you.
4114373	4114934	Who was it?
4115194	4115494	I don't know.
4115514	4118596	800 number.
4119897	4125620	But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.
4125700	4126861	It had really fun music.
4126901	4133826	In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like bopping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.
4134506	4135307	So that was pretty funny.
4135327	4135367	Um...
4137888	4153160	So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was, it was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.
4154080	4156522	and Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.
4157743	4167892	So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006 and in Europe on December 8th and North America on the 19th of February, 2007.
4169613	4170334	There were sequels.
4170694	4171474	There were other ones.
4172235	4175238	There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.
4175858	4180562	There was three Dixie Kongs, Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64 and Donkey Kong Country Returns.
4182668	4183869	So, that was it.
4184990	4188853	This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.
4191175	4194358	Yeah.
4194898	4195158	Nice.
4195519	4195819	Not bad.
4197220	4197520	So is it.
4198781	4199342	There you go.
4199622	4204066	Your classic game of the week, Donkey Kong Country.
4204386	4206848	That's what happens when you try to say all those words too fast.
4208727	4209307	Oh, good times.
4209327	4211748	Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.
4211808	4212048	Please.
4212488	4216648	I found an NPC called, like, Chef Yon or something.
4217169	4218189	Or Cookmaster Yon.
4218509	4221729	So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yon.
4222990	4224070	And Yon can cook.
4225050	4230191	But it was Walk with Yon that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.
4231331	4235472	So I've actually been... Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.
4236652	4237052	There you go.
4239881	4243243	All right, I think it's time for a break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
4243263	4245964	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4245984	4248065	We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.
4248105	4251226	The recent shows have been very long, but hey, it happens sometimes.
4251306	4261010	But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4261050	4261391	You know what?
4261411	4263071	The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.
4263111	4266793	That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.
4267233	4270194	That's all fixed tonight, so I'm sure people will be getting in.
4270234	4274716	Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
4274756	4279919	We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4286727	4296496	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.
4296796	4303302	We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.
4303702	4308006	If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night of course at vognetwork.com.
4308646	4313651	Be sure to join us and chat live.vognetwork.com and Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.
4314191	4334547	Alright, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about, and I don't, I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is, but Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.
4335547	4343910	and of course one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go and that is coming.
4343950	4348271	They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.
4349612	4350432	That's pretty awesome.
4351161	4351481	DarkSakura.com
4366272	4368213	Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble
4396738	4397518	That sounds like a winner.
4397958	4405541	And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.
4407542	4408842	So, it's pretty sweet.
4409342	4415745	And I guess it's, you know, you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.
4417205	4418766	Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?
4419046	4421847	Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too.
4421867	4423727	I think they added some more games to that.
4423747	4424167	They did.
4424207	4425528	You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.
4426334	4426874	Wizorb.
4427274	4429014	Oh my god, I already bought all these games.
4429034	4429535	Yeah, Wizorb.
4429595	4439736	I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.
4440316	4441797	Oh, well, I can't be too upset.
4441857	4444137	I mean, I paid money for really good games.
4444157	4446918	Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.
4447678	4455099	No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use... Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.
4455419	4483353	oh nice okay yeah you should give one away it's a good deal one day left by the way and last but not least a game I'm very excited about Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week and not to be outdone by that D3 of America decided hey guess what Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US fuck yeah Loki was very happy
4483573	4488916	Yes, so that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.
4489236	4491417	Oh, that's a... Oh, okay, I was like, winter 2013?
4491598	4492638	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4492678	4495480	Remember, it's considered fall, you know.
4495520	4497381	Yeah, yeah.
4498281	4500102	So... Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.
4500503	4501383	No, no, not at all.
4501443	4501783	That's good.
4502063	4506506	And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.
4508527	4510628	A reason for you to own a Vita.
4510729	4514071	And apparently the people that played it at Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.
4514331	4519414	Like they actually added physics this time around and the details a little bit better.
4519875	4521156	Wait, they're trying to legitimize.
4521676	4522677	No, seriously.
4522877	4523537	I don't care.
4523617	4524278	It doesn't matter.
4524298	4525398	It's Sandbox making the game.
4525418	4526219	It's going to be awesome.
4526239	4528781	I have no doubt it's going to be awesome.
4528981	4531602	But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.
4532523	4535725	That's something that doesn't happen very often.
4535905	4537326	I still need to get a little Big Planet Vita.
4538567	4539247	Yeah, me too.
4540068	4543269	All right, moving on with some rapid-fire news over here.
4543929	4547651	I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.
4547771	4550632	It's dated Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams.
4551172	4560896	The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers, like really, really similar.
4561517	4562277	They kind of had a point.
4562617	4564678	I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.
4564698	4564778	Yes.
4588314	4595877	And I don't know if you've, they show it a little bit in the trailer about these shifting between different worlds.
4596057	4596578	Yeah, yeah.
4596618	4598438	And the music changes when you switch too.
4599379	4600239	Ah, that's pretty cool.
4600379	4603581	So they're saying it's like a platformer Garuga almost.
4603961	4604321	Okay.
4604541	4608763	That's kind of a neat concept and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.
4608783	4610824	They have a demo out there you can check out for free.
4611044	4613845	I actually backed it so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.
4614244	4614484	Nice.
4614925	4621409	Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013, which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there.
4623491	4624031	Very cool.
4624452	4626613	Congrats to the team there for getting that out.
4628234	4630576	The final title was voted upon by the community.
4630656	4634539	Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.
4634699	4635620	Yeah, I totally missed that.
4663602	4690351	After getting the initial amount The 1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal Because, quote, we are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath the Steel Sky And are currently discussing ideas for this project Which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse So there you go, the original game dates all the way back to 1994
4693100	4693880	Well, that's pretty cool.
4695461	4701143	If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project, Final Fantasy VI.
4701683	4704304	It's Overclock's Remix Final Fantasy VI album.
4704324	4705385	There was a Kickstarter for it.
4705465	4706585	It was shut down.
4707586	4710847	And it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.
4711167	4714048	It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.
4714208	4714628	Hmm.
4715068	4717349	But apparently all those issues have been worked out.
4717409	4718570	The fundraiser is back.
4719370	4728677	Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI Celebration, but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.
4729158	4732941	It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.
4733281	4738585	The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes or at events or what have you.
4739626	4746612	It's apparently trying to raise $30,000 but with 29 days left to go they are looking pretty good.
4747273	4748014	So there you go.
4748995	4752858	You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.
4753259	4756041	Let's hope for Actdeft's sake there's another Chocobo wrap on it.
4756642	4757523	That would be phenomenal.
4760265	4761506	Alright, let's move on, DarkSakura.
4761586	4762067	Chocobop.
4763942	4768546	There's a whole little I love this song he wrote about or I love this song?
4768886	4773149	This song's okay.
4773429	4775971	Fantasy Star Online 2 is free to play on the Vita.
4777192	4777973	Yay!
4778253	4780034	It needs to be free to play on PC.
4780214	4781275	Well, free to play on the Vita.
4782276	4783337	Hopefully that's here too.
4784352	4786413	Why must arcades close?
4786433	4787613	They don't make money.
4812885	4813826	Shut up, that's no excuse.
4813886	4816387	I think this particular one, that wasn't the case though.
4816527	4821751	The guy had been running it for 30 plus years and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.
4822171	4824452	So I actually don't think in this case it was a money thing.
4825213	4825493	Yeah.
4825573	4826894	But it was a landmark arcade.
4826934	4828575	I mean, it was a big deal.
4828995	4829936	Yeah, one of the big ones.
4830596	4834539	But it was a big home for fighting games too.
4834819	4837821	Because I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.
4837841	4837941	Right.
4840306	4841927	And then Prison Architect.
4842987	4853051	Basically, they had a paid alpha version and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.
4853891	4856072	The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.
4856852	4862714	Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one because apparently everybody's making money on there.
4864414	4864915	Just kidding.
4865995	4866495	Maybe you are.
4867215	4868516	Ha ha ha ha.
4869608	4870629	Okay, that's it.
4871770	4874513	Alright, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
4874613	4883162	Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities and we answer them and read the answers for you here right on the show.
4883942	4885584	This week it's all about Windows 8.
4887776	4891758	The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.
4892398	4895999	With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?
4896379	4897560	Is it something you're picking up?
4897680	4900221	Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?
4900661	4907564	Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows because I knew if I did that, somebody would say, fuck Windows, I'm on Linux.
4907704	4909024	Fuck Windows, I'm on Mac.
4909044	4910605	So there was kind of a two-part question.
4910765	4911726	Well, Mac, you don't have a choice.
4911746	4913847	You just have to upgrade when they come out with new ones.
4913887	4915247	Otherwise, your computer will stop working.
4915388	4922211	Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too, what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?
4922571	4926333	Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?
4926754	4928114	So let's go to Google Plus first.
4928755	4932617	I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E. I used to know him when he lived out here.
4933437	4962046	he answered the question saying I use Linux for many reasons but games are not one of them I'd say however that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OS's but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux and of course all Android devices run Linux but that's a different world of gaming
4962606	4967269	Now, if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.
4968449	4970190	I do want to add something, actually, Rob.
4970610	4973272	You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.
4973412	4977534	Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.
4977794	4979935	That's cool.
4979975	4984518	Flaco Jones responded on Google+, saying, I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.
4984658	4988480	I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs, and I can't stand it.
4988900	4991302	Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.
4991662	4993423	I love all the Mac OSes I've used.
4993723	4998146	There isn't a lot of variation between them, but they are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.
4998466	5002028	Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.
5002388	5009352	I do wish there were more games for Mac, because whenever I do play on a Mac, it feels a lot smoother than the PC version, even though my PC has slightly better specs.
5010773	5019319	Actdeft replied on Google+, saying the Win 8 Metro UI is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.
5019899	5024823	That interface is made for a tablet, and it would totally work for that really well, but not for a keyboard and mouse.
5025323	5034309	Also, considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them, Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture if your internet connection goes down or something.
5034729	5036090	I'm currently using Win XP.
5036270	5039532	I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.
5041354	5048941	Facebook, I love this nickname, I am super lazy, replied and said, it's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.
5049261	5055607	My thought is that it works best as a media center PC, but as a traditional PC, it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.
5055627	5056668	There might be better options.
5057429	5062953	Codeman said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs, but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.
5063193	5067176	You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.
5067696	5069157	What happened to the Windows XP days?
5069197	5069937	The good old days.
5070398	5075741	The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it and if you use Steam, you're really shit out of luck.
5075761	5083787	You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.
5083807	5084367	Of course.
5084387	5086909	I'm not looking forward to it.
5087809	5093851	VX, Jason, XV Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.
5094272	5104515	Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe and Notch have talked about will eventually set it up and if they don't already, quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface and then it's Windows 7 again.
5104976	5108397	Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the surface.
5108977	5109137	Hmm.
5109177	5109357	Hmm.
5137130	5140354	Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet, but from what I've seen, it looks messy.
5140714	5143598	I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.
5143978	5146040	I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.
5146080	5147662	We only just migrated to Windows 7.
5147742	5149645	Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.
5150345	5154851	And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.
5156289	5160716	I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on even back when I had a PC.
5161177	5162459	Macs have World of Warcraft.
5162479	5164582	That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.
5164983	5170070	I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.
5171292	5176216	Tiger Claw says, personally, I don't think you would notice any performance increase going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.
5176817	5178698	Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.
5179099	5187926	Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro-style UI that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard in Windows Phone.
5188526	5194131	I hate though actually about the UI real quick is the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.
5194351	5194672	Really?
5194992	5195192	Yeah.
5195472	5202138	Because remember it's made for tablets so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.
5202238	5202739	Fuck that.
5204760	5208945	Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.
5209485	5215912	Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.
5216553	5222720	Apparently from the way I understand the story is that he fears that with Windows 8 will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.
5223200	5223720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5238627	5245249	It's funny because last time I checked, his game is freely downloadable off his website and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.
5245529	5253232	But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores that you have to go through a certification process to get your app on there in the first place?
5253652	5256093	It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.
5256393	5265116	I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game from the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go and it's right there when I start the PC up?
5265436	5268798	Hell, last time I checked, you are not being held up at gunpoint to buy Windows 8.
5269098	5269658	Interesting point.
5269898	5278182	But I think the thing is, though, is for all those three platforms that you mentioned, there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.
5278202	5280704	Like, he cannot sell you a copy from his website.
5281084	5285066	Maybe you can for Android, because then you can do third-party apps and stuff like that.
5285086	5288688	But for everything else, you cannot buy straight from his website.
5288708	5289268	Right.
5289733	5290653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5312862	5319367	So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?
5319907	5322949	And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.
5324831	5327412	Microsoft charges for...
5328653	5331054	and updates on your games.
5332034	5333635	And how often is Minecraft updated?
5333835	5334555	About once a week.
5336016	5338057	Granted, those are beta updates and stuff like that.
5338097	5342718	You don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.
5343218	5347660	So why would he want to pay money to do that?
5348000	5351762	That's the same reason why his game's on Steam because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.
5351842	5352422	Fair question.
5353203	5354044	Okay.
5354064	5356407	Just a few more answers here from Zethers.
5356447	5357648	Windows 8 is like Vista.
5357788	5360872	Every other release of Windows have been bad for the past few years of show.
5361373	5362474	I'd rather wait for Windows 9.
5363115	5364277	So they're like Star Trek movies.
5365438	5366519	Seriously, it is.
5366640	5369163	Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.
5369585	5370005	DarkSakura,
5387612	5389294	No, no.
5389574	5391155	Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?
5391876	5392116	No.
5392396	5395179	I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.
5395239	5400804	Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it, so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.
5401584	5404707	But after the little bit I've watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.
5406004	5422993	They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson Nice Alright, Hitstun says Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2 and PC users will certainly skip it and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting What the hell?
5423754	5426475	UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting?
5426575	5426876	Really?
5427116	5427296	Yeah
5427856	5429937	And lastly, Sean L replies saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.
5458317	5462140	I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down and I write software for a living.
5462481	5465884	If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?
5466845	5471089	I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two maybe.
5471770	5471950	Wow.
5474847	5475528	Very interesting.
5475568	5476148	Alright, that's it.
5476168	5477209	The Fugle Question of the Week.
5477569	5478390	How about you guys?
5478730	5479070	Windows 8?
5480011	5480291	Yes?
5480531	5480791	No?
5480992	5481552	Maybe so?
5481732	5482012	Never.
5482453	5482733	Never?
5482753	5483153	Why?
5483193	5484574	Unless they make it like Windows 7.
5485775	5495963	Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000 into whatever the hell one came after that.
5497164	5498085	Xp or Vista?
5512581	5531924	I really like Windows 7 because it took the stuff that was good in Vista took actually a few bits and pieces for memory management from Linux and it's pretty solid on top of that I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users
5532644	5545248	and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.
5547048	5551449	The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5 because I used 6 at school.
5553090	5556591	That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.
5557951	5560052	I mean, it's a really good OS.
5560192	5561373	A lot of people use it.
5561813	5568657	It's got great graphical management, clearly, because I mean, that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.
5568697	5575341	However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually...
5576983	5578344	It's basically going to be the PC for idiots.
5598425	5603348	except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and try to figure out how to do things and it's just not working.
5604509	5609592	It's... I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.
5609712	5613414	Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off.
5613454	5615375	That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.
5615655	5615896	Yeah.
5616476	5622740	I just... I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.
5622820	5625802	It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.
5627683	5627903	Loki?
5628305	5634608	Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs like back in the 90s and the 80s?
5634688	5637250	I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.
5638230	5641192	I mean, seriously, it's like, come on.
5641592	5647315	The people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.
5647435	5651297	Kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs.
5651717	5652798	But yet, why are we like,
5654133	5663804	You know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use.
5664004	5666327	I know, because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit.
5667088	5667688	I guess that's it.
5668209	5672414	They've got that retirement money burning a hole through their pocket, I guess.
5673579	5674280	And Ranma, no.
5674380	5676062	A PC for idiots is not a Mac.
5676943	5678164	A PC for idiots is Windows 8.
5678224	5679786	End of story.
5680787	5683870	You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use a Mac OS.
5685912	5687333	Um, and no, I would not buy it.
5687613	5688673	I'm not getting Windows 8.
5689514	5691955	I'm gonna take the wait-and-see approach that somebody else said.
5692315	5695796	Um, I'm gonna be honest, this is gonna make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.
5696396	5707381	Uh, the fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.
5708601	5709101	Shut up.
5709301	5710202	Let's put it this way.
5710402	5710482	If...
5710942	5712003	For once, I'm not judging you.
5712743	5718826	If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go replacing it?
5720327	5721748	Just wait.
5723449	5726311	Wait for Windows 9 or something else.
5727461	5733048	Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.
5733068	5733789	Good job.
5733909	5734509	So there you go.
5735551	5744401	If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5744882	5745763	Let's get back into some news.
5745843	5746123	Loki.
5747144	5747445	One thing.
5748986	5757413	Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.
5761013	5772980	Alright, so there's a word out there, a phrase out there that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community.
5773020	5774121	It's called fan service.
5775101	5776622	And what do fans want?
5777323	5780945	Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.
5783391	5784171	Amen to that.
5784671	5793554	Team Ninja, they were saying that earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.
5794595	5795775	Where's the fun in that?
5795855	5803418	However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.
5804558	5823053	but the fans who had played the early demos we got a lot of feedback from them that said we want bigger breasts make the characters more like that that was kind of surprising giving the suggestions to tone down the sexuality and so Team Ninja being Team Ninja
5824634	5829076	Look, Team Ninja, props for trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.
5829096	5829936	Gold star, you tried.
5830076	5830936	Let's be real.
5831096	5837739	Dead or Alive is all about excess, and if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.
5838740	5839740	Then you have Virtua Fighter.
5839780	5841361	And a really shitty volleyball game.
5841381	5843242	No, no, no, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit.
5844082	5845003	I hate Virtua Fighter.
5845083	5845883	I love Dead or Alive.
5846143	5847584	Now, how do you feel about Bigger Boobs?
5848427	5849027	I'm all for it.
5849828	5850828	There you go.
5851549	5853290	Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio.
5853630	5854930	Even the women want bigger boobs.
5854951	5858713	Can you imagine Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts?
5859013	5859653	Fuck that.
5860273	5861534	Nope, not buying it.
5861554	5863155	But hey, you know what?
5863175	5868098	I don't want small-chested women to feel... There's fan clubs for that too.
5868538	5869638	The Itty Bitty Titty Committee.
5869919	5871339	There's fan clubs for that too.
5871399	5876282	But in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.
5877859	5878280	It really is.
5879541	5888549	I really think we should ramp up Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 3 with hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.
5888869	5891492	Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress up for dudes.
5892554	5893355	I've already got the butt floss string.
5909133	5913194	Yes, but you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.
5913474	5917336	I really want there to be a part three with pillow fight mode.
5917356	5919676	I think that would be a lot of fun.
5919696	5920737	Wait, wait, wait.
5920797	5923577	As you're doing pillow fight mode, like pieces of clothing just, oh.
5923617	5924418	Pillow fight mode?
5924438	5924938	Uh-huh.
5925838	5926538	Using the Kinect.
5930560	5932120	No, we don't have panda boobs.
5932520	5932920	Shut up.
5933000	5935281	Why are they talking about Pandaren in chat?
5937000	5950678	I don't know Furry boobies That might take you out of the experience a little bit Alright Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5 Moving on
5952842	5954542	This is the story that just won't go away.
5954623	5961744	Remember 38 Studios and how they closed and how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?
5962225	5968766	Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits because, you know, that's what happens.
5968806	5970307	Those things never leak out.
5971067	5971207	Or what?
5971227	5971327	Yeah.
5986544	5989346	and they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.
5989406	6001091	Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.
6001772	6012837	We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.
6014219	6015480	Here's something kind of scary, though.
6015500	6019182	I mean, if you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.
6019322	6032789	You license a game from... So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying, hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us?
6033169	6034010	Yeah, we need those back.
6035751	6037852	You licensed it, so you need to send them back.
6039517	6042257	Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have?
6042458	6043438	Yeah, with the license up.
6043618	6043878	Yank.
6046618	6046838	Fun.
6047618	6050519	But yeah, seriously, those XTKs do get out there.
6051719	6053619	I would know from personal experience.
6054640	6056620	And how much, approximately, would one set you back?
6057260	6065461	Not very much anymore, because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and JTAGs are pretty out there, there's not much use for XTKs anymore.
6065481	6066282	Like, 300, 400...
6069212	6069912	Oh, that's not too bad.
6071273	6074414	I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.
6075994	6076455	Interesting.
6077855	6079356	All right, well, moving on, DarkSakura.
6081296	6083317	Well, I was actually playing with my iPad.
6083337	6084017	Yeah, I can tell.
6084918	6085498	Pay attention.
6085678	6085958	Hey!
6086958	6089319	I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class.
6089339	6089859	You can't.
6089899	6093421	How about a really trippy-ass game called Middens?
6094721	6095481	Kitten Middens.
6096382	6096622	Okay.
6097822	6102326	I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.
6104588	6114276	It basically is an indie RPG, so it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy-ass backgrounds.
6115216	6124961	It looks like you're running headfirst through a combination of Dali or even going back to Hieronymus Bosch.
6125981	6128162	Yeah, I know, I'm going all art history on you guys.
6129623	6134565	It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.
6136126	6140688	Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.
6142941	6146323	Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this.
6146723	6148064	Because it's really fucking weird.
6148904	6150045	Well, at least you get a gun.
6151046	6152566	And you can try it out for free.
6154748	6155368	I like free.
6155868	6157949	Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.
6160251	6162232	Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.
6163257	6165559	You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.
6166619	6166959	Oh, that's right.
6166979	6167820	You're not here next week.
6167880	6168360	That's right.
6168380	6169841	I'm going to be... I forgot.
6170361	6170682	It's all right.
6170702	6173883	She won't play it anyways by next week.
6173903	6178686	She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.
6178786	6180027	No, I'm just playing for Becky.
6181548	6181888	There you go.
6181928	6184790	We should start a foundation where, you know... We should.
6184830	6186070	We should start a foundation.
6186130	6188192	Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.
6189852	6191253	We'll play Mass Effect for money.
6193607	6195329	It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation.
6196310	6201476	I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.
6201736	6202978	I don't play 24-7.
6203358	6206141	I basically play Mass Effect once a week.
6206181	6209505	Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is... Pandas!
6209885	6210266	Shut up.
6210446	6210866	My bad.
6211988	6213910	Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.
6214264	6216266	Actually, Bobby Blackwolf is volunteering.
6216346	6217587	He needs that foundation.
6217727	6219869	So he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.
6219889	6221590	That means that he has to come over to my house.
6223452	6229717	Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.
6229777	6230218	That's true.
6230478	6232359	And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.
6232480	6233921	The Church of Garrus Foundation.
6233981	6238505	Thank you, AskDeft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos.
6238565	6239405	Now they're little asses.
6240286	6258768	um also Alpha Cananogram asked about me having an iPad yeah I didn't actually bring it up on the show Dan traded his transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card power supply and got Borderlands 2 and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad
6260538	6261399	So he made it up to me.
6261419	6262860	He traded a Transformer?
6263160	6263660	Like a doll?
6263820	6267963	No, he traded his shitty Android shit.
6269004	6269905	He didn't like it anyway.
6270145	6273447	I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.
6275008	6276629	We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.
6276830	6278010	Alright, I get it now, sorry.
6278050	6280512	But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway.
6280532	6283274	Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.
6285095	6290079	But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it and he was going to sell it anyway so he got me an iPad instead.
6290575	6292196	What do you think this is, Rob G4?
6294336	6295036	I'm just a pretty face.
6295056	6297997	Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day.
6298017	6302019	I'm like, I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Reb.
6302479	6305740	The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.
6305820	6306860	I mean, seriously.
6307640	6312682	He just sits there and is like, okay, what retard thing can I say next?
6312802	6313422	Funny joke.
6313482	6314022	Ha, ha, ha.
6314102	6314622	I'm funny.
6315043	6315863	And they're just like...
6316523	6318624	What the fuck did that have to do with anything?
6318644	6327628	It's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.
6329349	6337273	And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android.
6337493	6338313	I've used it.
6338473	6339714	I've given it a chance.
6339814	6342255	I hate Windows tablets even more.
6344278	6347040	IOS has what I want to do and Wacom loves it.
6347360	6347741	The end.
6348921	6351503	DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see.
6351883	6352784	What is the old saying?
6352984	6354605	She's a hater and guess what she's gonna do?
6355046	6355806	I'm gonna hate!
6358388	6359088	Exactly.
6361110	6362471	Y'all can bite my tuchus.
6363255	6366158	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, S3 greater than iPhone.
6366178	6366919	You know it's hilarious.
6366959	6367339	I don't care.
6367599	6368540	You know it's hilarious.
6368640	6369521	No, this is what's hilarious.
6369941	6371243	iPhone 5 comes out, right?
6372604	6377769	My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old-ass BlackBerry.
6377789	6380271	He has one of the first BlackBerrys a long time ago.
6380291	6381632	He has an old-ass phone, right?
6382033	6384455	He finally decides he's going to join the current generation of phones.
6384735	6386617	So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches?
6386897	6387798	Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.
6389079	6389860	Bravo.
6390480	6391201	Bravo.
6392042	6392903	Wise choice.
6393723	6394144	Keeper.
6394224	6395105	He's a keeper.
6395185	6399529	Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.
6401791	6414523	But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile, which apparently has treated him very well over the years, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.
6414543	6414923	Galaxy.
6415259	6416520	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6441226	6451309	Because I have a... Well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's... Actually, it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight-up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.
6451789	6460052	You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is $30 for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use.
6460092	6466594	And even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data, so...
6467716	6471584	I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3.
6471864	6474590	I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever.
6474610	6475392	The only thing
6476296	6499138	the reason why I like it is in a whole like you know what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that let me play with that and you can do the same thing with my iPhone right he probably uses my iPad more than I do but the reason the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T we don't get the free text messages and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that so that's the one thing I don't like
6499445	6502147	I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?
6502167	6503789	I do.
6503909	6504849	Well, way to go.
6505150	6506050	Great provider.
6506331	6509933	Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.
6509953	6511094	I have a cheap plan, $30 a month.
6513857	6514177	All right.
6515238	6515658	T-Mobile.
6516379	6516759	All right.
6517319	6517860	Moving on.
6518360	6519141	Loki, you got a story.
6519767	6531674	Alright, Borderlands 2, there's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.
6533495	6541939	They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on...
6543420	6545022	I forget what fucking service it is.
6545182	6550668	It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.
6553761	6558967	When you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff.
6559887	6562931	You know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.
6563011	6564672	So your badass rank goes away.
6564833	6574783	All your... Not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.
6574803	6576304	Because the way the badass points work is...
6577225	6593619	All of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters or all of your characters and then you get perks like plus 1% to your damage or something like that and it's spread across all your characters.
6595640	6601746	So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people how
6602551	6609402	It has happened to you that you submit your save so they can take a look at it.
6610604	6611646	And they're investigating.
6612995	6616417	MM2K in our chatroom wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?
6616937	6618258	Yes, it's all platforms.
6619359	6619659	Uh-oh.
6620139	6627824	It's because it's tied to... It's not Premium Club, it's... Fuck, I forget what it's called.
6627984	6640732	They have it on the front page there, you can sign up for it, and it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get, and... Once you've signed up, they give you one additional key...
6643248	6667785	so they have that honestly if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up I mean I think there's save it throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families because that works so well for other people I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to not that anyone would do that but you can
6669506	6685924	so and not only does it erase your badass points it's basically everything that's tied to your account so all your skins and faces that you've unlocked and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions are gone so and some of those there are maybe no way to get those back so that kind of sucks
6687583	6687883	All right.
6689184	6692106	Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.
6692967	6694248	There was another one?
6694308	6696629	There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.
6697250	6698811	And it was about New Super Mario Bros.
6699071	6699912	2 and the DLC.
6700252	6703634	The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros.
6703654	6712180	2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's, first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.
6712260	6714021	Wow, they're not late to the party.
6714482	6714682	No.
6714762	6715482	Well, you know what?
6716403	6722148	Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is A-OK arriving late to this party.
6722749	6724230	But, you know, New Super Mario Bros.
6724250	6729695	2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra and some of the levels that will be available.
6730115	6732057	Go Go as Gold Mario Pack.
6732437	6736141	Three Gold Mario-themed courses up to 30,000 coins.
6736881	6738463	Challenge the Record A-Pack.
6738863	6741405	It will post the top scores on the game's website.
6741946	6742046	Ooh!
6742546	6745749	and Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels.
6746510	6748212	Those will all be in the coin rush mode.
6748432	6750534	So are they like legitimizing Asshole Mario?
6750574	6751916	Because that's kind of awesome if true.
6753417	6756160	October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan.
6756721	6757942	200 yen each.
6758162	6761586	I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind.
6761946	6765770	And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.
6766070	6775639	Once again, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have, crossing Nintendo Mario with LittleBigPlanet.
6775919	6777221	Can you imagine if they did that?
6777361	6782506	First-party Nintendo games, but a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, and LittleBigPlanet
6786549	6809573	Nintendo would never let that happen because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters because people like if Mario like Mario Mario was in Little Big Planet people would be building levels it's like Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that and like Nintendo would never well no it wouldn't necessarily be like that it would be just like um you know you design your own levels
6809895	6810255	DarkSakura.com
6827666	6829608	Because there's always going to be some dude out there.
6829788	6831750	I'm sure there are people they have dedicated their lives to.
6832110	6834572	I'm going to create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.
6834893	6837075	I think I have a rule about design.
6837235	6841018	Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm going to have to run this by DarkSakura.
6841038	6841659	Are you ready?
6842239	6843741	Tell me if this is a true statement or not.
6845262	6846623	This is a very zen statement.
6846663	6848845	I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria.
6850126	6852749	Where there is design, there is penis.
6855189	6855389	No.
6856170	6856931	What do you mean no?
6857351	6865940	When there are immature minds, there is penis.
6866120	6867761	And where isn't there immature minds?
6869063	6870364	Clearly not in the internet.
6870584	6871986	The internet is quite mature.
6872326	6873147	Thank you very much.
6874268	6874768	Think about it.
6874808	6876170	I want you to go ask your teacher.
6877734	6879315	I heard this on an internet radio show.
6879355	6881076	Where there is design, there is penis.
6881136	6881696	What do you think?
6881756	6884898	He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.
6885478	6887099	That is so true, is what he'll say.
6887820	6888960	No, he'll roll his eyes.
6889121	6890842	I know he would do it.
6891002	6892102	And he'd just go, what?
6892202	6895524	Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.
6896685	6897565	I've seen his art.
6897685	6899607	It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.
6900907	6901187	Yet.
6901848	6901948	No.
6903362	6904943	Where there is design, there is penis.
6905163	6907444	I sense an art book possibility.
6907904	6910285	You know, I'm making an art book.
6910305	6914127	Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.
6914167	6914788	Thank you!
6914808	6923992	It will be rated M. There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was guess who drew the penis.
6924152	6929175	And somebody would take around a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.
6929555	6931836	And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.
6932356	6933957	And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.
6934037	6937399	We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire.
6937519	6938740	Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama.
6938780	6939080	Shut up.
6939280	6939600	Nerd.
6940021	6943242	We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.
6943983	6944643	Oh, that game.
6944943	6945183	Yeah.
6945524	6946424	Who doesn't know that game?
6946464	6950707	But I have to tell you, I was at Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.
6951387	6954609	And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.
6955910	6956370	There you go.
6975069	6981651	Mario, Zelda, not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.
6982071	6982631	That'd be awesome.
6985132	6985452	All right.
6986412	6987933	Blackwolf says, Excitebike.
6988753	6990213	Can you do a penis in Excitebike?
6990273	6991053	It'll probably be very difficult.
6991073	6995015	No, because they have, you know, it's... I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.
6995115	7003457	Well, I remember that you could... I remember that you could draw things in Excitebike based on letter.
7003897	7006442	Like you would choose a letter and that would be with the obstacle over here.
7006462	7008185	So you could technically make a corset with penis.
7008265	7011752	Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.
7012073	7013295	So think about it.
7014036	7014457	Think about it.
7015519	7016280	Or don't think about it.
7017646	7020928	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Alright, true story here.
7021468	7025150	When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.
7025551	7032414	So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.
7032895	7036657	Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.
7037317	7041519	The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.
7043308	7046231	We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.
7047393	7051157	I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the Fry's penis on the Orange Lodge Radio website.
7051177	7051638	Nobody cares.
7053379	7054321	It's got hairy balls.
7055262	7055942	Oh, hooray.
7056143	7056563	Hooray.
7062989	7065631	I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.
7066552	7068073	I've had a really crazy week.
7069013	7073256	I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.
7074296	7076158	Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder.
7076218	7080020	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.
7080420	7084343	DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out an email that she thinks, Hey!
7084803	7084923	Ew!
7085643	7085884	Hey!
7085904	7086304	Ew!
7086324	7086404	Ew!
7087841	7088381	I'm going to read this.
7088521	7089262	It's kind of sticky.
7091703	7092404	Good evening.
7093144	7095906	I have to object to something DarkSakura said on last week's OLR.
7095946	7097267	Well, too fucking bad, Skip.
7097387	7097787	No, I'm kidding.
7098588	7103511	Last week, DarkSakura called Dan's reference to the fake game Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition reprehensible.
7104071	7105572	I find this to be abhorrent.
7106413	7111896	How is Nintendogs Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference Beat and Groovy The Ike Turner Experience?
7112236	7112517	Wow.
7113377	7118258	In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.
7118598	7128861	Britney's Dance Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent, Ew!
7129161	7129541	Wow.
7129881	7131702	Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.
7132870	7133771	Next email.
7133891	7134231	Next email.
7150067	7150667	Next email.
7151107	7151588	Next email.
7152108	7155729	First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.
7156329	7168073	I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three-month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey Collection when I tried to redeem the 30-day voucher the system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it.
7168653	7171174	Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?
7172938	7174721	That's a great question for Sony.
7174861	7175462	I don't know.
7175562	7177846	I don't think so because it's auto-renewing.
7178727	7179769	You could turn that off, though.
7179789	7181412	You could turn off the auto-renewing.
7181432	7182774	The catch is they want you to do that.
7186028	7189651	The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.
7189911	7199639	Hold on though, because I just tip, get one of those prepaid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.
7200700	7203322	Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.
7204183	7209587	Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the McFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?
7209867	7210648	Fuck if I know.
7212463	7213804	The answer is, I don't.
7215986	7217226	I wanted the Sylvanas figure.
7217347	7217807	That was it.
7217907	7219268	Because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.
7219642	7221584	Wargan Death Knight with Swift Griffin Keep having a good show Robert M
7244071	7247873	Now here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question.
7247933	7251695	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards.
7252175	7255276	I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.
7256077	7261059	Tiger Claw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.
7262140	7267805	SSJ100Matt says the thing is that by law they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto-charge thing, of course.
7268485	7273590	So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.
7273710	7278074	So yeah.
7278874	7279695	Next email.
7279955	7283458	And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.
7283658	7285460	So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping...
7286232	7286873	Sylvanas Faker.
7287373	7287793	Oh, Garrus.
7287993	7288294	Garrus.
7288634	7289314	I really want Garrus.
7289395	7290696	Garrus greater than Sylvanas.
7291216	7291656	Just saying.
7292157	7292497	Yes, ma'am.
7292877	7293638	Or a plushie panda.
7293938	7294999	Actually, I have a plushie panda.
7295359	7296200	Why not all three?
7297697	7321015	I have a plush panda no for real okay I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant and when I was in fourth grade my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off so that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck and I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon true story okay
7323143	7323983	Greetings, OLR.
7324043	7325284	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7326024	7327385	Here's my review of Borderlands 2.
7328065	7328485	Awesome!
7328605	7329166	For the PC.
7330266	7336388	My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.
7336749	7338389	Then I played it on my gaming PC.
7339710	7340570	Blood and ashes.
7340730	7341751	It's incredible.
7343031	7347775	It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.
7348235	7352638	The huge levels, the game improves upon the first in every way there is.
7353019	7358142	The voice acting is great, the dialogue is genius, and Claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.
7359023	7361745	I highly recommend it.
7362365	7365928	What system is Loki playing the game on, and has he played it on a gaming PC?
7366068	7368149	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Sirius Turtle.
7368490	7371792	Xbox 360, no I have not, because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.
7372697	7375758	You'll wait until a Steam sale anyway, right?
7375778	7378119	If my laptop doesn't run it, then there's no reason for me to buy it.
7378279	7378499	Dope.
7379339	7380939	No reason, but it doesn't mean I won't do it.
7383080	7386341	Well, I mean, it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought this.
7386701	7390782	It was like $7 for Borderlands.
7390822	7393363	And that would be something I'd have to buy the Game of the Year edition.
7393763	7396144	I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.
7398064	7401065	Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?
7401385	7401905	Let's shall.
7402125	7403566	Alright, that was the last email, right?
7403926	7404686	Yes.
7404766	7408387	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
7408507	7409927	And you should, dammit.
7410747	7411828	I want to get more emails.
7412328	7412668	Dammit.
7413148	7413828	And you can read them.
7414749	7415109	Dammit.
7416229	7416589	Dammit.
7418670	7419710	Oh God, please don't.
7419770	7422931	Oh, this is bad.
7422991	7423311	Here.
7432535	7453713	My FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raijan, which I actually still need some kind of money for.
7454814	7455115	Very...
7455735	7456937	You weren't able to get that.
7457398	7458881	You weren't able to get that, find that.
7459882	7460103	Yeah.
7460143	7460924	Gone.
7461525	7464249	I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key.
7464750	7468657	But I've lost my 18-year-old Bats Maruki chain.
7470327	7473109	FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.
7473469	7473609	Done.
7473649	7473830	Loki...
7495350	7497251	I don't need the people that drift into other lanes.
7497832	7503136	Because it seems like all the time, like driving here today, there's like four or five of them.
7503596	7506599	Like seriously, people, pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.
7507700	7510482	Like texting or just plain stupid.
7510642	7512363	Urgh, I'm in another lane now.
7516807	7521110	My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night, but today.
7521370	7524433	And headaches can be very disabling, especially when you're really busy.
7524893	7526174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7544372	7572095	so if you did the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland it had nothing to do with Disneyland or work it was all here back at home nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip however everything happens for a reason what does it kill us makes us stronger la la la la la la la la so whatever why can't everything be perfect 24-7 damn it and easy I like easy
7573817	7574297	and Lazy.
7575878	7577399	Yes, also had nothing to do with VOG.
7577439	7578080	That's important.
7578720	7579240	Thank you, Bobby.
7580001	7581462	If it had something to do with VOG, you'd know.
7583243	7584803	Alright, moving on.
7585324	7590487	A few more news stories for you guys and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line.
7590887	7595530	Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7595610	7595830	Loki.
7596229	7596829	FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii
7621827	7644162	Um, they actually, there was an article that was run on, um, Nintendo Gamer, and, uh, apparently, looking at the game, and, uh, I guess Wayne Rooney, uh, they've replaced him, um, or I guess with, uh, one of, uh, Lionel Messi, is one of the examples of just the simple changes that they did in the game.
7644242	7647564	Basically, the games are identical, except for, you know, the cover star's been changed.
7648365	7650766	Um, you know, the title's FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.
7651627	7662318	They've done the roster updates and changed uniforms and added the clubs that they've updated.
7663539	7665581	Aside from that, the game is exactly the same.
7667323	7668484	So that's kind of disappointing.
7668965	7670627	I guess they figured that no one would notice?
7672406	7673908	I mean, put minimal effort into it.
7673928	7675729	We'll trick them, wah-ha-ha.
7676010	7679593	Yes, so very interesting.
7681916	7689623	And there was, I guess, a review on the official Nintendo magazine, UK, that they were kind of talking about those as well.
7690184	7695349	And it's just funny.
7697410	7701012	Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual?
7701352	7701592	60 bucks?
7702413	7704714	I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think.
7705774	7706175	50 or 40.
7708716	7710177	But yeah, it's still pretty full.
7710277	7713198	It's not like a $20 game or something like that.
7715419	7718161	Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year.
7720142	7724644	So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.
7727506	7728287	It's just decent.
7728507	7728967	It's bad.
7729148	7734553	I mean, that's pretty blatant that they would do that.
7735376	7735696	All right.
7736137	7741380	Let's go to this last story here, which is about... And this is one of those things where I'm like, please stop.
7741640	7742021	Don't.
7742301	7742661	No.
7742841	7744803	This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody.
7744963	7746344	It's going to just kill the industry.
7746544	7746884	Watch.
7748225	7749606	It's about Ubisoft.
7750787	7755490	Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free-to-play games for the marketplace.
7755550	7757191	Now, that in itself is not a bad thing.
7758152	7770127	But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions And yes, I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron
7770878	7772940	on this particular article, yeah.
7773641	7786612	Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free-to-play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free-to-play model.
7787092	7790655	The next generation will offer more and more item-based content.
7790996	7793318	This will benefit our game's profitability.
7794979	7795480	No, it won't.
7796160	7798082	When we start rejecting that bullshit...
7801127	7803388	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7804168	7805288	Do not want.
7805348	7806749	Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible.
7806929	7813991	It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character.
7814071	7815051	Level up a little faster.
7815731	7818152	And then some of them, this guy's, hey, here's a mission.
7818172	7820832	We're going to get some more money for free.
7820872	7826154	You know, if you find these ten things, you get all these money, all these different monies.
7827194	7851802	and um so yeah that's not a good example of um DLC also EA very notable for charging for cheats one of the one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer like you know to basically cheat and I'm sure those things sell like crazy yeah FIFA
7852762	7871048	I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the DLC for the other stuff Don't encourage them, bonk
7871903	7872964	So I bought like two packs.
7873284	7873685	But anyway.
7873845	7877287	Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs.
7878148	7880970	So, yeah, I don't see a downside for them.
7881891	7884093	People are going to go, oh, those are terrible.
7884153	7884913	Why are you doing it?
7884954	7886275	It's going to ruin the industry.
7886475	7887476	And then people buy them.
7887796	7890318	So that's why there's DLC in those games.
7890358	7893100	The free-to-play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.
7893380	7895302	I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House.
7895442	7898364	I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount thing.
7900686	7902267	People pay $25 per amount.
7902287	7903889	Never have done that.
7904449	7905410	That's too much.
7905470	7906591	I know lots of people that have done it.
7906631	7908813	Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.
7909153	7909853	And hey, you know what?
7909893	7910414	It's your money.
7910474	7911895	Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose.
7911935	7915178	But I just don't... Like the price of the expansion was $40.
7916479	7919641	Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion.
7919761	7921343	I don't get that logic at all.
7921703	7926907	The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet.
7927768	7928849	No, there were two charity pets.
7929069	7929489	And that's it.
7929609	7930230	That's all I've bought.
7930450	7930890	I like that.
7931611	7933472	There's a comment on the story here.
7934513	7937495	Basically, they coined the phrase pay-to-pay.
7938496	7940057	So that's what we're going to call these games.
7940157	7940877	Pay-to-pay games.
7940977	7941918	Pay-to-pay games.
7942058	7942578	I like that.
7942979	7944540	And I think these should be called out.
7944620	7950704	And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.
7952645	7981908	Saints Row the Third perfect example of DLC gone wrong if it's locked in the game if it's like locked costumes in the game not additional stuff that they hey we made this new character class or something like that that's just it's bullshit you shouldn't have to pay for that stuff and yes I understand you don't have to pay for it but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want
7982802	7986145	And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing.
7986645	7989548	Like, all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing.
7991169	7991690	Like, really?
7992791	7993011	Really?
7996149	7999491	I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight.
7999531	8000852	We are going to go to the Skype line.
8000892	8002373	The Skype line is open right now.
8002393	8007676	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8007736	8009657	We will start taking calls here.
8009837	8010638	Go ahead and give us a call.
8011278	8015701	You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about.
8015821	8017261	That is just fine as well.
8017842	8024846	Meanwhile, we'll also go to our Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those.
8026833	8030796	And also, Loki, you'll probably have some last minute news, right?
8032937	8033578	News?
8033658	8035139	You don't have last minute news tonight.
8035899	8037941	No, I don't have any last minute news.
8038241	8039182	Oh my gosh.
8039422	8042624	Alright, well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones.
8043204	8044585	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8045126	8045986	Legend of Zaku here.
8046166	8048028	Hey, what's up?
8048088	8053691	Nothing much, just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed, trying to get in one call.
8054132	8055593	But yeah, I just wanted to bring up the...
8056832	8068400	A little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week, where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.
8068880	8072423	We did talk about this in Part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?
8073844	8079307	So, I don't know, I'm kind of puzzled in the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS...
8080613	8085097	and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms.
8085958	8091083	And yet, he's having a fit with Microsoft again.
8091963	8095406	So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back.
8096187	8103794	I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others that are just the same.
8104074	8106116	Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?
8106416	8121509	Yes, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different architecture, different platform.
8121829	8123490	Hey Kettle, this is Pot.
8123651	8128935	Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, that'd be great.
8128955	8130597	Stop being rude, Rob.
8131097	8132018	Again, this is Pot.
8132158	8133059	That's P-O-T.
8133439	8135060	It's Zaku.
8136882	8138183	Did you say black or back?
8139484	8139945	Back.
8140985	8142847	The Pot calling the Kettle back.
8143608	8145189	It's the Pot calling the Kettle black.
8146230	8146730	The phrase.
8146750	8149553	The saying is usually the Pot calling the Kettle black, but that's okay.
8150526	8151387	All right, yeah, I get it.
8151907	8152627	All right, 1L.
8152687	8153708	But you get the idea.
8153728	8170539	It's pretty much, it's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically, that's what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is like the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS.
8171560	8174323	on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.
8174363	8180949	So, in other words, he kind of likes, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of ass rape while complaining about another.
8182410	8183391	That's pretty much what it is.
8183931	8186654	Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed.
8186674	8188956	I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.
8189937	8190657	What was that?
8191238	8193180	I said the iOS platform is not really closed.
8193200	8197083	I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that, but they're, unless you're Google.
8197103	8197844	Yeah.
8199305	8225680	you have a different set of rules in Google Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either he contracted or somebody bought the rights to it he didn't really do it for the 360 somebody else did so is he really supporting the closed platform?
8226641	8229303	I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand.
8229343	8232905	He's representing the game itself.
8233346	8245675	I don't think it's not as relevant the fact that he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform, but in the end of the day, it's still his game, that it just went beyond PC.
8245775	8251699	It went beyond a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.
8253176	8263185	Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.
8263585	8265166	And that's where I see the hypocrisy.
8265947	8278517	You greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.
8280749	8282530	and I don't see where it adds up.
8282950	8283310	I don't.
8285130	8285450	Alright.
8286471	8288171	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8289871	8290312	Let me see.
8290352	8292472	This just came in to Kotaku today.
8292492	8300334	38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG won't be facing federal charges.
8302214	8305215	So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds.
8307037	8317755	Even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.
8319285	8348488	and it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself from what I'm hearing is that Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you or really to do any professional project for you exactly
8350456	8350836	That's it.
8350896	8368021	It's like, you know, at the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who worked their asses off at the studios trying, you know, on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.
8368101	8370141	And none of them have been held accountable.
8371142	8375863	In that sense, they just walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.
8376314	8380905	Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?
8382315	8390080	People's Court would have been better, but... I think, yeah, there's gonna be... I'm not surprised that there'll be, like, lawsuits over this.
8390560	8401026	Like, Curt Schilling, I don't... I mean, he's off the... He's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.
8402087	8412013	One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just gonna, like, gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't, like, making payroll...
8414765	8420888	So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities.
8422149	8426111	So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.
8428072	8431315	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much.
8431435	8431715	Take care.
8431775	8432195	Have a good night.
8433096	8435318	Bye.
8435338	8439161	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to call.
8440082	8440902	Just missed one.
8441663	8444145	Sometimes people call and wait and hope to get through.
8444205	8445206	I just missed it.
8445666	8446266	Sorry about that.
8447327	8447707	All right.
8448567	8451968	Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing.
8452088	8452829	You might have pinged out too.
8452849	8453329	Yeah, I did too.
8453569	8456890	For like, oh man, it pisses me off.
8456930	8461372	I didn't get to see the comments in chat to the call me back comment.
8461792	8465693	I do see one from Actdeft that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.
8468994	8470275	Oh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8470295	8470615	Who's this?
8471496	8471976	What up, guys?
8472056	8473157	It's Xeno from the OKC.
8473197	8473738	How you guys doing?
8473778	8474479	Hey, Xenocore.
8474519	8475359	Haven't heard from you in a while.
8475379	8475860	How you doing?
8476801	8477902	You know, staying employed.
8478362	8479043	Same old, same old.
8479143	8479903	That's a good thing.
8479943	8480704	What's on your mind, buddy?
8481405	8483927	I've been playing a bit of Planetside 2, actually.
8484347	8485108	Ooh, all right.
8485168	8485988	How's that going for you?
8486669	8491673	Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this.
8491814	8493655	Now, every single base is different.
8493855	8499160	Tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game's going to be free on release, so why not?
8500834	8502275	Wait, this is a totally free game?
8502875	8506558	Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.
8506878	8508399	Oh, of course, of course.
8508459	8509540	That's how things are going.
8509920	8517064	Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?
8518886	8523128	Well, Ubisoft, I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.
8526101	8531243	I did not realize that Planetside was originally 2003, the first one.
8531263	8532244	That's really old.
8532724	8535805	Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making at E3 2001 when I went.
8536505	8537886	And it looked damn good then.
8538626	8540407	You know, just the playability and everything else.
8540487	8543628	And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?
8544388	8547730	And here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up.
8547930	8550731	They got at least three years with the development of this one based on what it looks like.
8551252	8554533	Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?
8555093	8556193	It's closed beta right now.
8556433	8557494	Ah, okay, I gotcha.
8557574	8558794	But you can buy your way in.
8558914	8565436	You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.
8565696	8565916	Right.
8566216	8569597	And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.
8570017	8572358	So what is it that draws you to Planet Psy?
8572378	8574659	Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day.
8574779	8579100	What is it that draws you to this game versus... Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?
8580496	8581877	Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly.
8581897	8584498	I played the first Planetside, played Earth and Beyond.
8584538	8585759	I played a whole bunch of that, my son.
8585859	8589721	You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi, planet-y space games.
8589801	8590441	Is that a thing?
8591262	8593043	Well, it's one of my things, yeah.
8593483	8593803	Okay.
8593983	8594943	Well, no, I think that's cool.
8594984	8596684	I just noticed that little trend going on there.
8596944	8600106	Well, what is it about Planetside specifically that draws you to that series?
8600967	8603468	It's more like a full military...
8604386	8608270	I can actually use some of the stuff I learned piloting, doing air support, so.
8631194	8637098	Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.
8637218	8643622	I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this.
8643722	8644702	I had no idea.
8645162	8652287	Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal...
8652987	8658315	that the sequel's title was Planetside Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.
8658975	8662280	Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?
8664102	8664944	I think he's depressed.
8666165	8666666	Hey, wait a minute.
8666706	8667387	I have a live journal.
8667407	8667848	You shut up.
8669389	8671771	He just recently posted to it too, August 11th, 2012.
8672091	8676434	That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.
8676974	8679496	PlanetSide 2, what is it and why do I want to play it?
8680336	8684319	PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE.
8684759	8689583	The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.
8689963	8694006	When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.
8695186	8699129	All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles with
8699229	8699589	StarCraft 2
8719887	8721907	I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry.
8721967	8725208	It's a very interesting way to put out your press releases.
8725228	8727809	Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.
8728649	8729509	Good to know.
8730009	8732610	Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?
8733590	8742612	Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC.
8743832	8744812	I'm really loving FTL.
8744832	8745872	That game's freaking amazing.
8746292	8747132	And Dark Souls.
8747212	8747933	Oh my gosh.
8748113	8749233	That game is ruthless.
8750194	8752016	I know, as all games should be.
8752856	8757921	This Namby Pamby, you know, you level twice so you win bull crap.
8759002	8763185	Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.
8763666	8766568	You press the button in time with the music, you win an internet.
8767069	8767789	Yeah, exactly.
8767889	8768370	Screw that.
8769891	8772173	All right, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8772733	8773654	No, that's pretty much it.
8773674	8774555	Y'all have a good show.
8774795	8775416	You too, buddy.
8775456	8775776	Take care.
8775856	8776437	Don't be a stranger.
8777017	8777478	All right, later.
8777658	8777858	Later.
8779449	8781791	Let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight.
8781851	8782832	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8782852	8783172	Who's this?
8784133	8784653	It's Shane.
8785114	8785654	Hey, Shane.
8785674	8786154	How you doing?
8786775	8787335	I'm doing well.
8787676	8789597	Did you have fun on the live hoard house this week?
8790418	8792780	No, I was too distracted playing WoW.
8793340	8793500	Aww.
8794221	8794541	Yeah.
8794621	8795582	How's WoW going for you?
8796402	8800646	I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90.
8801166	8806971	So I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else ever.
8807211	8808472	What level is your main pet?
8809584	8811204	I keep rotating all of them out.
8812085	8814805	I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now.
8815405	8817006	And I've got like almost 100 pets.
8817146	8817786	What is the name?
8818006	8820526	Oh my, you've leveled all of your pets to 5?
8821006	8821966	I'm starting to.
8822026	8823667	I've got maybe about 10 of them done.
8824787	8825767	What do you name your pets?
8825807	8826987	Do you custom name all your pets?
8827548	8829928	No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.
8830708	8833989	I've been naming mine after Mass Effect characters.
8834089	8834689	Mine are better.
8835453	8838574	No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?
8838694	8839694	That doesn't make sense.
8839974	8841095	Because, I don't know.
8841415	8843775	I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.
8843895	8845356	You named your dog Helo?
8846256	8848116	Yes, but that's adorable.
8850737	8855738	Now, Rob, did I tell you I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character?
8856799	8857219	Which one?
8857499	8857919	Cuddles.
8858179	8859379	Cuddles, aw.
8859920	8861460	I named my high gel cub Cuddles.
8862460	8864002	and didn't, didn't, what was Shane's?
8864022	8865444	Shane had a cute character name too.
8865464	8866445	It was like Fluffles.
8866465	8866966	Fluffles.
8867106	8867607	That was it.
8868167	8868368	Yes.
8868388	8870631	Well maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.
8870991	8871572	Alright, there you go.
8871852	8872974	Shane, would that be happy for you?
8873493	8875635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8897040	8897982	Stop judging me.
8898663	8899324	What was that?
8899344	8901547	I told Rob to stop judging me.
8901627	8905112	I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.
8905232	8906114	I had a headache.
8907952	8910593	That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.
8910653	8912374	I've been leveling my character.
8912454	8915555	It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.
8915856	8917556	I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?
8918757	8920538	Is it D Space?
8920558	8920878	Whatever.
8921138	8923939	I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not.
8924279	8926741	But it was like number six on the list of things it found.
8926781	8928041	It didn't make any sense to me.
8928601	8932203	Like it picked up ReRave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.
8932783	8933784	ReRave's not bad.
8934451	8934911	No, it's not.
8935131	8935951	I'm not saying it is.
8936351	8937932	But DJ Max is better.
8938952	8942552	Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.
8943273	8944473	Yeah, I think it just stretches.
8944533	8947873	But it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad.
8947933	8950134	But it's just so freaking good.
8950894	8954134	Like, I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it.
8954554	8956595	And I can't quit playing that as well.
8957175	8959695	So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now, too.
8960435	8961696	I don't want to get yelled at again.
8962336	8963656	I am not buying this game.
8964861	8965341	Good job.
8965542	8966022	Don't buy it.
8966522	8967223	Don't give in to him.
8967263	8967823	He's a jerk.
8968164	8978692	It's free unless you want the song packs and you can get a pretty good deal like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out and then you get some extra note skin.
8978832	8981694	What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?
8982094	8982494	I don't know.
8982554	8983335	It sounds stupid.
8983375	8984256	Get DJ Maxx.
8986224	8988025	The little anime chick, she commands me.
8988045	8989205	The anime chick wants a dollar.
8989285	8990426	Don't buy it, Rob.
8990466	8994228	Don't give in to the... I don't see DJ... I seriously... Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps.
8995028	8999750	I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?
9000190	9000611	Yeah.
9001131	9002311	I don't listen to her.
9002632	9004412	How many years has it been?
9004893	9005273	Rob?
9006874	9007514	Okay, I got it.
9007554	9008854	DJ Max Ray, right?
9009255	9009475	Yeah.
9009655	9012036	Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?
9013459	9015082	Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?
9015102	9017105	Yes, and I agree three times.
9018788	9020752	I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.
9021468	9023129	Make sure to create an account too.
9023169	9024150	It takes like two seconds.
9024170	9032736	You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise.
9033097	9036539	And that really sucks if you do that with the purchasing thing.
9036739	9037400	I don't understand.
9037440	9041643	I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says the terms and conditions have changed.
9041683	9042264	I haven't heard that.
9042284	9043645	The conditions have changed!
9048608	9050590	I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.
9052366	9054587	There's some kind of dumb over there right now.
9055988	9056388	Shut up, Rob.
9056408	9057949	Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.
9059690	9062331	You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.
9062351	9066673	By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.
9067353	9068214	Oh yeah, the Jane Shepard.
9068334	9071255	Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.
9072476	9073556	I was actually a little surprised too.
9073576	9079379	I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.
9081747	9083968	I can't find the title that I'm looking for.
9085469	9085509	Oh.
9109719	9112682	And I have to agree to these change conditions.
9112702	9115005	And I can't shut down my iPad.
9115085	9119169	Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.
9120691	9121111	Shut up.
9122172	9122873	No one asked you.
9125095	9126497	I'm actually trying it on my phone.
9126577	9131222	Raydeer in our chatroom says, it's Tapsonic, but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.
9131533	9132794	That's exactly right.
9132934	9141018	And it's got, well, I mean, it's all real DJ Max music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.
9141118	9142919	Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?
9143640	9146842	No, it's freaking DJ Max.
9147302	9150744	Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.
9153265	9154046	So I think it's that app.
9154066	9156247	Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.
9157548	9157928	It's fine.
9158288	9159929	All right, what else did you want to talk about tonight?
9162247	9166050	I was mostly going to talk about DJ Max and then some stupidity happened.
9167411	9168371	Tell us about DJ Max.
9168391	9170733	Was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Max that you didn't get out there?
9171451	9195501	Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts and then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability and then there are, I want to say, five more packs
9196141	9197221	A lot of songs that you can get.
9197301	9202463	So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.
9202503	9203744	So it's really, really good.
9204244	9205384	Everybody should get it that can.
9207385	9210926	Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.
9212067	9213067	All right, sounds good.
9213687	9215288	And I'm still pet battling.
9215488	9216688	And Pokemon is this week.
9216908	9219469	And I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.
9219789	9222270	Well, you're just going to be like the happiest person ever.
9222310	9223330	It's like Christmas for you.
9223410	9224771	I know this week is great.
9226479	9227620	Well, congratulations.
9227800	9228040	Thank you.
9228060	9230883	Not all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.
9230903	9232124	I wish I was having a good week.
9232244	9232585	All right.
9232985	9234646	Well, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.
9235187	9235487	All right.
9235527	9235888	Go end it.
9235908	9236168	Bye.
9237887	9240688	Alright, let me... Oh, I gotta go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.
9241009	9242329	Thanks to all those that called in tonight.
9242369	9244330	If you didn't get through, tough.
9244770	9245831	Try again next week.
9245971	9248712	Or send us an email with your thoughts.
9248732	9252654	1-877-GAME-OLR OrangeRite wanted to point out in the chatroom about DJ Max.
9252774	9255376	It's key-sounded and that is pretty important as well.
9255436	9258357	It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music.
9258777	9261859	Like some other apps that are out there, it actually does have the key sounds in it.
9262559	9265481	That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.
9266261	9269102	It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.
9271163	9275945	TigerClaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight, and he sent us some tweets about this one.
9276006	9281008	First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.
9281508	9287391	I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out?
9287531	9287871	I don't know.
9288453	9290474	There are quite a few, two this year.
9291014	9293034	I think two, was there two last year?
9294135	9294955	I guess there's been a few.
9294975	9298496	I remember Lego Harry Potter 2 last year, and Lego Star Wars last year.
9298516	9300296	Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.
9300336	9302097	Yeah, Lego Lord of the Rings is this year.
9302137	9305538	Actually, three if you include that Lego City stories.
9305858	9310780	Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.
9310820	9311860	And they've already had Lego Batman 2.
9313280	9313621	Let's see.
9313701	9317903	Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.
9318583	9325767	Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute, strategic, and competitive point of view.
9326207	9329069	And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.
9329449	9330449	There's always something new.
9330489	9331630	There's always something different.
9331670	9339294	We're always looking to add different layers, whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which we'll have the luxury of having over the next few years.
9339654	9367959	so it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance of fruits and vegetables alright let me see I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here and it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games and the quote he pulled there is you run the company like you're in danger of starving I guess this has to do with the high stress nature of running a game company
9369039	9370840	Um, let's see.
9370960	9377484	This was a quote in, uh, Edge Online in the magazine E246.
9378724	9386348	Um, quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.
9386689	9391071	I mean, you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.
9392451	9395413	When Platinum Games started in 2006, it had 50 staff.
9395793	9398854	Six years, it had 200 if you counted the contractors.
9402316	9405637	The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer, Capcom.
9405917	9412180	The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.
9412640	9416281	But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.
9416621	9419602	Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4.
9420242	9421703	Just an enormous amount of people.
9422243	9423223	Didn't help them, did it?
9424704	9425364	Oh, snap.
9426224	9433046	Again, that comment from an article on edgeonline.com sent to us via Twitter by Tigerclaw.
9433506	9435887	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9438318	9442463	Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?
9444967	9446629	No, I didn't see anything that stood out.
9447677	9448918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9470399	9471180	But not next week.
9471280	9473441	Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over OLR.
9473461	9474742	Yes, I choose the gay.
9474842	9475903	And I'm not going this year.
9476063	9476683	It's kind of sad.
9476963	9478504	I choose a lot of gay.
9478725	9479425	Send me pictures.
9480206	9480926	The Sea of Red.
9482207	9483188	Have fun.
9483208	9483928	Your final thought tonight.
9483968	9485249	I'm actually going to wear my OLR shirt.
9485769	9486250	Oh, wait.
9486290	9487190	That's right.
9487210	9488731	You didn't get the VOG one this time.
9489031	9494475	I have my red and black OLR shirt that Kristen and I had done way back when.
9494995	9497837	Because I have hit my first goal.
9498498	9500199	I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.
9500379	9500799	Congrats.
9501099	9501399	Thank you.
9501559	9501860	Good news.
9502400	9504600	So my message is actually very important.
9505201	9506241	Spay and neuter your cats.
9507902	9508642	Thank you, Bob Barker.
9510642	9513163	Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?
9513183	9515384	I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.
9515424	9516264	You poor soul.
9516304	9516904	It's a great show.
9516924	9518045	I did back in the 80s.
9518605	9519385	You said it back in the 80s.
9519405	9520946	Well, I didn't remember because I didn't care.
9522346	9525827	But seriously, rescue a cat.
9525987	9527448	Everyone go out and rescue a cat.
9529085	9530146	Unless you're allergic to cats.
9530466	9531327	Then take some Benadryl.
9531427	9532088	Rescue dog.
9532689	9534250	All right, Loki, your final thought.
9534470	9536172	I've never rescued enough cats.
9536753	9537974	Had 11 at one time.
9539420	9539920	It's a lot of cats.
9539940	9541361	Then I didn't feed them and they went away.
9541801	9542642	At least I think they did.
9542882	9544102	I think they're waiting in the shadows.
9545323	9546824	Waiting to hunt me down.
9547644	9555088	My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.
9555408	9555648	Yes.
9555709	9557229	I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.
9557249	9558570	We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.
9558790	9559771	It's really good.
9559831	9561031	I just had Pinkberry last night.
9561071	9561391	I don't care.
9561431	9561952	Let's go get some.
9562592	9563572	Alright, that's it.
9563872	9565873	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
