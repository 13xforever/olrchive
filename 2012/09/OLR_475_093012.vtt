Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Tonight, September 30th, 2012. EA cancels a major sports title. DLC is detailed for New Super Mario Bros. 2.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And can you soon get monetary rewards based on your achievement points?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with episode number 475 of our program for this September the 30th of 2012.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and all that good stuff.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi. How you doing, Jamie?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm caffeinated, thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You had two cups of coffee.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes. I've made a new rule, by the way. The only one allowed to talk about sports ball is Bobby.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
What's your thing against sports ball? Some people like sports ball.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Boring!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
We have a sports ball story coming up tonight, hater.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Boring!

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I like rugby. And I like real football.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
There was a comment that actdeft made this week. I don't remember if it was on Twitter or if it was on a VOG network post.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
But he said, yes I am a hater and I am hating.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And that's you right now.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I agree with that. I agree with that.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm DarkSakura and I endorse this comment.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Hi.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Doing good.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Awesome. What's new with you?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Um, Minecraft.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Did you enjoy your Sunday off last week?

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, and I played no Minecraft. I played Borderlands 2.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Okay.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Which is sadly the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Well, yeah, that's the only time I got to play Borderlands 2 this week.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
My wife's been occupying TV so I've been occupying Minecraft.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Well, not a problem. It looks like the server's growing a little bit there.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah. There's actually people on now. I see people when I go on there.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Nice, nice. And I hear they've been defacing my house.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
My little, or my shack.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
We haven't been defacing it. We've been, um, applying temporary tenants.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Interesting. Would you fill my house with creepers?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
No. That would be destructive.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
Alright. Well, I'll check that out as soon as I can get back on there, but I'll talk about my gaming week in just a minute.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
So, um, yeah. What else do I want to say? Oh, this poster came, right?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
This was from that guy who called in last week, right?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I think it was. Can I see it? Can I open this?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, go ahead.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
No, Rob, you're physically incapable.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Tell us what it is while I open it because it's bad radio for me to just sit here opening a box.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
It's a picture of Zero from Borderlands 2 and it's signed by all the developers.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
It's stuck in there. Hold on.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Open the other side.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
That's still awesome. I have a particular bone to pick about Borderlands, though.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
It's called, I call it Disco Panda.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
And that was Dan doing that five round kill whoever person with the disco music that Bobby played in his show.

03:22.000 --> 03:31.000
And all I heard was that music for two days while playing Mr. Pandaria. So it was Disco Pandas.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
That poster's rad, by the way.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Can you get a picture of that for OrangeLaunchRadio.com?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I guess.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
What little thing we have left at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I can do that in a minute when we get into gaming weeks.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So just give me a little bit of time.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Let's see. Before we get into gaming weeks, I wanted to start off tonight with a kickoff topic as we usually do.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
A lot of traffic at VOG Network this week for one of the articles that was up on there that went viral.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
And it wasn't really intentional for that to happen.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But apparently a lot of media companies, for whatever reason, aren't really covering this.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Because it has to do with the indie community.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
And I don't know when everybody decided to just fucking abandon the indie community.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
But this is a little bit irritating because it has to do with Microsoft and XNA Games.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Now remember when XNA Games first came out?

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
I think a lot of us were very excited about the potential that people could make anything they wanted for XNA.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And there's been some good and there's been some not good.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
In the good column, we've had some pretty top-notch A-plus Minecraft clones.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Obviously we're a little partial to YYR in some of his efforts, like Bungie ferret tossing and so forth.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
I know there were some games that came from some of the hosts on the network we used to be on.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Like You Will Die was a great indie game and so forth.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I made a game with zombies in it.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, the zombie game was pretty good.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
The Breath of Death and all that started on XNA, right?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah, Breath of Death and that stuff was on there, that was pretty good.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
There's actually been a lot of really good games on there, but unfortunately there's a lot of games to sift through.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Right, and then there's the bad.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
The controller vibrate game, the fireplace thing.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Okay, so all these things fill niches.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
It's the fart app that you'll find on the iPhone, I mean it's that whole thing.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
And then you get the really weird stuff, like the launch a baby from your vag game.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's funny.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
It's hilarious for like three seconds, but it's a little bit strange.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
What is it, Techno Kitten Adventure?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, oh yeah, Techno Kitten Adventure started there.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
That was that interview and everything, which I think he sold it to somebody, but anyway.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
My point is, there's been some good, there's been some not so good, but overall we've seen some things born from there.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
So why did Microsoft just suddenly stop paying attention to it?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Here's the deal, here's what's going on.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
There's an article all about it at vognetwork.com, very well done from Bobby.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
He found this issue going on in the community that needed to have some light shed on it.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
So we spent some time shedding a little light on it for people, and it actually got posted to Reddit, not by us, and got some hits that way.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Microsoft no longer allowing indie developers to generate codes.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
They used to be able to generate 50 review codes, and it's broken.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
No press release saying they took it away, maybe I'm not phrasing that correctly,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
because to say that they stopped letting you do it says that that was maybe intentional.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I don't think it was intentional, it's just a bug.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
I can't believe it's a super major bug that can't be fixed with a day's worth of work if they would allocate somebody to it.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
But that hasn't happened, and it's been going on a couple weeks now.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
YYR, who did Bungee Ferret Tossing, the OLR game, can't get review codes generated for it.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
And that sucks, because that's one way that your game gets out there on the internet, is the reviews on websites.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
And people would see it go, Bungee Ferret Tossing, what's this?

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
And then they check it out, and that's how YYR can make sales on his game.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
But now, a lot of that is stifled, because Microsoft has this bug on the site.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
It's not just affecting him.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
These big indie games, or indie developers, I should say, or whatever, got together and did this indie uprising thing,

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
which is the indie answer to Microsoft Summer of Arcade and Winter Jamboree, or whatever the hell they call those things,

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
which they've never once officially endorsed indie games since the very, very beginning.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Remember when Microsoft said, oh yeah, we're gonna promote XNA games?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, I think that ever happened once, twice?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Actually, there have been a few that were going to be indie games, and then didn't.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
Like, Dust and Elysian Tail, or whatever, that was gonna be an indie game.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
And there was also a few that have been in these contests that they do.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
I don't remember what it's called, but they've been promoted from there, too.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
Bobby Blackwolf, who's in our chat room, who wrote the article, is at live.vognetwork.com, where you guys should be.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
He says, not just for review, but for giveaways. Ever wonder why VoG hasn't given away any copies of Bungie Ferretossing?

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Perfect example. We can't give it to you for free. Although, seriously, guys, it's one fucking dollar.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
And it is a really fun game, so, just, you know, you probably have the points left over in your wallet.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
But, yeah, and SSJ100Matt says you would think they want to get this fixed.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
They're promoting games that they profit off of, and that's the weird thing.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
It's not that Microsoft stopped getting money from this, but, I don't know, maybe they feel it's not enough money?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Maybe they feel not enough people are paying attention to indie games or selling it?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, then, do something about it. Microsoft has the power to shed a light on indie games.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh, is there too much crap indie games that's bogging down the system so people don't want to go find the stellar indie games?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Fix it!

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
This has me a little worried for the next Xbox console. I wonder if this is something that's just going to magically disappear.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
It'd be a little sad if that was the case. Or maybe it's-

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't think it's going to disappear because they have their whole Windows 8 app store, and, of course, they don't want people developing apps for it.

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
And probably XNA is going to tie into that somehow, so, you know, wouldn't they want to keep people around to develop for a closed platform when people can go indie?

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
You know, indie can just go to an open platform and possibly get their game on Steam and, oh, a lot more sales there!

09:08.000 --> 09:26.000
It's just a bummer that it had such potential to be so awesome to let people kind of control what was going on on the television and show what's going on in their mind and their game development side and it's just kind of gone.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
So, um, Brakeman in our chat says there are some damn good Xbox Live indie games. There are. It's-

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
What went wrong with this? Why is this not doing better? Loki, any thoughts?

09:39.000 --> 09:49.000
Because they haven't done anything with it. They haven't really- they haven't promoted it. They hid it away in a corner and they made it a pain in the ass to sort through.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
So, it's like whatever they could possibly do to not help things out, they did.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
Sj100Matt in our chat says all the indie guys should go to Ouya and Steam and just screw Microsoft.

10:01.000 --> 10:14.000
Well, but like YYR, he's been doing Bungie Ferretossing for two years, you know, and two years ago, XNA looked, you know, a lot better than maybe it does now, so it kind of sucks for those that have already invested so much time.

10:14.000 --> 10:29.000
I've always thought, though, and I could be wrong, I am not a developer, I've not made games, I always thought it was supposed to be pretty easy to port your stuff from XNA on Xbox to PC. Isn't that supposed to be a pretty easy process?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I think so.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So, I don't know, maybe-

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, because you're developing it on a PC, I would imagine that, yeah, it's probably pretty easy to, you know, port it over.

10:38.000 --> 10:57.000
I know that you can edit save files for Xbox games on a PC, like for example, and I hate to bring Mass Effect back into it, you can actually use the gib tools that you hack your PC save files on the Xbox save files and move them over on your hard drive.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That's cool.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
So, the programming there is pretty much the same.

11:01.000 --> 11:19.000
I used to love editing files, like I remember Civilization 1 on the PC, like a bunch of the scripting ran off text files, so as long as- like there were certain criteria that had to be met, but as long as you were kind of within the boundaries, you could like get the Queen of England to like, when she's meeting you and negotiating with you, go, look at you, you little fucker.

11:19.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm gonna declare war on your ass. You could like, change things and do a 12-year-old, that shit's hilarious. Hell, to a 34-year-old, that shit's still hilarious.

11:32.000 --> 11:50.000
Anyhow, going to more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, because of course, I don't think I said this earlier, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
There's articles there too, there'd be more if I wasn't falling behind with stuff I have going on in my real life, but there will be more very soon.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Meanwhile, Bobby's doing a great job holding down the fort.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Let's see, WhatUpG says, by that I mean the big budget games, the ones that seem to get more press, etc.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Microsoft is more about the AAA games, is the comment that preceded that.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
So, maybe Microsoft just wants to focus on the arcade games, I don't know.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Not that a lot of those end up being very good all the time, but whatever.

12:22.000 --> 12:32.000
Anyhow, let's talk about our gaming weeks, and the video games that we have been playing this week, and whether they be indie, or AAA, or whatever the case may be.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
We'll start with Dark Soccer, I bet you all can predict her week, I bet you all can think about it. What is it?

12:38.000 --> 12:53.000
I played Mass Effect 3, and played Pandas, I've made Rob over 10,000 gold, selling gems, in less than a week.

12:53.000 --> 13:05.000
So yeah, it's been a profitable expansion, it's been slow, slow, slow, and I've actually had a bunch of stuff going on, so I haven't been able to sit in Uber level.

13:05.000 --> 13:23.000
Which is fine, I mean, I do have other things going on. But yeah, it was a lot of Pandas. It was Pandemonium. Yeah, that's it.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
How do you feel about the new expansion? I know this isn't Horde House, but it is a major PC game release.

13:31.000 --> 13:41.000
Slow. I really like the areas, and I really like the music when it's not, oh my god, Disco Pandas going on over it. Because, like I said earlier, Dan's been playing Borderlands 2.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
Which makes me want to throw up. It's pretty, it looks like fun, I would be so sick.

13:48.000 --> 13:57.000
I find it interesting that there's a lot of things about the expansion that are going back to a Burning Crusade style approach, and I think a lot of that is to purposefully draw out the endgame a little bit.

13:57.000 --> 14:09.000
Which is fair, because people blow through it too quickly. But I don't know if you know this yet, did you know that there is no more Justice Point vendor that sits in Orgrimmar or the Panda City, and just hands out Justice stuff.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
You have to get revered with a faction, then you can buy the Justice rewards for that faction.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
That's stupid!

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
So it's going to take a little time, but this, well, I can see why they did that, because they said there's not enough to do at 90.

14:26.000 --> 14:40.000
So it's, hey, we're going to have to throw out all these daily quests, give people a path to do. There's a lot of good about it, but I think a lot of us who have been spoiled over the few years by the quick grind are going to really get in check.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm feeling really behind because I'm not level 90, I've had too much going on in my personal life, I can't sit there and just grind to 90.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I'm just 88.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I know, I know, I know.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And Shane's already got a 90.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, most of my guild, raiding guild, already has 90s.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Some of us have lives.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't like to say it that way, because I know Shane has a life and what have you.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
But we have other stuff going on that isn't OMG Pandas.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Some of us have Mass Effect to play.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Which is a perfectly acceptable excuse.

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
Some of us have also decided that we want a part corgi, part pit bull dog. I want a corgi bull.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You're silly. Alright, let's move on. I'll talk about-

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
And some of us have really fat cats that like to poop right when we get in a dungeon.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
I'll talk about panda people a little more when it gets to my gaming week, but Loki, go ahead.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
So I played Borderlands 2 last week. Well, kind of on Sunday since we weren't doing a show.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
So I've been playing that and leveling up my assassin.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
And the game's pretty fun. I'm digging it.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
I wish I could play it a little bit more. I want to play it a bit more this week, take a little break from Minecraft.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Since I played like 20 hours of Minecraft at least this week.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And of course we switched the server over to creative, so it's been fun.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Everybody's been kind of coming in and building big things.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
I haven't really finished my castle, but I'm taking a break from it. I think it's pretty much done.

16:08.000 --> 16:17.000
I've got all the grounds done. I have a little stable area with cows and pigs and chickens.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
I built an underground blacksmithing thing.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Farmer Loki had a farm. E-I-E-I-O.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
I'm just trying to think of things to put on the ground so that I'd have something there.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
It's a big open space. So I have that all pretty much done.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I just have to fill the rooms with stuff. I haven't done that yet.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
I've been taking a break from it to do other things. Explore and build other things.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
So yeah, I think that's pretty much it this week. That's all I played. Those two things.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
Alright, my gaming week. I've been pretty busy and I was out of town for a few days.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
When I wasn't playing video game rides at Disneyland, which is my last trip for a year,

17:02.000 --> 17:10.000
that's at least the goal is to do Disney detox for a year and we'll see how successful it is.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
If you want to take bets on how many days before I crack, that would be a really great thing to take bets on.

17:15.000 --> 17:24.000
But anyway, as far as video games that I have been playing, I've been playing Mr. Pandaria obviously when I have had time.

17:24.000 --> 17:33.000
I love the music. I love the scenery. I love that because they didn't have to go back and redesign an old world,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
all of those resources got put into this new world and it's just vast. There's so much to do.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
I'm at the point where it's like I'm almost sick of questing because there's so many quests.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
In fact, that might be the one thing I would say is starting to grate on me a little bit,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
is I don't like that they made it not possible really. I mean, you can.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
But they made it really hard now to level through dungeoning, which is how I really used to do it.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But they really nerfed the dungeon XP and all that so you can't really level through dungeoning anymore,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
which really kind of irritated me because that's how I like to do it.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
But I guess to match the style of the fact that you have to get reputation with all these factions

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
to get the end game rewards, you have to do a little bit of questing, so whatever.

18:15.000 --> 18:23.000
But anyway, I will elaborate more on my thoughts on this week's Hoard House, www.hoardhouse.com.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
Another game that I checked out this week though for a little bit, I only played this in between the time

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
that this game came out and Mr. Pandaria came out, which was about three days when I wasn't doing other stuff.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
And that is Torchlight 2. Torchlight 2 is released and it is available on Steam.

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
And if you don't know what Torchlight is, if you've never played Torchlight 1, it is available on Xbox and Steam

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
and probably other places too that I'm not thinking of. I just own it on both places.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
It's basically Diablo. It's a lot of the same people that made Diablo 1 and 2 made this game.

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
It's kind of like a reimagining of that whole thing, although obviously it's a little more DungeonCrawler

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
and a little less Satan. It's not Diablo.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
Torchlight 2 is out and it has kind of a different feel right off the bat because you're not dipping right into a dungeon.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
Like you do in Diablo or like you did in the first Torchlight. A lot of it is taking place in the outworld

19:20.000 --> 19:27.000
or the outside, outdoors, very grassy areas. It's not to say that there aren't dungeons at all,

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
but I noticed right off the bat that a lot of the scenery is very varied.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I love some of the class design in Torchlight 2 is great as well.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Like I play this dual-wielding gun chick and she's a lot of fun.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
I've had a real joy playing it and dare I say, I kind of had more fun with it and I've been more interested in that than Diablo 3.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
So I don't know really what that says, but yeah, Torchlight 2, big fan. Thumbs up.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
And I like that there's the multiplayer that you can do very easily through the internet

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
and you can also be in the same room and do internet that way. There's the LAN is in there.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
None of this fuckery with Battle.net going up and down the day of the launch.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
That is a great word. Fuckery.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Diablo 3's launch is a perfect way to use that word too. That was total fuckery.

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
And this had very little fuckery. Granted, I think Torchlight's registration servers were down on launch day,

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
but it didn't really ruin the experience. It was a good time.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
ActDeft says, internet multiplayer? Wow. Well, the first game didn't have it.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
So there you go. Let's see, and Ray Deer in our chat room says,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
I'm sort of saving up for Torchlight 2 right now. Well, the good news is it's only 20 bucks.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
So yeah, Torchlight 2 is great, especially if you're a fan of Diablo or those dungeon crawler games.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
So if you are listening live here at vognetwork.com, apparently the stream is having some issues.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
It's going up and down a little bit. So I'll make sure everybody's got their porn torrents turned off

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
so that way we don't hiccup. But otherwise, I'm not sure there's a lot we can do about that.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Unfortunately, we will try our best to maintain the connection.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
I closed Dropbox, right? Sometimes big files come in through there. Yeah, that's closed.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
So IDK, I'll figure out what's going on. Meanwhile, that's really it for my gaming week.

21:20.000 --> 21:28.000
Torchlight 2 and Pandaria. And Disney games. Do you think I'll be able to make it the full year, Dark Soccer?

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
Because in chat, Brakeman says, my last trip for a year to Disneyland, in my country we have a word for you.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Liar. And don't even try to go to Disney World as some sort of loophole.

21:40.000 --> 21:52.000
You know what, Rob? I have faith in you. And if you don't, if you do end up going, I will sob bitter, bitter tears.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I'll be sobbing my bitter tears for you next week while I'm there.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Okay.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Oh boohoo, I'm at Blue Bayou and Rob's not here.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
No, stop. Alright. Let's move on and we're going to get into some housekeeping.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
And of course we're available on Google Plus as well for Orange Lounge Radio.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
We'll get to the FUGL question of the week a little later. But before we get to that, some news!

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Loki's starting us off with the gaming news this week.

22:27.000 --> 22:37.000
Alright. So, this is a little shocking. Not entirely shocking, I guess, but NBA Live 13 was cancelled by EA.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
And this was an announcement, I believe it was on Friday? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, on the 27th.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Seriously, kind of out of nowhere. I mean, it was being delayed for a while.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
You may remember they tried relaunching the whole franchise with NBA Elite 11 back in 2010.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
And that got pulled right before it shipped the stores. Actually, some of them did ship the stores.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
And I think a few leaked out and it was really glitchy and just terrible.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
And they were going to kind of, they took a break last year and then this year they were going to try launching it again with NBA Live 13.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
And once again, they just cancelled it before you even got a chance to get sent out.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
And this was literally kind of out of nowhere on EA Sports' website.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Their executive vice president, Andrew Wilson, just wrote,

23:30.000 --> 23:40.000
Hey, it's cancelled and here's why. Rather than launch midway through the season, we're going to sit out another full year and make sure next year's game is really great.

23:41.000 --> 23:50.000
So, I don't know. It's interesting, but I think at this point, you know, if it was that terrible where they can't even launch the game.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
And from what I hear, some of the people that were testing it were saying,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
Hey, you probably shouldn't launch this game because it's not very good.

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
Maybe if it was that terrible, I mean, this far into the development cycle, then,

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
God, I don't know if next year's going to be any different. I mean, we may run into the exact same situation again with NBA Live 14.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And at that point, I mean, NBA 2K is going to be so far ahead.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I don't even know if they'll be able to catch up with their market share.

24:18.000 --> 24:26.000
I mean, how loyal must your fans be where your game doesn't come out for three years and then finally new NBA game.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
You know, obviously they're probably playing other things.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
I did like it, though, because I'm sure all people that play these games are very mature.

24:36.000 --> 24:44.000
One of the first comments I read on the Asports.com site was like,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
I'm going to kill your family. I'm going to kill all the employees.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
I'll burn down the building because you won't give me my NBA Live.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Call the Popo on that. Why do people feel like they could just say whatever they want because they're hiding behind a monitor?

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm about to go down a much bigger path on this stuff, but I sometimes hate the anonymity that Facebook get hurt.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
Well, there's Facebook, too, but I hate the anonymity that the Internet gives us sometimes.

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
Like, really? You're going to kill somebody's family over a missing basketball game? Really? Really? Really?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Geez.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Why don't we just set them all on fire?

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
How are you being any better by saying that?

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
Calm down, woman.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Hey, I said it very calmly.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Anyhow.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
I don't know. I know some of my friends that actually play the basketball games quite a bit.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
They're just like, meh. Not surprised.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And honestly, I'm not surprised either.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
I thought that was going to be the case since they haven't really started their media campaign yet and the game was scheduled for October.

25:48.000 --> 25:55.000
I kind of thought that you would have a little something. So, yeah. Not a big shocker.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Well, what do you think might be the long-term ramifications of this?

26:00.000 --> 26:09.000
There's a part of me that's like, alright, well, one could commend EA for this decision because if the game was going to suck

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
or was just going to be a really lame upgrade to the previous game, then good on them for making the right decision.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
Because there's a story later about maybe a not-so-great decision for a game that came out that was really just a copy of the year before.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I found that comment finally. It was funny.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
You've got to be fucking kidding me. We stuck our neck out for you.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
We've been fans of you guys for years getting fucked every fucking day with 2K fans.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I swear, if there's no game that...

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Of course, I'm reading this verbatim.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.000
There's no game that released this year. I'm killing every employee in EA slash NBA Live building, dude.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm so heartbroken, literally. I'm so fucking tired of playing 2K.

26:52.000 --> 27:00.000
I can't believe we're stuck playing with only one game after you guys have three to four fucking years to fix the game the right way.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
If we can't at least get something online, I'm with EA for... I don't know.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
I need to send the police to his house to scare that little boy because you know that some 13-year-old kid writes that comment.

27:13.000 --> 27:21.000
Of course. But I just think it's funny that people think that you don't have to play a new NBA game.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
It's not like, oh shit. It's not like choosing a president or something like that. A choice needs to be made.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
It's just, you know, you can play that same NBA game that you have.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, well, I understand that the rosters aren't up to date and stuff, but tough.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Why don't you go play NBA Baller Beats?

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
It's supposed to be fun. Actually, I will admit, I really do want to check that game out at some point.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm just kind of put off by the price, but I want to check it out at some point.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
So...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
We actually got a copy of that.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Did you? Why did you get a copy of it?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Why not?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Because my boss had one in his office.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Baller Beats!

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And I laughed at it. I'm like, I'm not fucking playing that.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
I'll play it.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
No, it's... No. No, we're not.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
Alright. Alright, I guess... Oh, I want to ask about the 2K game. Doesn't this open the door wide open for 2K?

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Didn't 2K get somebody really famous to produce this year's game?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Jay-Z.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Well, I was just talking...

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I'm looking forward to that.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Well, hold on. I was talking with Alan about this earlier today.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
About what a smart guy Jay-Z must actually be.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Because one of the people that Jay-Z produces is Rihanna.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
And, you know, say what you will about her music and so forth, but...

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
I mean, that woman is a well-oiled pop machine.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
She's putting out so many albums. She puts out an album a year.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
And all these music videos, wins all these Grammys, has all these catchy songs written for her.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
You know, whether it might be your cup of tea or not, you can't ignore that she writes some really...

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Or, she doesn't write, probably, but she has some really good pop music that she puts out.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And, yet again, she's got like another new album coming out this year. It's crazy.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Like, Jay-Z is working her and she's an extraordinarily famous woman.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Just like a pimp.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Hey, if Jay-Z...

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Work your best hoe.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
If... Shut up.

29:11.000 --> 29:19.000
If Jay-Z can make 2K basketball, like, if he can do for video games what he's done for pop music,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I actually think it could be a really good thing.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
He's not doing shit. All he's doing is picking up the soundtrack.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
Ooh. Fucking awesome.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
I mean, whatever. You know, that's cool.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
I mean, people that are going to be buying the game probably don't care,

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
because it's the only basketball game that they can pick up this year.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I mean, that's it.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
I mean, even last year, they're like, well, we don't have an NBA game, but we're going to do NBA Jam.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, that seemed exciting until it came out, and then it was like, ehhh. Not so exciting.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
Why does the chat room think I said pot music? I said pop music.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Pot music would be like...

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Fog Hat.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
It would be like the Grateful Dead and Dave Matthews Band. That's pot music.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Fog Hat.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And maybe a little bit Journey, too.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
I mean, I do love Journey, but I went to their concert once, and damn, I think I got a contact high.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Anyway, back to games.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Or maybe lack of games if Motorola gets their way, because you know, Motorola, although it is really Google,

30:24.000 --> 30:31.000
they got an injunction against Microsoft in Germany that would prevent the sale or import of Xbox 360s,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
among some other Microsoft devices.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
This is all over the H.264 video encoding technology.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
It's actually owned by Motorola. It's licensed for use in MS devices.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Now, here's the interesting thing.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
It's been ruled in the US that Motorola cannot enforce the injunction.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
Well, now why would the US talk about an injunction in Germany anyway?

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
Well, it's because Microsoft had previously sued Motorola over a breach of contract case in the US.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
So now this allows the court to consider if the whole thing is subject to the US law.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And the court's ruling says, quote,

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
At bottom, this case is a private dispute under Washington state contract law between two US corporations.

31:14.000 --> 31:20.000
So if you were worried that what happened in Germany was going to have effect over here, you're okay.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
So, like, if your 360 is going to red ring one day after you're out of that three-year warranty, you're okay.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
You can still get one.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Phew.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Well, technically, they wouldn't be selling it. They would just be shipping a replacement.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
No, I said one day after the warranty when you're screwed and they won't ship a replacement anymore.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Because, you know, that's what happens to people now.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
It used to be that they'd red ring after a week and that's just part of like growing up.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Well, they don't red ring anymore because they've taken that functionality out of...

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Did you say that was just part of growing up?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Yes.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Because every Xbox...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
You take the good, you take the bad.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
Yes, you take the good, you take the bad and you take them both and there you have a 360.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
360?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Stop.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
You know, and that's actually in my head because I just watched the robot chicken thing where they did...

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Never mind.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
No, no, okay.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
One chick's on Survivor.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Which one, Tootie?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Blair, on Survivor.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
They are really, really stretching for celebrities.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
You and your reality shows, Rob.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I know, what can I say, I'm a whore for trash reality shows.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
You have a problem.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
We have a commercial for the next Xbox.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You take the good, you take the bad.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
You take them both and there you have...

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The 720.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The 720.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
There's a time you gotta go and show your...

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
There's a time you get to play...

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh yeah, Tootie was in that video for Boyz II Men.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
What?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Tootie was in that video with Boyz II Men.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
What was her name?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I just remembered she was Tootie.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
I'm probably gonna horribly mispronounce this name, but it's Entitlitis.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Inflammation of the entitlement.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Entitlitis says, my first kiss, my first blowjob, my first red ring.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You never forget.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Did the red ring come after the blowjob?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
That would be a whole other problem.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
That means you need to go see a doctor.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Yes, Kim Fields, that was her. Thank you, Rama.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I knew Rama would remember.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Alright. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
So there was a big, horkin' interview about the PlayStation 3

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
and why there is a newer version out and what they think about 3D.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
And they even admit the whole 3D TV thing is dying

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
because no one wants to wear the stupid glasses in their house.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
So they're also looking that more and more people are going the visual route.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Not visual, the casual... casual visual.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It rhymes. Don't give me that look.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
More people are going the casual route, so they're trying to do, you know,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
with games, things that are a little bit more reflective of that.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
And that's also contributing to the whole lack of the big 3D thing.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
As far as how well the Vita's doing,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
they say they're not gonna reduce the price this year.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That is probably gonna be sometime next year,

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
so it's not a matter of if it's when.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But definitely not this year.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
And this... so really it's just more of what we knew.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
I think it's just... I don't know if it's the fact that people don't want to wear glasses.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
They don't want to buy $100 pairs of glasses for their fuckin' TV

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
and then they have to buy multiple pairs of those $100 glasses to, you know,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
have their friends see it.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I saw a tweet from another podcasting friend on Twitter

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
and it said something that those 3D TVs were on sale at Best Buy this week

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
for like $199 or something.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Really?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I know, I was like...

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Cool, were they teeny?

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
We, sir, I think at one point we were sitting on a bunch of their 3D displays.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I guess that didn't do too well, did it?

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah, who's gonna buy a $500 TV from Sony when it comes down in price? Sure.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Which it may have. I should check that out.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
They were also saying that with the ones that are coming out in the UK,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
there's a 500 gigabyte version that's out now

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
and then a 12 gigabyte version that's gonna be out on October 12th,

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
but that they're actually not setting the price of their own hardware in the UK.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
It's the shops that are setting the price.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
I don't really get that since it's their system, but...

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Well, they gotta charge them a cost, so, I mean,

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
obviously the price is gonna be as low as they can get while making a profit.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
And they're also trying not to be worried about the Wii U.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
So, I'm not worried about the Wii U.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Well, of course, they're not gonna ever say openly,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
why, yes, we're shitting our pants over the Wii U, actually.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
They have nothing to worry about with the Wii U.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I know, no one has anything to worry about with the Wii U.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
The Wii U doesn't have Ridge Racer!

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
You know, I am kind of shocked that it doesn't have Ridge Racer.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
What, Namco, you couldn't, I don't know,

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
re-release Ridge Racer 6 again as Ridge Racer 8 or something?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Same damn tracks.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Oh, does that not fit into your plan of, you know,

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
releasing one track with, you know, half a car and you have to buy the rest later?

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
So, just throwing this out there, it's still on sale on Best Buy site,

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
$179.99 for the TV, MotorStorm Apocalypse, and glasses, and a little cable.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Eh, give it more time.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
You think it could get even lower.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Black Friday's right around the corner.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Don't remind me, I'm going to hear about that for weeks from Dan.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Since I'm not working retail.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Yay.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Alright, let's move on, Loki.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
Alright, well, while I contemplate getting a 3D TV, no actually I'm not.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
They were kind of cool though, I've got to plan those a few times.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
So, they have this new Xbox Live reward thing,

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
where they're allowing people with high gamer scores

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
to get some sort of points back on their live purchases.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
And it's a whopping, I know you're going to get excited here,

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
it's a whopping 1% if your gamer score is over 10,000 points,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
and 2% if it's over 25,000 points.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
That's right, 2%.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Woo!

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm getting excited already.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
And of course, also, apparently if you have a gamer score of over 3,000,

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
you get a special gift during your birthday month,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
which in the fine print says is only worth 25 cents.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Here's a quarter, call somebody who cares.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
What about, it's probably going to be some stinkin' avatar item like a birthday cake.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
It's stupid, I mean seriously, 1% back?

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Okay, so you buy $100 worth of fuckin' Microsoft Point stuff

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you get a dollar.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
That is fucking stupid.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
The 25 cent gift is a free download of Rihanna's birthday cake for your Microsoft Zoom.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
It's a fuckin' birthday hat.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
I guarantee you it's a birthday hat.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
That is it, for your avatar.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
So that everyone can go, hey look, he has a birthday hat on.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Cool.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I want them to send me a quarter.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I want them to mail it to me.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
If it has like a value, you want to be able to redeem it in or whatever.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
So how is it that they can assign a value to that,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
because there's no items on the marketplace that are a quarter?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Well, I always thought it was akin to like,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
have you ever really read the fine print on a coupon?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, one one-hundredth of a cent.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
One one-hundredth of a cent or one tenth of a cent is the actual cash value.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Like, maybe that's the actual cash value of a, you know,

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
40 point item in the marketplace or something.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
It would be 25 cents.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That's just stupid.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.000
Cool, thank you for, you know, the money back, I guess.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
But at the same time, I'd rather have free games.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I don't know who this Entitelitis is,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
but I like the comments from this individual tonight.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
So I have 7,000 points.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
What do I get, a coupon from Arby's?

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
No, no, the idea is to like, get you to be loyal,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
not to like, scare you off.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Like, you know, a lifetime supply of horsey sauce.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Who's gonna spend a hundred dollars on DLC in a month?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
I mean, that would basically be buying every single Xbox Live Arcade game

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
that comes out in a whole bunch of DLC.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
I mean, those people are gonna have to be really sipping the, you know,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Microsoft Kool-Aid pretty vigorously.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
That's like 30 premium boxes in Mass Effect.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
Cause, you know, that's the new thing now, is free to play mechanisms.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Congratulations to all the FIFA hackers, you get some money back.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It's not so bad. Hey!

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
I got all this money stolen from me,

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
but hey, at least I got 40 Microsoft points back. Sweet!

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
It's not so bad anymore.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
And a birthday hat! Yeah!

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Maybe the hat's a fuckin' sign that says,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Sucker, you spent all this money.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
You're an idiot.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
Oh, boy. Alright, let's move on, talk about something in the PlayStation camp.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
The PlayStation 3, you might be worried that soon your PlayStation 3

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
is gonna be a PlayStation brick, and it won't really be useful for anything anymore,

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
cause of course the PlayStation 4 is likely happening next year.

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
But don't worry, Sony will be supporting the PlayStation 3 through 2015 at least.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
All things considered, that actually isn't a very long time.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Nope.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
Well, when did it first, when did the system first come out, 2006?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
This is about a nine year window.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So I guess that's not terrible.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
That's not your fuckin' ten year life cycle that you promised me, I want my money back.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Uh-oh.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Dark Sucker, did you have a problem?

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Your soap spat on my shirt. It left white foam on my shirt.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
It likes you a lot.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
I guess so.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
Alright, anyhow, PlayStation 3, good for until 2015.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
That will actually be the release date of The Last Guardian, apparently, is 2015.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
2016.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
That's what's targeted.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
Obviously, there are all new PlayStation 3s that are out, so they want to, you know, re-emphasize,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
you're not just buying something that's gonna suck in a couple years.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
So, there you go.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
We're gonna continue supporting the PlayStation 3 for the next few years, absolutely,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
and we're going to continue supporting it not only that long,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
but as long as there is a development spigot that's running hot.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Same thing with PlayStation 2.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
It's kinda stuck around as that old warrior many years after its launch.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
But there's still games launching for it.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
That was a comment from John Kohler to GameSpot.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
So, your PlayStation 3 will still be good through 2015.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
I hope so. We've already had it for years and years.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
What about the PlayStation 2, DarkSakura?

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
Well, there's actually some stuff going on for the PlayStation 2.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
Did you realize that there's still a game coming out?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
One whole game?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
One whole game.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
One game?

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
One whole game. One game that's going to be out in Japan.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Ooh, there will be one more game.

42:49.000 --> 42:57.000
And it says that it's Final Fantasy XI.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
I'm trying to pronounce this right because my screen is kind of screwing up.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Adullino Macchio?

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah, the English version is something like Something of Anderlin

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
or something is the English title.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
Well, I mean, it's actually that my screen has a kind of a thing over the name

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
so I can't actually read it properly.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Scroll.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Well, no, it's not working.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Macchio.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Adullino Macchio.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
So, yeah, it's an expansion for Final Fantasy XI.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
It's the one that has geomancers and sword mages and all that stuff.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
Final Fantasy XI, it's alright.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
I know.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I can see why people are still playing it.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
But we have pandas.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
But it's funny that it's the one thing that keeps the PlayStation 2 going

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
because you can't really play it on the PlayStation 3.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I am so surprised it hasn't gotten free to play yet.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Me too.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
If it went free to play, I'd play it again.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Who wouldn't?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I know a few people who wouldn't.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
You know what? I told you what made me quit that game, right?

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
Being a white mage.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
Get in the damn circle so I can cast the damn buff, dammit.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
That's why it was better playing with Japanese players.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Fuck this, I'm teleporting Holla.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Yeah.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
So I was just like, I'm done.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
After all these years, you still can make jokes like that.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
That game had quite an impression.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
This is like, oh, you made a bad pull.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Eh, fuck you guys.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
No heal and I'm out.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
I also, though, did like watching the people run around in the leather underwear.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
That was pretty funny.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Yeah, Sublegar. Always a good time.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
They had Sublegar in XIV too,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
which was probably the only interesting thing about Final Fantasy XIV.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Leather underwear.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
SSJ-100 Matt in our chat room says,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Jamie, heal please. Protect please.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Bite my ass please.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Ah, good times.

44:50.000 --> 44:57.000
At least it's not as annoying as it was in International Ragnarok Online.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Port, port please.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
Port, and they follow you around going port, port, port, port.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Port, port please.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
Hey, pretty impressive though, because the PlayStation 2 came out in, what, 2001?

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
And so its life cycle's been, what, 12 years if there's still a game coming out in 2013.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Although, let's be real.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
It's like, there's been one game this year and one game next year.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It's on life support at this moment.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
But hey, you know, there's still a great library of games for the PlayStation 2 that's worth checking out.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
You probably still never played Final Fantasy XII.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And I'm never gonna.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Hey, it's not that bad.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You know, I have it. And I should sit down and play it.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
You should. It's a good time.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
But I also have pandas.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Balthier and Fran.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Pandas.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
You would write fanfic about Balthier and Fran.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Pandas.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Fran's a bunny.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
So?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Alright, let's move on.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Let's travel around the world and check out release dates for other systems.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Alright, this week actually there's a few things coming out.

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
I know that there's Resident Evil 6.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Some people might be looking forward to that.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
That's coming out this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

46:15.000 --> 46:23.000
Also NBA 2K13 coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Wii.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
Vita? No. No Vita.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
But PSP for some goddamn reason.

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
Go2K for supporting PSP still.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Because no one else is.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And PC.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
And then of course also from Nintendo we have a few games that probably no one will care about.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Crosswords Plus for the 3DS.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
And Art Academy You Can Draw Everything.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I think that's what it's called.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Including a penis.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
It said everything.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
I think it's lessons for everyone.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
But yes, it's You Can Draw Everything.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
That's basically how I'm calling it.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Including a penis.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Including a penis.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
And that is going to be on the 3DS as well.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
Carry Command Gaia Mission on Xbox 360.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
And what else do we have here?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Let's see here.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Oh, Command & Conquer The Ultimate Collection on PC.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
17 Command & Conquer games in there.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Holy fuck.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
That's a lot of Command & Conquer.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
That's too much Command & Conquer.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
Or is it over 17 years where the Command & Conquer.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I can't read the cover there.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Nope, 17 games.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Holy shit, that's pretty awesome.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
50 bucks and you get all of the Command & Conquer games.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
All the Red Alert games.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Generals.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Wow.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
That's pretty sweet.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Ron Munnar says 17 Command & Conquer games.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Shut up and take my money.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
You'll never get through it all.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
I bought the entire XCOM collection out of similar logic on Steam.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I think I played one game for two seconds.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I did that with the Doom pack.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
XCOM is fucking great though.

48:05.000 --> 48:12.000
Also just to mention that they also have the Dynasty Edition of Resident Evil.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
No, NBA 2K13 and also in case you really do love a lot of Resident Evil.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
They have the archives and anthologies.

48:19.000 --> 48:24.000
Which are basically all the games that are available on Xbox 360 or PS3.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
Including the digital stuff like Resident Evil 1, 3, 4.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It's like all these random ones in there.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
MXC1 to clarify in our chat room.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
17 games but they're all digital.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Even if you buy the VOX you just get codes.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
That's stupid.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I hate it when they do that now.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
Thank you Origin! Thank you!

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Thank you for sucking.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Fucking awesome.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
That comment and more in our chat room.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Live.vognetwork.com

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Oh and of course I should mention a week from today.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
There's...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Pokemon Black 2 and White 2.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Someone might be interested in that.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
No one I know likes that game.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Okay I have to digress for a moment.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Have you done any pet battles?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Yeah they're pretty fun actually.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I went and did that for like an hour.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
But they will not let you according to our guildie Gwen.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
They will not let you name your Phoenix hatchling Fox.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Well you know what's funny?

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
I have been naming all of my little pets after Mass Effect characters.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Shut up.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Because my priest is Dr. Chacwas right?

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
And so my kitty is Jack.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
And I tried to name my little mechanical.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
Like if you have a mechanical creature what are you going to name it?

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Legion.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I was going to try and name it Legion.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
It wouldn't let me name it Legion.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Because it's biblical.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Oh my god.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
So I named it Geth Legion.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Still.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
For the record Rob.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
I did actually prove you wrong from something on Hoard House.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
What?

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
I got Jane Shepherd.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
On Proudmoore.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Oh.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Good for you.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Just saying.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Have a cookie.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Alright.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Going back to Jamie.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
I like when the chat room taunts Jamie.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Well they do.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
This is some Jamie taunting to get you to play Final Fantasy 12.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
SG100Matt says, just tell her Garrus is in it.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
No, Garrus isn't in it.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
ActDef says, tell her it has Panda Corgi Garrus.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Ew.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
That just is wrong.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
No.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Although did you see the ferret effect?

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Uh uh.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Oh yes I did.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
No yes I did.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
That was awesome.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
That was pretty rad.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
The listener of OLR.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
I guess we can't take all the credit for it.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
No it was in our Mass Effect secret community.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.160
Fifth dream about the World of Warcraft expansion in our chat room says Mists of Pandiaria is

50:38.160 --> 50:40.160
what my wife and I have been calling it.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.160
That's pretty good.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.160
I'm going to use that on Hoard House.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.000
I'm going to call it Mists of Pandemic.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.820
Mists of Pandiaria.

50:45.820 --> 50:49.000
By the way, do you know what name I got for my Tauren Monk?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.800
I'm really excited.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.800
You told me.

50:51.800 --> 50:52.800
Calvin.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.800
That's awesome.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.200
I told Dan and he just rolled his eyes.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.200
You know what I got?

50:56.200 --> 50:57.200
What?

50:57.200 --> 50:58.200
I have Sunny Gummy.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
Uh huh.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.200
I love that name.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.200
From Gummy Bears.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.200
And then I have Shampoo.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.200
Spelled X-I-A-N-P-U.

51:03.200 --> 51:09.760
Oh hey, let's travel to Japan and check out release dates over there.

51:09.760 --> 51:15.420
Coming up this Friday, October 4th, Biohazard 6, Resident Evil 6 of course, F1 2012 both

51:15.420 --> 51:16.660
on the Xbox 360.

51:16.660 --> 51:22.320
There is also a full Xbox 360 console, a 250 gig value pack, you know to try and like sell

51:22.320 --> 51:26.760
some Microsoft Xbox 360s I guess.

51:26.760 --> 51:31.000
I believe there are full consoles coming out too.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.840
There's this Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.120
Oh no.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.880
This is the one with the jacket, isn't it?

51:36.880 --> 51:40.240
Do you know how much this fucker cost to import?

51:40.240 --> 51:43.360
$1700 if you want to get this.

51:43.360 --> 51:47.260
This is the Resident Evil 6 Premium Edition that comes with a full leather jacket.

51:47.260 --> 51:48.320
Remember that?

51:48.320 --> 51:49.480
That's happening in Japan this week.

51:49.480 --> 51:50.800
But not a full metal jacket.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.800
No.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.440
I thought that was like with the console, but apparently not.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.440
They're just releasing the console for those that want to buy the jacket too.

51:57.440 --> 51:58.940
The jacket's pretty freaking rad.

51:58.940 --> 52:02.760
Look at this girl wearing the jacket over her little polka dot dress.

52:02.760 --> 52:03.760
It's cute.

52:03.760 --> 52:07.400
I'd rather have the Mass Effect one.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.240
Yes, we know.

52:09.240 --> 52:14.120
Alright, going to the Playstation 3, I imagine it's mostly the same shit.

52:14.120 --> 52:17.360
Yep, Resident Evil 6 or Biohazard 6 there as well.

52:17.360 --> 52:21.760
You can even get a decoration seal set to decorate your Playstation 3 with Biohazard

52:21.760 --> 52:22.760
symbols.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.480
So your Playstation 3 can be a chick blowing a giraffe.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.800
Wouldn't that be awesome?

52:26.800 --> 52:29.000
F1 2012.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.560
And you got right over there?

52:30.560 --> 52:32.080
No, they just made me laugh.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.000
Because I had mental imagery then.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.600
World Soccer winning 11, 2013.

52:37.600 --> 52:41.880
Well they just know everybody likes seeing pictures of chicks blowing giraffes and so

52:41.880 --> 52:44.800
because of that they're going to immediately think of Resident Evil 6.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.440
I know.

52:46.440 --> 52:47.440
Now you can't unsee that.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.060
Seriously, when you look at the Resident Evil 6 logo, it's all you'll ever see is a chick

52:50.060 --> 52:51.120
blowing a giraffe.

52:51.120 --> 52:54.080
You can't unsee that now that that's been said.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.520
So if you hadn't already read that on the internet, there you go, you're welcome.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.120
How about on the Nintendo 3DS?

52:59.120 --> 53:01.680
Coming out this week, nothing.

53:01.680 --> 53:06.160
But next week, the Nintendo 3DS LL, blue and black.

53:06.160 --> 53:11.240
I'm assuming that is the XL over there in Japan, the LL.

53:11.240 --> 53:12.240
There you go.

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
That's the Japanese release dates.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.800
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

53:14.800 --> 53:16.800
Oh, a few things.

53:16.800 --> 53:22.600
On the first, which it already is over there, Blade Guardian comes out on the iPad and iPhone.

53:22.600 --> 53:27.160
And then on the second, Resident Evil 6, oh my god, you are so correct.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.160
Right?

53:28.160 --> 53:32.200
Well, I've tried, I've kind of been ignoring it.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.920
Tried the R&C but you can't.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.800
Because did you hear about the meat market that they did in London, by the way?

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
What?

53:38.800 --> 53:39.800
For the release of that?

53:39.800 --> 53:44.040
They did like a fake human meat market for Resident Evil 6 in East London.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.080
It was all raccoon.

53:46.080 --> 53:47.080
Ew!

53:47.080 --> 53:48.080
No.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.600
Have you seen that episode of It's Always Sunny?

53:51.600 --> 53:52.600
No.

53:52.600 --> 53:57.040
Yes, that was the first episode I ever saw of that show and I thought it was so stupid

53:57.040 --> 53:58.400
I didn't watch it again for like two years.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.400
It's really gross.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.920
I almost put it in show roll, but it's really, really gross.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
I'll just link pictures.

54:03.920 --> 54:10.720
They had an arm that you could buy that was made out of prosciutto and pork.

54:10.720 --> 54:13.200
The best, ew, that's gross.

54:13.200 --> 54:14.200
The best episode ever.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.360
You can also buy fake penises.

54:16.360 --> 54:20.360
The best episode ever of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, besides Kittenman's, was the

54:20.360 --> 54:22.560
episode where they take the road trip to the Grand Canyon.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.160
That was my favorite.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.800
I haven't seen that one yet.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.160
Oh, it's fantastic.

54:28.160 --> 54:34.400
But all the proceeds from this were going to the Limbless Association, so basically

54:34.400 --> 54:35.400
for helping amputees.

54:35.400 --> 54:40.880
Well, I guess that's cool that it had a, you know, a good cause at the end of the day.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.800
So back to the releases.

54:43.800 --> 54:44.800
What were you gonna say?

54:44.800 --> 54:47.840
I was gonna say, actually I do think I did see the episode where they were all in the

54:47.840 --> 54:49.720
U-Haul trailer or something like that.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.600
Wasn't that the Grand Canyon one?

54:51.600 --> 54:52.600
Yes.

54:52.600 --> 54:53.600
Okay, okay.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.600
Oh yeah.

54:54.600 --> 54:55.600
That was hilarious.

54:55.600 --> 55:00.240
Alright, on the 3rd of October is Hell Yeah, Wrath of the Dead Rabbit.

55:00.240 --> 55:03.600
And the 4th is Anno2070 Deep Ocean.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.080
And the 5th NBA 2K13.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.640
So something every day this week.

55:09.400 --> 55:13.720
Alright, couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week

55:13.720 --> 55:17.640
where we'll reminisce about a classic game for the week.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.480
But first, Loki.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.000
And it's of the week, so.

55:22.000 --> 55:31.280
So Notch, the, you know, wonderful creator of Minecraft, was asked by Microsoft to, you

55:31.280 --> 55:37.800
know, perhaps urge him or nudge him in the direction of certifying his game to run in

55:37.840 --> 55:43.040
Windows 8, you know, so that it would be on their closed platform.

55:43.040 --> 55:49.800
And they even asked, hey, you can help certify, you know, Minecraft for Windows 8.

55:49.800 --> 55:55.120
And you know, he said that he preferred not to have Minecraft run on Windows 8 at all

55:55.120 --> 56:00.320
rather than to, you know, play along with what Microsoft wanted.

56:00.320 --> 56:05.560
And basically, you know, said, no, I hope we can keep a lot of open and free platforms

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
around.

56:06.560 --> 56:12.200
And if it was locked down Windows 8, it would be very, very bad for indie games and competition

56:12.200 --> 56:13.200
in general.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.520
If we can keep open platforms around, there's going to be a lot of very interesting games

56:16.520 --> 56:21.440
in 10 years mixed in with huge AAA games that we all love.

56:21.440 --> 56:26.400
I think it would have been, what they wanted it for is a good marketing thing so they can

56:26.400 --> 56:28.880
show, hey, these are all the games that run on Windows 8.

56:28.880 --> 56:31.560
They're certified for it in Minecraft.

56:31.560 --> 56:36.440
Everyone recognizes Minecraft, but, you know, he doesn't want to do that.

56:36.440 --> 56:37.440
Why would you?

56:37.440 --> 56:42.000
I mean, you have a, basically, if you put your game on the Windows 8 App Store, I'm

56:42.000 --> 56:46.840
assuming, they're going to try to take money from those purchases because, you know, it's

56:46.840 --> 56:52.080
their closed app store versus he sells the game off his website, he gets all the profits

56:52.080 --> 56:53.080
for it.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.080
So why?

56:54.080 --> 56:59.400
Yes, let me go ahead and give you some of that money for free for no apparent reason,

56:59.400 --> 57:00.400
you know.

57:00.400 --> 57:03.800
Of course, he's going to say no.

57:03.800 --> 57:07.640
This is a little different when you're putting your game on, you know, the Xbox 360 where

57:07.640 --> 57:13.400
no one that has an Xbox 360 can purchase the PC version of the game for their Xbox 360.

57:13.400 --> 57:15.920
You just can't do that.

57:15.920 --> 57:21.760
Rama in chat says, oh, for fuck's sake, Windows 8 is not locked down.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.680
I'd like to explore this a little bit as well.

57:23.680 --> 57:29.400
I mean, if I want to just write a silly little Windows program, I can do that.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.920
Like, Windows 8 isn't going to, like, stop me from doing that, right?

57:31.920 --> 57:33.200
I'm pretty sure you can.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.360
I think it's just mainly it's the marketplace, the marketplace.

57:36.360 --> 57:37.360
Yeah.

57:37.360 --> 57:40.760
That's where it's more locked down because it's trying to combat piracy and all that,

57:40.760 --> 57:41.760
right?

57:41.760 --> 57:42.760
Yeah.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.920
I'm just saying that's why they do it.

57:44.920 --> 57:49.740
Windows, the operating system that is pirate proof.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.320
No one pirates windows.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.320
Please.

57:52.320 --> 57:57.400
If I buy an operating system, someone should shoot me.

57:57.400 --> 57:59.760
I don't buy operating systems.

57:59.760 --> 58:04.320
I actually don't think I've paid for one in, like, 20 years.

58:04.320 --> 58:09.280
Definitely not paying for Windows 8 because I'm not putting Windows 8 on any of my PCs.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.280
Same here.

58:10.280 --> 58:13.880
Well, we have a comment about this coming up in the Frugal Question of the Week a little

58:13.880 --> 58:15.960
later when it comes to Windows 8.

58:15.960 --> 58:21.080
I'm still really torn on it, like, I'm kind of like, there's things about it I might like

58:21.080 --> 58:24.200
if I want to keep it simple, but I don't know.

58:24.200 --> 58:26.240
There's a lot of mystery around it.

58:26.240 --> 58:31.320
If there's anything that people, like, find about Windows 8 that they really must have,

58:31.320 --> 58:34.920
someone's gonna fuckin' develop a program that runs in Windows 7 that does the same

58:34.920 --> 58:37.560
damn shit.

58:37.560 --> 58:42.160
I mean, probably does it better, so... no.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.760
No thanks.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.880
Not into it.

58:47.880 --> 58:53.280
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

58:53.280 --> 58:55.400
use the passphrase, danger.

58:55.720 --> 59:01.800
Alright, well, if, you know, you don't want to use Windows 8, and for whatever reason

59:01.800 --> 59:05.440
you don't want to use Windows 7 either, or any Microsoft platform for that matter, maybe

59:05.440 --> 59:06.840
you're on Linux.

59:06.840 --> 59:11.460
And of course, Linux is gonna be getting a pretty big boost for games soon in the form

59:11.460 --> 59:13.400
of Steam.

59:13.400 --> 59:18.360
Steam Linux Beta is going to be admitting 1,000 users throughout the month of October.

59:18.360 --> 59:23.480
1,000 users will be testing the client, they also get one Valve game with that.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.680
It's probably gonna be Left 4 Dead 2, because that, of course, is the game that they already

59:26.680 --> 59:28.720
said would be on Linux.

59:28.720 --> 59:32.520
The beta will support... and please forgive me if I mispronounce this, because I'm not

59:32.520 --> 59:33.520
a Linux user...

59:33.520 --> 59:34.520
Ubuntu?

59:34.520 --> 59:35.520
Is that how you say it?

59:35.520 --> 59:36.520
Yep.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.640
Ubuntu 12.04 and above.

59:38.640 --> 59:41.920
It is meant for people that are experienced with Linux.

59:41.920 --> 59:45.960
So if you're like a Linux noob, maybe not so much.

59:45.960 --> 59:49.800
Wait for a subsequent release when more features are implemented along with improvements to

59:49.800 --> 59:51.280
the user install experience.

59:51.280 --> 59:55.440
Now you use Linux Mint on that little lappy top of yours, right?

59:55.440 --> 59:57.320
Any interest in using Steam on Linux Mint?

59:57.320 --> 01:00:06.640
Yeah, I think so, but I'm not an in-depth programmer or anything like that, so I might

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640
see if I can't get into it.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.880
And what was your logic for using Linux Mint again?

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:16.480
First of all, it was a third the size of Windows on my netbook.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:22.680
You can change your kernel on it, so if you want to have more graphics output or more

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.920
sound processing, you can basically choose how it's going to use the memory.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:33.240
On top of that, you have basic, immediate root access to anything in your system.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.340
On top of that, not many people do viruses for Linux.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:44.920
It's respected, it's versatile, and the other thing that I really like is with Mint, there's

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.920
a software updater so that you can basically just look for any software that you want for

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.360
anything, and it's been tested that it will work on your build of Linux.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.480
And what's specific about Mint?

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.160
It's just a really easy interface.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.860
Do you just like the name Mint because it's minty fresh?

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:04.620
It's got a really easy to use interface, especially for anyone new to Linux.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.680
It's a really good introductory into Linux.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.720
Minty fresh scattles.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720
You remember that?

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.840
A 10-year-old joke from understation live.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840
Look at that.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840
Look at that.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.280
Hey, you know, on my DeviantArt, I made a picture for mint scattles.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280
I'm going to find it now.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.440
Did you post it to your live journal 10 years ago?

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.760
I probably did.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.160
Actually, I think I made it before I had a live journal.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160
Or your Zonga.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160
I never had a Zonga.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.160
Never had a Zonga.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.560
Somebody brought up Zonga on the internet this week, and I was like, oh yeah.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.480
I'm going to go find the mint scattles.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480
Hold on.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.760
You know what I think started that conversation was the whole new MySpace.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.800
Have you seen the new MySpace?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800
They're trying.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800
You mean Pinterest?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.520
It's basically Pinterest.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.520
But like, no, here's the thing.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.940
Like when I log on to Pinterest, I'm like, I don't get it.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.440
But I was looking at the new MySpace, I'm like, oh, okay.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.320
So MySpace is Pinterest for dudes.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.860
That's what it is.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.860
Still won't use it.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:01.860
I kind of use Pinterest.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.860
Do you?

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.040
What do you pin on Pinterest?

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.400
Usually like recipes and supernatural and mass effect.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400
You're such a girl.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400
All right.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.400
You know what?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.640
I love the car.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.560
The car really makes me happy.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.320
All right.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.080
Going a step further here with Steam.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.640
Did I get the, oh yeah, sorry.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.240
There's one other thing I wanted to say about Steam, and that is this game McPixel.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.880
It is the first game to get greenlit by Project Greenlight.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.480
It is now, excuse me, Steam Greenlight.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.160
I believe Project Greenlight was a bad reality TV show many years ago.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.820
Steam Greenlight did produce McPixel.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.400
It is now available for $4.99.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:50.160
It's 100 scenarios where the player has 20 seconds to prevent stuff from blowing up by

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.020
using available tools.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.020
It's awesome.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.460
It's basically don't shit your pants, it looks like.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.460
It's really awesome.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.460
Is it?

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.460
It's ridiculous.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460
Yeah.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460
Did you play it?

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460
Yeah.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.460
I beat the whole game.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.460
I have it on my phone.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.460
Nice.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.460
Yeah.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460
I paid for it and it was ridiculous.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.640
It looks like a junior-senior music video, kind of.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:18.280
It's basically a cross between those point-and-click LucasArts games, MacGyver, and something really

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.280
retarded.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280
I don't know.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.400
It's just like, the guy, the guy's just, a lot of the puzzles are solved by kicking people

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.880
in the nuts.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.880
It's so noted.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.880
OMG, spoiler.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880
Spoiler.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.880
Well, if you, which puzzles though?

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.880
I mean, sometimes kicking people in the nuts just does nothing other than kick them in

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880
the nuts.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120
Oh, I'm going to kick somebody in the nuts.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120
Yeah, seriously.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120
See if it works.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:49.800
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane to a much simpler time, a time when kicking

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.760
people in the nuts wasn't always the way to beat the game, unless it was Double Dragon.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.160
It's the classic game of the week, a chance for Dark Soccer to take a trip down memory

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.880
lane, go in the vault and find one game that she thinks, hey, brats, play this and shut

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880
up.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880
Seriously.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.880
I'm going to post the Mint Scabbles picture in chat.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880
You found it that quick.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880
I did it ages.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.880
It was on my deviantart, duh.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.880
I did it a long time ago, though.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880
Along with your, uh, Garris Shep picks.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.880
You know what?

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880
I haven't done any Garris Shep picks.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.880
I'm actually getting, when did I do this?

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.880
Like, years ago.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
Anyway.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
Here we go.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
Classic of the week.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
What'd you pick, Dark Soccer?

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.880
I picked Donkey Kong Country.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880
Good pick.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.880
So we have to actually play the beginning music because it's the best.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.880
How many of us cheered when we heard that?

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Yay.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.880
Fuckin' love this game.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.880
Oh, Rare.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.880
Oh, Rare.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.880
So, um, I also have to say it's funny because, yeah, I do actually use Wikipedia for some

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880
of my references.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.880
And I'm like, DKC redirects here.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.880
For the genetic disease, see, dyskeratosis congenita.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.880
It just made me laugh for some reason.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880
I was like, what is that?

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.880
Sounds like something to its skin.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.880
Anyway, um, Donkey Kong Country was made by Rare.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.880
It came out on the SNES on November 21st, 1994.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:38.880
It was the first Donkey Kong game that was not produced or directed by Miyamoto.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880
It was done by Tim Stapler.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.880
By some dude.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Um, this game was really cool.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.880
There was so much going on with this one.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.880
It's a big platformer at 40 side-scrolling levels.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.880
The Game Boy Color version had 41.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.880
And you basically have to rescue your bananas that's been stolen by krumlings.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.880
So you can jump on the tops of trees, you can swing from vines,

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.880
you can ride rhinos and bust holes in walls.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.880
You can do all kinds of stuff.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.880
And you can spell out K-O-N-G.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:12.880
And get extra life balloons.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.880
You can do all kinds of stuff.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880
I love the rhino.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.880
And I like that you can ride a barrel and just not shit over while you're riding the barrel.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.880
So you can play as Donkey Kong or his nephew Diddy.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.880
And you can switch between them.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.880
Diddy is more agile but not as powerful.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.880
And you have, like I said, you've got Rambi the rhino,

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.880
Espresso the ostrich,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880
Enguarde the swordfish,

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880
Winky the frog,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880
and Squawks the parrot.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.880
I want to know who thought of those names because those are some dumb names.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.880
You have two player mode.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.880
So you can do contest or team.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.880
So contest, you basically take turns beating the level as fast as possible.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.880
And team, you play together.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.880
You work together. One of you is Donkey, one of you is Diddy.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.880
And you can track your progress during the map.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.880
You basically can meet other members of the Kong family.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:10.880
And you can go to other parts of the map by chatting with Funky Kong.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:14.880
I want to know where he got that name.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.880
Now Bobby Black Wolf and Chad is threatening to throw a fit if I do not play the underwater music.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.880
So here you go, some underwater music.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.880
Oh, I love this music.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
Here you go.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:48.880
So, anyway, it was really, it was all done in 3D as far as actually how the characters themselves were designed.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.880
So it was meant to have a 3D appearance to it.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.880
And it also borrowed the red necktie that was used in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.880
And that's pretty much become the standard now.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:10.880
So basically, until 2002, Nintendo credited Rare with that design of Donkey Kong.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.880
So, I mean, it was really just a fantastic game.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.880
It was lots of fun. There were different ways to play through each level.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:24.880
You had secret rooms that you could get. You had all kinds of different things that were going on.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.880
You had all the balloons you could...

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.880
Oh, stop calling me whoever you are.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.880
I'm actually just going to hang up on them.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.880
I'm hanging up on you.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.880
Who was it?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.880
I don't know. 800 number.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:44.880
But yeah, we've got people who love, like Bobby was saying, the underwater music is absolutely gorgeous.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880
It had really fun music.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.880
In fact, when I was going through looking for the music, Dan was like popping along with it and forgetting Borderlands.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.880
So that was pretty funny.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:02.880
So yeah, it's really, I mean, there was a Game Boy Color version that came out that had a new level that was...

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:10.880
It was in Chimp Caverns called Necky Nutmare, which was a really freaking weird name.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.880
And Candy Kong doesn't run the save points anymore.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:22.880
So it also came back out on the Virtual Console for the Wii on December 7th, 2006, and in Europe on December 8th.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.880
And North America on the 19th of February, 2007.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.880
There were sequels. There were other ones.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:32.880
There was Donkey Kong Country 2, Diddy Kong's Quest.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.880
There was three, Dixie Kong's Double Trouble, Donkey Kong 64, and Donkey Kong Country Returns.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.880
So, that was it.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.880
This is some dude playing it on his piano I just see in the related videos.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.880
Nice.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880
Not bad.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.880
So that's it.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.880
There you go.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.880
Classic game of the week.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.880
Donkey Kong Country.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.880
That happens when you try to say all those words too fast.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.880
Oh, good times.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.880
Okay, so I have to go back to Pandas real quick.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.880
Please.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.880
I found an NPC called Chef Yan or something.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.880
Or Cookmaster Yan.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.880
So I've been going back and watching episodes of Walk with Yan.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.880
And Yan can cook.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.880
But it was Walk with Yan that made me laugh because the guy had this apron that had all of the funny sayings on it.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.880
So I've actually been...

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.880
Actually, WoW has gotten me cooking.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.880
Got me cooking.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.880
There you go.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.880
Alright.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.880
I think it's time for a break.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.880
But don't go anywhere, guys.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.880
When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.880
We're getting through tonight's show kind of fast, which is weird.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.880
The recent shows have been very long.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
But hey, it happens sometimes.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:11:00.880
But we do have plenty more to come in Part B, including rapid fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and emails and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.880
You know what? The number didn't work a couple weeks ago.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.880
That's why we were short on some calls the last time we were truly live on a Sunday night.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880
That's all fixed tonight.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880
So I'm sure people will be getting in.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.880
Of course, you can always use the old-fashioned Skype line.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.880
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.880
We'll be doing that in a little while when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live at vognetwork.com with the 475th episode of our show for this September the 30th of 2012.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.880
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here to start us off with the second half of our show.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.880
If you are listening live to us, we are live every Sunday night, of course, at vognetwork.com.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.880
Be sure to join us in chat. Live.vognetwork.com.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.880
And Loki's going to start off the rapid fire news.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:01.880
Alright, so let's see. Let's talk a little bit about a game we've been kind of talking fondly about.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:08.880
And I didn't say that you played it, so I'm not sure how good it is.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.880
But Tokyo Jungle just came out on the PlayStation Network last week, I believe.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:22.880
And, of course, one thing that people might be waiting for is remote play, so you can actually take Tokyo Jungle on the go.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.880
And that is coming. They're going to be patching it into the game so that you can play it on the Vita.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.880
That's pretty awesome.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.880
I haven't had a chance to play Tokyo Jungle yet, and I'm really upset because it's one of those games I really wanted to check out.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.880
But I've been hearing it's not bad.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880
I want to play it.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880
Yeah, me too.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.880
They have a picture of an elephant with roller skates on, so I mean...

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.880
How could that be bad?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.880
How could that possibly be bad?

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880
Yeah.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.880
And, of course, there's a new indie bundle that you can check out. It's the Indie Royale.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:13:01.880
They're doing their Oktoberfest bundle, and it features a bunch of different things in there, including Zoe Mode's Chime,

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.880
all three episodes of Hector, Badge of Carnage by Telltale Games,

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:14.880
the Smudged Cat Games' Adventures of Shuggy, and also Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.880
Yep.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.880
That sounds like a winner.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:25.880
And I guess if you spend more than $8 on the bundle, you'll also get two Chiptune albums by the Save States, Calm Your Nerves and Chip Undeath.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.880
So, it's pretty sweet.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:36.880
And I guess you can pay the minimum price, which I guess is $5.21.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.880
Humble Bundle 6 is still going, right?

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.880
Yeah, they've got some cool stuff with that, too. I think they added some more games to that.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.880
They did. You can get Bit.Trip Runner now.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.880
Wizorb. Oh my god, I already bought all these games.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:59.880
I have Wizorb already because I got it in the Kickstarter for their new one that they've got.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.880
Oh, well, I can't be too upset. I mean, I paid money for really good games.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.880
Just means I'll have to give away a copy of Wizorb at some point.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.880
No, because if you cash them in on Steam, then you don't get to use...

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.880
Well, I understand that, but I still have two Steam codes for it.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.880
Oh, nice. Okay. Yeah, you should give one away. It's a good deal.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.880
Good deal. One day left, by the way.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.880
And last but not least, a game I'm very excited about.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.880
Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan this week.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.880
And not to be outdone by that, D3 of America decided,

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.880
Hey, guess what? Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable is coming to the US.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880
Fuck yeah!

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.880
John, Loki was very happy.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.880
So that should be coming, hopefully, winter 2013, I believe, which will probably be the first three months of next year.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.880
Oh, that's a... Oh, okay. I was like, winter 2013?

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.880
Yeah, yeah. Remember, it's considered fall.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.880
Oh, that's not too bad of a wait.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880
No, no, not at all.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880
That's good.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:07.880
And that'll just bide me some time until they even show more trailers for Earth Defense Force 4.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.880
A reason for you to own a CD.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.880
And apparently the people that played it at the Tokyo Game Show say it's actually pretty good.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:19.880
Like, they actually added physics this time around, and, you know, the details a little bit better, and...

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880
Wait, they're trying to legitimize?

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:25.880
No, seriously, I don't care. It doesn't matter. It's sandbox making the game. It's gonna be awesome.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.880
I have no doubt it's gonna be awesome.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.880
But hey, a Vita game I can actually look forward to.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.880
That's something that doesn't happen very often.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.880
I still need to get LittleBigPlanet Vita.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880
Yeah, me too.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.880
Alright, moving on. With some rapid-fire news over here.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.880
I think we talked about this briefly on the show before, but it is coming out.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.880
It's dated Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.880
The Giana Sisters is a series that dates all the way back to the Commodore 64,

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.880
when the game was pulled off the shelf for being too similar to Mario Brothers.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.880
Like, really, really similar. They kind of had a point.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.880
But since then, it always had a bit of a cult following, because the music was very different,

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.880
and the music was very, very good.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.880
And now, the series has had a cult following ever since then.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.880
They had the DS game not that long ago.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.880
Well, now there was a Kickstarter, and the success of that, Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams,

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.880
will come out on PC October 23rd.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.880
I don't know if this trailer has any of the music in it.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.880
Yes.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.880
They show it a little bit in the trailer about the shifting between different worlds.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.880
And the music changes when you switch, too.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.880
Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.880
So, they're saying it's like a platformer Igaruga, almost.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.880
Okay. That's kind of a neat concept, and certainly, you know, very different than the Mario and all that.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880
They have a demo out there you can check out for free.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.880
I actually backed it, so I'm getting a full copy of the game when it comes out.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.880
Nice. Xbox Live and PlayStation Network versions are planned for early 2013,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.880
which this looks like it'll be a pretty kick-ass little platformer there, so...

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Yeah.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.880
Very cool.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.880
Congrats to the team there for getting that out.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.880
The final title was voted upon by the community.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.880
Twisted Dreams got 76% of the vote, so the community named this game.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.880
Yeah, I totally missed that.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.880
Broken Sword Kickstarter.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.880
It did not hit beneath a Steel Sky 2 goal, but a sequel is going to happen anyway.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.880
Here's what happened.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:31.880
Revolution Software, they asked for $400,000 to kickstart the fifth installment of Broken Sword,

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.880
called Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.880
The Kickstarter closed with $771,000, so that's good.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.880
They way out did that.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.880
Now, there were stretch goals after getting the initial amount.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:50.880
The $1 million goal would have greenlit a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.880
However, they're going to go ahead and do it regardless of the stretch goal,

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
because, quote,

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.880
We are delighted by the recent level of interest in a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky,

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.880
and are currently discussing ideas for this project,

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.880
which we plan to go into development following the release of Broken Sword the Serpent's Curse.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.880
So, there you go.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.880
The original game dates all the way back to 1994.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.880
Well, that's pretty cool.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.880
If you're a fan of OC Remix, and this is another Kickstarter project,

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.880
Final Fantasy VI, its overclocked remixed Final Fantasy VI album,

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.880
there was a Kickstarter for it, it was shut down,

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.880
and it was shut down after it had already gone past the target goal.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.880
It was pulled because of copyright infringement claims.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.880
But apparently, all those issues have been worked out.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.880
The fundraiser is back.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.880
Final Fantasy VI Balance and Ruin is a five-disc Final Fantasy VI celebration,

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.880
but the fifth disc is Final Fantasy VII Voices of the Lifestream in full.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.880
It's going to be released in December for free, as these albums usually are.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.880
The Kickstarter is just a way to do physical copies to do for prizes, or at events, or what have you.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:06.880
It's apparently trying to raise $30,000, but with 29 days left to go, they are looking pretty good.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880
So, there you go.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.880
You have to donate at least $50 if you want the actual physical collection.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.880
Let's hope, for act-def's sake, there's another Chocobo wrap on it.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.880
That would be phenomenal.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.880
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880
Chocobop.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.880
There's a whole little, I love this song he wrote about...

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.880
Or, I love this song? Question mark.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880
This song's okay.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.880
Alright, Final Fantasy Star Online 2 is free-to-play on the Vita.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.880
Yay!

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.880
It needs to be free-to-play on PC!

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880
Well, free-to-play on the Vita...

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880
That's in Japan.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880
Hopefully that's here, too.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Yeah, but it was on the Phantasy Star Fan Blog that Vita players will be able to play with PC players.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.880
There's going to be certain lobbies open to both.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.880
And then, Arcade Heroes.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:06.880
Had a thing about the Family Fun Arcade closing January 2013.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.880
Why must arcades close?

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.880
They don't make money.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880
Oh, shut up. That's no excuse.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.880
I think this particular one, that wasn't the case, though.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:21.880
The guy had been running it for 30-plus years, and I think they said he's having health and personal problems.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.880
So I actually don't think, in this case, it was a money thing.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.880
Yeah.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.880
But it was a landmark arcade. I mean, it was a big deal.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880
Yeah, one of the big ones.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.880
But, it was a big home for fighting games, too.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.880
Because, I mean, there are just a bajillion of them at this particular arcade.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.880
And then, Prison Architect.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:52.880
Basically, they had a paid alpha version, and they made more than $100,000 in 72 hours.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.880
The first 72 hours of the alpha going on sale.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:02.880
Maybe we should eat our words about Kickstarter and start one, because apparently everybody's making money on there.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.880
Just kidding.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880
Maybe you are.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.880
Ha ha ha ha.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.880
Okay. That's up.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.880
Alright, let's go to the Fugu question of the week.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.880
Every week we ask a question in our Facebook and Google fan communities.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.880
And we answer them. Read the answers for you here.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Right on the show.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880
This week it's all about Windows 8.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.880
The creator of Minecraft had some strong things to say about Windows 8 this week.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.880
With the release of Windows 8 only about a month away, how do you feel about Windows 8?

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
Is it something you're picking up?

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.880
Do you think it will help or hurt PC gaming?

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:44.880
Now, I didn't want to keep it only about Windows, because I knew if I did that, somebody would say,

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.880
Fuck Windows. I'm on Linux. Fuck Windows. I'm on Mac.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.880
So there was kind of a two-part question.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880
Well Mac, you don't have a choice. You just have to upgrade when they come out with a new one.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.880
Otherwise your computer will stop working.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.880
Since we are sure there are some Mac OS and Linux users out there too,

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.880
what is it about your operating system that makes you prefer to use that?

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.880
Do you ever feel there's a lack of games on your OS of choice?

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880
So let's go to Google Plus first.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.880
I haven't heard from this guy in a long time, Evan E.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.880
I used to know him when he lived out here.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880
He answered the question saying,

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.880
I use Linux for many reasons, but games are not one of them.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.880
I'd say, however, that there's been a radical change in the last year for the Linux gaming scene.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.880
I don't know if it's even visible to people on other OSes,

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.880
but it seems like a ton of games are being put out routinely for Linux now.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.880
I think the indie scene becoming better funded plus Kickstarter helped,

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.880
but the pending arrival of Steam is the real sign that things are changing for those of us using Linux.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.880
And, of course, all Android devices run Linux, but that's a different world of gaming.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.880
Now if only the RTS scene would get out of the niche rut it's been in for a decade, I'd be happy.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.880
I do want to add something, actually, Rob.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.880
You know that a lot of 3D design is done in Linux.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.880
Like all of DreamWorks, they use their own proprietary software in Red Hat.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.880
That's cool.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.880
Flaco Jones responded on Google Plus saying,

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880
I own PCs and Macs and use both at work.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.880
I have a little experience with Windows 7 on some of our work PCs

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880
and I can't stand it.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880
Maybe I was just too used to XP, which I do like.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880
I love all the Mac OSes I've used.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880
There isn't a lot of variation between them.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.880
They are always stable, fast, and I know how to find everything.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.880
Plus the shortcuts for opening, closing, and switching between multiple folders are awesome.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880
I do wish there were more games for Mac,

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880
because whenever I do play on a Mac it feels a lot smoother than the PC version,

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880
even though my PC has slightly better specs.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.880
ActDeft replied on Google Plus saying,

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.880
The Win 8 Metro UI, look at all these people on Google Plus this week,

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.880
is possibly one of the worst things ever made for a PC.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.880
That interface is made for a tablet and it would totally work for that really well,

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.880
but not for a keyboard and mouse.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880
Also considering a lot of games already have really strict DRM in them,

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.880
Win 8 adding that call home thing for apps is going to be a torture

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880
if your internet connection goes down or something.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.880
I'm currently using Win XP.

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.880
I may upgrade to Win 7 if possible, but definitely not to Win 8.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880
Facebook.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.880
I love this nickname.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.880
I Am Super Lazy replied and said,

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.880
It's really a wait and see when it comes to Windows 8.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880
My thought is that it works best as a media center PC,

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.880
but as a traditional PC it might fail when it comes to the traditional office.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880
There might be better options.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880
Code Man said, I'm a graphic designer so I use Macs,

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.880
but I've seen Windows 8 and I'm really just plain unhappy with it.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.880
You might as well just use your Xbox 360 as a PC now because the interfaces are one and the same.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:28.880
What happened to the Windows XP days?

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.880
The good old days.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880
The only thing that sucks about the Mac OS is that there's pretty much no games on it

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.880
and if you use Steam you're really shit out of luck.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.880
You really shouldn't be talking bad about the Xbox 360 interface right now

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.880
because it's going to turn into that interface with the fall update.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880
Of course.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.880
I'm not looking forward to it.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880
VX Jason XV.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:53.880
Windows 8 is really only a problem for people who don't regularly use computers.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.880
Any gamer who would care about the things Gabe N and Notch have talked about

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.880
will eventually set it up and if they don't already,

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880
quickly learn how to turn off the don't call it Metro interface

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.880
on Windows 7 again.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.880
Windows 8 means nothing for the desktop and everything for the Surface.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.880
Any gamer that owns or runs a non-Windows platform

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880
has complained about the lack of games at one time or another.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880
Even boot campers moan when they have to switch OS just to play.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.880
I'm always disheartened when I only see the Windows icon on a title on Steam

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.880
and I'm always so delighted when they both are there.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880
No Mac exclusives as far as I know of.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880
That's surprising to me.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.880
I'll be awfully surprised if Steam does in fact appear on Linux in the next 365 days,

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880
even two years.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880
I don't expect it to happen.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.880
Hmm.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.880
Picaruno says I've not used Windows 8 yet but from what I've seen it looks messy.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.880
I'm not sure it'll go down well with the hardcore users or the casuals.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.880
I also won't be seeing it work anytime soon.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880
We only just migrated to Windows 7.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.880
Yeah, we're still on XP at my work.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.880
And we just upgraded from like NT like three years ago.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.880
I'm a Mac user at home and have always preferred consoles to play on

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.880
even back when I had a PC.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.880
Macs have World of Warcraft.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.880
That's pretty much the only PC game I really care about.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880
I just dislike the amount of wrestling you give to Windows

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.880
to make it do the work you wish it would do on its own.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.880
Tigerclaw says personally I don't think you would notice any performance increase

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880
going from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.880
Windows 8 seems to be more about the aesthetics.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.880
Most of the complaints I've heard about Windows 8 are more about the UI

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880
and that they've gotten rid of the start button in favor of a Metro style UI

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.880
that's similar to the Xbox 360 dashboard and Windows Phone.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880
I hate though actually about the UI real quick.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.880
It's the mouse gestures that you have to do to get things to work.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:35.880
Really?

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.880
Yeah, because remember it's made for tablets

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.880
so you have to do mouse gestures to get shit to pop up and stuff.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.880
Fuck that.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.880
Game companies like Valve complained about how Windows 8 isn't good for PC gaming.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.880
Let's get to an interesting comment here from Technus.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880
With all due respect for the creator of Minecraft,

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880
I think he needs to get off his high horse.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880
Apparently from the way I understand the story

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880
is that he fears that with Windows 8

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.880
it will mark the beginning of the Windows platform being more closed.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.880
He states that he would not have his game run on Windows 8 at all

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880
than work with Microsoft which I think is a very bad decision.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880
It seems like he thinks that the Microsoft App Store

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880
is going to be the be-all end-all for applications

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.880
and that he is getting his game certified for it

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880
but is basically contributing to the so-called walled garden.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.880
It's funny because last time I checked

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.880
his game is freely downloadable off his website

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.880
and it's on Xbox Live Arcade, iOS, Android.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.880
But wait, isn't Xbox Live Arcade, iOS App Store, and Google Play closed app stores

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880
that you have to go through a certification process

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.880
to get your app on there in the first place?

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880
It's almost, to me, he sounds like a complete hypocrite.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.880
I mean, what in the hell is wrong with me being able to run the game

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.880
for the Microsoft App Store and having the icon appear

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880
on the Windows 8 start screen where I can just go

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880
and it's right there when I start the PC up?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880
Hell, last time I checked you are not being held up at gunpoint

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880
to buy Windows 8. Interesting point.

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.880
But I think the thing is though is for all those three platforms that you mentioned

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.880
there are no alternatives to being able to purchase that from his website.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.880
Like he cannot sell you a copy from his website.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880
Maybe you can for Android because I know you can do third party apps and stuff like that.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.880
But for everything else you cannot buy straight from his website.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.880
Isn't some of that contracted out too?

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.880
Because technically he didn't develop the Xbox Live version.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880
Yeah, that was 4J. 4J Studios did.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.880
But here's the thing, it's like why, once again,

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880
why would he give Microsoft a portion of his profits

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880
to have the game on their App Store?

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:28.880
Which, let's be honest, they had the whole Windows Live App Store thing

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.880
and did anyone give a shit about that? Nope.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.880
So why bother doing that when he can get all the profits

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.880
and have people get the game the same way that he's done right now?

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.880
And if you think about it too, let's look at it even deeper.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.880
Microsoft charges for updates on your games.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.880
And how often is Minecraft updated? About once a week.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.880
You know, granted those are beta updates and stuff like that,

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.880
and you don't have to download them, but it's updated fairly regularly.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.880
So why would he want to pay money to do that?

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.880
That's the same reason why his game's not on Steam,

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.880
because he just doesn't want to mess with that crap.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880
Fair question. Okay.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.880
Just a few more answers here from Zether.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.880
It says Windows 8 is like Vista.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.880
Every other release of Windows has been bad for the past few years.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.880
I'd rather wait for Windows 9. So they're like Star Trek movies.

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.880
Seriously, it is. Every other release seems to be kind of terrible.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.880
That's a bummer, because that means the next Star Trek movie is going to be bad.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.880
And I don't want it to be bad.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880
But maybe.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880
We might, we might.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.880
After seeing a few things going on, and it's got Sherlock Holmes in it. I mean, just saying.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Wait a minute. I thought Sherlock Holmes was on CBS now.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880
No. No.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.880
Wait, you mean Lucy Liu isn't Watson?

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:51.880


01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880
I love getting those fans riled up with those comments.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.880
Actually, I've seen, my friend's been trying to get me into it,

01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880
so I'm going to start watching the BBC one.

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.880
But after the little bit I watched, I was like, oh, this is actually brilliant.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:09.880
They should have Lucy Lawless as Watson.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.880
Nice. Alright, Hitstun says, Windows 8 reminds me of Vista 2, and PC users will certainly skip it,

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:20.880
and the UEFI motherboards that will prevent other operating systems from booting.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.880
What the hell? UEFI motherboards that prevent other operating systems from booting? Really?

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880
Yeah. Lame.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.880
Windows 8 looks pretty bad for a typical PC application that you use with a keyboard and mouse,

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.880
and if it's like the current Xbox 360 dashboard, it's awful for games, too.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880
It does look like a fine interface for touch screens,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.880
and if they decide to make a phone that runs the full PC version of Windows 8, I'd probably go for it.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880
People treat their phones like computers nowadays,

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:49.880
so a phone running a full computer OS specialized for touch screens sounds really cool.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.880
It's just not going to replace Windows 7 on my desktop.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.880
And lastly, Sean L. replies, saying, Windows 8 is fucking terrible.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.880
I couldn't even figure out how to shut the computer down,

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.880
and I write software for a living.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.880
If they can't even get basic UI right, how can it be good for games?

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.880
I did not hear a lot of people in that on board with Windows 8, like one or two, maybe.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.880
Wow. Very interesting.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:16.880
Alright, that's it for the football question of the week.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.880
How about you guys? Windows 8? Yes? No? Maybe so?

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.880
Never. Never? Why?

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.880
Unless they make it like Windows 7.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:31.880
Honestly, I got so mad when Dan decided he was going to upgrade me from Windows 2000

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.880
into whatever the hell one came after that.

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.880
XP or Vista?

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.880
XP. Because I actually had to get a new computer.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.880
Because something happened and it fucked up my hard drive.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.880
I think my hard drive was already going out because I know that an OS just won't screw it up automatically, but still.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880
I hated Vista.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:56.880
I really like Windows 7, because it took the stuff that was good in Vista,

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:03.880
took actually a few bits and pieces from memory management from Linux, and it's pretty solid.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:10.880
On top of that, I am super happy that Adobe has been actually getting their shit together for the PC users,

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:18.880
and have made the 64-bit versions of the full CS suite actually really good and really usable,

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.880
and those compatibility issues between Mac and PC, they're just not there like they used to be.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:30.880
The only problems I ever have is going from 6 to 5.5, because I used 6 at school.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.880
That being said, I would like to see more game support on Mac.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.880
I mean, it's a really good OS. A lot of people use it.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:47.880
It's got great graphical management, clearly, because that's what is the industry standard for anyone who's in graphics.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:57.880
However, I do think that Linux also should have the attention, being that it actually is a lot more versatile.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:02.880
You really can do a lot more with Linux. I think that Linux should really replace both of them, but that's just me.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.880
That's just me. Don't shoot me or anything.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.880
Windows 8, it's basically, Microsoft has this whole micromanagement thing,

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.880
and Windows 8 is really going to limit, it's basically going to be the PC for idiots.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.880
Except, you know, we've already had people trying to get in and trying to figure out how to do things, and it's just not working.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:28.880
It's, I don't like to let anything have that much control over my system.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:34.880
Yeah, my favorite is the guy who develops software that can't get his computer to shut off. That's pretty telling right there, in my opinion.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:41.880
Yeah, I just, I can't get behind taking that much of the control out of the user's hands.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.880
It really is going to be the idiot's PC, the idiot's computer.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.880
Loki?

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.880
Why can't we just get people to learn how to use PCs, like back in, you know, the 90s and 80s?

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.880
I need Mavis Beacon to come over here and teach me how to type.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:05.880
I mean, seriously, it's like, come on, the people growing up with PCs nowadays are fully aware of how to use them, I think.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.880
You know, kids growing up probably know a little bit more than their parents did about how to run PCs,

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:22.880
but yet, why are we like, you know, trying to get these people, like the elderly, to purchase these brand new devices that they're not going to really use?

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:26.880
I know, it's because it's the elderly and they'll buy shit. I guess that's it.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:31.880
Got that, you know, retirement money burning a hole in the through their pocket, I guess.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.880
And Raman, no, a PC for idiots is not a Mac. A PC for idiots is Windows 8. End of story.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.880
You actually have to have some degree of intelligence to use Mac OS.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.880
And no, I would not buy it. I'm not getting a Windows 8.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.880
I'm going to take the wait and see approach that somebody else said. I'm going to be honest, this is going to make me sound ridiculous, but I don't care.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:06.880
The fact that Blizzard hates it makes me really, or at least, you know, indicates that from some comments that have been made, makes me really nervous because obviously I need my PC to play World of Warcraft flawlessly, and yes, that is a big deal.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880
Shut up.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.880
For once, I'm not judging you.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.880
If your computer's not broke, if your Windows 7 or whatever's not broke, why are you going to go about replacing it?

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:25.880
Just wait. Wait for Windows 9 or something else.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:32.880
Alright, well, for the first time in a while, since we were running good on time tonight, I read every single answer on Facebook and Google+.

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.880
Good job.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:43.880
So there you go. If you want to answer next week's question, make sure you're a part of the community, either at Google+, at Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880
Let's get back into some news. Loki.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:57.880
One thing. Brad cannot talk about the iPad being an idiot's PC because it's the only reason that I don't have a Cintiq yet.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:13.880
Alright. So, there's a word out there, a phrase out there, that's kind of abundant in the video game and anime community. It's called fan service.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:20.880
And what do fans want? Well, in Dead or Alive 5, it's bigger breasts.

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.880
Amen to that.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:32.880
Team Ninja, they were saying that, you know, earlier this year, we were actually trying to focus on the real women that surround us and being realistic in the character designs.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880
Where's the fun in that?

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.880
However, we were getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality and tone down the sexiness of the game and stuff like that.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:52.880
But, the fans who had played the early demos, we got a lot of feedback from them saying, we want bigger breasts. Make the characters more like that.

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.880
That was kind of surprising, giving, you know, the suggestions to tone down the sexuality.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.880
And, so, Team Ninja being Team Ninja.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.880
Look, Team Ninja, props for, like, trying to do the right thing, and I understand, but let's be real.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880
Gold star, you tried.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:16.880
Let's be real, Dead or Alive is all about excess, and, like, if you take the tits out of Dead or Alive, you have a pretty mediocre fighting game.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.880
Then you have Virtua Fighter.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.880
And a really shitty volleyball game.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.880
No, no, no, no, because Virtua Fighter is shit. I hate Virtua Fighter. I love Dead or Alive.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:26.880
Now, how do you feel about bigger boobs?

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:28.880
I'm all for it.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:30.880
Can you imagine?

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.880
Confirmed on Orange Lounge Radio. Even the women want bigger boobs.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.880
Can you imagine, like, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball with toned down breasts? Fuck that. Nope, not buying it.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:46.880
Well, you know what? But, hey, you know what? I don't want small-chested women to feel, you know, there's fan clubs for that, too.

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.880
The itty-bitty titty committee. There's fan clubs for that, too.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:55.880
But, in this particular circumstance, Dead or Alive is all about the big tits.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.880
It really is.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:07.880
I really think we should, like, you know, ramp up Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 3 with, like, hardcore orgy scenes or something like that.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.880
Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball is like dress-up for dudes.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.880
That's why I'm saying we throw the orgy and sex and nudity and all the X-rated content in there.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:19.880
It's girly dress-up for dudes.

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:24.880
Because then it's girly dress-up to then have them take it off and have sex with each other.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.880
You've already got the butt-floss string.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.880
Yes, but, you see, they're not having sex with each other, so that's the problem.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.880
I really want there to be a part three with pillow-fight mode. I think that would be a lot of fun.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.880
And, like, as you're doing pillow-fight mode, like, pieces of clothing, just, oh.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.880
Pillow-fight mode? Using Connect.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.880
No, we don't have panda boobs. Shut up.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:54.880
Why are they talking about pandaren in chat?

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880
I don't know.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:58.880
Furry boobies.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.880
That might take you out of the experience a little bit.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880
Alright.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.880
Well, I can't wait for Dead or Alive 5.

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.880
Moving on.

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.880
This is the story that just won't go away. Remember 38 Studios and how they closed?

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.880
And how the state of Rhode Island basically owns them because of the whole loan situation?

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.880
Well, Rhode Island was going to try and auction off the Xbox developer kits.

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:27.880
Because, you know, that's what happens.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:29.880
Those things never leak out.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880
When they liquidate you, they auction all that shit off.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.880
So, they were going to sell those on October 23rd when the auction was slated to happen.

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.880
However, Microsoft is requesting that Rhode Island return those developer kits.

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.880
Or what?

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.880
And they say that those kits do belong to Microsoft.

01:39:48.880 --> 01:40:00.880
Quote, Xbox 360 development kits are the property of Microsoft and are only licensed to authorized studios and may not be assigned or sold to any third party without the written consent of Microsoft.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:12.880
We will be contacting the appropriate parties involved in the auction of 38 Studios assets to remove the XDK units from the auction listing and to secure the return of the consoles to Microsoft.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880
Here's something kind of scary though.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.880
If you think about it, we have the whole thing where stuff is licensed.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.880
You know, you license a game from...

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.880
So, I mean, this is just totally tinfoil hat scenario here, but what's to stop Microsoft from saying,

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.880
Hey, yeah, you know those Halo 4 games you guys bought from us? Yeah, we need those back.

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.880
You licensed it, so you need to send them back.

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.880
Or, you know that electronic copy of the game you have? Yeah, well, the license is up. Yank.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.880
Fun. But yeah, seriously, those XDKs do get out there.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.880
I would know from personal experience.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.880
And how much approximately would one set you back?

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:04.880
Not very much anymore because now that there's the whole reset glitch consoles and J tags are pretty out there, there's not much use for XDKs anymore.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.880
Like 300, 400. Oh, that's not too bad.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.880
I wonder what bargain basement prices they would have gone for in this auction.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.880
Interesting.

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.880
Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer.

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:22.880
Well, I was actually playing with my iPad. Yeah, I can tell.

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.880
Pay attention! Hey!

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:30.880
I will confiscate your iPad and you can have it back after class. You can't. How about a really trippy ass game?

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.880
Called Middens.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880
Kitten Middens.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.880
I was just looking at the pictures of this game and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:53.880
It basically is an indie RPG, so it's got, it's all pixelated sprites, but with some very trippy ass backgrounds.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:42:04.880
So it looks like you're running, you know, head first through a combination of a Dali or even, you know, going back to Hieronymus Bosch.

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.880
Yeah, I know. I'm going all art history on you guys.

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.880
It's really freaking trippy, but it's a game that I really think that I want to play.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.880
Basically, when you start off the game, you find a gun with a mouth and an eye.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.880
Yeah, so basically just don't take acid while you play this, because it's really fucking weird.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:28.880
Well, at least you get a gun.

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.880
And you can try it out for free.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.880
I like free.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.880
Yep, so I'm going to play the hell out of this game.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.880
Well, I expect a full review on next week's show.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.880
You can expect your review, but I'll be at Disneyland.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.880
Oh, that's right. You're not here next week.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:48.880
That's right. I'm going to be at Disneyland.

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.880
It's all right. She won't play it anyways by next week.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.880
She'll be like, oh, I had to play Mass Effect again for my other friend who can't play it themselves.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:42:59.880
No, I'm just playing for Becky.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880
There you go. We should start a foundation.

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.880
We should. We should start a foundation.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.880
Mass Effect for those who cannot Mass Effect.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.880
We'll play Mass Effect for money.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:20.880
It's the Make a Mass Effect Foundation. I shouldn't. I'm not making fun, but I'm making fun of Jamie playing nothing but Mass Effect 24-7.

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.880
I don't play 24-7. I basically play Mass Effect once a week.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:26.880
Sorry, 12-7, and then the other 12-7 is...

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880
Pandas! Shut up.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.880
My bad.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880
Well, I do play the Mass Effect thing on my iPad.

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.880
Actually, Bobby Black Wolf is volunteering. He needs that foundation, so he needs you to play Mass Effect for him.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.880
That means that he has to come over to my house.

01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.880
Well, remember, remember, if we get the podcast award win this year, he's going to come have a beer with us during our marathon show.

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:49.880


01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.880
And so we'll marathon Mass Effect during the show.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.880
The Church of Garish Foundation. Thank you, ass-deft, which came from chat purely because we were talking about burritos. Now they're little asses.

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:03.880
Also, AlphaKananagram asked about me having an iPad. Yeah, I didn't actually bring it up on the show.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:17.880
Dan traded his Transformer for an iPad for me because he bought a new graphics card, power supply, and got Borderlands 2, and I was really pissed off that he spent all that money and didn't buy me an iPad.

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.880
So he made it up to me.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.880
He traded a Transformer? Like a doll?

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.880
No, he traded his shitty android shit.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:28.880
He didn't like it anyway.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.880
I was like, Dan just had a Transformer doll that was worth $400.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:34.880
We've got one that's worth a couple hundred.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:36.880
Alright, I get it now, sorry.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.880
But anyway, Dan didn't really care for it anyway. He was going to sell it.

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.880
Just because I'm on this show doesn't mean I'm smart.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:48.880
But he didn't really, like I said, he didn't really care for it, and he was going to sell it anyway, so he got me an iPad instead.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:51.880
What do you think this is, RobG4?

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.880
I'm just a pretty face.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:45:00.880
Dude, I caught a clip of X-Play the other day. I didn't even realize that was X-Play until they were like, oh, that's Morgan Rep.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.880
The guy that they have replacing Adam Sessler is a fucking tard.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:10.880
I mean, seriously, he just sits there and is like, okay, what retarded thing can I say next?

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.880
Funny joke, hahaha, I'm funny.

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.880
And they're just like, what the fuck did that have to do with anything?

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:25.880
You know, it's like the male equivalent of the females that they had on Attack of the Show or something.

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.880
Alright.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:38.880
And for all of you freaking people who like to suck Android's cock, I don't like Android. I've used it. I've given it a chance.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.880
I hate Windows tablets even more.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:46.880
iOS has what I want to do, and Wacom loves it. The end.

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:53.880
DarkSakura is an equal opportunity hater, you see. What is the old saying? She's a hater, and guess what she's gonna do?

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:55.880
I'm gonna hate!

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:58.880
Exactly.

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.880
Y'all can bite my tuchus.

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.880
Uh, BlackWolf in our chatroom says S3 greater than iPhone. You know it's hilarious.

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:06.880


01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.880
You know it's hilarious. No, this is what's hilarious. iPhone 5 comes out, right?

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:18.880
My boyfriend, Alan, the day the iPhone 5 launches, he's had this old ass Blackberry. He has like one of the first Blackberries.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.880
Only a long time ago. It was an old ass phone, right? He finally decides he's gonna join the current generation of phones.

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:27.880
So what does he do the day iPhone 5 launches? Goes and gets a Galaxy S3.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.880
Bravo. Bravo. Wise choice. Keeper. He's a keeper.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.880
Dan and I were having the discussion about it, and when he gets rid of his Nexus, he's going back to an iPhone.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:47.880
But this is the reason why Alan is very loyal to his mobile phone company, T-Mobile, or as I call it, Tijuana Mobile.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:54.880
Which apparently is treated him very well over the years, so he didn't want to, because they don't have the iPhone, so he wanted a Galaxy.

01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.880
I love my iPhone 4S. I really do.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.880
There's several people in chat going, Alan is awesome.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:08.880
He could technically get a phone and then unlock it and have it, I think, work on that service, an iPhone.

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:19.880
I heard T-Mobile was actually doing, sorry, I'm eating crackers live on air. I heard T-Mobile was actually doing some type of advertising campaign targeting jailbroken iPhone users.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:30.880
Because I have a, well, mine's not jailbroken, but it's, actually it's not even unlocked either, but I bought a phone, just a straight up phone that was a T-Mobile Galaxy S2.

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:45.880
You know, paid the premium price for it, but my monthly bill is 30 bucks for unlimited data, unlimited texting in 100 minutes, which I never use, and even if I did use those, I have apps to make calls over my data.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:48:01.880
I'm actually not mad that Alan got the S3. I mean, you might think, oh, make him get the iPhone or whatever. The only thing, the reason why I like it is in a whole what's yours is mine kind of way when you get in a long-term relationship is that, let me play with that.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.880
And he can do the same thing with my iPhone, right? He probably uses my iPad more than I do.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:18.880
But the reason, the only thing I don't like about it is that because he's still on T-Mobile and I'm on AT&T, we don't get the free text messages, and we don't have the iMessage or anything like that, so that's the one thing I don't like.

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.880
I'm surprised he has to pay for text messaging, or do you get to pay for text?

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880
I do.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.880
Well, way to go. Great provider.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.880
Well, because I have a cheap plan, even though I'm making fun of T-Mobile.

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:31.880
I have a cheap plan, 30 bucks a month.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.880
Alright.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.880
T-Mobile.

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.880
Moving on. Loki, you got a story.

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:51.880
Alright. Borderlands 2. There's kind of a terrible bug that's going around that will actually wipe out your, not necessarily achievement, but your badass ranks.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:49:04.880
They don't know exactly what causes it, but the rumor around the forums is that it's from signing up on, I forget what fucking service it is.

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.880
It's a service that they have tied to the game, but you can get a key if you sign up with it.

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:21.880
And when you do that and go back into the game, it may possibly erase your stuff, you know, if you do it after you have everything unlocked.

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:33.880
So your badass rank goes away, all your, not really achievements, but your badass points that you can spend on different characters.

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:43.880
Because the way the badass points work is all of your characters that you have on your account actually can earn these badass points and you can spend them on any of your characters.

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.880
Or all of your characters. And then you get perks like, you know, plus 1% to your damage or something like that.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880
And it's spread across all your characters.

01:49:52.880 --> 01:50:08.880
So they're right now trying to figure out what the deal is and why it's happening and asking people if it has happened to you that you submit your save and stuff so they can take a look at it.

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.880
And they're investigating.

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:15.880
Mm2k in our chat room wants to know, is that glitch on Xbox too?

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.880
Yes, it's all platforms.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.880
Uh oh.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:26.880
It's because it's tied to, it's not Premium Club, it's, fuck I forget what it's called.

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.880
They have it on the front page there. You can sign up for it.

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:39.880
And it's basically some additional content stuff that you can get and once you've signed up they give you one additional key.

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:43.880
So they have that.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.880
Honestly, if it happens to you and it gets all fucked up, I mean, I think there's save it or not.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.880
Throw a fit on the internet and threaten to kill people's families.

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:54.880
Does that work so well for other people?

01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:03.880
Exactly. I think there's editors you can do because it's all in your GPD file on the Xbox 360 so you can mod that and actually give yourself a ton of badass points if you wanted to.

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:07.880
Not that anyone would do that, but you can.

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:14.880
And not only does it erase your badass points, it's basically everything that's tied to your account.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:20.880
So all your skins and faces that you've unlocked, and that includes stuff that you've unlocked from story missions, are gone.

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:25.880
And some of those, there may be no way to get those back. So that kinda sucks.

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:31.880
Alright. Moving on to a Nintendo Direct conference that was held this week.

01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.880
There was another one?

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.880
There was another one, but it was really only about one topic.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.880
And it was about New Super Mario Bros. 2 and the DLC.

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:50.880
The Nintendo Direct was detailing the information about New Super Mario Bros. 2 DLC, which is a big deal because it's Nintendo, as in first party Nintendo's first foray into DLC, if I'm not mistaken.

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.880
Wow, they're not late to the party?

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:54.880
No. Well, you know what?

01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:01.880
Considering some of the bullshit people pull with DLC sometimes, I think Nintendo is a-okay arriving late to this party.

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:08.880
But, you know, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a pretty good game, so it's nice that they're enhancing it with a little something extra, and some of the levels that will be available.

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.880
GoGo as Gold Mario Pack. Three gold Mario themed courses up to 30,000 coins.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:20.880
Challenge the Record A Pack. It will post the top scores on the game's website.

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:27.880
And Survival Panic Pack, an extra hard set of levels. Those will all be in the Coin Rush mode.

01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:31.880
So, are they, like, legitimizing Asshole Mario? Because that's kind of awesome, if true.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:44.880
October 2nd is when these will be out in Japan. 200 yen each. I don't know the release date for America, but I can't imagine it's far behind. And probably 200 space buck points, Nintendo points here.

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:56.880
Once again, like, this whole Nintendo wet dream thing that I have. You know, kind of crossing Nintendo, like, Mario with LittleBigPlanet. Can you imagine if they did that?

01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:07.880
Like, first party Nintendo games, but like, you know, like a 16-bit Mario, 16-bit Zelda, in like a LittleBigPlanet setting where you design your own levels and games and shit.

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:23.880
Nintendo would never let that happen, because they would never want people to have that sort of control over their characters. Because people, like, if Mario, like, Mario Mario was in LittleBigPlanet, people would be building levels that's like, Mario goes to fuck a sheep and things like that. And Nintendo would never let that happen.

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:33.880
Well, no, it wouldn't necessarily be like that. It would be just like, um, you know, you design your own levels. Not necessarily like you design a giant penis. Although, you could probably build a penis at the time.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.880
Mario sucks a penis. That would be a level that would get uploaded instantly.

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:53.880
Well, that's why there's peer review. They can label that stuff. I mean, come on. You can't just let a few people ruin a great idea. Because there's always gonna be some dude out there. I'm sure there are people that have dedicated their lives to, I'm gonna create a penis in this as soon as it comes out.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:03.880
I think I have a rule about design. Now, I don't go to school for design, so I'm gonna have to run this by Dark Sakura. So, you ready? Tell me if this is a true statement or not.

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:12.880
This is a very zen statement. I've done this from playing a lot of Pandaria. Where there is design, there is penis.

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.880
No.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.880
What do you mean no?

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880
When there...

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.880
Where there are immature minds, there is penis.

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.880
And where isn't there immature minds?

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.880
Clearly not in the internet. The internet is quite mature. Thank you very much.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.880
Think about it. I want you to go ask your teacher.

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.880
I heard this on an internet radio show. Where there is design, there is penis. What do you think?

01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.880
He'd just roll his eyes and go, whatever.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.880
That is so true, is what he'll say.

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:51.880
No, he'll roll his eyes. I know he would do it. And he'd just go, what?

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.880
Well, Jamie, let me show you about some of these designs I've been working on.

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.880
I've seen his art. It's amazing, but I have not seen penis in it.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:00.880
Yet.

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:02.880
No.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.880
Where there is design, there is penis.

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.880
No, I sense an art book possibility.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.880
Okay, when I do the official OLR art book, there will be the page of penis.

01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:14.880
Thank you!

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:16.880
It will be rated M.

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.880
There used to be a game we would play at Rocky, at Rocky Horror, where it was, guess who drew the penis.

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.880
And somebody would take her on a clipboard with a page and everybody would draw their own version of a penis on it.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.880
And then you have to go around and vote who drew what penis.

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:33.880
And that was a game that occurred throughout the show.

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:38.880
We used to go to Denny's after playing Live Action Vampire. Yes, this was Mobile, Alabama. Shut up.

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:42.880
We would sit in the middle of Denny's and whoever said penis the loudest won.

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:44.880
Oh, that game.

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.880
Yeah, we would do that.

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:49.880
But I have to tell you, it wasn't Fry's when we got Dan's graphics card.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.880
And on one of the monitors, someone had drawn a penis.

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.880
I took a picture of it.

01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.880
There you go.

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:00.880
Do you have any other fanboy wank ideas, Loki?

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:02.880
No, that's it.

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:07.880
I would really dig a game with a level editor.

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.880
Anything from Nintendo. I mean, maybe not Ice Climber or something like that.

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:20.880
Mario Kart, Mario, Zelda. Not necessarily 3D Zelda, but like, you know, the cool Link to the Past stuff.

01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:22.880
That'd be awesome.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:29.880
Alright. Black Wolf says excite bike. Can you do a penis and excite bike? It would probably be very difficult.

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:31.880
No, because they have, you know, it's...

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.880
I'm uploading the picture of the penis to our website, by the way.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:42.880
Well, I remember that you could draw things in excite bike based on letter.

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.880
Like, you would choose a letter and that would be the...

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:47.880
So you could technically make a corset with penis.

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.880
Yes, you could even do penis vagina and have that be a level.

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.880
So, think about it. Think about it. Or don't think about it.

01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.880
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, alright, true story here.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.880
When I was in school for graphic design, a classmate was pissed at my professor.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.880
So in a final project, he put a very faint picture of his dick, very low opacity in Photoshop, in the project.

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:15.880
Everyone who knew it was there saw it, but the professor didn't.

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.880
The guy ended up getting a good grade on it and praised in class about it.

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:25.880
We have to say that you have very good form on your penis.

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.880
I uploaded the photo, by the way, of the fries penis on the Orange Elder Radio website.

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.880
Nobody cares. Alright.

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:33.880
It's got hairy balls.

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:35.880
Oh, hooray. Hooray.

01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:44.880
I don't know why immature jokes are so funny tonight, but they are.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:52.880
I've had a really crazy week. I had a headache all day long, so being able to laugh right now really helps.

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:59.880
Maybe some of your emails will make me laugh harder. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails every week.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.880
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first and pull out an email that she thinks, hey.

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:04.880


01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:05.880


01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:06.880


01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:07.880


01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:09.880
It's kind of sticky.

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.880
Good evening. I have to object to something Dark Soccer said on last week's OLR.

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.880
Well, too fucking bad, Skip. No, I'm kidding.

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.880
Last week, Dark Soccer called Dan's reference to the fake game, Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition, reprehensible.

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:24.880
I find this to be abhorrent.

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.880
How is Nintendo's Michael Vick Edition any worse than my fake game reference, Beaten Groovy, the Ike Turner Experience?

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:31.880


01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.880
In fact, I bet if you thought about it for a minute, you could come up with several fake video game titles that are worse than that.

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:46.880
Britney's Dance, Beating Kids, Grandma's Left for Dead, Space Harriet Tubman, Dragon Age of Consent.

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:48.880
Ew!

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.880
Stay Black Entertainment Trainer.

01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:55.880
That is a list list in development there.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:57.880
Yeah, we're going to need to do that when you come back.

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.880
Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game.

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.880
Next email.

01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.880
Most Unpolitically Correct Video Game I hope to see launched on the Xbox 720 or Xbox Lube or whatever.

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:10.880
Next email.

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:14.880
First, I know you, Rob, are pretty happy with the PlayStation Plus program.

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:24.880
I was able to get the Back to the Future Telltale series on sale with my three month welcome back enrollment, but I recently got the Journey collection when I tried to redeem the 30 day voucher.

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.880
The system let me know I needed a credit card on file to use it. Are you able to subscribe only using redemption cards?

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:34.880
That's a great question for Sony. I don't know.

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.880
I don't think so because it's auto renewing.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.880
You could turn that off though. You could turn off the auto renewing.

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.880
You could turn off the auto renewing. They want you to, you know, the catch is they want you to do that.

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:48.880
The second question on here, I'm wondering why he's wanting to ask Loki.

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:58.880
Hold on though. Tip, get one of those pre-paid credit cards and then that's how you can kind of get around it if you're worried about the whole, you know, charging you over and over again or whatever.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.880
Okay, I don't know why he's asking you this because it's about me and Rob.

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.880
Do Rob or Jamie collect any World of Warcraft toys such as the MacFarlane statues or the recent Mega Bloks minifigures?

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:10.880
Fuck if I know.

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:18.880
The answer is I don't. I wanted the Sylvanas figure. That was it because she's pretty hot for a dead chick.

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:24.880
Believe it or not, I don't have any of that stuff. The last like game figure I bought is that Balthier from Final Fantasy 12 because...

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:28.880
You did have the Final Fantasy 12 clock. No, the 11 o'clock.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:30.880
You had the 11 o'clock.

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:32.880
That was a gift. I don't think I bought that.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:40.880
Well, to finish reading, I don't really play the game myself, but I did get the Worgen Death Knight with Swift Griffin set because, hey, Worgen with a Griffin.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.880
Keep having a good show, Robert M.

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:54.880
Now, here's where the chat room helps out in answering that question. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I joined PlayStation Plus with wallet cards. I had $50 in my PlayStation wallet and it let me subscribe.

02:00:55.880 --> 02:01:00.880
Tigerclaw says, I would just buy the PlayStation Network Plus cards, usually the three month ones since they are cheaper.

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.880
SGA 100 Matt says, the thing is that by law, they have to tell people that they can unsubscribe to the auto charge thing, of course.

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.880
So it sounds like you should be able to do it without a credit card based on what Bobby and Tigerclaw are saying.

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.880
So, yeah.

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:22.880
Next email. And by the way, I still want the Sylvanas figure just because it's freaking awesome.

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:24.880
So if anybody's doing some early Hanukkah shopping.

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:30.880
Sylvanas figure. Oh, Garris. Garris. I really want the Garris. Garris greater than Sylvanas. Just saying.

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:32.880
Yes, ma'am.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:34.880
Or a plushie panda. Actually, I have a plushie panda.

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:36.880
Why not all three?

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:40.880
I have a plush panda. No, for real. Okay. I have to tell you a true story about me as a kid.

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:47.880
I had a brown bear that I've had since I was an infant. And when I was in fourth grade, my dad got rid of it and I was so pissed off.

02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:51.880
So that year my mom got me a panda with a red ribbon around its neck.

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.880
And I've had that panda since I was in fourth grade to the point where the ribbon has stained the white fur underneath the ribbon.

02:01:58.880 --> 02:01:59.880
True story.

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:01.880
Okay.

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:04.880
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:08.880
Here's my review of Borderlands 2. Awesome for the PC.

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:15.880
My brother and I were playing it on his PS3 and graphically it seemed incredibly choppy, a little laggy with jaggies everywhere.

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.880
Then I played it on my gaming PC. Blood and ashes. It's incredible.

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:26.880
It's beautiful to look at the art. It's beautiful to look at the art that is involved.

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:31.880
The huge levels. The game improves upon the first in every way there is.

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:37.880
The voice acting is great. The dialogue is genius. The clap and claptrap doesn't make me want to shoot myself in the balls.

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:39.880
I highly recommend it.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:47.880
What system is Loki playing the game on and has he played it on a gaming PC? Your loyal turtle in Philly?

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.880
Xbox 360. No I have not because I don't think my laptop can run it very well.

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:53.880
You'll wait until Steam sale anyway, right?

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.880
If my laptop doesn't run it then there's no reason for me to buy it.

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.880
No reason but it doesn't mean I won't do it.

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:09.880
Well I mean it'd have to get down to about the price that I bought. It was like 7 bucks for Portland State.

02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.880
And that would be something I'd have to buy the game of the year edition. I wouldn't want to buy DLC twice and stuff like that.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.880
Alright, shall we get into the FUs of the week then?

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.880
Let's shall.

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:23.880
That was the last email right?

02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:24.880
Yes.

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:32.880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week. And you should, dammit. I want to get more emails, dammit.

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:34.880
And you can read them.

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:36.880
Dammit.

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:38.880
Dammit.

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.880
Oh god please don't.

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:42.880
All this is bad.

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:44.880
Here is justice.

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.880
Here is punishment.

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:49.880
This is fucked up.

02:03:50.880 --> 02:04:13.880
Um, my FU goes towards losing my mini purse that had my aluminum wallet in it, my ATM cards, cards plural, my license, and my house key, and the Wacom stylus that I bought from Raichan. Which I actually still need some kind of money for.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.880
You weren't able to get that. You weren't able to get that and find that.

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:20.880
Gone.

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:28.880
I have, however, replaced my house key with a Hello Kitty house key. But I've lost my 18 year old Bats Maru keychain.

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:35.880
The one that I've had. It's metal. Actual metal. I've had it for years. I moved out here with it. It's gone.

02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.880
Very sad about that.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.880
But I do have a Hello Kitty house key.

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.880
That's black.

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.880
Um.

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:45.880
Yeah, just not please.

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:48.880
FU.

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:51.880
FU to the fucker that didn't turn it into Lost and Found.

02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:53.880
Done.

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.880
Fucking the people that drift into other lanes.

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:05.880
Because it seems like all the time. Like driving here today there's like four or five of them. Like seriously, people pay the fuck attention to where you're driving.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:09.880
Like texting or just plain stupid.

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:11.880
Urgh, I'm in another lane now.

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:12.880
I hate it.

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:22.880
My FU of the week goes to the killer headache I had not only last night but today. And headaches can be very disabling. Especially when you're really busy.

02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:27.880
And I wonder if it's not a stress caused headache. FU to the fact that I've had a lot of stress.

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:34.880
I'm just very very very very very very very busy right now. Now granted, don't cry for me Argentina. I'm the one that signed up for all this stuff.

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:42.880
So you know I have no one to blame quote on quote about myself and I know they'll be great rewards but it's just. Oh my god.

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:51.880
So, um, FU to the fact that I had some drama come up while I was at Disneyland. It had nothing to do with Disneyland or work. It was all here back at home.

02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:59.880
Um, nothing that you guys will be able to figure out but just like it's just irritating because that kind of stuff can put a little rain cloud over your trip.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:06.880
However, everything happens for a reason. What is the kill that makes us stronger? La la la la la la la la. So whatever.

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:13.880
Why can't everything be perfect 24-7? Damn it. And easy. I like easy. Because I'm lazy.

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:20.880
Yes, also I had nothing to do with VOG. That's important. Thank you Bobby. If it had something to do with VOG you'd know.

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:34.880
Alright, moving on. A few more news stories for you guys and then twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and the skype line. Hoping to hear from a lot of you tonight at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Laundry Deal on skype. Loki.

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:43.880
So in part A we talked about how NBA Live 13 got cancelled because the game wasn't very good and they just needed more time.

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:55.880
Well, here's a game the EA released that, and you know we always talk about roster updates and make that kind of joke and stuff, but it literally was a roster update.

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:11.880
FIFA Soccer 13 for the Wii. They actually, there was an article that was run on Nintendo Gamer and apparently looking at the game.

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:23.880
And I guess Wayne Rooney, they've replaced him or I guess with one of Lionel Messi as one of the examples of just the simple changes in the game.

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:30.880
Basically the games are identical except for the cover star has been changed. The title is FIFA 13 now instead of FIFA 12.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:41.880
They've done the roster updates and changed the uniforms and added I guess the clubs that they've updated and stuff in there.

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:50.880
Aside from that, the game is exactly the same. So that's kind of disappointing. I guess they figured that no one would notice.

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:54.880
I mean, put minimal effort into it.

02:07:55.880 --> 02:08:09.880
Yes, so very interesting. And there was I guess a review on the official Nintendo Magazine UK that they were kind of talking about those as well.

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:15.880
And it's just funny.

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:20.880
Alright, and how much does this game cost an individual? 60 bucks?

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:32.880
I want to say it's not 60 bucks, it's 50 I think. 50 or 40. But yeah, it's still pretty full. It's not like a $20 game or something like that.

02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:44.880
Which I think Pro Evo was actually a $20 game this year. So maybe you should hold off for Pro Evo because at least I know those are new.

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:53.880
It's just decent. It's bad. I mean, it's pretty blatant that they would do that.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:01.880
Alright, let's go to this last story here which is about, and this is one of those things where I'm like please stop, don't, no.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:06.880
This is what's going to ruin gaming for everybody. It's going to just kill the industry. Watch.

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:16.880
It's about Ubisoft. Ubisoft is apparently planning on some more free to play games for the marketplace. Now that in itself is not a bad thing.

02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:26.880
But they also want to do $60 retail games that are filled with microtransactions. And yes I am going to use that word because it should invoke a negative reaction.

02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:29.880
I also think it's incredibly funny that there's a picture of Unicron.

02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:45.880
On this particular article, yeah. Ubisoft's Alian Martinez said, quote, there will be free to play on consoles, but in the future with games like Sleeping Dogs, we could see more opportunity for $60 games to learn from the free to play model.

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:52.880
The next generation will offer more and more item based content. This will benefit our game's profitability.

02:09:53.880 --> 02:10:02.880
No it won't. When we start rejecting that bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:04.880
Do not want.

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:14.880
Sleeping Dogs DLC is terrible. It was all basically just, hey, you've got, here's some XP for your character, level up a little faster.

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:20.880
And then some of them disguise, hey, here's a mission. We're gonna get some more money for free.

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.880
You know, if you find these 10 things, you get all these money, all these different monies.

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:35.880
And so yeah, that's not a good example of DLC. Also EA, very notable for charging for cheats.

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:47.880
One of the, one of the big negatives I had to say about Mass Effect was I did not like how you can buy with money those boxes to get you ahead in multiplayer. Like, you know, to basically cheat.

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.880
And I'm sure those things sell like crazy. FIFA and FIFA's got, you know, the whole ultimate thing.

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.880
I actually did buy like two packs so that I wouldn't start off.

02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:08.880
Well, I mean, to be honest, I had already had all the points on there because I had just put way too many points on there for buying the, um, the DLC for, uh, the other stuff.

02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:10.880
Don't encourage them.

02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:12.880
So I bought like two packs, but anyway.

02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:20.880
Well, that's two packs more than they would have sold if they didn't offer those packs. So yeah, I don't see a downside for them.

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:26.880
People are going to go, oh, those are terrible. Why are you doing? It's going to ruin the industry. And then people buy them.

02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:32.880
So that's why there's DLC in those games. The free to play stuff is because people are dumb enough to buy them.

02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:41.880
I don't, and I've talked about this a lot on Horde House. I still do not understand the whole $25 for a mount. People pay $25 for a mount.

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:43.880
Never have done that.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.880
That's too much. I know lots of people that have done it. Lots of very reasonable, smart people that do it.

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:54.880
And hey, you know what? It's your money. Spend it on whatever you want, I suppose. But I just don't, like the price of the expansion was $40.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.880
Two mounts is more expensive than the expansion. I don't get that logic at all.

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:09.880
The only stuff I've ever bought through the Blizzard Marketplace was the charity pet. No, there were two charity pets and that's it. That's all I bought.

02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:19.880
I like that. There's a comment on the story here. Basically they coined the phrase pay to pay. So that's what we're going to call these games. Pay to pay games.

02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:29.880
Pay to pay games. I like that. And I think these should be called out. And I think it's very important that as we review and screen these games in the industry, we call this bullshit out.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:48.880
You know? Saints Row the Third, perfect example of DLC gone wrong. If it's locked in the game, if it's like locked costumes in the game, not additional stuff that they, hey we made this new character class or something like that, that's just, it's bullshit.

02:12:48.880 --> 02:13:01.880
You shouldn't have to pay for that stuff. And yes I understand you don't have to pay for it, but it's still the fact that they're offering pieces of the game that you bought, but oh technically a license so they can yank all that stuff away whenever they want.

02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:12.880
And don't get me started on the fact that pay to unlock is still a thing. Like all these years later, pay to unlock is still a thing. Like really? Really?

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:29.880
I guess that's it for the news that we had slated tonight. We are going to go to the Skype line. The Skype line is open right now. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We will start taking calls here. Go ahead and give us a call.

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:36.880
You can talk about anything we've discussed tonight or maybe there's something else going on in gaming that you want to talk about. That is just fine as well.

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:50.880
Meanwhile we'll also go to our Twitters at Twitter.com slash OLR and read some of those. And also, Loki you'll probably have some last minute news right?

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:52.880
Noooo.

02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:54.880
You don't have last minute news tonight.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.880
No I don't have any last minute news.

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:04.880
Oh my gosh. Alright well I know there's some Twitter topics, but let's go to the phones. Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:05.880
Legend of Zaku here.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.880
Hey, what's up?

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:13.880
Nothing much. Just relaxing on a Sunday night before heading off to bed. Trying to get in one call.

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:27.880
But yeah, I just wanted to bring up a little bit of a Minecraft article I ran into last week where the creator, Notch, he put out an article saying that he wasn't going to certify the app for Windows 8.

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:31.880
We did talk about this in part A, just so you know, but what are your thoughts on it?

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:50.880
So I don't know, I'm kind of puzzling the fact that even though he's already put out the app for iOS and Xbox Live Arcade, two pretty much walled garden platforms, and yet he's having a fit with Microsoft again.

02:14:50.880 --> 02:15:02.880
So in other words, it's like the pot calling the kettle back. I just find it odd that he's complaining about one platform even though he's taking the ass rape of two others. They're just the same.

02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.880
Did you say the pot calling the kettle back?

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:20.880
Yeah, it's hypocrisy in the sense that he gripes about Microsoft, about Windows 8, and I can understand the whole tablet aspect is pretty much locked down because it's a different platform.

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:27.880
Hey kettle, this is pot. Looks like I missed you again, so if you'd call me back, I'd be great.

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:29.880
Stop being rude, Rob.

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.880
Again, this is pot. That's P-O-T.

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:34.880
It's Zaku.

02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:37.880
Did you say black or back?

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.880
Back. The pot calling the kettle back.

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.880
It's the pot calling the kettle black. The phrase.

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:48.880
The saying is usually the pot calling the kettle black, but that's okay.

02:15:49.880 --> 02:16:13.880
Alright, yeah, it's one L, but you get the idea. It's him just having a gripe about one ARM platform, which is basically what he's complaining about Windows 8 RT, which is the new tablets that are locked down that are going to run on Windows 8, even though he's already got an app running on iOS on the same hardware, on the same hardware on Apple.

02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:22.880
So, in other words, he's basically subjecting himself to one form of asteroid block complaining about another. That's pretty much what it is.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.880
Well, the platform, the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, you can pretty much make whatever you want for it.

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:30.880
What was that?

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:34.880
I said the iOS platform is not really closed. I mean, they have a peer review process and stuff like that.

02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:36.880
Unless you're Google.

02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.880
You have a different set of rules than Google.

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:47.880
Apple is the only one that authorizes the installation of apps through their store and final approval on all apps.

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:57.880
Here's something that was brought up earlier I'm curious about your thoughts on is that Notch didn't really make Minecraft for the 360 either. He contracted or somebody bought the rights to it.

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:04.880
He didn't really do it for the 360. Somebody else did. So is he really supporting the closed platform?

02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:09.880
I guess in the sense that he's representing the brand. He's representing the game itself.

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:19.880
The fact that I don't think it's not as relevant, the fact that he contracted, he farmed out the port of Minecraft to another platform.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:30.880
But in the end of the day, it's still his game that it just went beyond PC. It went beyond like a simple Java app to something that's running on multiple platforms on multiple languages.

02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:42.880
Most importantly, as I said, I guess he has it out for Microsoft even though he basically approved a version running on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:57.880
And that's where I see the hypocrisy. You basically greenlit Xbox Live Arcade and the iOS and mobile versions, yet you're basically complaining about Windows.

02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.880
And I don't see where it adds up. I don't.

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:07.880
Alright. Well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:19.880
Let me see. This just came in to Kotaku today. 38 Studios, a company that Curt Schilling funded for his ill-fated RPG, won't be facing federal charges.

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:36.880
So in other words, he's basically off the hook from the feds, even though the state of Rhode Island is probably on the hook for the money they shelled out for having to fund that project.

02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:52.880
And it goes to show that there's an ugly side to the video game industry where you have people that shouldn't be at points where making these critical decisions about the project itself.

02:18:53.880 --> 02:19:00.880
From what I'm hearing, Curt Schilling just hired a bunch of his guildmates to advise him on how to create the game.

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.880
Don't ever hire your WoW guildies to create games for you, or really to do any professional project for you.

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:26.880
Exactly. That's it. At the end of the day, people, not just taxpayers are getting screwed, but the families of the folks who work their asses off at the studios trying on something that they really believed in, only to get screwed over by management for their decisions.

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:35.880
And none of them have been held accountable in that sense. They walk away, wipe their hands, and they move on to the next disaster.

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.880
Do you want them to be dragged in front of Judge Judy and have to answer?

02:19:41.880 --> 02:20:00.880
People's Court would have been better, but I'm not surprised that there will be lawsuits over this. Curt Schilling, he's in the clear from Uncle Sam, but in terms of the civil matters, they're on their way.

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:11.880
One can only imagine a lot of creditors and a lot of people are just going to gang up on him for lost wages, the fact that he wasn't making payroll.

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:25.880
So he's pretty much not clear from his legal liabilities. So he's better off lowering up in the near future again.

02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:32.880
Alright, Zach, I gotta let you go to take more calls, but thank you very much. Take care. Have a good night. Bye.

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:45.880
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to call. Just missed one. Sometimes people will call and wait and hope to get through. I just missed it. Sorry about that.

02:20:46.880 --> 02:21:00.880
Alright. Also, I pinged out a chat during that whole thing. You might have pinged out for like, oh man, that pisses me off. I didn't get to see the comments and chat to the call me back comment.

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:05.880
I do see one from Act Deaf that says, this is crazy and I just met you, but call me back.

02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:10.880
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:13.880
What up, guys? It's Zeno from the OKC. How you guys doing?

02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.880
Geez, Zenocor. Haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.880
Well, you know, staying employed. Same old, same old.

02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:20.880
That's a good thing. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:23.880
I've been playing a bit of PlanetSide 2, actually.

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:25.880
Ooh, alright. How's that going for you?

02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:38.880
Well, they definitely beat the hell out of their artists on this one because they really stepped it up on this. Now, every single base is different, tons of weapons, tons of customization, and the game is going to be free on release. So why not?

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.880
Wait, this is a totally free game?

02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:45.880
Yeah, it's going to be free-to-play with microtransactions like all the other free-to-play games now.

02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:48.880
Oh, of course, of course. That's how things are going.

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:56.880
Wait, did you hear that article we did just before the calls on Ubisoft's comment on the $60 games learning from the free-to-play model?

02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:02.880
Well, you know, Ubisoft's got Ubisoft. I'll wait until I see it with anything they do.

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:11.880
Mm-hmm. I did not realize that PlanetSide was originally 2003, the first one. That's really old.

02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:14.880
Yeah, I saw it when it was in the making, the E3 2001 when I went.

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:15.880


02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:22.880
And it looked damn good then. You know, just the playability and everything else. And the game survived for like, what, five, six years after it got released?

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:23.880


02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:29.880
And then here they are rebooting and they managed to step it up. They got at least three years with the development of this one based off what it looks like.

02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:33.880
Is the game already out or are you in the beta testing thing?

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.880
It's closed beta right now.

02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:37.880
Ah, okay, I gotcha.

02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:44.880
But you can buy your way in. You'll get the cash value in station points, you know, that they use throughout all their games.

02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:48.880
And then you're in the closed beta playing the game functionally right now.

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:55.880
So what is it that draws you to PlanetSide? Because, you know, this isn't an MMO I hear about every day. What is it that draws you to this game versus...

02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:58.880
Wait a minute, weren't you a EVE Online player too?

02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:04.880
Yeah, I played EVE Online briefly. I played the first PlanetSide, I played Earth and Beyond, I played a whole bunch of them myself.

02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:09.880
You know, I notice a lot of these happen to be sci-fi planet-y space games. Is that a thing?

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:11.880
Well, it's one of my things, yeah.

02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:19.880
Okay. Well, no, I think that's cool. I just noticed that little trend going on there. Well, what is it about PlanetSide specifically that draws you to that series?

02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:31.880
It's more like a full military exercise than it is just a first-person shooter. It encompasses not just vehicles, armored vehicles, but logistics.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:39.880
Some strategy, you know, actual rewarding of leadership. If people are actually doing a decent job leading a unit, they get rewarded for it.

02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:48.880
Then, you know, I somewhat flash back a bit to my days in the Air Force. I can actually use some of the stuff I learned doing air support.

02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:54.880
Now, if only half the kids understood what the hell I was saying over the radio, then it'd be a little bit more efficient.

02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:03.880
I'm trying to do my research real quick here on PlanetSide 2, and I'm looking at the Wikipedia article, and I gotta say, I'm fascinated by this. I had no idea.

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:17.880
Apparently, the Sony Online Entertainment president, John Smedley, he posted to his live journal that the sequel's title was PlanetSide Next, which was the working title at one point in 2009.

02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.880
Dude, the president of Sony Online Entertainment has a live journal?

02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.880
I think he's depressed.

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.880
Hey, wait a minute. I have a live journal. You shut up.

02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:35.880
He just recently posted to it, too. August 11th, 2012. That's more recent of an entry than like 99% of my friends' page, including me.

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:38.880
PlanetSide 2, what is it, and why do I want to play it?

02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:48.880
PlanetSide 2 is a massively multiplayer first-person shooter game made by SOE. The game is played in a gigantic open world with up to 2,000 other players on a single continent.

02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:53.880
When we say it's massively multiplayer, we're not talking about a bunch of instances like other games.

02:24:54.880 --> 02:25:01.880
All 2,000 people are literally playing together and fighting in massive battles that aren't forced into tiny little arenas like other FPS games.

02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:08.880
Each player chooses to play on one of three empires. It takes place in the distant future, and each empire has a unique play style.

02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:17.880
Probably the closest comparison would be a game like Starcraft 2, where each of the different races has a very unique play style and feel to it. Interesting.

02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:23.880
I'm just kind of reading through some of the live journal entry. It's a very interesting way to put up your press releases.

02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:27.880
Plus, now they have plenty of YouTube footage as well.

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:29.880
Good to know. Good to know.

02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:32.880
Well, any other games that you're looking forward to through this holiday season?

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:45.880
Well, not really, because I seem to have nabbed the majority of the ones for this year, like FTL and Dark Souls on PC. I'm really loving FTL. That game is freaking amazing.

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:48.880
And Dark Souls, oh my gosh, that game is ruthless.

02:25:48.880 --> 02:26:02.880
I know, as all games should be. This namby-pamby, you know, you leveled twice, so you win. Bullcrap. Figure the game out and beat it the old-fashioned way with brute strength.

02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:05.880
You press the button in time with the music. You win an internet.

02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:07.880
Yeah, exactly. Screw that.

02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:11.880
Alright, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:13.880
Nah, that's pretty much it. Y'all have a good show.

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:15.880
You too, buddy. Take care. Don't be a stranger.

02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:17.880
Alright, later.

02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.880
Well, let's go to the phones and see who else might be calling us tonight. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio. Who's this?

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:23.880


02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:25.880
Hey, Shane. How you doing?

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:26.880


02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880
Did you have fun on the live Hoard House this week?

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:31.880
No, I was too distracted playing WoW.

02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:34.880
Aww. How's WoW going for you?

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:45.880
I can't stop doing pet battles right now, which I told myself I wouldn't do until I got to 90, so I, you know, kept my promise to myself and now I'm not going to do anything else, ever.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:47.880
What level is your main pet?

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:55.880
I keep rotating all of them out. I'm getting everybody through level 5 right now and I've got like almost 100 pets.

02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:59.880
What is the name? Oh my. You've leveled all of your pets to 5?

02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:02.880
I'm starting to. I've got maybe about 10 of them done.

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.880
What do you name your pets? Do you custom name all your pets?

02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:09.880
No, but I've named most of them after Pokemon.

02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:13.880
I've named mine after Mass Effect characters. Mine are better.

02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.880
No, why would I name an animal a Mass Effect character?

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:19.880
It doesn't make sense.

02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:22.880
I named one of mine after one of Rob's old characters.

02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:24.880
You named your dog Helo?

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.880
Yes, but that's adorable.

02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:34.880
Rob, did I tell you? I actually named one of my pets after your old Final Fantasy XI character.

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:36.880
Which one? I had a few.

02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:38.880
Cuddles.

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:40.880
I named my hyjal cub Cuddles.

02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:44.880
What was Shane's? Shane had a cute character name too. It was like...

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:46.880
Fluffles.

02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:47.880
Fluffles. That was it.

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:49.880
Well, maybe I'll name one of my kittens Fluffles.

02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:52.880
Alright, there you go. Shane, would that be happy for you?

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:54.880
That'd be okay.

02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:57.880
Shane, what did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:02.880
I picked up, because it was free, DJ Max Ray on iOS and it's amazing.

02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:04.880
Apps are freaking lutely amazing.

02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.880
Dark Sakura immediately picked up her iPad and started going into the app store.

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.880
You should have seen that. The minute those words left your mouth, she's like,

02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:14.880
shit, picked up her iPad.

02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:16.880
Stop judging me.

02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:18.880
What was that?

02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:20.880
I told Rob to stop judging me.

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:24.880
I'm judging you, Rob, for not downloading it still, even though I tell you every day to.

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.880
I had a headache.

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:29.880
That is a stupid, stupid reason not to download it.

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:31.880
I've been leveling my character.

02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.880
It's not showing on, I just have DJ Max only.

02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:36.880
I think you have to do DJ Space Max, right?

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.880
Is it D Space? Whatever.

02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:45.880
I think I put DJ Space Max, but technically it's not, but it was like number six on the list of things that found.

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:47.880
It didn't make any sense to me.

02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:51.880
Like it picked up Rerave first, which is, you know, made by the In The Groove people.

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:53.880
Rerave's not bad.

02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:57.880
No, it's not. I'm not saying it is, but DJ Max is better.

02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:01.880
Oh, because I was looking under iPad apps instead of iPhone apps.

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:08.880
Yeah, I think it just stretches, but it's still supposed to be really playable on the iPad, but it's just so freaking good.

02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:15.880
Like I'm supposed to write a review, I think, for it, and I can't quit playing that as well.

02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:18.880
So, by the way, we can judge Rob because he's buying it now too.

02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:20.880
I don't want to get yelled at again.

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:22.880
I am not buying this game.

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:26.880
Good job. Don't buy it. Don't give in to him. He's a jerk.

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:37.880
It's free unless you want the song packs, and you can get a pretty good deal, like $10 for all the song packs that are currently out, and then you get some extra note skin.

02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:40.880
What's this groove catch with a little anime chick on it?

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:43.880
I don't know. It sounds stupid. Get DJ Max.

02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:46.880
With the little anime chick, she commands me.

02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:49.880
The anime chick wants a dollar. Don't buy it, Rob. Don't give in to the...

02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:53.880
I don't see DJ Max. I seriously don't. Oh, because I'm only looking at iPad apps. Hello.

02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:58.880
I just told... Shane, didn't I just say that I had to look under iPhone?

02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:00.880
Yeah.

02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:03.880
I don't listen to her. How many years has it been?

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:05.880
Rob?

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:07.880
Okay, I got it. DJ Max Ray, right?

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:09.880
Yeah.

02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:11.880
Why does it keep telling me the terms and conditions have changed?

02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:14.880
Well, did you know the terms and conditions have changed?

02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:16.880
Yes, and I agree three times.

02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.880
The rules have changed.

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:20.880
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this fucker.

02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:33.880
Make sure to create an account too. It takes like two seconds. You just have to come up with a username and password because there's a lot of syncing issues that are going on with it right now where you might lose your data otherwise, and that really sucks if you do that.

02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:35.880
I'll have to download it later.

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:37.880
I don't understand. I'm getting this pop-up box on my iPad that says...

02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:39.880
It's doing the same thing to me.

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:41.880
...the terms and conditions have changed. I haven't heard that that's happened.

02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:43.880
The conditions have changed!

02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:49.880
I don't want to read all 42 pages of this.

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.880
There is some kind of dumb over there right now.

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:55.880
Shut up, Rob.

02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:57.880
Thank God it hasn't drifted this way.

02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:00.880
You guys might need to leave the room Rob is in so you don't catch it.

02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:05.880
By the way, Shane, I did get a particular Mass Effect name that I wanted and Rob said I couldn't get it.

02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:07.880
Oh yeah, the Jane Shepherd.

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.880
Yep, I saw that was kind of surprising.

02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:12.880
I was actually a little surprised too.

02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:18.880
I wonder how many German Shepherds out there are named Commander.

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:23.880
Call it Shepherd Commander.

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.880
Oh, Alan is yelling from the other room. That is actually a thing.

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:31.880
It won't let me download it because I can't get past that stupid pop-up box.

02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:33.880
That's what it did to me. I'm going to try it on my phone.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:35.880
Do you have fingers? Because usually that's all it takes.

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:40.880
You have sold me on the Wonders of the Eye awesome platform.

02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:42.880
I am a believer now.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.880
Wow, I can't find the title that I'm looking for.

02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:51.880
Oh, and I have to agree to these change conditions.

02:31:51.880 --> 02:31:53.880
And I can't shut down my iPad.

02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:58.880
Wow, this is so much better than the Android marketplace that, you know, works.

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:02.880
Shut up. No one asked you.

02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:05.880
I'm actually trying it on my phone.

02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.880
Ray Deer in our chat room says it's Tap Sonic but you don't have to pay for every play or have a constant connection.

02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:19.880
That's exactly right. And it's got, well I mean it's all real DJ Maxx music, not random K-pop or Sara Bareilles or Hilary Duff randomly.

02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:21.880
Wait, does it have Gangnam Style?

02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:25.880
No, it's freaking DJ Maxx.

02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:29.880
Okay, so it's actually doing the same thing on the phone.

02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:33.880
So I think it's that app.

02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:35.880
Well, I don't know why it's not working for you guys.

02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:39.880
It's fine. Alright, what else did you want to talk about tonight?

02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:45.880
I was mostly going to talk about DJ Maxx and then some stupidity happened and so...

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:48.880
Well, was there anything else you wanted to say about DJ Maxx?

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:50.880
That you didn't get out there?

02:32:51.880 --> 02:33:01.880
Yes, it is very much worth at least the free download because you get four songs and they each have, doing the math, nine charts.

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:09.880
And then you can unlock through some missions a fifth hidden song which also has nine charts so it's a lot of replayability.

02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:16.880
And then there are, I want to say, five more packs of songs that you can get.

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:21.880
So it's got a lot of content for what comes out to be $10 at the moment.

02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:24.880
So it's really, really good and everybody should get it that can.

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:30.880
Yeah, if my Apple iPad will let me download it, I'll be happy to try it.

02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:38.880
Alright, sounds good and I'm still pet battling and Pokemon is this week and I cannot wait because I'll get it either tomorrow or Tuesday.

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:42.880
Well, you're just going to be the happiest person ever. It's like Christmas for you.

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.880
I know, this week is great.

02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:46.880
Well, congratulations.

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:49.880
Now all we need is the new DLC and it's extra special.

02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:53.880
I wish I was having a good week. Alright, well Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can end the show.

02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:55.880
Alright, go end it. Bye.

02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:59.880
Alright, let me, oh, I've got to go back to the iPad to bring up Twitter.

02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:04.880
Thanks to all those that called in tonight. If you didn't get through, tough. Try again next week.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:08.880
Or send us an email with your thoughts. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:14.880
Orange Riot wanted to point out in the chat room about DJ Max, it's key sounded and that is pretty important as well.

02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:19.880
It's not just something you just tap randomly in time to the music like some other apps that are out there.

02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.880
It actually does have the key sounds in it. That can really kind of change a music game for the better, I think.

02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:28.880
It might make your playing for the worse, but for the better.

02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.880
Tigerclaw was the only one to really send us any tweets tonight and he sent us some tweets about this one.

02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:39.880
First one, a story from GameSpot about Lego is aware of brand saturation fears.

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:46.880
I didn't know that there were brand saturation fears around Lego, but I guess maybe too many Lego games coming out? I don't know.

02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:52.880
There are quite a few, two this year. I think two, is there two last year?

02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:59.880
Lego Harry Potter 2 last year and Lego Star Wars last year. Yeah, they've been having about two games a year.

02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.880
Lego Lord of the Rings is this year. Actually three if you include that Lego City Stories.

02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:10.880
Lego City Undercover is April 2013 for Wii U, so lots of Lego stuff.

02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:12.880
And they already have Lego Batman 2.

02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:17.880
Let's see, Daryl Kelly said in an interview to GameSpot, each new game adds something different to the series.

02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:24.880
Quote, I think any developer, any publisher, or toy manufacturer would always look at brand saturation from an acute strategic and competitive point of view.

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:27.880
And it's important that we're adding novelty to each and every game.

02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:32.880
There's always something new, there's always something different, we're always looking to add different layers.

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:38.880
Whether it's a feature or a function or it's new hardware, which will have the luxury of having over the next few years.

02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.880
So it's definitely always a concern and it's just important to maintain a healthy balance.

02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:45.880
Of fruits and vegetables.

02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:50.880
Alright, let me see, I saw one other tweet from Tigerclaw here.

02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.880
And it has to do with Atsushi Inaba on Platinum Games.

02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:02.880
And the quote he pulled there is, you run the company like you're in danger of starving.

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:07.880
I guess this has to do with kind of the high stress nature of running a game company.

02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:17.880
Let's see, this was a quote in Edge Online in the magazine E246.

02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:25.880
Quote, I don't know if it's right to say we're lean per se, but I do think an important thing for an independent developer like us is to be on the edge of starving.

02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:30.880
I mean you run the company like you're in danger of starving the whole time and it's the right way to do it.

02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:37.880
They're saying when Platinum Games started in 2006 it had 50 staff, six years it had 200 if you counted the contractors.

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:39.880
Wow.

02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.880
The Platinum directors also made a slight dig at their previous employer Capcom.

02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:51.880
The company made great hay of the fact it had a team of 600 people working on Resident Evil 6 for periods of its development.

02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:55.880
But Hideki Kamiya is dismissive of such large projects.

02:36:55.880 --> 02:37:00.880
Quote, I heard that there were a huge amount of people working on Devil May Cry 4, just an enormous amount of people.

02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:02.880
Didn't help them, did it?

02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:04.880
Oh snap.

02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:12.880
Again that comment from an article on EdgeOnline.com sent to us via Twitter by TigerClaw.

02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:15.880
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:21.880
Any last minute stories that came up while those calls were going on?

02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:25.880
Uh, no I didn't see anything that stood out.

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.880
Not much has been going on this week.

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:31.880
Left 4 Dead sells 12 million. Cool.

02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:34.880
Alright, well that tangs us to the end of the show.

02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:38.880
A little bit shorter of a show tonight, but hey sometimes you have busy news weeks, sometimes you don't.

02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:42.880
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we close out Shop for Tonight.

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.880
Dark Sakura, thank you for being here as always.

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:48.880
I have a choice and I choose O-L-R.

02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:49.880
I choose O-L-R.

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:52.880
But not next week. Next week you choose the gays at Disneyland over O-L-R.

02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:54.880
Yes, I choose the gay.

02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:56.880
And I'm not going this year. It's kind of sad.

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:58.880
I choose a lot of gay.

02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:00.880
Send me pictures.

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:02.880
The Sea of Red.

02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:04.880
Have fun. Your final thought tonight?

02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:06.880
I'm actually going to wear my O-L-R shirt.

02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:08.880
Oh wait, that's right you didn't get the vog one this time.

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:13.880
I have my red and black O-L-R shirt that Kristen and I had way back when.

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:14.880
Very cool.

02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.880
Because I have hit my first goal. I have lost 10 pounds before going to Disneyland.

02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:21.880
Congrats.

02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:23.880
So my message is actually very important.

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:25.880
Span, neuter your cats.

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.880
Thank you Bob Barker.

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:31.880
Did he not say that at the end of every episode of The Price is Right?

02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:34.880
I didn't really watch a whole lot of The Price is Right.

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:36.880
Poor soul. It's a great show.

02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:38.880
I did back in the 80s.

02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:40.880
I didn't remember because I didn't care.

02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:46.880
But seriously, rescue a cat. Everyone go out and rescue a cat.

02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.880
Unless you're allergic to cats.

02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:50.880
Then take some Benadryl.

02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:52.880
Rescue a dog.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:54.880
Alright, Loki your final thought?

02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:56.880
I never rescued enough cats.

02:38:57.880 --> 02:38:58.880
I had 11 at one time.

02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:00.880
That's a lot of cats.

02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:02.880
Then I didn't feed them and then they went away. At least I think they did.

02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.880
I think they're waiting in the shadows.

02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:06.880
Waiting to hunt me down.

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:11.880
My final thought is Christmas cannot get here soon enough or Hanukkah or whatever, winter or December.

02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:14.880
Because I am waiting for Peppermint Pinkberry to come back.

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:16.880
I am craving some Peppermint Pinkberry.

02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:18.880
We need to go get some Pinkberry tonight.

02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:20.880
It's really good. I just had Pinkberry last night.

02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:22.880
I don't care. Let's go get some.

02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:25.880
Alright, that's it. That does it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio tonight.

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:27.880
Thank you guys as always for supporting independent radio.

02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:30.880
Hey, if you liked Orange Lawns Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show.

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.880
Word of mouth is all we have to promote ourselves.

02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:35.880
We'll be back next week with more of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:38.880
Ooh, I believe podcast award nominations open up this week.

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.880
So, for your consideration.

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:43.880
Alright, there you go.

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:45.880
That's it. Have a great week everybody.

02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:47.880
We'll see you next week. Same bat time, same bat channel.
