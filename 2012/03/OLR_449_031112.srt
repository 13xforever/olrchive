00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,680
Tonight, March 11th, 2012, a new iPad claims to do something Xbox and PlayStation can't.

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:31,720
One UK retailer is in financial trouble, and could the next Xbox be disc drive free?

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,700
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,380
We are live with episode number 449 of our show for this March 11th of 2012.

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,040
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,040
say hello to, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Ugh.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
How are you?

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Full.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Full.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Full of orange chicken I see.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Yes.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
One of my weaknesses.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,160
Because my DNA compelled me to eat it.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,880
Panda Express is like Starbucks around here.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
There's a crack.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,760
There's a place like, there's literally, you can go to a mall and there's Panda Express

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,200
in the food court, and then right next door, in the other mall, is another Panda Express.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,640
And they're all next door to Starbucks.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Yes, exactly.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,320
That's how it works around here.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,160
Alright, also say hello to, you know he loves his food too, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
Hello.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
How you doing, Loki?

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I'm doing good.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
You went pretty basic with your food choice tonight.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,440
You went to the McDonald's.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,800
Yes, it was because I just, there's not, like I said, there's not a lot here to, or from

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
my house to, you know, your apartment, so.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Yeah.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,280
And there's like, like a ton of McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and that's pretty much it.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,560
This part of town's really sad when it comes to food.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
So I mean, unless I pull off the freeway mid, you know, mid-trip, I, there wasn't really

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,560
much for me to, you know, have in.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,520
I was gonna go to Quiznos, but I was like, I had Quiznos yesterday.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,320
You know, I had pizza yesterday, so, I was like, I'll just have McDonald's, it won't

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
be that bad.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,680
It was actually pretty terrible, but it's alright, you know, it's, I don't, I've been

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,460
not eating McDonald's, so, you know, Burger King's the way to go, at least that food is

41
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
palatable.

42
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,560
Alright less food, more games.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Join us to talk about what you've been doing in video games this week.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,360
After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and we do tape live every Sunday

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,160
show and his misguided ways about particular soundtracks, but it's still a good show, so

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,200
tune in and stay tuned for us at, again, six Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, and join us

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,700
live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where some of the chatters are not too happy

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,840
about us bringing up food.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,280
Uni starts us off tonight saying, OMG, dang you for mentioning Panda, I want it now, lol.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,020
And they don't even pay us for these ads, these free ads that we're giving away here

52
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
on the show.

53
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,120
We need to put the clamp down on that, alright.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
No more freebies.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Alright.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,800
I love my food from Redected.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,440
Exactly, beep.

58
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,280
Let's talk about games.

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,320
The kickoff topic tonight I wanted to start with kind of talking about is rediscovering

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,800
games kind of late in the game.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
We usually talk about, you know, what video games we've been playing this week, and I'll

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,840
kind of tell you in advance here, one of the games that I finally, finally played this

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,900
week, and you guys are seriously going to roll your eyes and be like, how are you on

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,000
a gaming podcast and you've never played this game, to which I say, shut up, because just

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
because we do a podcast doesn't mean we have time to play every single game that comes

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,720
out, because there's so many of them.

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,200
So sometimes we miss some, and one that I missed the first several times is Mass Effect,

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,080
and I finally started playing it this week, when did Mass Effect come out, like 2007?

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
I've never played it.

70
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
That sounds about right.

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,320
So see, sometimes, you know, you just don't have time to play everything.

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,840
So yeah, I finally started playing it, and well, I'll save my opinions for a little bit

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
here.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I think it was the same year as Rock Band.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Was it really?

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Like, within a week.

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,520
Well, I figure they come out about every other year, except for, I think, Mass Effect 2 originally

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,240
had been bumped back, like, it was a January release, wasn't it?

79
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,760
Uh, PS3 it was, because that came out a year later, I think.

80
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,320
I could have sworn that when Mass Effect 2 came out, it was really early in the year,

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,400
because when it got a lot of Game of the Year awards, people were like, that came out this

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
year?

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,360
Oh yeah, it came out, like, right after Christmas.

84
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,760
So, but anyway, this isn't about necessarily just the timing of things, but what I really

85
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,080
wanted to ask was, has there ever been a game that just, it seemed like you missed the boat

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,780
on it for so long, it just took you so long to get into it, and years later, here you

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,480
are finally playing it.

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,800
Have you ever had a game like that, where it took you like five years to get into it?

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,960
I know here on the show, we do the Classic Game of the Week every week, too, where Dark

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,000
Sakura talks about a game, you know, and sometimes people have discovered games that way, like,

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,360
I think there's an email coming up tonight about that, sort of, but, just wondering if

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,840
you guys have had any experience with delayed games.

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,320
Played Chain of Memories, like, really late.

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,240
I really can't think of very many, because I really can't play a lot of console stuff

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
anymore.

96
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh yeah, because of your hand and stuff, huh?

97
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,960
I played Mario Kart 7 for the first time yesterday.

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,720
It didn't make me throw up.

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Well that's good.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,520
I thought I let you play Mario Kart 7 when I got it.

101
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Alright.

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
I played Loki's Ridge Racer.

103
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Yeah?

104
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
That was it.

105
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
And it made me sick.

106
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Oh, it's too bad.

107
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
Loki, anything you can think of that was a little bit delayed for you?

108
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,960
That's true, you've just been talking about the first game, not that long ago, huh?

110
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,980
Well, we're gonna be going to three pretty soon, I think.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,880
Because I asked them, like, hey, you guys wanna do number two?

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,400
Like, we're gonna move to another game, we're gonna go to the latest one.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Not Black Ops or anything, not really into the Cold War stuff, we're more into the Modern

114
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Warfare stuff.

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,880
Going to our chat room, I love some of the comments we're getting in our chat room.

116
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,760
We are the show, of course, where every gamer has a voice, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

117
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,000
Katsuhiko Jinai says, I haven't played Mass Effect either, so it's not just you, Dark

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Sakura, or me, up until today.

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,280
And let's see, the Rob D. in our chat says, I do that all the time.

120
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,400
I went back and beat 50 games back in 2006 just for this purpose.

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Probably five games were new.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,760
That's a, man, I wish that was a goal I could realistically accomplish, but I never beat

123
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
games.

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,120
I really should force myself to, but there's just, there's so much other stuff I have to

125
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
tackle that I wouldn't want to give myself a goal like that.

126
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,340
That's a lot.

127
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,080
That's up there with reading 100 books in a year or something like that.

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,840
Black Wolf in chat says, BeatMania 2DX.

129
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,760
I think, I can think of one for you, Dark Sakura.

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
World of Warcraft.

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,040
I played it right at the beginning though, too.

132
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Oh, that's right.

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
You did.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
You didn't like it.

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Remember, I had a vanilla account.

136
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Yeah, I forgot about that.

137
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
That's true.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,480
The Rob D. says, playing new games is overrated.

139
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,060
You know, it's usually a lot cheaper if you wait, that's for sure.

140
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,620
So there you go.

141
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,800
So those are some of the delayed games there, delayed games.

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,680
Let's move on and talk about what video games we've been playing this week, whether it be

143
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,400
new or old.

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Well, I finally beat every single puzzle in Best of Move for iOS, and it was pretty epic.

146
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,220
Now I want them to release some more so that I can get more puzzles.

147
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,040
I started another game called Star Mine that I bought on name alone, and it's actually

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
a pretty fun little puzzle game.

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,800
It's like a block sliding kind of game.

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,600
And then I played some well in Sonic CD.

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,080
All right, there you go.

152
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Loki?

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:09,480
I played just a few games this week, other than Call of Duty, played a little bit of

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,400
the new Vita game, Motorstorm RC, which is pretty cool.

155
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
It's a little different than a regular Motorstorm game.

156
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,280
It's more like a Super Sprint or Ivan Ironman, Stewart's super off-road type thing.

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,360
And I've been playing that a bit, and one of the things I was trying to do was beat

158
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,240
you, because they have ghost data that you race basically in the game.

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,280
And so I was trying to beat that stuff, and I was pretty happy that I was able to beat

160
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,200
the ghost data that was in there until I figured out that the ghost data is glitched out, because

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,100
the ghost data, yeah, even though you beat it, like for example, the very first track

162
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,400
in the game is called Mixing Bull, and beat the ghost data in that.

163
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,080
Except then I noticed, hey, it disappeared.

164
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,940
That's because the ghost data only runs three of the four laps.

165
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:06,320
So it's impossible to beat, because it's all fucked up, because the game is cheap and terrible.

166
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,360
Well, it's not terrible, but hey, it's free, so I guess you can't complain.

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I don't know.

168
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
It's frustrating.

169
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Unfortunately, I kind of ran into the same thing with some of the other ghost data that

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,880
I raced, where I beat it and find out that, oh, look, I'm still ranked 3,000, even though

171
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,200
they're, oh, there's times they're faster than mine.

172
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,940
Well, then why wasn't that the ghost data that I was racing?

173
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,560
It's just all really weird.

174
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,380
And I complained to, of course, got to complain to them, Bill, listen, bitch, I know this

175
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
shit was free.

176
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Did you say in an angry tweet?

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,240
I did say in an angry tweet, too.

178
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,760
At PlayStation, why are your games broken?

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,040
No, no, see, you would think it's at PlayStation, but no, it's at MotorStormRC, they have their

180
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,940
own fucking Twitter account, and I'm like, what the fuck, you can't beat this goddamn

181
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,600
ghost lap, because it only does three of the four laps.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,440
We're aware of the issue, we're working on it.

183
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,400
I kind of did something similar this week, I sent a tweet, this is serious, not a joke,

184
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,320
I sent a tweet to AwakeNBC, and I sent a tweet that said, please don't get cancelled, because

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
I like the show, and apparently not a lot of people are watching it.

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,000
So I sent them a tweet, and I said, please don't get cancelled.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,320
They didn't reply to me, maybe they've already been cancelled, I don't know.

188
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,800
So that was alright, I played a little bit of that, and then a couple other things that

189
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,880
are a little frustrating with me, the camera is really annoying, I really wish this game

190
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,560
was a first person driving game, and I understand maybe the camera's top down because one, it's

191
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,760
an RC game, that's fine, but I've played other RC games that were first person, or at least

192
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
behind the car type thing, not this, I have to figure it out from the top of the track.

193
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,120
Is this going to be about your love of Excite Truck again?

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,680
No, it's not going to be about Excite Truck.

195
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,280
No, there was a racing game that was on, I think it was Re-Volt, was actually on the

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Playstation 2 or Playstation 1, that was actually pretty cool, it was an RC game.

197
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,840
It's a little frustrating, like when you're racing, it's hard to see some of the track

198
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,200
get the really mess of the camera to get it just right.

199
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,000
And then of course they have cars you can buy, which, as far as I'm aware, they don't

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,900
have stats on those cars, so I don't know what any of these other cars that I'm unlocking

201
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,200
do other than different types, and they're assuming different types handle differently,

202
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,140
but as far as different cars within the same type, I think it's just the way they look.

203
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:43,560
I did download the free cake car that you can, it's a cake slice car, so that was free.

204
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,800
What else?

205
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:54,040
I played Luminous on the Vita as well, I went through and I decided, hey, I'm going to beat

206
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,160
all the leaderboards on here, at least within my friends, and so I did that.

207
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,800
I beat all the leaderboards and, last I checked, and I was on top of all of them.

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,840
Except for obviously some of the higher master class stuff because I haven't beat the master

209
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,240
thing yet.

210
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,240
That's like really frustrating, just trying to get all the trophies for that game.

211
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,880
Oh, and I ranked up to 50 because for some reason when I play Luminous, it's actually

212
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,200
when they start doing the world cube thing, and you level up like 30 levels just by checking

213
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
it once.

214
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,160
I still can't nail what time of day, like I thought, it seemed like to me at the beginning

215
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,280
it was 4 o'clock Pacific everyday because that would be midnight in Greenwich time,

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,120
but it doesn't seem like it's always that time.

217
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:47,800
It's about 7, I think it's about, well it's just after, between 8 and 9 Pacific, 8-9 PM

218
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,680
Pacific is about when they're up, because I actually watched it one day when they had

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,400
a few hundred thousand left, and I actually contributed quite a bit to that one.

220
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,960
But yeah, around 8, 7, it was 8 or 9 PM Pacific.

221
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,720
Of course, with the time change and everything, it might be 7-8 PM Pacific.

222
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,160
So yeah, that's pretty much all I played.

223
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Alright.

224
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,160
My gaming week, let me talk about a few things I've been playing this week.

225
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,560
There have been a few things.

226
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,680
Obviously first off is Mass Effect, but I haven't played it enough.

227
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Well, A, do you really want me to review a 5 year old game?

228
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,840
I think most of you probably know how you feel, but since I did see somebody earlier

229
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,280
had said they haven't played it, and DarkSora hasn't played it, I'll just quickly say, well

230
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I haven't played enough to give you a full review, but I'll tell you this much.

231
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,200
I am way less annoyed by the combat than I thought I would be, because I know Mass Effect

232
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,000
is very much about use cover and hide behind things and get things, and that's why I could

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
not play Gears of War.

234
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,160
And it's not that I think Gears of War is a bad game, it's not, it's a good game, but

235
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,360
I, that whole like cover thing, like no, I want fucking Quake or Unreal where you run

236
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,080
out there guns a blazing, that's more my kind of shooter.

237
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,400
So I thought the cover thing would really bother me, but it's not.

238
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,360
And I think, let's be real, I think a lot of that is because I'm playing on easy, so

239
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,200
I think my squad mates really pick up the slack for me, which is totally fine by me

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,320
because I'm really more playing for the story.

241
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,960
And I did find through playing Star Wars The Old Republic and you know, a little bit of

242
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,320
the Dragon Age, I do like BioWare's whole little conversational style, and I really

243
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,120
do see where the game can damn well be two completely separate games, depending on how

244
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,160
you are playing it, so I like that.

245
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,440
I kind of like that, that it can go in the different directions, but little annoyances

246
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,720
I have so far.

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
Some of the interface is just kind of crappy, now I hear that they fixed a lot of those

248
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
issues in two and three, so I'm not going to really harp on it, but let me just say,

249
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,360
I really value the one button maps, that's all I'm going to say.

250
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,160
But those are kind of nitpicking, otherwise what I think, especially for five years ago,

251
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,840
was graphically a good game, and you know, I guess ahead of its time in some ways.

252
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,960
But I'll let you know how things progress after I actually play more of it, because

253
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,720
if I told you where I was right now, you'd be like, oh Rob, you've barely touched the

254
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
damn game.

255
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,200
Couple other things I played, Rune Spell Overture, I can't remember if I talked about this game

256
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,480
before on the show, but it's a game I bought in one of those indie bundle collections that

257
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,160
I got a key for on Steam, and maybe I played it a little bit, you know, back when I first

258
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,280
got it, and I might have mentioned it in passing on the show, but I played it more in depth

259
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,560
this week, and for those that don't know it, I would say it's a little bit Puzzle Quest

260
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,600
2-ish meets a solitaire slash poker hybrid, and I know that sounds really weird, but the

261
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,920
way you battle enemies is that you have a, you kind of have a solitaire-ish hand, and

262
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,040
then they have one, and you form poker hands by moving your cards around, but it doesn't

263
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,520
follow the rules of solitaire, it doesn't have to be red on black or any of that stuff.

264
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,660
You can take their cards too and move them up into your hand, and you're trying to form

265
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,780
like the best poker hands, like you know, five of a kind would be the best one, which

266
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,240
is more of a Yahtzee, but you know what I mean.

267
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,080
And you kind of battle that way, but on top of that, you have spells, which felt a little

268
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,560
more like Puzzle Quest, because you can kind of activate those based on the power that

269
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,120
you've generated, so pretty cool little time killer puzzle game, and I imagine it's super

270
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,140
cheap, you know, I bought it in a bundle, so I bought it when it was, you know, a very

271
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,880
very reasonable price, soundtrack's good too, let me throw that out there, pretty deep story,

272
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,880
no voice acting, but you know, some dialogue questions, and you know, just, it definitely

273
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,760
seems like there's a fleshed out story that I'm not far enough in to really appreciate

274
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
yet.

275
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,540
Let's see, a couple other things I've been playing this week, there was one other one

276
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,940
I wanted to name before I got to the big one, and now I can't remember, so I'll just say

277
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,320
World of Warcraft, but the other one I want to mention is amongst all the hype for Mass

278
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,100
Effect this week, I think there's another game that's come out, well, it's only come

279
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,620
out to a small audience, but I think it's coming out for a bigger audience this week,

280
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,560
and I gotta tell you, don't miss this one, because I think it's pretty awesome, and that's

281
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,520
a game called Journey on the Playstation 3, not to be confused with the awesome arcade

282
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,800
game from the 1980s, okay, this has nothing to do with the band, but Journey is by the

283
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,760
folks that did Flower, that game company I think is their name, and this is kind of their

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,320
new game, and so if you played Flower at all, you'll kind of know what to expect, now this

285
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,040
game isn't like Flower, it's not like, I think Flower is the most creative racing game I've

286
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,320
ever played in my life, that's kind of how I would describe Flower, Journey, I don't

287
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,440
know where to put, Journey is definitely kind of more like a platformer, but don't think

288
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,160
of it like a platformer, I'm being very careful and choosing my words carefully here, because

289
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,040
I think Journey is best experienced not knowing anything about it, because I will tell you

290
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,080
this, I sat down and played Journey, it doesn't tell you anything, there's no dialogue, there's

291
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:23,360
no, you know, do this, or you need to go here, or arrow, or any help, there's one little,

292
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,600
the little controller will show up, and it'll say, you know, A is jump, that's about it,

293
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,860
like once in a while it'll kind of pop up, so you're kind of left to your own devices

294
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,680
to figure out what the heck's going on, and it's a game that's told really through its

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,480
soundtrack, in a way, like I just, I found the soundtrack to be amazing, and really moving,

296
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,680
and then there's a twist to it, there's a reason why it's called Journey, and some of

297
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,920
you probably know, but I don't want to ruin it for you, if you don't already know, the

298
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,480
band pops out, and starts playing you on your way, therefore it's part of the soundtrack,

299
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,600
I wish, I wish, that would make it even more awesome, but there's a twist, and when it

300
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,120
happened, I was like, wait a minute, what the, and like, I don't know, do you know what

301
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,040
I'm talking about, have you read about this game at all? I've read about the game, but

302
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm trying very hard not to ruin it for the listeners, I'll have to tell you during the

303
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,960
break or something, but there's like a little twist to it, and when I first, like, I didn't

304
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,400
realize what was happening, as it was happening, and I was kind of like, this is so, the, how

305
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,120
do I explain it, ah, just, as it was happening, I was kind of like, I, I didn't realize what

306
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,200
it really was at first, and then it kind of hit me, like, oh my gosh, this is this. Yeah,

307
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,120
I know what you're talking about now. Do you? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Do

308
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,880
you really? Yeah. Okay, but there, yeah, but you know, like, it's, it's, and then suddenly

309
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,520
when you figure it out, you're like, oh my god, I had no idea that this was part of the

310
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,620
game, and then, again, I said there's no dialogue, and there's not a lot to it, you're finding

311
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,400
all these interesting ways you've never thought about before to now play this game, and it

312
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,160
can go a variety of directions. It can go a very customary direction, or it can go in

313
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,720
a direction where I never saw this twist happen, I'm just going to ignore it, I don't give

314
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,920
an F, I'm going to go do this what I was doing before, and the game still kind of works in

315
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:31,680
both ways. Now, the one, the one thing I will say about it is that it's short, it's like

316
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:39,420
two or three hours tops, and it's a $15 game, and that may not sit well with people, which

317
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,780
is fair, because, you know, we've been taught to know that games like that usually shouldn't

318
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:51,240
cost that much money, but I do think it's a really good two, three hour experience,

319
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,160
and there is some replay value in it, I can see, again, there's several different ways

320
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,520
to approach the game, and yeah, I would recommend it, but I think that play time is going to

321
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,400
really scare some people off, but, and I think a lot of people are saying this, this game

322
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,280
is very much the games are art in motion, but I don't know, like, I wouldn't necessarily

323
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,120
say well Roger Ebert needs to play this game, I don't think he could appreciate it, but

324
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,960
as somebody, you know, who's had some pretty miserable experiences on Xbox Live, and had

325
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,640
to put up with like trolling in World of Warcraft and so forth, the experience that this game

326
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,920
brought was really organic and neat, so, I guess that's really all I can say about it,

327
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,200
again, some of you know darn well what I'm talking about, and you're just like just say

328
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,680
it, but I'm telling you, there's a reason why I'm not telling you, because I don't want

329
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,400
you to be spoiled on that, and seriously, avoid reviews, play the, the value of the

330
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,380
game will be so much more if you know nothing about it going in, trust me, don't spoil it

331
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:06,960
for yourself, you might figure it out right away, but, you know, that's all I'm going

332
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,080
to say, alright, let me move on, it is what I'm going to pick up this week though, I wanted

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,880
to pick that up, yeah, you're welcome to test it out here if you want to see if it's worth

334
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,040
15 bucks or not, but, you know, because, you know, again, it's a pretty basic platformer,

335
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,000
the visuals are not, I think it's a very beautiful game, but some people are going to go, it's

336
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,800
all desert, it's just the desert, desert, desert, but there's some very beautiful things

337
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,700
they do, like there's one level where you're kind of, it's almost like a race, like you're

338
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,880
falling down a hill, and you're kind of like, you know, having to move, like it's almost

339
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,840
like hydro thunder or something, and it's like you're falling through the desert as

340
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,160
the sun is setting, it's really gorgeous, so. I forgot that I had one more game. You

341
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,240
have one more game you want to add, that's fine, because I'm done, what did you want

342
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,960
to add? I was playing Doctor Who, the Mazes of Time. Is that actually good? It's pretty

343
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,640
good so far. Is that an iPhone game? Yeah, it's, you play as the doctor and Amy, and

344
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,520
you have to, it's basically one person does one part of the puzzle, and maybe has to stand

345
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,880
on something so that it activates another part of the puzzle, and then you have to figure

346
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,820
out how to get both of them through the maze. So it's just, it's just a fun little, it's

347
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:21,460
a dollar right now, so, get it. There you go. Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about

348
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,560
some housekeeping before we get into news. I actually have something tonight, and this

349
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,860
is something I'm going to surprise DarkSakura and Loki with on air, because aren't on air

350
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:36,720
surprises the best? Oh lord. Alright, so let me tell you about this. I got a package in

351
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,900
the mail this week from our buddy Brad at Pod Culture, and this is, this is the package

352
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,320
that we got, and I had no idea what it was. Cardboard! Yes, it's cardboard, but there's

353
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,780
something inside this cardboard I think you should see, and you, Jamie, I think are really

354
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,700
going to appreciate this. You ready? Okay, so here's what was sent to us, and listeners,

355
00:23:52,700 --> 00:24:02,860
this can impact you as well. These are vinyl decals of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.

356
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,820
There's one for you, there's one for Matt. Now here's the cool thing, I wouldn't take

357
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,660
that off, because once you do, you're going to have to stick it on something. I check

358
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,540
the ink on everything, you know me. Oh yeah, you're a nerd like that. Here's the thing,

359
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,300
we have some extra decals here, and I'm sure we'll give those away at some point, except

360
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,580
I want to keep one for myself. There's some other ones in here, these are hard to see,

361
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,420
but hold them up to the light, and you can see, these are like the white silhouette ones

362
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,220
that you see on the backs of cars. Yeah. Yeah, but like the artist here took kind of like

363
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:40,420
the art and did that, and I really like the way that looks. Yeah. So, assuming that Loki

364
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,060
and Dark Sakura like this, the guy is going to, I think we're going to try, he's offered

365
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,420
to sell the stickers on his site, so you guys can get them too. Of course, you know, they're

366
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,940
not free guys, it does cost money to make, but I know the guy will be reasonable about

367
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,980
the price. I wouldn't mention it here on the show, if I didn't think that, and it's, you

368
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,340
know, Brad from Pod Culture is our buddy. And of course, I didn't put the name of the

369
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,380
site here in front of me, but I have the letter here, it is Decalmic.com. There it is, Decalmic.com.

370
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,540
And we're going to see what we can do to get that added to the store, so you guys can check

371
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,420
that out. Now the listeners are demanding pictures. I don't, I don't think that. It's

372
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,980
going to be hard to take a picture of. Exactly, I'm like, you have to remember, it's a vinyl

373
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,860
decal of the Orange Orange Radio album art. So if you've seen the podcast. With Flash

374
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,620
it could work. You already know what it looks like, but they're like little stickers, and

375
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,620
they're about the size, how big, how big would you say that is? The size of your phone. It's

376
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
about the size of an iPhone, but a little bit more square. I think it's a three by three,

377
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,780
or three and a half by three and a half. So those of you guys that have been asking for

378
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,140
OLR merchandise, because you know we, it's been how many years, we still don't have a

379
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,740
t-shirt, I think we'll be able to jump on this. So I want to say thank you, thank you,

380
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,140
thank you, thank you, thank you to our buddy Brad at Pod Culture, and of course Decalmic

381
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,900
for the hard work there. But Brad from Pod Culture is the one that essentially, I guess

382
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,340
for lack of a better term, front of the money, I guess for that, or kicked around the idea

383
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,540
to get that started. So props to him. Alright, yeah, probably not going to show up very well

384
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:15,060
on the iPhone, we'll not do it justice, but you know. Oh. And if you're a fan of Airwolf,

385
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,940
or you know, Back to the Future, there's also decals on Decalmic's site as well. Oh really?

386
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,460
I have to be honest, I've only, I haven't had a chance to browse the site yet, but he

387
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,840
has some other stuff too. Yeah, there's stuff like from Airwolf, there's World of Warcrack,

388
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,060
there's Thundercat's Sword, the Stargate SGC decal. It's all the shows that Brad talks

389
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,840
about on his show, I'm not surprised at all. Yeah, there's, you know, the TARDIS Interruptus,

390
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,860
there's Pod Culture stuff. Oh, his other shows, alright. Type 40, Geek Spin, and a lot of

391
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,660
stuff from Occupy Wall Street, there's the Guy Fawkes mask, a Dalek. A Dalek. Nice. Yeah.

392
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,580
Loves it! Alright, so. I'm putting up a few pictures. Thanks again you guys, and listeners,

393
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,680
if you want to get these stickers, I have to do some, they're not there yet, I have

394
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,820
to do some DMs and all that stuff, and you know, on Twitter, and get that all arranged,

395
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:15,440
but they should be up. I will remind you guys next week about that. Alright. My 3DS friends

396
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,320
are asking for 3D pictures. You guys, it's a window decal, they're not in 3D. 3D is not

397
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,660
going to do it justice. Alright, now let's get into some gaming news. Less about us,

398
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:32,960
more about the video games. Loki. So there was a brief little web stream thing for the

399
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,960
PlayStation Vita. I was hoping for a lot more US titles, but unfortunately they're all Japanese

400
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,520
titles, but it doesn't necessarily mean that this stuff won't be coming out over here,

401
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,280
or in other territories other than Japan, but as of right now it's just all Japanese

402
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,760
titles. So starting off, one of the titles that got announced was Phantasy Star Online

403
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,600
2 is coming to the Vita, with PC cross-play. So you're going to be able to play against

404
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,200
people that have the PC version as well. So there you go, your first MMO on the Vita.

405
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,400
And you know, I'm not really sure how the online's handled, but I mean, hell, if anything,

406
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,760
you know, the old PlayStation, or not PlayStation, the old Sega Dreamcast, Phantasy Star Online

407
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,400
was able to work over dial-ups, so Phantasy Star Online 2 working over 3G, maybe? That'd

408
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,520
be kind of interesting. No word on when that's going to be coming out, probably later this

409
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,680
year, but still pretty cool. And then they also had a... I really hope this comes to

410
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,200
America. Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I really want this to come to America.

411
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,600
I really liked, I'm probably the only person in the world that liked Phantasy Star Universe.

412
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,440
And I know this is not PSU2, this is PSO2, and it's PSO2 because PSU was not viewed as

413
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,800
very good. But regardless, I'm a fan of this series, and I hope that we are getting it

414
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,920
in America, because I was interested in it when they first announced the PC one. I liked

415
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,000
playing Phantasy Star Online offline. That was kind of fun. Well then you'd probably

416
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,280
like those PSP games were just Phantasy Star Universe, but offline. Yeah, meh. That was

417
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,400
the one where you could have the pizza box. It had some really weird tie-ins, remember

418
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,080
that? Yeah, the Pizza Hut stuff, that was funny. Wasn't Colonel Sanders in there or

419
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,240
something like that? Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me because I think Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell

420
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,640
are like all the same people. Brand wars. Another RPG that's coming out as well on the

421
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,240
Vita, The Legend of Heroes, or Dragon Slayer, The Legend of Heroes. And that's coming out

422
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,200
on the Vita as well. And they also announced that Gundam Seed Battle Destiny will be coming

423
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:57,680
out on the Vita. And it's, I guess, the sixth game in the Gundam Battle series, of which

424
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,880
I am not familiar with. I am assuming those were only Japanese releases. Not surprised.

425
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,400
There was another one that was unannounced that was kind of like, oh, we're gonna work

426
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,280
with the fans to make this happen or something. It just reminded me too much of Mega Man Legends

427
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:22,120
3, so I just tuned that out. But yeah, unfortunately no actual US titles or anything like that.

428
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,480
Because it is Japanese. Well yeah, the press conference was Japanese. It's funny because

429
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,440
I think a lot of people when this was first announced was like, why are they doing this?

430
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,840
The system just came out like two weeks ago and they already have to have a press conference.

431
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,880
Well, in Japan it's been quite a bit longer than two weeks, because they got the Vita

432
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,200
in December. So it makes sense. I do hope there is a press conference for us soon where

433
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,840
they talk about the US release of PlayStation Online 2, but at this point they might as

434
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,560
well just do E3. Yeah, well I mean, if you think about it, three months from launch that's

435
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,880
almost E3, so why not. And they've already kind of announced everything that's gonna

436
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,900
be coming out, first party at least, up through the end of the second quarter. So it would

437
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,440
make sense that any of those other announcements are gonna be at E3. And there's probably gonna

438
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,880
be a little bit of a lull during the summer, but you're gonna get a lot of fall games.

439
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,800
And I mean, hell, we got like Resistance and Gravity Rush. And in fact, actually Gravity

440
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,600
Rush, yeah, that'll be the June title. Resistance is gonna be the May title. April, probably

441
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,200
LittleBigPlanet at this point. Well, now here's what I'm wondering, because this was a Twitter

442
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,520
conversation I was in this week, and somebody was asking when LittleBigPlanet was coming

443
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,120
out, and I was like, well supposedly it's April, but the box art isn't even finalized

444
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,600
yet and there's a lot that seems like it's still up in the air in the game. I would,

445
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,400
I mean, the game may be awesome, and I'm totally down with that if that's the case. Box art's

446
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,660
finalized, just aside from the ESRB rating. I'm really worried about them rushing it.

447
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,120
I just don't want a rushed game. I don't think it's gonna be rushed. Alright, because I was

448
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,200
thinking at this point it would get delayed this summer because we just haven't heard

449
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
a lot about it. No, because this was a good launch title. I think it's already been delayed.

450
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,200
It's just, I think putting it out in March would have been kind of, I mean, it would

451
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,360
have been alright, but I think it's good that they're spacing their titles out, because

452
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,080
they had, what, two titles coming out in March, and they're gonna have one each month coming,

453
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,840
you know, major titles coming out soon, so at least there's a lot more releases than

454
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,040
there were on the 3DS, because I remember when the 3DS came out, the next month was

455
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,680
pretty much SpongeBob SquigglePants. There was a... SpongeBob SquigglePants? SquigglePants,

456
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,720
yes. I thought it was SquarePants. No, SquigglePants. Is this his cousin? It was the one that was

457
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,120
like WarioWare. Did he marry into the SquigglePants family? He must have. Yes, he changed the

458
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,800
last name, or his last name. I see. So I just remember that the releases were a lot slower,

459
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:00,520
but I don't know, it's kind of cool. I would like to see some, you know, some other stuff.

460
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, because it's supposed to be a PlayStation Network title, I'm hoping

461
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,880
that Retro City Rampage will be playable on the Vita, because that would be pretty awesome.

462
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,840
And it might be. I mean, it doesn't have to push a lot of graphics. Alright, well, now

463
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,780
that the Vita is out and they're talking about it, now our attention starts to shift towards

464
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:30,120
the next batch of consoles that is the unknown. That would be, of course, the Wii U, the PlayStation

465
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,600
4 someday, and the next Xbox, or whatever they're gonna end up calling it. I think they

466
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,600
should do the Apple thing and just call it the Xbox all over again. The new Xbox. That's

467
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,440
like so confusing. I mean, seriously? Well, we're gonna get to it later in the show, so

468
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,120
I'll talk about it then. I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.

469
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,000
No, I understand why they're doing it, because of their other, their other, you know, series

470
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,200
of hardware devices. Or anything. I bought a Corolla, you know, or I bought a Xerox machine.

471
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,260
You know, there's a lot of things that we don't necessarily address. Xerox machines

472
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,240
have model numbers, Corollas, they call them, in different car manufacturers, it's a 2012

473
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,600
Corolla or it's a 2011 Corolla. I know that, I know that, but people don't necessarily

474
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,240
like refer to it by that, so I don't know. Well fine, they can call the stupid new, the new iPad,

475
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,280
and you know what people are gonna call it? iPad 3. You're having an argument we're supposed

476
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,640
to be having in 30 minutes. Did you not get tonight's list? I don't care. Alright, the

477
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,400
next Xbox, the new Xbox, Xbox lube, Xbox, I won't even call it that other number name,

478
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,640
because that's such a stupid name and I can't believe everybody always calls it that. How

479
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,960
about the X-Sphere? The Xbox. I hear the new system will be full of skateboarding games.

480
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,040
Yes, I was gonna say the next Xbox Atari skateboarding game. Alright, anyhow, the big rumor going

481
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,800
around this week about it, and what's interesting about this rumor is that we had a very similar

482
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,280
rumor five weeks ago, and I seriously think everybody forgot, but we kind of already had

483
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,240
this rumor, but it made the rounds again that the next Xbox won't have a disk drive. Oh,

484
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,140
supposedly the code name is Durango, speaking of cars, but anyway, the next Xbox is not

485
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,520
supposed to, is supposed to not have a disk drive. There's, you know, apparently it's

486
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,440
leaked out even though there was big NDAs and all that, and, you know, of course there's

487
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,760
the way these things happen. The next Xbox quote will offer, the quote from MCVUK, quote

488
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,000
will offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid state card storage,

489
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,560
although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such

490
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:44,680
as SD. So if I'm reading this correctly, we've gone from cartridges to disk, back to cartridge.

491
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,440
Right? Is what they're saying with the next Xbox. Well, what they're saying, and I, I

492
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,960
really don't buy that they're gonna do this, because I think that, you know, Xbox, their

493
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,440
thing is we want to be your source for, like, entertainment, and I think the next step would

494
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,680
be a Blu-ray drive, because that's what everybody's using for entertainment, they want it, you

495
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:12,400
know. It's doing, like, a proprietary format, like the Vita. It was basically for security,

496
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,960
because that thing was getting hacked to shit, and, you know, publishers didn't want to make

497
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,480
games for the system because, you know, they're afraid it's gonna get pirated. Well, wouldn't

498
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,880
that just be forward thinking on Microsoft's part, that Blu-ray is gonna get hacked to

499
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,880
shit if it hasn't been already, and they don't want to, you know, A, it's, Sony's involved

500
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
with Blu-ray, so why? It doesn't matter. It's not a matter of Blu-ray being hacked to shit,

501
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,600
it's your file formats on those disks. The disk is just a storage medium. You can have

502
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,480
that same, you know, format, or the same file structure on a solid state disk on whatever.

503
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,600
You know, granted, if it's a proprietary thing, it's gonna be harder to read, because, you

504
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,320
know, no one has anything to read it yet. Well, of course, everybody's now crying. It's

505
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,840
the death of the used game market. It's the death of retail. It's the death, blah, blah,

506
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,980
blah, blah, because when you don't have a disk, therefore, there's nothing to interchange,

507
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,680
so it is gonna go belly up. Although, why are people going here when we're talking about

508
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,000
cartridges? This sounds like the Vita to me. I mean, it'll probably be, but it's probably

509
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,720
gonna be just like the Vita. It doesn't even matter. It's gonna have a drive of some sort.

510
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
They're not gonna just get rid of physical disks. I think it's still gonna be disk space.

511
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,080
I think that all these rumors are full of shit. Where's their source? Oh, it's some

512
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,080
guy that said he was under NDA. Well, I'm under NDA, and guess what? It's a fucking

513
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,360
giant robot. It's a giant 50 foot tall robot. That's the new system. I wasn't supposed to

514
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,680
tell you because I was under NDA, but it's a giant 50 foot fucking tall robot. I used

515
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,240
to be able to hear, thank you. So it's a response to the Sony Aibo. It is a giant fucking robot.

516
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Oh, I'm sorry. I was under NDA. You didn't hear it from me. Giant fucking robot. I mean,

517
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,120
that is about how credible this is. It's just stupid. It is so fucking stupid. We've had

518
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:01,400
all these... Because it's just feeding into the... It's just troll bait is all it is.

519
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,500
They're not that dumb, okay? They know that if they put out something that's digital only,

520
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,440
that it's gonna... First off, it's gonna... Not everybody has broadband connections.

521
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,840
So yeah, a lot of people do, but not everybody. So I mean, why would you do that? You're not

522
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,720
going to. I think if anything, it's gonna be kind of a compromise like the Vita is where

523
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,600
all their titles are offered as a digital download at a slight discount, or you can

524
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,720
buy everything physical. Now, whether the disc is gonna be a Blu-ray disc or it's gonna

525
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,000
be a cartridge or whatever, it doesn't matter, but there's gonna be some physical part to

526
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,360
it. I don't think the cartridge idea is so far fetched. We know that those little memory

527
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:46,320
cards, those tiny, tiny ass memory cards on the PlayStation Vita can hold up to 32 gigabytes,

528
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,520
and that Sony is charging way more than those cards are really worth. So in a couple years

529
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,200
time when the Xbox new is a reality, you could probably fit... How much can a Blu-ray hold

530
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,080
right now? Is it 20 gigs? It's like 50 some gigs. Is it even... Oh God, I thought it

531
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,900
was less. Well, because I was gonna say, you could probably hold more on a card than you

532
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,320
probably could. I mean, USB drives go higher. They're probably looking at something where

533
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,560
you can hold more on a card than you can on a disc. Well, that even might be... And to

534
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,560
be honest, I mean, that might be the reason why they're going that route is because they're

535
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,680
worried that they're gonna run into the same problem they do with the DVD-9 format where

536
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,080
they're gonna basically run out of disc space, and they're just thinking ahead saying, hey,

537
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:32,000
maybe we shouldn't do this because we wanna have some sort of support for whatever formats

538
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,520
that are larger than this because we don't wanna have to come out with a new console.

539
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,320
Dungeon Buster in our chat room says, Macross box.

540
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,880
It transforms into a Valkyrie and flies away with your money.

541
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,720
Pika Uno in a chat says, it's not the time for digital only yet. I'm kind of on board

542
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,700
with that. I think the Vita is a good sign of where we're at right now. Some people want

543
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,960
digital only, and certainly the publishers like it when we do that and they give incentives

544
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,960
to go that route, but I think there's still enough of America that isn't on super high

545
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,080
speed internet or has that type of bandwidth a month. I think sometimes in our big urban

546
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,120
areas, we live in a little bit of a bubble. Those of us that live there thinking everybody

547
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,000
has that type of connection, but they don't.

548
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,520
Can you imagine even, let's just say they do have a high speed connection. Say we have

549
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,640
cable. It's pretty fast, right? Can you imagine downloading a 50 gigabyte game? That would

550
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,960
take fucking forever. Oh, there you go. Five games or even a couple games and you hit your

551
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,200
bandwidth cap.

552
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,720
Even Mass Effect was six gigs and I was like, that's too much. I have that bandwidth cap

553
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,000
I have to think about and six gigs is gonna take several hours. I don't really wanna do

554
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,200
this. So it's not the time for digital only.

555
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,520
It's not. It's not gonna happen. And can you imagine, oh, hey, a game stuff. Yeah. You

556
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,240
know how we're we've been providing with products and stuff like that. We're not going to anymore.

557
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I'm sorry, but people aren't gonna just all of a sudden go, you know, hey, I'm gonna buy

558
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
it from Microsoft.

559
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,840
That's not Microsoft's fucking problem, nor is it something that Microsoft really I think

560
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,260
has to concern themselves with because let's face it, game stops are going to end up like

561
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,680
Blockbuster. It's a matter of time.

562
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,440
But it's just the thing with, well, Blockbuster is a whole other problem. It wasn't necessarily

563
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,480
that people weren't going to rent. It's just mismanaged. But, um, I think people are still

564
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,200
looking for physical stuff. I mean, that's why Redbox is doing so well. They're still

565
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
looking for this.

566
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,040
It's just, you know, it's more convenient now to go to a kiosk versus a store. Um, but

567
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,000
I still think people are looking for this. I mean, because they want to be, they want

568
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,320
to have the illusion that they own the product, even though, you know, license agreements

569
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
prevent that.

570
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,880
Great comment from chat too. Raginator in our chat room says, I don't care for digital

571
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,120
ever since Sony fucked me over with my videos. And we remember hearing about his plights

572
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,240
a few months ago during the call-in segments of the show is that some people have a severe

573
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,960
lack of trust with digital, you know, and I got to admit, if the new Xbox was announced

574
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,400
as digital only, I would have a slight hesitation.

575
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,020
At the end of the day, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but I would

576
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,460
want to know what's Microsoft, clearly Microsoft systems are not infallible to hacking. So

577
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,220
what, you know, how, how is my stuff going to be protected?

578
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,380
And also on top of that, I mean, if they put out, okay, if Microsoft said, we're going

579
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,020
to do only, we're going to do digital only and Sony said, we're going to do digital and

580
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,700
disc people are going to go with Sony. They're going to, they're going to buy a system that's

581
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,920
going to have physical media or medium. But yeah, I think though it's getting a lot more

582
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,680
convenient to purchase digitally, but it's not, there's a lot of factors into just convenience.

583
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,460
And unfortunately the publishers are not quite understanding yet.

584
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,840
Here's something to think about. I saw a great point to this on Twitter this week that I

585
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,140
would, I wouldn't have thought about right away, I must admit, but I thought it was just

586
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,000
a great argument for why this is definitely a possibility that the next Xbox may not have

587
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,340
any type of dis format at all. Because if X, you know, and even though everybody's rabble

588
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,180
rabbling about, you know, whether it would kill to use game market and dah, dah, dah,

589
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,820
dah, if they got rid of the disk drive and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, Xbox wouldn't be the

590
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,260
first person to do it. In fact, another company's done it. Another company's cut out the disk

591
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,700
drive completely and they have the most popular fucking computer in the world right now that

592
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:28,780
everybody wants. Who is it? Apple. Where's the disk drive on the iPad? Where is it? Had

593
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,540
didn't they even release a laptop that specifically doesn't have a disk drive in it? You have

594
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,100
to have some type of like airport hub in your home and people are eating it up. So if Xbox

595
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:45,060
went this direction, they would not be the first. Okay, hold on. Now you're comparing

596
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,980
the average gamer with a hipster and I'm sorry, it's just not going to work. You have to understand

597
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,500
that people, the people that buy Macs, okay, and I'm not talking about iPods, I'm talking

598
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:02,980
about Macs. It's all about seeing the PlayStation before it was mainstream. Okay. It's all about

599
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,180
it's like, well, I like the brushed metal finish on this system. It's so sleek and wonderful.

600
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:14,060
Oh, I don't care if it has only one USB port. I don't need those pesky USB ports. I only

601
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,040
value the Atari 2600 with the wood paneling finishes on the side. Don't bring me those

602
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,180
little plastic refurbs because they're not the real deal. I had a four controller system

603
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,060
before any of you did. Listen, the only reason they took out-

604
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,220
I have two Atari 5200s, hello. The only reason they took out the disk drive

605
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,900
is because they're like, we want to make the thinnest fucking laptop ever. And they did

606
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,940
it and then people are like, Oh my God, it's so thin, I'm going to buy it. Like it's a

607
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,060
fucking supermodel or something like that. And so they did. And then they're like, Hey,

608
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,580
I can't fucking install any software on it. And Apple's like, well, that's okay. Cause

609
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,420
no software is really supported by our system anyway. So, Oh, well you don't need to download

610
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,140
it. My Rob the robot is a hundred percent organic and gluten-free. Okay. I bought it

611
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,500
at Whole Foods. Thank you. To be honest, the Fairchild Channel F is totally underappreciated.

612
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,260
And you know what? Hey, if they're going to go the Apple route, why don't we charge $4,000

613
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,860
for the goddamn system? Because as long as it's sexy enough, people will buy it. Even

614
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:15,940
if it's, you know, performance wise, not quite inferior to the competition for the same price.

615
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,480
But Hey. Well, Duke Nukem Forever is five bucks.

616
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,580
And you know what? You know, the Japanese Sonic soundtrack is clearly superior to the

617
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:32,460
American one. And if we're, if we're talking about like, you know, devices with whole foods

618
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,220
anymore, I go to farmer's markets, you know, if we're talking about devices without, uh,

619
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,180
I just drive to Mexico. This drives and stuff like that and how well they worked out. Where's

620
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,780
the netbook nowadays? Oh, that's right. It's a format that failed. Yeah. I understand you

621
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,020
have one, but I'm talking about the format. I'm saying that the format itself failed.

622
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,380
They're not making them anymore. They're not making netbooks. They're not making netbooks

623
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:01,780
anymore. It's people like this drives. They're not making netbooks anymore. They are. Yeah.

624
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,340
They're the older ones that they're clearing out inventory on. There's no new netbooks

625
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:12,580
coming out. I like mine. And there's also the transformer, which Dan has, which is a

626
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,920
tablet and a netbook. And last I checked, most games out there are probably not a few

627
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,820
megs versus, you know, the typical application size, but whatever, you know, if you want,

628
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,260
if you want a system without a disk drive and you want it in a brushed metal, you know,

629
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,420
finish and you want it to be sleek and have a glowing Apple symbol on the back of it,

630
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,720
then fine. You go ahead and purchase yourself, you know, what disk drive list system and

631
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,180
don't come crying to me when you can't install anything on it. All right, look, one more

632
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,980
thing I want to say on the story and then we can move on. And that is the fact that

633
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,000
Microsoft was asked to comment on this by the gaming blogs is to be expected. What's

634
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,760
interesting about it is that they didn't 100% deny it. You know, you think you're going

635
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,380
to get the line that says Microsoft does not comment on rumors or speculation and the line,

636
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,000
right? But here's the actual quote. Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend its lifecycle,

637
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,260
like introducing the world to controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the

638
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,100
console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships. We are always thinking

639
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,900
about what is next for our platform and how to continue to defy the lifecycle convention.

640
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,960
Beyond that, we do not comment on rumors or speculation. So it's just PR spin and the

641
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,460
do not comment. It's, it's, it is a little weird to me. In a way it says to me, why are

642
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,780
you talking about the new Xbox? We're still extending the life of the Xbox 360. Stop focusing

643
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:43,500
on this new Xbox and our plans for it. There's plenty to go on the 360, but maybe, I don't

644
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:50,240
know, this is crazy, crazy tinfoil hat time. Ready? Maybe there's a new 360 coming out.

645
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,380
That's like the Microsoft version of the PSP go. You heard it here first on the orange

646
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,220
owned radio, throwing it out there, just throwing it out there. So maybe it's, well, maybe,

647
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,620
Oh God, here we go. Hold on. I just, all I want to say, but maybe the one mistake that

648
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:13,860
Microsoft won't make that Sony did that ruined the PSP go is that maybe the system is priced

649
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,980
right. All right, now, Loki, what's your witty retort? My witty retort is no one's going

650
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:29,040
to buy it. That's my witty retort is they're not going to do that. Only Sony makes those

651
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,260
stupid mistakes where they're like, Hey, yeah, we just announced the Vita. Oh, and we're

652
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,500
going to put out a new PSP. What? Why? Oh, and it's not going to have any sort of wifi

653
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:47,900
built in. What? Huh? All right, let's move on. I'm sure there's plenty more comments

654
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,440
we're going to hear on this. Uh, by the way, I did want to say though, uh, one thing I

655
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,220
forgot to tie this to the story that this ties into from five weeks ago, we may not

656
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,040
have been, you know, hearing about the, they are got rid of the disc, but we did hear the

657
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,380
rumor about they won't play used games. So I'm telling you, man, you know, I was over

658
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:14,380
in China the other day on the production line for the new Xbox and that leg was a good 20

659
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:20,140
feet long, 50 foot robot. I'm telling you, Xbox GFR. Yeah. Speaking about things that

660
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:29,500
are full of shit, mad dog McCree. Oh, poor guy. I hate that game. I'm going to tell you

661
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:39,180
a story about mad dog McCree. One day, one day, shut up. When I was working up serious,

662
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,580
I was working at cyber station and we had a mad dog McCree freaking hate that because

663
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:51,260
I had to clean that bitch. Did you have to watch grandpa's balls? Not as often as you

664
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:58,900
do. Did you have to polish his knobs? That has nothing to do with the game. So yeah.

665
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:05,540
Mad dog McCree. Rob is having a spasm right now. He's just laughing at the fact he said

666
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:13,780
balls. Thank God it's radio. He's all red in the face. It's kind of cute. Anyway, a

667
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,860
group called engine software is porting mad dog McCree to the 3DS. It's going to be released

668
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:28,900
on the eShop and scores of gamers across the world go, why? Because honestly, that game

669
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,300
was not very good. It had a sequel. How did that game get a sequel? It had it at Solomon's

670
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:40,860
that was by my college in Alabama. Is dragon's lair on the 3DS out yet? No, and why isn't

671
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,740
it? Because, you know, when I think of laser disc games immediately getting ported to everything

672
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:53,060
in the fucking universe, I think of dragon's lair. When I think of laser disc games, I

673
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,780
think your average consumer that has the 3DS probably doesn't know what a fucking laser

674
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:02,980
disc is, nor would be interested in mad dog McCree. I have one more question about mad

675
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,060
dog McCree on the 3DS. Dark Sakura, since you, you know, we're very familiar with mad

676
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,220
dog McCree and you know, you touch that machine in all its places. Was mad dog McCree in 3D?

677
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:20,940
No it wasn't. Why is it on the 3DS? Now I'm deaf in the other ear. Thank you. Okay. And

678
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:24,700
they said that they're not even going to port it over with any kind of 3D added into that.

679
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,100
And the quote is, and I'm going to read it. There's really no 3D in the 3DS version because

680
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:38,820
how are you going to do that? You know, it's funny. How are you going to do that is also

681
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:44,160
probably the answer to, um, we're going to need to sell this game. How are you going

682
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:52,900
to do that when no one gives a shit about this game? Seriously, that game is awful.

683
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,600
I guarantee you'll sell, you know, twice as many copies as you did the Wii version, which

684
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:07,140
is probably zero. But, but Loki two times zero is zero. Thank you for the math. If you

685
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,780
just put them together, it's infinity. You know how much it's going to cost? $4.99 in

686
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,820
U S dollars. You know how much you're overpaying by? $10. $4.99 U S dollars. They should pay

687
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:25,020
you to play it. I got to say on the Wii, it's available now, by the way, they were charging

688
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:30,420
like $19.99 for it. So the fact that it's only, you know, five bucks is still gouging

689
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,580
you. Just saying they should pay you. It's actually $15 overpriced because they should

690
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,940
be paying you $10 and one cent to play it for them. So they can say, Oh, people got

691
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:48,920
her game. The end. Listen, why didn't they just put tits in the game? Then people want

692
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,980
to buy it. True. Um, if you're interested in playing a game that has that kind of laser

693
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:00,980
disc vibe to it and even a Western theme, I recommend that you pick up Gun Stringer

694
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,300
with the DLC that was, you know, out there for it. What was that game? The time traveler

695
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,820
game that was on, um, laser disc that had the cowboy horrible hologram. I know that

696
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,980
was awful. I remember it in the arcades and it was a terrible game. I liked cliff technology

697
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,260
though because it was really Lupin and the castle of Cagliostro cause you could literally

698
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:30,340
touch that guy's balls. Lupin is coming back. Next story. We're not going to talk about

699
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:36,780
balls anymore. I think if you want, we know. Thank goodness. Um, so let's talk about last

700
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,780
week and last week we talked a little bit about, uh, Street Fighter cross Tekken and

701
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:47,560
all the, the screwy things that they're doing with the download content with this game.

702
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,600
For example, all the download content for the game is paid to unlock content, which

703
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:57,260
is fantastic. Also those wonderful PlayStation exclusive characters, aside from, okay, you

704
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,980
know, the guy from infamous cause it just wouldn't make sense that he was on 360 version

705
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:08,100
and also I believe, uh, the two, those two Japanese cats, um, everything else was also

706
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:14,060
on the disc. Now, Capcom insinuates, listen, listen, this is just to make sure there's

707
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,300
compatibility with, you know, the people that don't have the DLC so that, you know, when

708
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,580
you're playing them, um, online and stuff like that, that your character data is still

709
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:29,060
there and all that stuff. Okay, fine. That's the excuse you want to use, but at the same

710
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:34,220
time, then why are the beginning and ending movies there? And you know, all the data is

711
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,420
on a disc and I understand that you can use it for compatibility. Although Saints Row

712
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,880
the third, for example, they have compatibility patches. Um, and there's even like some other

713
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,060
games that have compatibility patches. So it's a free download if you don't buy the

714
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,900
DLC, but you can play against other people that have the DLC. That way everything works

715
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:57,780
just fine. Um, so you actually don't need to have everything on disc. Really the excuses,

716
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,300
you know, it's just an excuse. That's what it is. It's that they're selling you, you

717
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:12,060
know, was a half of the game or whatever beyond, uh, the cost of the actual disc, even though

718
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,340
all the content's on there. How's the game selling? I don't know. It's just been out

719
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,780
for weeks. Pretty good so far. I thought maybe you'd know from your, I mean, it seems to

720
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:24,520
be pretty good. I just haven't heard that. I don't hear people talking about it. Like

721
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,300
I did Street Fighter IV. Now granted, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm not to profess

722
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,740
that I am this fighting gang guru guy, but I don't hear as many people talking about

723
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:37,580
it nearly as I am talking, hearing, talking about Mass Effect or that we're talking about

724
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,420
Street Fighter IV when it came out. So it's just, I find that interesting. I'm just wondering

725
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,860
if there is a backlash occurring, yes or no, because I know I'm not going to buy it because

726
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,740
I, it's, it's not even so much the content on the disc thing, although I think that's

727
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,660
kind of skeezy. It's just the whole, there's going to be an ultimate edition at some point.

728
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:02,100
Yes, I know they're denying it. I don't believe them. Sorry. I don't believe them. Maybe I'm

729
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:08,140
being a fool, but I'm going to go off track. I could go off Capcom PR statement or I could

730
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:15,560
go off track record. PR, track record. I'm going with track record. Let's see. A Street

731
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,900
Fighter IV. Did that have some sort of game? Oh, wait. Yeah. Had a few. A Super Street

732
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:26,860
Fighter IV and then there's Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

733
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:34,860
They didn't even give it nine months. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Uh, yeah. So, anyways,

734
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:40,980
um, and then on top of that, this is, this is great. On top of that, the Xbox 360 version

735
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,300
has an issue with it. You can't take your local teams online. It's stated in the manual

736
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:55,340
that you can and the PS3 version can, but the 360, meh, just doesn't work. So, fantastic.

737
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,740
And their excuse is, well, the reason for that is the difference between, or the difference

738
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:05,780
is because of the architecture differences between Xbox Live, gamer tags, and PlayStation

739
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,300
Network IDs. I'm not sure of the technical details, but basically it amounts to Sony

740
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,060
made it so that you can mix and match online and offline. Microsoft made it so you can't.

741
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:21,140
However, Mortal Kombat allows you to do that just fine, so that's full of shit. Um, Halo

742
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,420
3 allowed you to do that too. How old is that game? But you used to be able to do split

743
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,700
screen and you could go on Xbox Live together. Yeah, and also you can do that in Borderlands.

744
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:40,340
You can do that in Call of Duty, I think. You can do that in quite a few things. But,

745
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:47,740
uh, sure. Whatever. Yeah. Um, okay. So real quick, I just want to talk about DLC because

746
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,780
it seems like there's a whole lot of issues. There's even one with, you know, I don't think

747
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,020
it's one of the stories you have about Mass Effect 3 and the DLC and stuff like that.

748
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,260
And I just, I think we need to set some ground rules on what I think should be acceptable

749
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,260
for DLC and what shouldn't as far as timing and that kind of stuff. All right. So let's

750
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:11,060
start off with pay to unlock content. I never think that that should be acceptable at all.

751
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:17,820
It's on disc. You're paying for it. The content was done before the disc was certified and

752
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,300
it's ready to go. So it's all ready. They planned it out so that you're going to have

753
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,340
to pay for additional con additional content for your game. It wasn't like, Hey, you know

754
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,020
what? This is cool. We thought, Hey, these characters aren't in the game. Let's go ahead

755
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,500
and add them and you can download them and add them to your game. So it's paid unlock

756
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:38,540
content. Uh, so that should never be acceptable. Day one DLC I think is fine because the reason

757
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:43,580
for that, for example, in the case of Mass Effect 3 game certified, you know, a month

758
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:49,060
or so ago, um, and during that time they were working on DLC, which they got done. It's

759
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,980
not on disc at all. It may use some assets from the game, but come on. I mean, if you're

760
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,180
using characters from the game, of course you're going to reuse some of that, but a

761
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:02,780
lot of it's brand new and uh, they put it out. Here's the thing. I might take shit for

762
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:07,300
this opinion, but F you. It's my opinion. I don't understand the logic that the people

763
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,880
that are hating on the Mass Effect DLC are using because the logic is you shouldn't charge

764
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,160
me for something that was being, or what is it that you shouldn't charge for something

765
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,540
that you were already making for the game before the game came out. Right. That's kind

766
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:25,760
of like the logic, right? Well, if that was true, shouldn't you have never bought Mass

767
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:34,660
Effect 1 or 2 because, you know, they were just leading up to Mass Effect 3? I mean,

768
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,900
kind of. Or, um, you should never have bought Saints Row 2 because you just get it for free

769
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,800
with Saints Row 3 on PlayStation. You should never have bought White Knight Chronicles

770
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,140
because you get the whole game free with White Knight Chronicles 2. White Knight Chronicles

771
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:51,580
was there for a shit game. Yeah. I mean, their, their logic is, okay, well you should delete

772
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,860
or delay it until you have all the download content out for the game and then you just

773
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,060
put it on disc. Well, they, they didn't do that. They actually just got it to the point

774
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,860
where the first batch of DLC just happened to be done a month or so after they certified

775
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:10,080
a disc and boom, it's day one download content. A lot of it, this, this is where I'm at. A

776
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,900
lot of it has to do with value. Is what you're paying for really worth what you're paying

777
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,940
for it? And even though I'm not to that point in the series yet and I haven't formed my

778
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,980
final opinion on Mass Effect, I'm pretty sure that for fans of Mass Effect, the on disc

779
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:30,400
experience presented with Mass Effect 3 is worth the price of admission. Going to Street

780
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,180
Fighter X Tekken, you know what, for a lot of hardcore fighting game fans and for, you

781
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,980
know, those individuals, the price of the stuff that's on the disc and even the unlocked

782
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:45,400
stuff is probably still worth it to them and I'm not going to knock that. But for me, everything

783
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,820
in that Street Fighter X Tekken has been devalued based on Capcom's history of how they treat

784
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:56,920
fighting games. Is what is on that disc worth $60? Not to me when I know in nine months

785
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:02,960
it'll be down to $40 with everything online included. That's the difference to me from

786
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
where I'm sitting.

787
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,160
Yeah, and if you, if you think that that game, by the time that all the DLC is released is

788
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:16,620
still going to be $60, you are sorely mistaken. That game is going to devalue pretty quick.

789
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,780
Especially if it doesn't sell very well. I mean, look at the last Dead Rising 2 game

790
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:27,760
that came out. I mean, off the record, didn't do that well and it's already marked down.

791
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,560
I think though, like, there's some companies that are just taking it too far. Like, even

792
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,900
with Vol, I don't even know if I, I wouldn't blame Volition because I don't think it's

793
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,240
the developer's fault. I think it's the publisher's fault, but let's look at Saints Row the Third.

794
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,400
Aside from the DLC that they actually have made separately and beyond, you know, that

795
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,800
you actually download, which is fucking terrible so far and it's really sad, everything else

796
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:57,640
has been paid to unlock content. Everything else. All the little costumes, all the little

797
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,240
special weapons, those are all paid to unlock content. It's all stuff that was on there.

798
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,840
Any of your pre-order bonuses, that's all paid to unlock content. Unless, unless of

799
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,080
course it's something that, okay, you get the first thing, a DLC that comes out a month

800
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,760
after the game comes out. And that's not, you know, paid to unlock content. But for

801
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,600
the most part, you know, those special weapons or skins or whatever, that's all on the disc.

802
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:27,120
And you're, you know, paying money, you know, to have that right, I guess. But it's kind

803
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,200
of sad though that they're like, you know, the publishers are getting mad, or not even

804
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,840
the publishers and developers, or maybe a little bit both, developers and publishers

805
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,760
are getting mad that people are complaining about, oh, well, you know what, too bad. This

806
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:47,720
is how we wanted to do it. Well then, that's not really, I mean, humor the consumer a little

807
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,860
bit. If you're playing on releasing these characters, say like, you know, these 12 characters

808
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:57,560
or whatever were, just don't put them on the disc. Just have it so you download them later

809
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,960
on. You would be doing the same thing, I don't know, I don't know as far as infrastructure

810
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,320
costs go, like if, you know, actually having more than just a key downloaded from Xbox

811
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,200
Live or something costs more to the publisher or the developer than it does just the key.

812
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:20,040
Okay, whatever. So say it's not. Just humor the consumer and don't put that data on the

813
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:25,400
disc. Just have it where you actually have to download the physical, you know, data for

814
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:31,280
those characters, all the movies, graphics, everything. And then that way people wouldn't

815
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,480
bitch about it and they'd be like, oh my god, this is a great value because look at all

816
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,480
these extra characters, Capcom supporting the game long after it's been out. This is

817
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,040
fantastic versus I'm getting fucking ripped off because all this stuff was on the disc

818
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,240
already. Notice, same thing, you're providing the same amount of content, but it's perception.

819
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,040
All right, let me jump in here because DarkSacker, I feel like you're dying to comment on this.

820
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:56,720
I'm just, I already said it in the chat room, so meh. I kind of don't care. I mean, really,

821
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:03,280
I don't because if, like for example, Street Fighter X Tekken, I'm gonna wait, you know,

822
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,520
the three months or so and see if they put out another one. If not, I'm gonna buy it

823
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,640
cheaper and then I don't have to look at, you know, shitty fake Mega Man.

824
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,960
So in other words, the DLC allows you to not get something you know is going to be shitty.

825
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,920
Exactly. I didn't give a shit about Jill or Shuma Garath as we call him slash her Shuma

826
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,840
Chan at home because I, all the characters I wanted to play were in the game. When Ultimate

827
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,880
came out, I was like, oh cool, we get sure to hear you. We have a new game.

828
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,920
I know this might be, I already know what the answer to this question is, but I'm gonna

829
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,880
ask it anyway. What would you think if you went online and then suddenly you're fighting

830
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,240
against someone else who's playing as the Mega Man you don't want to see?

831
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:49,400
DC. I'd seriously quit the match. Keep in mind, I'm the same person that if there is

832
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:56,480
one single troll in my dungeon run, I will leave party because I don't, my time is important

833
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,480
and I don't have to put up with shit I don't like. You know, I really, if I want a game,

834
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,080
I'm going to buy the game regardless of what's already on the desk. I don't really care.

835
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:11,360
All right. I'm going to try to wrap this up. Bobby is sending a link to the official DLC

836
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,360
response for Mass Effect 3. In a nutshell, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but

837
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,400
it's kind of what we already know is Bioware's approach to this is that, you know, they finished

838
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,560
Mass Effect 3 before they did the DLC, but in order to do DLC, you have to kind of put,

839
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,560
and this is the part that's kind of, you know, more information. You have to put the seeds

840
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,520
of the DLC in the game or you can't have the DLC interact with the game that's already

841
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,760
pressed on the disk. If that makes sense.

842
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,640
You have to have the code that's going to access the info.

843
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,880
And I don't think there's any problem with having an outline of, we know we want to do

844
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,960
this, this, and this later on. Kind of Saints Row clearly did the same thing as Mediocre's

845
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,640
content did. You know, they, they knew that they, what, what packs they were going to

846
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,880
do. In fact, didn't they advertise it from day one? The Gangsters in Space was going

847
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,160
to be an add on eventually.

848
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,920
It wasn't day one, but they had, they, there's, you know, obviously they were selling the

849
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,160
season passes, which I have a problem with season passes, but that's the same problem

850
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,640
as like paying money up front for, I don't know, whatever. It, I don't like season passes

851
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,800
either. I think it's stupid.

852
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,440
Nito, Nito comment from E3VL or Evil, I suppose, in our chat room. Whatever happened to unlocking

853
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,440
characters the traditional way?

854
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:22,440
It's not.

855
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,000
You can still do that in some games.

856
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,520
Some games.

857
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,640
It's not cost effective.

858
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,680
Probably not a Capcom game.

859
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,840
That is a, but that's a, that's a sad, I mean, it's a good question, but it's a sad question.

860
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,000
Because the modern gamer seriously doesn't really want to work for anything.

861
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,440
Hence why they'll put up the 99 cent unlock thing.

862
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,000
Exactly. Because it's instant gratification.

863
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,760
I'll tell you exactly why that's not unlocked in the traditional ways anymore. Because back

864
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,760
in the day when, you know, a lot of that stuff was unlocked traditionally is through playing

865
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,120
through the story mode. Nowadays, most gamers are split between single player and multiplayer.

866
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:02,400
And a lot of people are purchasing this game just to play multiplayer and they won't even

867
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,440
touch the single player. And so why make someone go through the single player when they're

868
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,840
not going to, you know, play it?

869
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,840
All right. Well, let's move on. Again, lots of opinions. And we look to hear yours at

870
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,600
mailbagorangelawnsradio.com. Some drama going on over in the UK with a retailer over there.

871
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,040
Now this isn't a retailer that exists here. So sometimes we forget about these guys, but

872
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,120
it's a store simply called Game. And I like that. I've never really seen the stores outside

873
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:33,520
of these little pictures, but it's just a big old building that says Game in the same

874
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,360
font as Game Boy.

875
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,000
Oh, a type nerd would pick up on that. I didn't pick up on that. Except they're kerning is

876
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,840
really tragic way. Well, it's going to say closed pretty soon on the top of it if things

877
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,560
keep going the way they're going, because apparently game is in trouble. Now game, we've

878
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:54,720
already heard of some trouble going on there. They didn't sell Mass Effect 3. It won their

879
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,480
street fighter cross Tekken. You can't get it at Game. That is not good when the retailer

880
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,200
will not sell the games people are looking for.

881
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,960
I know exactly what's going on here, because this exact same thing happened with Blockbuster.

882
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,040
What happened was is when they get into this financial problems where they're like facing

883
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:19,280
bankruptcy or I don't know if they've even filed bankruptcy yet or whatever, these publishers

884
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,840
are concerned about getting paid for their product. And so they don't extend them credit

885
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,640
any more. And so because of that, they're unable to purchase games. Where in the case

886
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,800
of Blockbuster, Blockbuster had to purchase games through a distributor and the distributor

887
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:42,700
basically covered, they floated them the credit, I guess, some way. And so basically they assume

888
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,320
all the risk for them. And unfortunately it sounds like that there's no UK distributor,

889
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,360
although I can't imagine that there's not UK distributors or maybe at least someone

890
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,720
that's not willing to float that kind of credit risk.

891
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:59,000
But that's what's going on here. That's why you're seeing certain publishers are not carrying

892
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,600
certain games and stuff. And I'm assuming it's going to be a lot of publishers if we're

893
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:08,920
talking EA, Ubisoft, I can't remember the other one, Capcom, Street Fighter Cross Tekken.

894
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,960
I'm not sure who the publishers are, because I know there's different publishers in the

895
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:18,360
UK. But I mean, if it's going to be, you're going to see it's going to be specific companies

896
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,000
and they're going to stop giving them credit. And that's why they're not carrying the games.

897
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,600
Well, just to further illustrate how serious this issue is, apparently Game is behind on

898
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,000
the rent. They have to pay some landlords in about two weeks. And if they don't, thousands

899
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,120
of jobs could be at risk. And that is obviously not going to be good news. Now, there is a

900
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,440
company that's kind of circling around like a hawk that might be picking these guys up

901
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:45,360
and that would be GameStop or as we call it here on Sunday nights at all games, Evil G.

902
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,280
GameStop particularly is interested in the Spanish arm of the business, apparently. And

903
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,800
I think this has to do with the fact that GameStop did try to do UK before, but they

904
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,720
closed some stores. But that doesn't necessarily mean they won't buy all of Game, it's just

905
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,360
Spanish is of particular interest, other countries, maybe.

906
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,800
They're just waiting for it to devalue enough and they'll swoop right in. I guarantee that

907
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,360
they'll probably buy it because it just makes sense that they're they're going to they're

908
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,560
not going to come out of this. I mean, yeah, this is this is kind of probably past that.

909
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,660
It's going to it's going to have to be someone buying them.

910
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:25,600
And Pete Caruno is in our chat room and I know he's from over there. The nice thing

911
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,880
is with the whole spring forward here, we did a little early. I think it's an hour early

912
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:36,160
for the folks overseas to tune into OLR live now. Pete Caruno says, I have 15, 15. I can't

913
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:39,880
see the pounds. Is it pounds? OK, because I can't see how it translates over here as

914
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,080
it comes up a special text. I have 15 pounds of vouchers with them. Need to spend it soon.

915
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,760
Yes, I would recommend if you have any sort of gift cards, the game, get those. Just buy

916
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,440
something, buy something, trade them in for cash if you can, if you can do that over there.

917
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,820
I know you can in California, but if it's a certain amount, but yeah, buy something

918
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,480
soon and it'll have to be an older game. Like Mass Effect one or something you've missed

919
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,840
out on in the past. There you go. All right. So, well, good luck game. You're going to

920
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,040
need it. DarkSakura? Bad game, no cookie. So there's some information out about Metal

921
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,880
Gear Solid HD Collection for the Vita. If anyone cares. Rob cares. So it's the Vita

922
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,480
version is going to have HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 with all

923
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,320
of the trophies and crap that the PS3 version does. They didn't say anything about Peace

924
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,080
Walker though. There is something that says they have a rebalanced user interface that's

925
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:45,600
going to go a little bit more with this transferring system that's being developed. What it's,

926
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,360
what the transferring is, is basically some type of cloud storage. It's called title user

927
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:57,920
storage, TUS, where your save game is going to transfer via whatever that cloud is and

928
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:07,480
you can access it on both PS3 and on Vita without using Wi-Fi. So that's how tiny the

929
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,360
gamer memory is because I completely forgot about transferring. Thank you for reminding

930
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:21,600
me. Well, the Japanese release date is June 28th. It's summer over here too. All right.

931
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,560
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner.

932
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:30,720
One other thing. You've got different things available with the touch panel. You have zooming

933
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:37,160
like with your binoculars on event scenes. You can close up in the cinematics. So kind

934
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,640
of working in those little features of the Vita. You know, make the Vita special. It's

935
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,040
kind of neat. So I thought I'd add that. All right. Release dates. Loki starting off here

936
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:52,320
locally in the US. Ah, yes. Um, let's start off with Silent Hill Downpour finally coming

Mario Party 9 came out. Yakuza Dead Souls on the PlayStation 3. GG. I don't know. Something

939
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:17,160
based off a toy with, it's like, I guess they have a toy that's hermit crabs. I don't know.

940
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:23,640
Every DS game. Um, Silverlicious based off a book series. That's also on the DS as well.

Uh, the foreign one action pack from South peak. It's a bunch of really terrible PlayStation

And that would be it. All right. Traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases

948
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:17,960

949
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,340
it's Japanese release. I don't know if that means all the dialogue has been redubbed with

950
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:28,120
Japanese voice actors. I would assume so. Um, but you know, there you go. SSX also coming

951
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,320
out in Japan this week on the three 60 going over to the PlayStation three. It's pretty

952
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,780
much the same story. Mass effect is there as well and as X, X S S X. But there are some

953
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:43,480
other games coming out as well. A resident evil five AE or biohazard five AE and revival

956
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:59,720
Shin Sengoku Musou online. Ryujin Rambo comes out this week and that is obviously it's an

957
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:05,080
online game. Is that dynasty warriors? I think it is. Yeah, it's dynasty warriors online

958
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,140
and it sounds like it's some type of expansion pack coming out for that on the PlayStation

959
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:14,200
three this week. Looking at the handhelds real quick. Let's check out the Vita on the

960
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,160

01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,400

982
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,520
Couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Oh, Loki, whatever

983
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,920
possible surprise news story could you be talking about next? Let's talk about the iPad.

984
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,600
Yes, I know. Shocker. There was a new iPad announced this week and it's called the new

985
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,120
iPad in case you hadn't heard. In case you hadn't heard, I'm full of lust. It was pretty

986
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,040
much all the rumored stuff except for the really weird stuff that they started remembering

987
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:51,560
this week. Um, it's got the, you know, the retina display. It's got the upgraded camera

988
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:59,040
that was, uh, in the iPhone four s quad core process or quad core, um, a five X processor

989
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:09,360
and a, also a, um, uh, what else? 4g connectivity. Uh, of course now everybody's phone is starting

990
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:14,120
to show 4g connectivity even though they're not 4g phones. If you're on AT&T it's because

991
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:18,440
of the multiple different types of 4g networks that existed and they're all being, um, solidified

992
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,800
into the one that I think Verizon uses. So, uh, those are out and of course it's gonna

993
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:29,000
range anywhere in price for the wifi version from four 99 to six 99 depending on how much

994
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,200
storage you want or for the four g six 29 through eight 29 and they will go on sale

995
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:44,560
this week, March 16th. Um, fantastic. Of course, you know, with this they got to, you know,

996
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,560
show the, Hey, Hey, we, we can do games. So, um, you know, they showed off a new infinity

997
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,680
blade game and flame infinity blade dungeons. That's a prequel to infinity blade and a look

998
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:02,400
kind of like God of war. Uh, and then also a flight SIM game called sky gamblers that

999
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:09,880
kind of looked like, um, ACE combat. And that was from Namco. Uh, unfortunately no buttons,

1000
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,640
still no buttons other than the, you know, the home button. And, uh, or unless you buy

1001
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,040
an Ikea, which isn't an official Apple product, so they don't talk about it. So, um, which

1002
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,320
was interesting because they made a claim, uh, that there was a claim during the press

1003
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,160
conference where they attacked essentially the three 16, the PlayStation three and said,

1004
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:33,580
this thing does more pixels at once than a millions, millions more pixels at once than

1005
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:38,000
a X-Box three 60 year PlayStation three, because the resolution is greater than 10 80 P 10

1006
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,480
80 means 10 80 by. And one of these suckers is what, 2000 something. Yeah, it was like

1007
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:49,600
29 something. But once again, graphics aren't everything. You can have a really beautiful

1008
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,840
game that controls like shit and it will be terrible. It's also how the developers utilize

1009
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,640
it. I mean, cause you know, you have to upper as everything or you have to make, you know,

1010
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,200
your games actually utilize that stuff in order for it to work out. Plus, you know,

1011
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,920
the hardware and the limitations there. I mean, I'm, I don't get me wrong. Those games

1012
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,840
are probably gonna look really nice, but do I really want a game that controls, you know,

1013
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,520
via tilts or, you know, touch screen and some of the touch screen stuff. I mean, infinity

1014
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:26,240
blade was all right, you know, with touch screen, but it's just, I don't know. Fine.

1015
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:32,560
You know, brag about your, your resolution of your screen, stuff like that. But at the

1016
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:37,560
same time also you gotta remember you do have some faults. There are people that are completely

1017
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:43,120
swayed by shiny. So, well, I'm not going to lie. I still kind of want one. I just, I don't

1018
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,680
feel like I need one right away at this point. But I mean, not even from a game standpoint,

1019
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,840
I'm just like, I want to watch movies in bed on that thing cause there's not going to be

1020
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,680
a better screen than that. But I have a Vita, you know, don't cry me a river. I'm going

1021
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,960
to be okay not having one of those day one. And see, I was actually already planning on

1022
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,800
getting one because I have a legitimate need of it for school. There's some really good

1023
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:07,320
note taking apps and that, well, they have the whole I university book thing now too.

1024
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,080
That's pretty cool. Yeah. Well, there's also an app that will let you type in your notes

1025
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,420
and it timestamps your notes in conjunction with where you started in the lecture while

1026
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:22,360
it records the lecture. And for me with my hand, that's perfect because then I can record

1027
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,040
my lecture and actually take notes and say this slide was used at this point or this

1028
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,500
and that and the other was used at that point, which I'm using my netbook already. Yes, I'm

1029
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:37,280
using my netbook, um, which does just fine. But for my hand problems, you know, typing

1030
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:43,680
on an iPad will be easier. So I'm actually, now that the new ones are, you know, there

1031
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,880
I'm going to get one. That's the plan. Anyway, I have a legitimate need for it. I'm buying

1032
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,840
it for school.

1033
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,560
Loki I probably don't even ask to ask you how you feel about the new iPad. And by the

1034
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,640
way, just to go back to our chat room and chat, that orange sounds ready.com Amiga 777

1035
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,040
says, really? That's actually going to be the real name. I thought that the article

1036
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,120
I read was going to be a joke. It's not that the name is the new iPad. That's not the name.

1037
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:15,900
The name is iPad. That's it. Just like I Mac, they don't differentiate between them or airbook

1038
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:20,780
or Mac mini. They don't differentiate between the different ones. It's just, it's the iPod

1039
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:27,160
or iPad flavor of the month. Fine. iPad third generation. Fair enough. I mean, how are you

1040
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,460
going to call it on your website? You're going to have, you know, uh, I think most people

1041
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:37,300
are going to call it iPad three or iPad HD. I would say iPad HD. I still know why they

1042
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,360
got to be all, uh, stubborn about it. Well, we're not going to put a number on it. You

1043
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,280
make it sound like we release these things every few years or something. I mean, what

1044
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:53,000
the hell? Because it's branding and marketing. End of story. They do it that way because

1045
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,200
they have to do it that way because they want people, when you think of iPad, they want

1046
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:04,520
you to think of the newest, best version of it that they have. I get it, but I feel bad

1047
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:09,800
for those that can't tell the difference because there will be people out there that buy iPad

1048
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,560
off Craigslist and get one of those first generation iPads, you know, which, you know,

1049
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,920
let the buyer beware. I know, I know, but I'm just saying, I feel a little bad for those

1050
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:24,400
people. I don't. If they didn't take the time to contact the seller and verify it, that's

1051
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:32,600
their fault. All right. One more story before the classic game of the week. Um, that is

1052
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,120
rock band. Yep. Still relevant. Nope. I'm not talking about rock band four. It's just

1053
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,200
that. And you know, I can admit this is, this is a really nice thing to hear. Harmonics

1054
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,400
has basically commented that rock band releases aren't stopping. One of the few things to

1055
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,240
come out of game developers conference 2012, a harmonic says, quote, we've been really

1056
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,000
pleased with the continued performance of rock band downloadable content. We've delivered

1057
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,040
over four years of weekly DLC and over 3,500 songs to the music platform. And we have no

1058
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:06,560
plans to stop weekly releases anytime soon. If there's a song you still want, rock band

1059
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,840
folks encourage you to go look at the Facebook app that they have and vote for artists on

1060
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:15,640
the wishlist. And this kind of makes me wonder if guitar heroes ever going to come back because

1061
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:20,720
how can you compete with that kind of a library? It's going to be difficult. Um, harmonics,

1062
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,640
by the way, also said they have no intentions of doing rock band for this year. They have

1063
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,240
some other projects going on right now. So maybe rock band is on the back burner until

1064
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,640
the next, you know, X-Box or playstations are being talked about and maybe some of those

1065
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:39,120
features being used. I'm strangely okay with this. You know, as much as I love rock band

1066
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,640
and would love to see a rock band for, I kind of get where, well, maybe there's not a whole

1067
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,200
lot else you can do with it. So the props to them for continuing to support the game

1068
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:55,800
with true DLC, you know what I mean? True, reasonably priced variety, varied, not on

1069
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:02,160
the disc DLC. Yeah. Now that is continuing. And when they say that they're going to support

1070
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:09,080
it weekly, they support it weekly and they continue to support it. Unlike some companies

1071
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:16,080
Konami. Hey, there was a third DLC pack for a party or what is it? Rhythm party this week.

1072
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:21,560
The Xbox three 60 game that everybody fan won't acknowledge exists. What weird songs

1073
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:27,920
do they have this time? Uh, Stacy Q, who I think did two of hearts years and years ago

1074
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:34,680
was one of the songs. And one of the, one of the chicks from sister sledge has a song.

1075
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:39,000
It's it's crazy. The obscurity of that stuff. That might've been the first DLC bundle. I

1076
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,920
can't remember. That was, I think that was the one you talked about. What was it? There's

1077
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:49,960
there's you look it up. I played it when it first came out and I already forgot. Sorry.

1078
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:56,000
But now a rhythm party. If you have all the DLC is up to like, no, no, it's funny. No.

1079
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,680
About 20 songs maybe starting to feel a little more like a full game. All right, but let's

1080
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:06,020
travel. Let's travel back to a day when there wasn't DLC, shall we? We're going to take

1081
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:12,760
a trip down memory lane to a time when games are simpler. Not in this case. It might still

1082
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:18,160
be a difficult game, but, uh, back before where there was this fancy schmancy cover

1083
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:23,360
and dialogue trees. This one had nine inch nails. Awesome. What is the classic game of

1084
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:30,360
the week? Quake. Yeah, seriously. If you guys, if Alan can do half life while I'm gone, but

1085
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:37,600
I can do quake. Um, quake is if you don't know what quake is and you need to get out

1086
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,480
from under the rock that you've been under for the last 20 years. Um, quake is a first

1087
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:49,800
person shooter game that came out by, um, the same people that gave us doom. Surprise,

1088
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,480
surprise. Um, and it spawned a whole series of games that actually came out on steam on

1089
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:01,240
August 3rd, 2007. Basically you have to go navigate through the level and you face enemies

1090
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:06,840
and you have to open doors and do different things. But when you start a level, you have

1091
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:13,120
three different pathways. It's an easy, medium and hard skill level. And to get to like the

1092
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:19,400
nightmare level, you have to, um, go into a secret passageway and stuff. So basically,

1093
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:25,160
um, you've got different episodes of about eight levels each and there's even a low gravity

1094
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:30,600
episode too. Um, but you collect all these different items and you carry them onto the

1095
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,440
next level and then the next level gets, you know, more challenging. When you die, you

1096
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:39,320
have to restart at the beginning of that level, but you can save your game as many times as

1097
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:44,520
you want. Um, you also do have multiplayer, like a death match. You've got, I think there

1098
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:50,120
was captured the flag. Yeah. But I mean, I really don't need to go into too much detail

1099
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:56,600
about the story of Quake because seriously, it's what happened with Quake. Who gives a

1100
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,680
fuck about the story? This is just about killing bitches. Pretty much. I mean, basically you

1101
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:08,320
have to stop an enemy named Quake. That's pretty much it. And it's sort of like a military

1102
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,880
operation that sends you through. It's like, it's like Doom. It's dark fantasy. So, um,

1103
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,920
but anyway, it's what happened with this game. I'm going to switch from the ambient noises

1104
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:30,040
to the actual music here. Yeah. Okay. It's pretty much what happened with this game after

1105
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:38,860
that. It was a VGA full color, uh, game. You know, there's an ASCII version of it. I actually

1106
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:44,360
did know that. There's an ASCII version of Quake. It's where the Quake engine went with

1107
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:52,920
this. That game engine has been in so many other games. Basically it's, um, it uses,

1108
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,440
it was polygon models instead of the sprites, you know, the way that Doom did it. You have

1109
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:03,720
full 3d level design, different light maps that are pre-rendered. You've got all kinds

1110
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:10,680
of abilities to modify it because there is a huge Quake modding, um, uh, community out

1111
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,760
there. I remember bringing up on the show, um, playing Gotcha Quake, which was Gotcha

1112
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,840
Mon Patch for Quake. That's why we have talked about this on the show before. I knew it came

1113
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,240
out before, but it's not just a classic movie. Did you know it was developed by John Carmack?

1114
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:29,880
I did know that. Yep. Um, also Michael Abrash and Johnny Cash as opposed to Johnny Cash

1115
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:36,680
who was dead. He wasn't at the time. What? And not his son either. And I was just thinking

1116
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:42,200
about, you know, the people that did the soundtrack. Johnny Cash was involved with the cover, but

1117
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:49,160
nevermind. Anyway, but if this was like pretty much the king of first person shooter games

1118
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:55,560
for the longest time, um, there, huh? I was gonna say, even I played the shit out of this

1119
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,400
game in college. We used to call, like this is back in, um, you know, when we had used

1120
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,560
modems to dial into everything, but my friends at Sonoma State had like one of those state

1121
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,760
of the art T one lines or whatever. So we'd all call into their server at Sonoma State.

1122
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:14,040
We play the fuck out of this game till like two in the morning. Yeah. So much fun. Multiplayers.

1123
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:21,000
I mean, well, basically when, um, the, uh, before there was even a demo, there was, uh,

1124
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,080
arcade software put out Q test, which is a February 24th, 1996. That was a tech demo

1125
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:33,760
that had three multiplayer maps. And basically it just lit a fire cause when Quake came out,

1126
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:40,360
there were servers everywhere popping up. I mean, just basically like you were saying,

1127
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:44,880
and uh, you know, there were people reskinning the textures, you know, reskinning the whole

1128
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:51,360
visuals, making new maps, you name it. That's what really came out. It's basically, um,

1129
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:58,400
scripted in, um, Quake C was I believe the, the code for it, the coding for it. And the

1130
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:05,120
first, um, Quake mod that came out was Team Fortress, which was capture the flag, but

1131
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:10,560
it had that class system basically. And we know where Team Fortress has gone since then.

1132
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,960
So there was also, um, three wave capture the flag. There was, uh, you know, I've actually

1133
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:23,480
seen where someone used, um, they did it first in Quake and then went and did it in Half

1134
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:31,200
Life where they redid the whole ending of, um, of, uh, Cube 2.

1135
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:38,760
Oh yeah. Yeah. But there were like different, uh, you know, they created different bots

1136
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:45,000
for it. There's Rocket Arena where, uh, you didn't have to really know the levels that

1137
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
well. It was really more of a matter of how you played it. There's people that do speed

1138
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,720
runs. Um, there's the big nickname Quake done quick. You remember that? There's also a second

1139
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:02,320
attempt that was called Quake done quicker that beat the game in 16 minutes, 35 seconds,

1140
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:07,200
which actually reduced it from three minutes from the original run. And I think that now

1141
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:14,320
they're down to it having been beaten in 12 minutes. So that's pretty good. So yeah, there's

1142
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:21,240
all kinds of different, it's, it's really blown up since then. Like, um, going to this,

1143
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:27,480
uh, image on here, that's basically the family tree of Quake games. We have on here coming

1144
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:34,760
from Quake, we have Quakeworld that spawned Twilight and more Quakeworld, Zquake, FTE,

1145
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:40,400
um, Doom 3 eventually came from, uh, Quake 3, which was built on Quake 2, built from,

1146
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:46,160
uh, the first Quake. So we've got, like, all of these different ones. Medal of Honor, um,

1147
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:55,400
Allied Assault. We have, uh, STV Elite Forces 2 on the list. We have Paintball. Jedi Academy.

1148
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:01,440
There's all kinds of games on here that run off of variants of the original Quake engine.

1149
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:08,120
So basically your first person shooters are what they are today because of Quake. Just

1150
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:16,760
saying. And also you can play it on, um, the Amiga. God, that's how old this game was.

1151
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:22,000
It actually runs on an Amiga. There's a port for it on the Amiga. The ports I really need

1152
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,720
to get into. Well, they made the source cord pub or source code. So source code public

1153
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:33,440
some time ago, right? Yes. Um, the Commodore Amiga port was done in 1998 by ClickBoom.

1154
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,280
And then, but it's only available in 68K. Uh, there was a Linux version that was made

1155
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:44,280
by an id software employee. Of course there was a Linux version. For fun, in a spare time.

1156
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,800
And then in 1999 there's a retail version, um, for Linux that was put out by, uh, Macmillan

1157
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:55,980
Digital. There also had two add-ons, which was the offering for Linux. So there's a Mac

1158
01:33:55,980 --> 01:34:01,720
version now that was done by Macsoft. Um, there's Sega, it came out on Sega Saturn,

1159
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:07,120
Nintendo 64. There are all kinds of versions. There's Nintendo DS versions of Quake. There's

1160
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:12,800
Quake DS and SeaQuake. So you name it, you can play Quake on it probably. You probably

1161
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:19,200
play Quake on a toaster. So that's it. There it is, your classic game of the week. A true,

1162
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:25,960
true classic indeed. Quake. I remember playing Quake 3 on the Dreamcast with our ethernet

1163
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,040
adapter. Quake 3 was amazing. And you know what, if you want to just, like, play Quake

1164
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:35,460
inspired games, go play Quake Live, because that's basically Quake 3. And even though

1165
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:40,000
there's lots of differences between Quake 1 and Quake 3, eh, it's still a good time.

1166
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,320
ASCII Quake. ASCII Quake is just funny. Yeah, it's funny for like two seconds. Alright.

1167
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,560
Then you're like, this is annoying. Escape. This makes my eyes hurt. Ow. Alright, uh,

1168
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,680
that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Launch Radio, but we have plenty more to come. Don't

1169
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,800
go anywhere. Don't stop your iPods. Don't turn off your live stream of all games, because

1170
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:02,120
we got plenty more to come. Rapid Fire News, Fugal Question, Mailbag, FUs, your calls,

1171
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:13,360
more news when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio. Welcome back everybody to Orange

1172
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:18,020
Launch Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. We are live here with episode number

1173
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:22,820
449 of our show at All Games Radio. Hope you guys are joining us live. If you've never

1174
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:26,080
listened live before, you really should join us sometime. We got a very full chat tonight.

1175
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:30,000
Just want to give a shout out to all of our chatters. Some folks talking about the music

1176
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,640
we played on Break. Obviously we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast. There's

1177
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:38,100
like laws and stuff. We would like to continue to deliver our podcast. But we had music from

1178
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,600
Street Fighter and we had music from Tekken, because I was doing a little joke there, Street

1179
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:47,280
Fighter and Tekken. And some folks are talking about kind of, you know, what songs, what

1180
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:52,680
stage music they prefer, or what character. In the case of Act Deft in our chatroom says,

1181
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:57,440
Cami greater than Chun Li. That's just cause she shows her butt. If you do, if you win

1182
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,040
with a special move, doesn't she show her butt? Okay, I have to tell you where that

1183
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:09,140
came from. What? Dan's little brother. It was a friend of ours son was saying, whenever

1184
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:14,560
Cami does her wind pose and turns around, she goes, look at my butt. That's what he

1185
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:21,300
would say. Loki? I was going to make the argument that is because she was, she's not American

1186
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,920
though. So I can't make that argument, but I thought that they're drawing some sort of

1187
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:30,360
a comparison to soundtracks of a certain other game and one being superior to the other,

1188
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:38,520
you know, the non Japanese being superior. Stop it right now. Stop it. All right. But,

1189
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:44,320
but, but to be fair, UK and Japanese have the same soundtrack. So hot. Ikuma JP says,

1190
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:48,940
I don't use female characters in any game. I think that, I think that's just Street Fighter

1191
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:52,840
he's talking about. But I noticed in fighting games that the female characters tend to be

1192
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,800
like the ones that are quick and agile. You know, I know that's kind of stereotype, but

1193
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,840
that's how I use almost all female characters. Me too. Like accepting King of Fighters where

1194
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:05,000
they all look androgynous. I used to be a pretty good Chun Li player like back in the

1195
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:12,240
day. I want a very non agile, large female character. They probably do exist. I'm like

1196
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,460
trying to think you'd probably have to go to like the Neo Geo series. The only character

1197
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,720
that I can think of in the Street Fighter series that's female and sizable would be

1198
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:31,080
Elena and her legs. Mm hmm. Um, there's also, um, no, I can't think of one. Um, but I know

1199
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:37,080
that there's male characters that are, you know, like a Vega. If you want to do Street

1200
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:42,360
Fighter, one thing of the sizable male characters, like what was this? Well, that's what I'm

1201
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:46,960
saying. We need a large, sassy black woman as like you do. Uh, I was trying to think

1202
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,520
of one exit. Well, you can, you can create to your heart's content and soul caliber,

1203
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,800
which I was thinking Ivy doesn't exactly, of course, nothing in soul caliber is really

1204
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,320
agile. I mean, it's sort of caliber is kind of a different style of fighting. I guess

1205
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,440
that's not true. Some would say like Voldo is like an agile type of character, but Voldo

1206
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:08,160
is also into bondage and shows off his package regularly. Not that there's anything wrong

1207
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:12,840
with that. All right. Now let's move on. We've got to get back into some gaming news. Uh,

1208
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,360
we still have a lot of room to go here before we get to your calls later on in the show.

1209
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,480
So Loki, how about some news? All right, let's talk about the new Sim city. They showed it

1210
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:27,880
off at GDC and uh, it looks pretty, it's not scheduled to come out until 2013. Um, and

1211
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:32,920
it will be on PC, but it looks like they've really amped up the detail, everything, you

1212
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:37,800
know, from actually seeing the individual cars driving around to the way, how much control

1213
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,280
you have over. It's just ridiculous. The amount of control, but a pretty awesome looking and

1214
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:49,760
we'll run on in this new glass box engine, uh, which like I said, it's really, really

1215
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:58,200
detailed. Um, yeah, so very cool looking game. Sorry. This has nothing to do with Sim city,

1216
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:03,240
but my mind is still suck stuck on the whole, uh, you want to like large sassy lady in a

1217
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:08,000
fighting game. And my mind for some reason instantly went to Latrice Royale from RuPaul's

1218
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,320
drag race. And that made me think, wouldn't RuPaul's drag race make the best fighting

1219
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:18,640
game ever? That would be great. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. No,

1220
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:27,160
really your life. I was thinking that Oprah should be downloadable. Then he could have,

1221
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,960
you know, Sharon needles with her party city attack. It'd be great. Anyway, there's like

1222
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,400
two people listening that'll get that joke. Oh yeah. I actually know who Sharon needles

1223
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:42,040
is. Sim city. Yeah. Um, remember the old games? Yeah. Old Sim city games were hilarious. Did

1224
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:48,880
you ever play the Sim city game that was on the PC on CD rom? Like they had a not, I'm

1225
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,080
not talking about the first computer one cause obviously the old school one, I think a lot

1226
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,480
of us have played cause there's a port of it on super Nintendo, but there's one on CD

1227
01:39:55,480 --> 01:40:02,160
that had like it hoard the full motion video and there was some bad video. Did you ever

1228
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:07,780
play it? I did not play that one. The first Sim city game I played was on five and a quarter

1229
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:13,560
floppies that uh, was in black and white. Well, the monitor I had was in black and white,

1230
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:19,480
but a really old Sim city. Then I played some city 2000 a little bit. I didn't really care

1231
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:24,240
for it too much. I was like, whoa, this is way more complicated than Sim city. So this

1232
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:28,240
game is like, I didn't like the minute I was like, wait, I have to build like piping and

1233
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:32,760
shit too. Yeah, no. Yeah. That's this game. The manager, sewer systems. I'm like, I just

1234
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:39,560
want to build buildings and have Godzilla attack them. I saw the most scary thing ever,

1235
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:45,800
ever for Sim city. What's that was this guy who basically created the most efficient city

1236
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:52,760
in Sim city with 6 million people and fully functioning everything. But the thing that

1237
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:58,320
he sacrificed was longevity of the people. So he had them dying off at like 50, but his

1238
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:05,520
city was the most efficient and he spent four years making it. Wow. That's frightening forever.

1239
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:11,880
And he's got himself exactly. It's the forever alone guy. He plays Sim city, but seriously,

1240
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:15,720
there's like a YouTube on there of him bragging about his shit with this epic music and all

1241
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:19,880
I can think of. That's so sad. Speaking of YouTube, I've got to play this for you guys

1242
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,880
since you haven't seen it. This is one of the great cut scenes from that Sim city PC.

1243
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,680
Remember when everything had to have full motion video? Yes. So this was like that period

1244
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,320
where like every adventure you've had. Okay. Here's, here's a great cut scene back from

1245
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:39,200
the Sim city days. So this is like one of the action news sequences that would chime

1246
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:49,280
into your game when things happen. Check out that 1994 rendering. Finally in the new 90

1247
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:54,800
year old Yancy Kornblatt was arrested last night for flashing for the 79th time. Kornblatt

1248
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:02,360
told the court that he was going to retire, but decided to stick it out one more year.

1249
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:06,280
We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the Sim

1250
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:12,480
city nuclear power plant. Plant may reach critical mass at any moment and explode above

1251
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:19,480
do not panic. Repeat, do not panic. Stay calm. Even though radiation may fear or flash internals

1252
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:25,520
always just listening slices of human spam. Everything will be just peachy. Do not panic.

1253
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:32,220
And the Oscar goes to, I don't know the pun. Horribly bad lipstick. Basic ass bitch from

1254
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:41,200
Sim city action news. We should do a, where are they now? I would like to know what happened

1255
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:46,560
here. Mocap or it was a full motion video actors and actresses. Where are they now?

1256
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:56,160
I would love that as a segment. Oh my God. Dana Plato dead. I couldn't help it. Actually.

1257
01:42:56,160 --> 01:43:00,080
I don't know that that might not be that different. We should try that. That'd be kind of fucking

1258
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,560
down with that. That is like, I'm sorry. The first thing that popped in my head was night

1259
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:14,640
trap. I was like, Tina Plato, dad, Jamie shame on you. That would be kind of funny. I'm all

1260
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,040
down for that. I would like to know what happened to Sim city action news lady. Some of these

1261
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:21,920
people might actually be famous for all we know. I don't think she is, but here's the

1262
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,520
thing. I'm not, I'm not doing this to harp on her acting skills or whatever. Cause let's

1263
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,480
face it, we all got to get work somewhere and you know, moving from community theater.

1264
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:34,520
She's been in one, one more game than I have. Right. More people have seen her than listen

1265
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:39,600
to this podcast. I'm sure of that. But look, uh, my point is that stuff would just cut

1266
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,640
right into the middle of your game when you were playing Sim city, like you'd be doing

1267
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,520
your thing, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. And then all of a sudden that fucking full

1268
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:53,520
motion video would come in. God damn it. I'm trying to play a game. Oh yeah. Sim city five.

1269
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:59,160
Hope it doesn't suck. I don't think Sim city woman's going to be in it though. Oh, thank

1270
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:05,160
God. You should do that. They're just, what? That doesn't make any sense. Stan in the chat

1271
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,760
room says she's probably selling insurance now. Hey, wait a minute. I work in insurance.

1272
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:15,340
You better watch it buddy. What are you talking about? All right, moving on. Oh, poor, poor

1273
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:23,760
Dana Plato. Oh, is it my turn? No, it's Loki's. Loki's done one story. rapid fire news. Hey,

1274
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:29,120
we were talking about Sim city. Okay. It's important. I promise to be fair. I'm going

1275
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,960
to be fast. Uh, the next one, uh, would be a sorcery. Finally has a date and you know,

1276
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,240
Hey, they talked about it during E3 is a big thing. And then it went poof, disappeared

1277
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:44,200
and just delays, delay, delay. So now the PlayStation move game will be out on May 22nd.

1278
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:51,080
Looks kind of neat. Um, so yeah, May 22nd. And then finally diabolical pitch, which is

1279
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:59,280
the really strange, uh, crossing between grasshopper manufacturer and connect and also zombies

1280
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:06,080
and baseball. Um, that game will be out April 4th and man, what a weird fucking game that

1281
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:13,400
is, but, uh, that'll be out on Xbox live arcade. Um, and yes, it's a really weird fucking game,

1282
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:17,920
but would you have it any other way with grasshopper manufacturer? I'm okay with weird. Yeah. So

1283
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:24,040
throwing baseballs at zombies. So with connect, good time. Yeah. All right. Well, this isn't

1284
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,600
as cool as a connect zombies and all that stuff, but, um, it's a game that a lot of

1285
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,560
people are looking forward to and a huge change apparently announced this week. Diablo three.

1286
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,520
Hello. PC game. You might've heard of it coming out soon. Cause the, you know, Diablo two

1287
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:44,400
sold billions of copies. Uh, PVP has been taken out for now, which might lend a hint

1288
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:48,100
as to what the holdup is with this game. We've been talking about it here. I know I've been

1289
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,440
talking about it all the time on a hoard house. This game has been delayed, delayed, delayed.

1290
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:57,360
Well, no Blizzard game has ever truly delayed cause they don't, you know, but let's be real.

1291
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:01,120
The beta has been out forever, so it seems like the game is done. So the question has

1292
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:05,480
been, what's the holdup? Well, it might've been PVP because this official press release

1293
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:10,120
came out on Blizzard site that basically says, um, you know, we're counting down the days

1294
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:14,200
getting ready to announce this release date. We have come to realize that PVP is not up

1295
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:20,000
to the standards. We will release it in a patch following the game's launch to which

1296
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,280
a lot of people kind of roll their eyes and go, uh, patching in the content after the

1297
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:30,280
game. But let's be fair. PC games kind of do this anyway a lot and something as robust

1298
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:33,800
as PVP and they're not going to charge the extra for it. I think it's okay if they're

1299
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:38,080
going to do that. PVP wasn't really in Diablo two, so it was something new to Diablo three.

1300
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,440
So whereas I'm sure some folks will be disappointed if it'll get the damn game out already, then

1301
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:47,480
I'm okay with this taking a little bit of a break. So they do say that when PVP does

1302
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:54,520
come out multiple arena maps, theme locations and so forth, it wasn't in the beta. So I

1303
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:58,720
guess it's not that surprising that PVP is getting cut out. So hopefully your release

1304
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:02,960
date for Diablo before too long. Uh, hopefully your release date soon for this game too,

1305
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:07,600
because I know the screenshots that came out for it this week have me very excited as I'm

1306
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,680
sure a lot of you and that is Kingdom Hearts 3D or Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance.

1307
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:18,920
Get it? Well, some of the screenshots came out this week that show Sora in Tron World.

1308
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:24,160
Looks very sexy. Uh, there's a Sora with a little identity disc there. There's a little

1309
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:28,960
picture here that you can actually see. You can see Korra and you can see, um, you know,

1310
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,360
Jeff Bridges character and I'm assuming that's his son. Although it doesn't really look like

1311
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:39,320
him. No it is. Sam, son of Flynn. It's supposed, yeah, I know it's Sam. And Riku? The other

1312
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:43,680
two kind of, kind of at least look like him. Is that Riku? No, I think that's Sora. I thought

1313
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:47,680
it was Riku. Cause I couldn't see his poofy hair. Yeah, well it's in the hat. Uh, by the

1314
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:52,680
way, Jeff Bridges confirmed for the game. That's awesome. That is very awesome. So.

1315
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:57,320
I love Jeff Bridges. I know, it's great that he will do that and it's great that, you know,

1316
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:01,160
those Kingdom Hearts game, man, they don't fuck around with the voice actors. No, they

1317
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:05,600
don't. And I know the first one got a lot of shit for Lance Bass as Sephiroth, but let's

1318
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,200
be real. I mean, you know, that was during the height of his, like in sync and all that

1319
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:14,240
stuff. So to get him to voice a video game, no matter what character it was, was kind

1320
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:18,040
of a big deal. And a lot of the voice, just the voice I can cast in all those games is

1321
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:23,640
phenomenal. So it looks like they are sparing no expense with Kingdom Hearts 3D. I would

1322
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:28,580
love to see a Kingdom Hearts 3 on consoles already, but I'll take this to hold me over.

1323
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:34,460
One other, uh, quick story here about Dead or Alive 5. Dead or Alive 5 has a new character

1324
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:38,960
on the roster. Might be familiar if you've ever played a little game called Virtua Fighter.

1325
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:44,760
Akira Yuki will be in the next Dead or Alive game. There you go. So if you're a Virtua

1326
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:49,480
Fighter fan. I'm not. Worlds are colliding. I wasn't really either, but there you go.

1327
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:54,920
All right. You know, my husband liked it and I was like, the only time I ever played any

1328
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:59,040
version of that game for like any period of time was because I was trying to knock off

1329
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:09,120
Kage's mask in Virtua Fighter 2. All right. So my turn, huh? Yep. Well, how about some

1330
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:15,080
stuff from Nimblebit? There is a new work in progress called Pocket Planes that, uh,

1331
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:21,880
it looks just like a tiny tower, but it's with airplanes and you basically stuff people

1332
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,400
into airplanes and you make bigger and bigger airplanes and you take them all over the world.

1333
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:30,680
That sounds like fun, doesn't it? I want that game. I like everything that Nimblebit does.

1334
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:37,760
And then Assassin's Creed 3 will be on the Wii U and there is a trailer out. And, uh,

1335
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,200
isn't this the one that's like the Native American one that's taking place during the

1336
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:47,400
American Revolution? I do believe it is. So yeah, it actually has, uh, big battles that

1337
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:52,760
are going on, including the, uh, Continental Army versus the British Army, all kinds of

1338
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:58,960
cool stuff. You know, actually I have to tell you something. Assassin's Creed came up in

1339
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:04,960
my Renaissance history class, my Renaissance art history class, because apparently it is,

1340
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:11,000
it shows, um, the towns so realistically that my teacher was able to use the models in the

1341
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,040
game to show us the Palazzo and all kinds of different places in Venice. I thought I

1342
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:23,200
would mention that. So she was able to walk her daughter through different parts of the

1343
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:27,640
places in the game because she knew of them from, you know, through art history. I thought

1344
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:34,200
it was pretty cool. So anyway, also Just Dance Propel. Yay. So you can drink your Propel

1345
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:41,440
while you drink, while you play. Is it really tie into the drink Propel or is that just

1346
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:47,480
the name? Speculation. I see. It's, I think it's just a clever name, but yeah. But hey

1347
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:51,920
yo dog, I heard you like Propel so you can play Propel while you drink Propel and Propel

1348
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,160
your head through the screen. Old meme is old. I know, but it's still funny sometimes.

1349
01:50:56,160 --> 01:51:05,880
Okay, I'm done. Real quick. Yeah. Now this might be a coincidence, but I was looking

1350
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:14,760
for the actress that played... I was just about to say the chatters found something

1351
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:18,260
on that, but go ahead. We'll see what you got first. Stephanie Fargo is the actress

1352
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:24,160
that did that. Funny enough, search for Stephanie Fargo on Facebook. You don't get Stephanie

1353
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:33,260
Fargo. You do, however, get Stephanie, I believe it's Goats, who happens to be a news reporter.

1354
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:38,880
Is that a coincidence or what? She's also blonde. It could be the one. She could have

1355
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:46,340
actually turned this into a career. I'm not saying that this is the person because there's

1356
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:53,280
very little go on because you know, IMDB and stuff, but man, that would be a coincidence.

1357
01:51:53,280 --> 01:52:01,420
OLR me. Bring me Stephanie Fargo. I has questions. And she looks like age wise that it could,

1358
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:08,440
it could be show me cause I can't find her. Like you've got it. Stephanie Fargo's photos,

1359
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:13,480
address, phone, email. See, look, I did a search for Stephanie Fargo. You shouldn't

1360
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:17,680
encourage people to stalk like this. This is, this is borderline. Like I got a bunch

1361
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:24,280
of, you know, but I was like news anchor reporter. Really? Wow. I mean that would be a coincidence.

1362
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:29,520
I'm don't get me wrong. I don't know. It doesn't really look like her to me. It's hard to say

1363
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,400
because I mean that that's like the nineties hair. Well, SSU 100. Matt was the chatter

1364
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:38,660
that said the wind said step. Stephanie Fargo is the SimCity news hiker. Her IMDB says that

1365
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:43,560
she's only been in SimCity, but that's IMDB. I mean, I was like, you all have problems.

1366
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:54,120
Stop stocking these poor, poor full motion actors. Oh my God, you guys. All right, let's

1367
01:52:54,120 --> 01:53:01,200
go to the foogle question of the week. Every week we ask you guys a question on the Facebook

1368
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:05,640
and the Google plus you put them together. It's foogle, uh, Facebook, Google question

1369
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:09,820
of the week. With the recent announcement of the new iPad, the statement was made by

1370
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:14,400
Apple that the resolution of the device was greater than the PlayStation three or Xbox

1371
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:19,480
three 60 experience. Do you consider the iPad a gaming device for the core gamer? Why or

1372
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:23,040
why not? I think we've kind of said our piece on this. Let's go to some of the answers.

1373
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:27,280
There was a lot of answers. I can't read them all, but I'm going to read some of these.

1374
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:32,880
Um, let's see. Jennifer J says to be completely honest, I don't see it as much of a gaming

1375
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,440
machine. I mean, sure there are games made for it and whatnot, but I really don't see

1376
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,360
it going anywhere. But then again, I might be wrong. Uh, John K says, not really. While

1377
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,600
there are some amusing games that one can play on it, the lack of physical controls

1378
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:49,280
holds it back from a solid gaming experience. I've yet to play anything on the iPad on the

1379
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:55,520
level of an uncharted Arkham city, Final Fantasy 13, et cetera. Uh, Jim H says not for core

1380
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:00,400
gamers. They'll always want a deeper experience. However, it's a gaming machine of a different

1381
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:04,240
sort. I think you're going to see that Nintendo and Sony's newer portable consoles aren't

1382
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:08,960
going to sell like past incarnations because Apple and Android have all the casual pickup

1383
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,880
and play gamers locked up. I think there's a story on that coming up in a minute here.

1384
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:18,400
Uh, Hunter R says, first of all, the resolution claim is contingent on the apps that run on

1385
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:25,120
the iPad. Remember the PS3 can do 1080p, but how many games actually run at that resolution?

1386
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:29,240
As far as the iPad being a gaming device, I don't buy it. I don't play many games on

1387
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,240
my iPad and the games I do play are mainly board and card games. This is mostly due to

1388
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:37,400
the control scheme. Having my fingers get in the way of the display is a problem for

1389
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:42,920
most games, but is not a problem for boarding card games. Also, I use my iPad more to watch

1390
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:46,660
videos, use Twitter, check my email, read online articles and type up long rambling

1391
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:52,300
passages that may or may not be interesting, such as this one. Uh, let's see. Uh, Katsu

1392
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:57,320
Hiko J says, uh, for a pickup and go experience. Yes. You can say the full name on that one.

1393
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:02,880
It's a anime character. I always say first in the lesson at OTA. For a pickup and go

1394
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,640
experience. Yes. For a sit down and play for hours experience. Probably not. That is decided

1395
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:12,240
by the game, whether it's tiny tower or grand theft auto. Realistically, I can see myself

1396
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:16,280
playing tiny tower for two to three minutes and be satisfied. There's no way I can play

1397
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:22,640
it for many hours straight, not even 30 minutes. It won't replace your PS3 or your 360. I kind

1398
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:27,000
of like that compare or that kind of calling it out like that because that's a lot of what

1399
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:33,480
I see in iOS gaming versus, you know, playing on the consoles. It's really about that time

1400
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:38,440
investment. There's a lot of games that just take like seconds. Uh, last one from Facebook

1401
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:42,940
here. Mike B says if they put Xbox live on the iPad, it would be a winner. So you could

1402
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:46,800
play the games you have downloaded on Xbox live. It would be fun to play. Bejeweled was

1403
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:54,260
my friends or some gears of war. I love the thinking, but you have to be living in a fantasy

1404
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:59,560
world for Microsoft to suddenly get along with the Apple devices like that. Um, but

1405
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:03,080
why aren't we seeing that type of stuff with the windows phones? I guess. Well, I guess

1406
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:06,560
we are a little bit. I mean, there is Xbox live stuff on there and I think you can even

1407
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:10,320
go so far as to earn some achievement points. I don't know about the whole cross platform

1408
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:15,240
playing, but if the Vita can interface with the PC, I mean anything else is just a matter

1409
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:21,600
of time, I'm sure. So, but as far as gears of war, that might be a bit much, but jeweled

1410
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:27,000
you'd think will be easy though. I think I might've found Ms. Fargo. You guys are stalkers.

1411
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,800
What's wrong with you guys? The one, the one I found it wasn't her because it just happened

1412
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:38,400
that since I searched for Fargo, it was a news anchor in Fargo. So that's not, I see.

1413
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,800
What did you owner Stephanie Fargo, a gorgeous Amazonian, former actress with an uproarious

1414
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:49,280
laugh. I found that article. Yeah, it's a revolution fitness. So she's a fitness instructor

1415
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:55,400
now. That might be her. She didn't look Amazonian in the, uh, the video there. She was also

1416
01:56:55,400 --> 01:57:01,960
sitting down. She might've bulked up if she took a fitness instructor role. Anyhow, can

1417
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,360
I, can I go to the Googles? Can I go to the Googles? Cause they're actually my favorite

1418
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:10,760
response out of all of them was on Google plus Stephanie powers. So let me get to Google

1419
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:14,880
plus, um, our page on Google plus you can find by searching for orange launch radio.

1420
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,240
Let me read a couple of these here. Uh, Carlos M says, definitely I do more gaming on my

1421
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:24,160
zoom tablet than on my PS three and we combined and my Xbox beats it just because of dragon

1422
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:28,400
age having sampled the world of goo need for speed and dead space for the tablet format.

1423
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:32,680
I can certainly vouch for the quality of games, not only graphics wise, but also on their

1424
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:37,960
entertainment value. Now, if they'd, if only they'd release a final fantasy or BioWare

1425
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:42,880
RPG there. Well, to be fair, I just want to get this out there. There are some really

1426
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:49,320
good final fantasy ports, um, on iPhone, which would be the final fantasy one, two and three.

1427
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:54,800
And I believe three has an iPad version too. Uh, and then there's, I think tactics to mass

1428
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,000
effect supposedly has a spinoff game that's on iOS, but my friends that are like obsessed

1429
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,680
with mass effect tell me it stinks and Loki's given the thumbs down too. Here's my favorite

1430
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:12,160
comment of them all from Derek H. The iPad is a gaming device. Just like a picture of

1431
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:18,240
B Arthur is a contraceptive. It'll work in an emergency, but it should never be your

1432
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:27,400
first choice unless you're Deadpool. The iPad lacks two things that a gaming device needs.

1433
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:33,000
A decent way to control games and decent games. Sure you can point to a couple of passable

1434
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,640
titles, but that's out of thousands. When 1.3 of your games are passable, it's time

1435
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:42,000
to move on. Also, it's not a camera, so I don't ever want to see anyone at any event

1436
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,820
taking pictures with it. And it's also not a video editor, a typewriter, a guitar, credit

1437
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:52,440
card machine, or a piano. I got to say, I know as much as you want to, you want to have

1438
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,020
first off, that was a hilarious comment in the beginning, but I will say for the second

1439
01:58:55,020 --> 01:59:01,600
half of it, a video editor, I wouldn't use it for anything serious, but I took a trip

1440
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:06,680
up to Lake Tahoe and I did a little video and I did it in iMovie and it was really easy

1441
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:12,000
and it made a cool, fun little thing to post on Facebook. I wouldn't make it much more

1442
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,280
serious than that, but I was actually really pleased with video editing on the iPhone because

1443
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:20,720
it was really super easy. But granted, if I was going to do anything professional, I

1444
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:27,480
would do it on a Mac or a PC. Credit card machine, I was at a restaurant the other day

1445
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:32,400
and I saw the waiter taking my order on an iPod. Couldn't believe it. That's where technology

1446
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,800
has come. It was the same restaurant you were at the other day, you were telling me when

1447
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:40,600
you came in here. Well, something else too is that a friend of mine who used to do drive-by

1448
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:47,000
appraisals actually would do them with his iPad mounted on the front of his bike and

1449
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:53,320
would basically drive around the house on his bike and take pictures of the home. Basically,

1450
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:57,040
what a drive-by appraisal is for people who don't know is when a mortgage company hires

1451
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,680
somebody to go make sure the house is lived in. I get the sense that the iDevices, they

1452
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:07,320
don't do anything maybe the best, but they do them well enough and considering how portable

1453
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:10,920
they are, a lot of people really like it. But that's, you know, I think a lot of that

1454
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:15,720
is based on opinion. So, it is the show where every gamer has a voice. Alright, let's move

1455
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:20,640
on to a few more news stories before we get to the mailbag, the twitter.com slash o-l-r

1456
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:27,120
and all that good stuff. Loki. Well, of course this month, well, just recently we got some

1457
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:34,400
NPD numbers talking about the sales during February. The Nintendo 3DS has finally hit

1458
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:40,480
4.5 million units in its first year. It's outperformed the original DS already and of

1459
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:48,800
course it hasn't even quite hit a year yet. That will be March 27th, but, eh, you know,

1460
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:56,240
close enough I guess. By comparison, I guess they said 9 million units of software have

1461
02:00:56,240 --> 02:01:02,520
been sold and 1.2 billion dollars in revenue it's generated so far. The original DS sold

1462
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:11,560
2.3 million units in its first year. And of course, during February, 200,000 of those

1463
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:19,040
are actually, actually I'm sorry it's not 2,000, yeah 200,000 systems were moved during

1464
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:25,920
February and Mario Galaxy has sold 5 million units as well. So, it's doing pretty well.

1465
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:34,640
The Nintendo Wii also sold about 228,000 units and the 3DS itself 135. So, still not doing

1466
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:44,000
too bad even though the 3DS is out. Microsoft didn't do too bad as well. They sold almost

1467
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:54,800
half a million units for the Xbox 360 and reached the top console spot for 14 consecutive

1468
02:01:54,800 --> 02:02:07,160
months. That's not bad. The PlayStation Move, they've shipped 10.5 million units. Of course,

1469
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:12,240
as I've mentioned in the past before when they talk about shipping units for the Move,

1470
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:18,720
how you can't really compare that to the Kinect because the Kinect, you know, they've sold,

1471
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:24,320
I can't remember how many units for the Kinect, it's quite a bit. I think it's actually still

1472
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:31,920
more than 10 million units. But, you know, what are they exactly counting for the PlayStation

1473
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:38,640
Move since, you know, like the Wii, you can use multiple Move units per system and are

1474
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:42,920
they counting the camera, are they counting the navigation controller, any accessories,

1475
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:47,960
it's just Move units. You can bet the math is as fuzzy as possible. I'd be willing to

1476
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:54,360
bet, yeah. So, 10.5 million units, that could be significantly less households and judging

1477
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:58,840
by the sales of Move-only games, I would guess it's probably... I don't want to sound like

1478
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:02,640
a jerk, but I don't think I know anyone in real life that has a PlayStation Move. I know

1479
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:07,520
people on the internet. Oh, you do? Yeah. Do I play with it? No. Maybe that's why I

1480
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:12,880
don't know anybody because nobody ever like, you know, says, let's play Move. It's sad

1481
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,440
because it's not bad. It's actually a pretty good peripheral. I mean, I would prefer to

1482
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:22,960
use Move over Kinect, but, you know, I think for some things, the Kinect is way better.

1483
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,480
Like dancing games, I think it would be a lot better, you know, tracking you versus,

1484
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:31,920
you know, the Move controller. For like core games, like, you know, shooters and stuff,

1485
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:41,160
it's probably way better. Like, I would play... What was it? God, no. I'd play like some of

1486
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:45,120
the third-person shooters or whatever, the gun games and stuff with the Move controller

1487
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:51,160
versus trying to even remotely do that with a Kinect camera. It just wouldn't be accurate

1488
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:59,940
at all. Plus it has buttons. Buttons are important, right? Yeah. Very important. All right. Well,

1489
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:03,400
what about the sales figures overall? I mean, what do we think this is saying? Like, is

1490
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:08,520
the 3DS recovered or whatever? I mean, this says to me, yes. I think that's the picture

1491
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:12,600
they're trying to paint is that it's, you know, recovered, but, you know, we'll see

1492
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:19,120
how, you know, long-term that is. I'm still doing well. I mean, even the regular DS is

1493
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:27,480
doing fine. The Wii, though, I can guarantee you that the Wii systems, you know, even 200,000,

1494
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:31,880
that's still, I think, gone the downturn. And, you know, looking at the slate of Wii

1495
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:37,680
games coming out, they're kind of done with that system. I mean, there's a lot of games

1496
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:44,400
that aren't getting Wii ports anymore. It's just, it's gone. All right. Well, this might

1497
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,840
make Loki sad, because I don't know who he's going to make fun of now. But Peter Molyneux

1498
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:53,920
has left Microsoft, meaning he's left Lionhead Studios as well. Ah, yes. His head was too

1499
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,680
big for the building. He had to leave. I think they had to carve him a new door on the way

1500
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:11,840
out. He's left for a startup called 22 cans. Big cans. No, 22 cans. He did leave some parting

1501
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:16,360
words. His parting words were, quote, it is with mixed emotions that I make the decision

1502
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:21,840
to leave Microsoft and Lionhead Studios, the company that I co-founded in 1997 at the conclusion

1503
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:27,360
of development of Fable The Journey. I remain extremely passionate and proud of the people,

1504
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:32,640
products and experiences that we created. It's not on rails. Okay, I added the last

1505
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:38,360
part, but the rest of it's true. Because it is on rails. So there you go. It is apparently

1506
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:44,240
an amicable breakup. Uh, there's still Facebook friends from what I understand. So, uh, maybe

1507
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:47,640
sometimes they'll just end up in bed together. They might throw some shade at each other

1508
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,800
once in a while, but that'll be the extent of it. I was going to make a game about a

1509
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:57,040
little boy named Milo. Then Chris Hansen showed up. So now I'm on the lam. So I went to a

1510
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:07,960
company called 22 cans, 22 cans. All right. I, they're a porn company. Stop it. 22 cans.

1511
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:10,800
That's the people that they have standing out on the street with an empty can saying,

1512
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:19,160
put money in me. What level is this show sunken to? Not Rob. Dana Plato. What you talking

1513
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:24,780
about? Mail bag at orangelandtrader.com is where you send emails every week and dark

1514
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:31,920
soccer has to read them. Why don't you read the emails from our kind and generous listeners

1515
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:41,600
this week? Oh, I like you. You're my favorite show ever. Don't make them up. Okay. Hi. I

1516
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:45,360
just wanted to say thank you for talking me out of buying street fighter cross tech and

1517
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,800
I was very excited to get it, but after hearing how over a quarter of the complete roster

1518
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:53,720
is paid to unlock, I had to say hell no. In fact, I went to GameStop yesterday to preorder

1519
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:58,440
the game, but I got a three ds instead and I got Mario Kart, so I'm down to play someone.

1520
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:02,520
The guy before me was buying a PS three and just dance three and I preordered the game

1521
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:07,160
as well. I was at the register next to him and the lady checking me out and she is checking

1522
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:11,160
you out. I'm asked if I wanted to preorder any games and I told her that you were hot

1523
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:14,720
with your three ds. I wanted to get street fighter cross tech in it, but went on about

1524
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:18,520
how quarter the roster was paid to unlock and the guy was checking out next to me freaked

1525
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:23,100
out. You could totally see the surprise in his eyes when I blurted that out. I'm sure

1526
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:27,000
she was pissed that I might have talked to the guy out of a sale. Oh well. But yeah,

1527
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:34,000
that's just nuts. 12 characters, probably $5 a piece to buy would mean they'd be $60,

1528
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,480
which is the cost of a game. Are you telling me that I'd have to shell out the same amount

1529
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:42,200
of money in order to get the full experience? Um, there's a big link on there. I'm not going

1530
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:49,960
to relink. Um, this is why they did it to save on hard drive space, but they didn't

1531
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:54,800
explain when they'd be unlocked and I'm guessing $3-$5 a piece, which is still too much. Sure

1532
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,320
they did that with Jill and Shuma Garath in the two Marvel vs Capcom 3 games, but that's

1533
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:03,120
just for two characters. If all 12 characters were available in a bundle for like $10, then

1534
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:07,560
I'll stop bitching. But I doubt that'll happen. Oh, I also thought it was funny that the PS3

1535
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:11,480
exclusive characters can also be found on the Xbox version. Their files were found in

1536
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:15,360
the disc, so if anyone is good at hacking, they might be able to play as cool on the

1537
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:19,840
Xbox. Okay, that's it. I'm done. Thanks for reading this. I look forward to your

1538
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:25,120
tenth-versary, Stan. And also, the reason why they're probably on the disc is because

1539
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:30,760
it's the same information ported. Oh yeah, it's kind of lazy porting, in a way. I mean,

1540
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:35,400
I know that sounds really harsh, but it kind of is what it is. The other thing I want to

1541
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:40,640
say about that is it's kind of scary that we kind of talked not one but two people out

1542
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:45,240
of buying the game. It's not what we set out to do. Like, I'm not trying to discourage

1543
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:48,480
people from buying the game, because, you know, again, there's fighting game fans out

1544
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:51,840
there that are going to eat this up, and that's fine. That is fine. It's your money. Buy what

1545
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:56,640
you want. But, you know, we're all about people making informed decisions, and it sounds like

1546
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:59,480
that's what happened in this case, is that people kind of realized, like, wait a minute,

1547
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,480
I'm going to have to pay $60, and then if I want everything, I have to pay $60 more

1548
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:09,960
dollars, maybe, only to see a super Uber collection at the end of the year? I kind of talked myself

1549
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:14,000
out of it with that same logic. I think that's why I asked Loki earlier, what did the sales

1550
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
look like for this game, because I want to see if it's just more than the three of us

1551
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:24,920
now that we're up to. Anyhow, next email. Dear Orange Launch Radio, let me say, first, you

1552
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:28,960
guys and Lady are amazing. Between Loki's Rants of Rage and Dark Soccer in the Sky's

1553
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:34,540
Epic Trolls, you make a three-hour podcast of very entertaining. I'm not a troll. Epic

1554
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:40,880
trolls. I'm not an epic troll. You don't, you, it's not that you are a troll, it's that

1555
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:47,560
you have done trolling. I was trolling you for compliments. Bitch. Girl, please. Now,

1556
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:51,400
granted, I haven't listened to you guys from the beginning, mostly because I was ten when

1557
02:09:51,400 --> 02:10:01,780
you guys started... Oh my God. Okay, emailers, I totally appreciate, I appreciate your emails.

1558
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:07,440
Please don't say that ever again. But for the past three years, you guys have taught

1559
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,000
me about old school games, system hackings, and other stuff I can't think of off the top

1560
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:16,400
of my head. You guys can make a long car drive seem shorter, a boring day entertaining, and

1561
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:20,520
a regular guy seem crazy because he can't stop laughing in the middle of class. I hope

1562
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:25,200
you guys keep podcasting, really enjoy the show, signed Haseo Sumiragawa. PS, if there

1563
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:29,840
are trophy whores listening to this show, you can add me on PSN, it's Haseo underscore

1564
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:35,860
Sumiragawa. I would love to be able to compare trophies to someone that isn't 100 or so trophies

1565
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:44,880
below my total. Next email. Now start paying attention in class, you young whippersnapper.

1566
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:52,000
Hello Hellions. Ever since the expansion pack for World of Warcraft involving the Pandarens

1567
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,280
was released, something has been stuck in my head. I've been ruminating about it for

1568
02:10:56,280 --> 02:11:02,000
some time until it struck me just now. Look at the promotional material released for this

1569
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,160
expansion pack. Look at the architecture that is on display. Look at the landscapes that

1570
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:09,440
are on display. Look at the pandas that are on display. Suddenly something seems very

1571
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:14,400
clear to me. The Pandaren expansion for World of Warcraft seems tailor made to appeal to

1572
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:20,720
China. But, being that China is an emerging market, not just in video games, but also

1573
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:24,880
different aspects of our modern day economy, it makes sense that Blizzard would tailor

1574
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:29,740
make something for the Chinese public. Okay. This also makes me think of the possibilities

1575
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:34,160
that could happen if Blizzard decides to tailor make something to any other emerging markets.

1576
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:39,320
Finally, one of the possibilities began to take tangible shape in my mind. Behold, the

1577
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:47,000
Jersey Darians. Lord. Okay. This is funny now. Coming from the mythical realm of shortopia,

1578
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:52,160
smush smush. I don't know what that means. The Jersey Darians are an orange race whose

1579
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:57,320
clothes, hair and muscular definitions appeal mostly to people of their own race. The Jersey

1580
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:01,760
Darians are not a smart race, but just try telling them that. Criticizing a Jersey Darian

1581
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:06,240
may result in you getting your teeth punched in by an orange troll whose overstylized hair

1582
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:12,000
makes up for the bulk of their height. One of them is pregnant, you know. I know I didn't

1583
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,120
need to know that. It just made my life hurt. Other possibilities for expansion packs for

1584
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:22,640
the emerging markets include for the English, the Cockney Darians, for the Irish, the U2

1585
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:27,440
Darians, for the Somalians, the not Jack Sparrow Piradarians, and for Utah, the conservative

1586
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:32,840
control freak-a-darians. Stay black, Reddertainment. This message has been brought to you by politicians

1587
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:37,680
who value adequately funding a sports stadium over adequately funding public education.

1588
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:44,720
Grrr. I just thought of the best argument ever for gay marriage. Or, you know, equal

1589
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:48,320
marriage because there's really no such thing as gay marriage. But I have the best argument

1590
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:55,760
ever. I can't get married, but Snooki can. Just think about that for a minute. So that

1591
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:02,200
sink in next time you're at the ballot box. That's the country we live in, folks. There's

1592
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:08,480
a woman who's- Rick Santorum wants Snooki to get married, but not me. Anyhow. Hello

1593
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:12,400
OLR crew. There was something else that you might want to say. Oh, the Pandarian thing

1594
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:16,960
in China. We've talked about this on the best little hoard house in Azeroth, a show all

1595
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:23,480
about the World of Warcraft. www.hoardhouse.com. We talked a little bit about this, and actually

1596
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:28,760
I don't think the claim is as far-fetched as some think. It's ironic because there was

1597
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:32,440
a time when people were saying it can't be Pandaria. They're not going to do Pandaria

1598
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:37,280
because there's laws in China against panda people. Like, you can't- that's defacing pandas

1599
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:42,080
and da da da da da da da. I don't think what you're saying is too far-fetched. I think

1600
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:45,660
it's kind of a win-win situation for Blizzard because, yes, they can do a very respectful

1601
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:50,580
thing for the Chinese culture. And, you know, here in the States and in other countries

1602
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:56,040
like Canada and UK and so forth, we kind of like that culture. There's a lot of people

1603
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:59,800
that are like, you know, pandas are cute. And, you know, they, they like the architecture

1604
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:05,400
and all that. So it makes, it makes sense. I still forgot to reserve the name orange

1605
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:11,420
chicken. But I think, um, you know, Pandarans, don't forget, they've been in Warcraft lore

1606
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:15,160
already. They're not new to- Even though they were a joke. Well, yeah, they were kind of

1607
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:21,920
a joke that went really far. Could you imagine a Pandaren druid, Boomkin, named orange chicken?

1608
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:26,640
That would be funny. My troll was, my troll was already an orange chicken. Anyway, hello

1609
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:32,000
OLR crew. Ooh, to DarkSakura. Well, I do respect you preferring the Japanese- Oh god, here

1610
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
we go. The Japanese Sonic CD soundtrack. I must side with Bobby Blackwolf and claim the

1611
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,560
US soundtrack as superior. Again, your opinion. Despite the fact that Sonic CD- Where every

1612
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:48,080
gamer has a voice, a really- That's why I'm pointing out an opinion. A really wrong voice.

1613
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:53,480
I just got the hand. No, that was a high five. Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought you were making

1614
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:58,920
me talk to that. Okay. No, I was giving you a high five. Despite the fact that Sonic CD's

1615
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,880
musics have a style different from the other Sonic games for its time, at least to me anyway,

1616
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:08,300
the Japanese music sounds very cheesy. It's way too upbeat and has some hammy voice samples

1617
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:12,200
that are out of place. I believe the US tunes composed by Spencer Nielsen do a fantastic

1618
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:16,280
job of fitting in with the atmosphere of each level, even if it sounds a little new agey

1619
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:20,280
at times. Yeah, but that's kind of why I have a problem with it doesn't sound like Sonic

1620
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:25,320
music. Here's a question for the whole OLR crew. What are some of the best deals that

1621
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:30,300
you've had for video game or video game hardware? For me, I've recently had a Circuit City Tiger

1622
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:37,000
Direct Honor, an erroneous $40 price tag for a 32 gigabyte PlayStation Vita memory card.

1623
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,860
I literally just bought Mass Effect for 11 bucks. I thought that was pretty good. This

1624
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:47,960
is also by Full Brazilian. I love that name so much. What's the most that's ever been

1625
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:56,080
shaved off a price for you? I know one on Dan's behalf where he traded his Sega CD for

1626
02:15:56,080 --> 02:16:03,720
a Neo Geo and games. What about a Steam? Like anything on Steam? I bought like every Doom

1627
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:08,720
game ever for $3. I know there's a lot of good deals there. And I randomly get free

1628
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:17,000
games from people. I got my Dreamcast for 40 bucks. Amazing deal. Those things are still

1629
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:24,240
fucking rad to have. Dreamcast Twin Sticks for Oritario Tangrum. We paid 45 bucks for

1630
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:31,440
them and they were going eBay for like $500. I won my Dreamcast at a Q's R All Nighter.

1631
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:42,640
Nice. Oh, we've gotten our first model PlayStation when they were still going for $700. We got

1632
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:48,320
$100 back from Discover. $700 for that first PlayStation? I guess they were about that

1633
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:52,960
much in the beginning, weren't they? Yeah, but we got $100 back from Discover and Dan

1634
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:59,160
got his manager's discount on it. So I guess that's kind of good and it still works. There

1635
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:04,720
you go. And it still plays all of our old stuff. So next email? Yes, please. How many

1636
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:10,560
more emails? Three. Geez. I know. It's all right. Every gamer gets a voice. That's why

1637
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:14,320
the show is three and a half hours long. Hi, OLR. A couple of weeks ago, Dark Soccer did

1638
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:18,560
a classic game of the week, which inspired me to get the game for my iPod Touch. More

1639
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:23,400
specifically, Puzzle Bobble, aka Bust A Move. It was well worth the $5 I spent to get it.

1640
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:28,040
It's very addicting and it's full of awesomeness. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, Vince Raven.

1641
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:35,320
P.S. Make sure everyone votes for President Cat in the elections. LOL XD. LOL. If President

1642
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:41,440
Cat was running for Republican, then I think everybody else would not make it. Oh, I was

1643
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:44,360
trying to read if there was a question. I got distracted. There was no question. Somebody

1644
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:47,760
sent me naked photos of one of the people from Glee. So I was like, oh, I want to see

1645
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:55,500
that. And then I wasn't I wasn't listening to the female or male female. OK, who it was.

1646
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:07,920
It's a video game podcast, right? It was just thanking me for referring. What? Nice. I'm

1647
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:13,800
back to video games. OK. OK. What is that badge in the background? It might be. Let's

1648
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:22,440
move on. It was a mirror. No. Well, you see, Jamie, women have a vagina. Shut up. And so

1649
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:33,520
do you. You're a bitch. Read an email. Love you. Mean it. Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly

1650
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:38,880
neighborhood turtle. I just heard that Diablo three is now removing PvP to speed up their

1651
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:44,440
release time. I'm getting real tired of companies. It should be really tired. Hello. Of companies

1652
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:48,720
stripping down their games to hit a release date and the game suffering for it. And it's

1653
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:53,440
my opinion that they usually release the rest of the game as paid DLC, which Blizzard will

1654
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:58,240
not be doing. But I'm still tired of it anyway. Just needed to get my frustration. And I'll

1655
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:02,920
answer Jamie's request for an OLR memory next time. Peace and chicken grease, serious turtle.

1656
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:14,600
I still agree with Rob. Sorry, what was the question? Girl. OK. It's about the Diablo

1657
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:20,880
three, removing the PvP and saying tired of games, right? You know, coming out with stuff

1658
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:24,880
that's going to be DLC later and we'll have to pay for it. They say they're not going

1659
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:28,280
to charge for. Yeah, but I think it's still the you mean it's not going to have everything

1660
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:33,560
on it. I'm OK with it because I don't want to wait nine more months for the game to come

1661
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:38,960
out. Yeah, like you kind of hit a point waiting for a baby. How how long without the indigestion

1662
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,840
waiting for Diablo three and PvP was not one of the elements I personally cared about.

1663
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,640
I don't as much it. I mean, I'll play it later when they patch it in, but I don't need it

1664
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:52,240
right away. It is like waiting for a baby without the indigestion. Moving on. OK, last

1665
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:59,200
one is I'm I didn't leave a name, so I'm just going to say it's pork chop. I totally agree

1666
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:03,280
with the fact that gamers don't want to work for unlocks anymore. I taken six and still

1667
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:08,560
caliber five. Everything is there to use right away. And the modes are rather lacking. The

1668
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:18,080
good old days of gaming are dwindling, folks. Agreed. And you know what? That's it. At least

1669
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:22,400
that's all I'm going to read. Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com. It sounds like Jamie sadly

1670
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:26,240
had to cut a few out tonight. So no, I didn't. I just said if any more arrived, I wasn't

1671
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:30,040
going to read them until next week. There you go. Look, you'll read them next week.

1672
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:34,480
There you go. That would be funny if Loki read them. He's done it before when you're

1673
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:42,840
not here. I know. But while I was here, the mailbag. Yeah. All right. Moving on. This

1674
02:20:42,840 --> 02:21:03,840
is the part of show where we get angsty because because. Uppity mail bitches. If you'd up

1675
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:11,040
any mail bitches. Hey, not you. OK, there's OK. I have a friend. Oh, I know where this

1676
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:15,480
is going. You know where this is going. You know, going. I already know you didn't have

1677
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:24,440
to say it. Who occasionally acts like a stereotypical hysterical woman and doesn't admit. And it's

1678
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:33,200
Nathan Lane in the bird cage and doesn't ever admit. Well, except for this time when said

1679
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:39,080
person has done something wrong or, you know, gives the roundabout passive aggressive type

1680
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:45,040
of apology. You know what I mean? Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. And I'm getting kind

1681
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:51,680
of sick of it and I'm getting sick of just that sense of entitlement. So. But you know

1682
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:58,080
what? We talked about things are better. I hope that said person watches it. But I really

1683
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:04,280
got so pissed off that I I haven't been this angry in a long time. I got so pissed off

1684
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:10,520
I've worked. She's not lying. She sent me a message. And wow, girl, I just burped. I

1685
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:16,780
am so angry. I burped. I threw up in my mouth. That was awful. And the place I didn't want

1686
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:23,280
to do it either. I was at synagogue. I was sick and had to leave. I was so mad. It was

1687
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:31,000
awful. Loki. Oh, I'm sorry. Girl, I'm F you to rob. I'll sound like you're done. No, I

1688
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:35,160
have one more. All right. Now I forgot what it was. Whatever. Oh, yeah. F you to daylight

1689
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:42,640
savings time, you whore. Who were? Who were? Because, OK, I got last time I went to the

1690
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:47,920
Jewish Film Festival. I come home at like one and sit down to, you know, check on my

1691
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:51,640
email and everything. I look at the clock. Next thing I know, it's three because boom

1692
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:58,080
time skip. And then I'm not in bed until like after four because I had all this crap to

1693
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:02,960
do that I thought I still had another hour to do because I forgot about it. I get up

1694
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:10,520
at one today because of my weird sleeping schedule and I'm groggy all day and tired

1695
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:20,720
and although I did have the world's best chocolate mousse cake last night. So good. OK, I'm done.

1696
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:29,280
Loki. F you to the donut shop in Folsom for not having the baking maple donuts you sold

1697
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:36,440
out of them at what, like 10 in the morning. I mean, seriously, that is just ridiculous.

1698
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:40,920
Not a single donut. You would think that they would be popular and you make a ton of them.

1699
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:48,680
I mean, that's my thought. So that's just unfair. They're open till five o'clock. I

1700
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:53,480
was going to come. I was going to leave early and go to the donut shop, pick up a dozen

1701
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:58,880
of those donuts, bring them in delish, but they know. Sorry, we stopped making them because

1702
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:05,360
we sold out of our tray of them that we made losers. All right. Any more. That's it. Right.

1703
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:10,580
Because you know what happens if I cut someone off my F you the week goes to daylight savings

1704
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:16,920
time as well, because it is a dirty. I've had two cups of coffee today to compensate.

1705
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:22,400
Not one, two cups of coffee. I did too. Thanks to you. Actually. Fuck. I had three. I need

1706
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:30,320
to catch up. Otherwise I had a really crazy week last week, but, um, a lot of like, a

1707
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:34,900
lot of good news and a lot of like, I don't really feel one way or the other about it

1708
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:40,120
news. Just like, just when it rains, it pours and that's not necessarily an F you, but it's

1709
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:46,400
just, damn, I'm going to be busy. If you do the fact that there aren't more hours in the

1710
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:50,020
day. In fact, there's one less thanks to daylight savings time. Did I say a few days daylight

1711
02:24:50,020 --> 02:24:55,000
savings time? Cause I really mean it. You know what? I think I can set back you up in

1712
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:00,240
that completely because fuck it. Good. Cause I'm right. I like more nighttime. All right.

1713
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:06,720
I want nighttime savings time. Let's go to some more news before we get to your calls.

1714
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:10,840
Hey, the 800 number works again this week. That's good. But we have a few more stories

1715
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:16,660
first. Loki. All right. Let's talk a little bit about, um, hopefully not anything I was

1716
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:22,160
looking up there. We don't need to talk about that. Um, more boobs. Well, it's the same

1717
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:30,680
boobs. So let's talk about, uh, valve in. Um, they of course came out and debunked the

1718
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:38,560
whole steam box debacle thing or whether everyone's conspiring that they were making some sort

1719
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:42,960
of console. And of course that's not the case. What they were doing though is they were making

1720
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:49,920
test boxes to, um, test out their big picture initiative, which is basically developing

1721
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:56,000
an interface for steam that looks nice on TV displays. So that's what those boxes were

1722
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:00,200
being used for. Not necessarily a game console, but I mean, if you think about it, likely

1723
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:07,140
story, no, it actually does sound like a likely story. So, um, you know, if you think about

1724
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:13,400
it though, I mean that kind of set up, you could use a PC next to your hooked up to your

1725
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:21,760
TV and kind of treat it like game box, you know, or something like that. I don't know.

1726
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:27,120
All right. Well, are you bummed out with this news? Were you hoping for a steam box? No,

1727
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,480
I didn't really care. I don't have a steam account. It would have really, that's surprising.

1728
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:35,800
It would have been neat, but it's not the end of the world that, I mean, it's still

1729
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:40,540
going to be a really good service for the PC. So I still think I'm right on the half

1730
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:43,900
life three thing though. So that means there's not going to be half life three until this

1731
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:49,520
steam box is ready years and years away. All right. Maybe I'm trolling a little bit. Um,

1732
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:54,280
I'm not trolling as much as Adidas is though. Yeah. You know, Adidas, the sporting company,

1733
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:59,280
I know we don't talk about them a lot with games, but a THQ has been sued. Uh, Adidas

1734
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:06,500
is suing the pants off of them. If your pants hold $10.6 million Adidas sued THQ this week

1735
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:12,800
for 10.6 million. Keep in mind, THQ has had some bumpy roads already. So this certainly

1736
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:19,240
doesn't help. What is at issue here? Breach of contract. Apparently a game that THQ is

1737
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:25,400
supposed to produce for Adidas called me coach 24 seven. I believe it's my coach, my

1738
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:31,720
coach, am I code? I thought maybe cause the we, but okay, my coach 24 seven, uh, got canned.

1739
02:27:31,720 --> 02:27:36,040
Uh, THQ told Adidas in December that it would not be able to present the product and developers

1740
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:41,440
who were working on the project were laid off. So maybe this was one of those things

1741
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:45,280
we heard about the layoffs of THQ. This was one of those things that was affected and

1742
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:51,480
Adidas isn't happy. So they want 10.6 million in damages. This humans, it's all scary. Similar

1743
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:55,920
to that Beyonce lawsuit we heard about where they got sued over the canceled Beyonce game.

1744
02:27:55,920 --> 02:28:00,760
Remember that? And anyway, that wasn't THQ as somebody else. But anyway, uh, THQ is refusing

1745
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:05,800
to turn over the publishing materials to an alternative developer. That's probably not

1746
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:12,160
good if that's true. Allegedly, it's all allegedly. Adidas is seeking an injunction preventing

1747
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:17,800
THQ from selling or transferring the rights to another company. So maybe this was something

1748
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:22,480
they were trying to sell off to, uh, get some of the money back. But, uh, Nope, Adidas won't

1749
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:28,480
have it. And they're going to have to do this out in a court of law, hopefully judge Judy,

1750
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:33,040
but probably not. It'll get settled as they always do. Yep. All right. Dark soccer. We

1751
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:39,280
need something better. We need some more warm, fuzzy news. Yeah, no, I haven't well for like,

1752
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:45,840
okay, how about Samurai Yeti and Ninja werewolves? There's a teacher whose name is Ben Bertoli

1753
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:53,440
is a sixth grade teacher who turned his classroom into an MMO. Basically he set up a, um, experience

1754
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:58,960
system and achievements for doing certain things in conjunction with his class, even

1755
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:03,240
giving out extra experience for when people, uh, turned in essay, you know, extra credit

1756
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:08,520
essays and stuff. And the students are actually helping him remember to keep track of everyone's

1757
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:15,840
experience on, um, you know, on a tracking board. They call it class realm and, uh, tried

1758
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:23,760
it out at the end of the school year. Um, his beta test group and, um, basically, uh,

1759
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:30,320
didn't even tell anybody, just told the students and, uh, they, uh, apparently really liked

1760
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:35,240
it. So there's rules of classroom. Uh, one classroom is completely, don't talk about

1761
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:41,480
classroom is completely voluntary. XP is the backbone of classroom. Every 10 XP you earn

1762
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:46,080
pushes you to the next level. Everyone starts off at level one. XP can be obtained by doing

1763
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:50,840
simple things as answering questions, joining in class discussion, uh, working hard on an

1764
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:58,360
assignment, helping others participation, random encounter Friday and gaining achievements.

1765
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:05,000
When he lets random encounter Friday is when he lets a wild boar loose in the classroom.

1766
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:11,200
Or achievements are gained by completing specific tasks. Um, for example, a student can obtain

1767
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:15,640
bookworm by reading two unassigned chapter books and explaining the plot and characters

1768
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:21,660
to me. Each achievement has four levels, bronze, silver, gold, and master. Each level is harder

1769
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:26,680
to reach than the one before it. Boys are pitted against girls. The gender that can

1770
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,340
acquire the most achievements by the end of the year will, um, earn extra recess and ice

1771
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:37,360
cream party during lunch. Each Friday is random and here's the secret because it's the sixth

1772
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:40,940
grade. Everybody will win the ice cream party so you don't even have to try cause that's

1773
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:45,520
how these things work. Hush. Everyone who wants to battle will put their name in a hat.

1774
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:49,940
I will draw out two names and they will battle. Students will be asked a question. Oh my God,

1775
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:55,500
it's battle royale. Shut up. I will repeat the question twice and start battle music.

1776
02:30:55,500 --> 02:31:00,300
The first to write the correct answer on the board will put their and put their hands up

1777
02:31:00,300 --> 02:31:07,500
will win XP. You can only answer once. Question subjects are chosen at random. Students may

1778
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:12,840
join in alliances of up to six classroom citizens. The alliance with the highest combined level

1779
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:17,020
at the end of the year wins a pizza party. All info except for the current amount of

1780
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:20,860
XP each student has will be listed online and in the classroom for students and parents

1781
02:31:20,860 --> 02:31:28,780
to see. Well, apparently it's been a big hit and everyone's been super enthusiastic and

1782
02:31:28,780 --> 02:31:34,500
really trying to participate in it. In fact, there's one he called the Newberry achievement

1783
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:40,660
that's based off the Newberry medal that has it's earned by writing an unassigned five

1784
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:45,900
paragraph essay and he had 20 essays turned into him in the first week that are written

1785
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:53,380
during students' free time outside of their other work. So apparently this is really popular.

1786
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:58,180
The kids like it and they're learning with it. So that's pretty cool.

1787
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:03,780
So Sally, little Jimmy, you've been called into battle.

1788
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:18,340
Rob, for real. If it's getting kids to actually participate in school and enjoy learning,

1789
02:32:18,340 --> 02:32:22,600
I think it's a great thing. No, I did. In all seriousness, it is. You know, I have to

1790
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:27,000
fuck with it because that's what I do here. But it is. And it's, it's not that dissimilar

1791
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,580
from stuff even I experienced when I was that age, you know, a long time ago, back when

1792
02:32:32,580 --> 02:32:38,220
some of our listeners weren't even born. But, but like I remember in the seventh grade,

1793
02:32:38,220 --> 02:32:43,460
our science teacher used to have these meters that would fill up with time. And like, as

1794
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:48,160
we answered questions correctly or volunteered to do things or do extra work, a little, little,

1795
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:51,220
we would move up the ladder a little bit. When you get to the top, you got like a free

1796
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:56,100
day. It was like a free day in the class, you know, like no work, no nothing. It was

1797
02:32:56,100 --> 02:33:00,660
just like, you know, screw off day or study lab or whatever, which, you know, was kind

1798
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:04,320
of cool. And it's kind of a similar thing, right? You gain experience. I remember in

1799
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:09,420
the fifth grade, we had a whole little like village with its own economy because I remember

1800
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:14,540
one thing I did, I ran a shop that rented Nintendo games in my fifth grade class. And

1801
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:20,500
I would rent games to, you know, my classmates for like 10 of the fake bucks that were named

1802
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:28,140
after the teacher. So that was like my business. Shroup bucks. What? Shroup bucks. No, I just

1803
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:32,920
don't, you know, I don't want to, but no, that wasn't the name, but yeah, same idea.

1804
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:35,980
But the whole battle thing is just really funny to me. Sorry. I can't help but think

1805
02:33:35,980 --> 02:33:39,060
of the hunger games. That's what everybody's all talking about right now. I don't give

1806
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:47,620
a crap. So, well, at any rate, I say good for you. And he's apparently a, a, a regular

1807
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:53,260
reader and commenter on Kotaku. So, um, the news is just really catching fire. I really

1808
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:57,460
hope that it's actually something that he can market for other schools. I see what you

1809
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:02,740
did there. Catching fire. Nevermind. What? Don't stand in fire. No, this is a hunger

1810
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:10,140
games reference. The hunger game sequel is catching fire. I okay. I'm going to tell everybody

1811
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:15,860
something. Unintentional lulz. I don't give a shit about hunger games. I had never, the

1812
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:20,380
only thing I've ever heard of it, but let me finish. You're a woman. I don't give a

1813
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:25,100
shit. The only thing I've ever heard about it is the name. That's it. I don't know anything

1814
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:29,260
about it. And guess who doesn't want to know anything about it. That would be me. I don't

1815
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:36,540
care. End of story. Don't care. They're hungry. It's about a bunch of hippos and they're really

1816
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:45,780
hungry. That sound is, that's my head repeatedly hitting the microphone.

1817
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:59,020
As I bang it into it. Ah, I've successfully derailed the show. Uh, low key. Help us get

1818
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:04,240
back on track and then we'll open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR. Tiger

1819
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:08,620
Claus says, I wonder what Rob was like when kids didn't return the Nintendo games on time.

1820
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:22,140
Were you mean to them? Nope. Just one finger for each day late. This is how we roll, right?

1821
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:33,180
So Tony Hawk, um, he's a little sad, sad, Tony Hawk. Um, he says that ride was a bit

1822
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:40,740
rushed and that people didn't give it a chance. Really? You should try Tony Hawk's ride. Give

1823
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:44,980
it a chance. Cause you know, the game may have been a little rushed and the critics

1824
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:50,840
didn't like it. Give it a chance. Of course, that didn't stop them from creating the sequel

1825
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:54,260
that I would assume wouldn't have been as rushed because you know, they would have had

1826
02:35:54,260 --> 02:36:00,540
a whole year to polish it, but still sucked. So I don't see the logic there, but whatever

1827
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:06,500
you know, it's rushed. Um, he, he's quoted, I think pride was a bit rushed for a number

1828
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:11,940
of reasons, mostly because probably for about the first half of the development process,

1829
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:16,820
it was just figuring out how to make a board, how to make a board and how to make it work.

1830
02:36:16,820 --> 02:36:23,060
We were in uncharted territory. Uh, so the game was a bit rushed, but I still feel critics

1831
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:28,260
never really gave it a chance in terms of learning how to play. They got on it and they

1832
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:32,660
went straight into expert mode because supposedly they were expert gamers and they didn't really

1833
02:36:32,660 --> 02:36:37,660
learn the mechanics of how the board works. And so I felt like that already in their mind

1834
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:43,780
it made it up or made up their decision before it came out. It was a gimmick and it was a

1835
02:36:43,780 --> 02:36:47,460
peripheral and whatnot and they never really took the time to learn how to play. No, I

1836
02:36:47,460 --> 02:36:53,020
think what they decided was that it's a fucking terrible game and you're selling it for $130.

1837
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:57,220
This thing takes up too much goddamn space in my house. Get it out. No, it's not even

1838
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:04,220
that it took up a lot of space. It was $130 for your stupid game. Not anymore. Yeah. Hey,

1839
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:09,540
yeah, seriously, gamers, if you want to take a chance on a ride, you can probably find

1840
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:14,220
it for 10 bucks with the board. Go to like Wise Buys or whatever. Anywhere. Big Lots

1841
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:19,540
or whatever. It's just terrible. And I'm sorry, like I understand. Okay, let's say the first

1842
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:23,540
ride game was terrible or whatever. It was rushed or whatever because you were trying

1843
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:29,380
to figure out the technology. Then why did the second game suck just as much? You have

1844
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:36,380
no excuses, Tony Hawk. The game sucked. It was terrible. It was a dumb idea because Activision

1845
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:40,820
thought, hey, we're going to cash in on all these peripheral games because we made money

1846
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:46,020
on DJ Hero. Actually, I think DJ Hero came out around the same time. Well, we made money

1847
02:37:46,020 --> 02:37:50,460
on Guitar Hero so we're going to put out this peripheral game because people like peripherals.

1848
02:37:50,460 --> 02:37:56,340
It makes them more interactive. Yeah, it just didn't work out. Just get over it. So no,

1849
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:00,020
you know what? I think that the direction that they're taking right now where they're

1850
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:06,660
taking the good games that you had and making them look better, that's probably the best

1851
02:38:06,660 --> 02:38:12,780
way to go because all your experiments to make your game series better have failed over

1852
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:18,820
and over again. And the board, that was just the icing on the cake. All right, one more

1853
02:38:18,820 --> 02:38:22,940
story for you guys and then we're going to open up the phones at 1877 Game OLR or our

1854
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:27,540
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is about a little bit of resolution. I just

1855
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:34,180
reported on some legal troubles in one area but this is about resolution to one lawsuit

1856
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:39,340
that was going to happen. This was between Bethesda and Mojang. You might remember this.

1857
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:46,020
It was over the name Scrolls. Remember Bethesda felt that the name Scrolls was infringing on

1858
02:38:46,020 --> 02:38:51,580
its trademark for Elder Scrolls and people might get confused. Just like when I reviewed

1859
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:56,580
Journey earlier in the show, I had to clarify that it's not the one about the 1980s ban

1860
02:38:56,580 --> 02:39:02,740
you know because the games are so similar once you've played them. But anyhow, there

1861
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:08,900
were some tweets. I love that official statements come from tweets now. That they have settled

1862
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:16,020
with yay heart. The settlement is that we give them the trademark. We get to keep the

1863
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:20,460
name and won't make an Elder Scrolls competitor using the name. That's the settlement. Usually

1864
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:24,060
you don't get to hear about the details of the settlement. I'm just glad like no finance

1865
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:29,660
stuff were changed or whatever. So they don't get to have a trademark on Scrolls but Bethesda

1866
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:34,680
will leave them alone as long as they don't try to infringe on you know epic epicness

1867
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:40,500
of first person role playing games. Which I don't think Scrolls was supposed to be.

1868
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:49,220
There you go. Fantastic. Fantastic. Alright so we are gonna open up the Skype line 1877

1869
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:56,660
Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. And oh we're already getting calls. And by

1870
02:39:56,660 --> 02:40:00,980
the way we will go to the Twitter here. Also Twitter.com slash OLR. But first we have some

1871
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:05,940
calls coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? This is Shane. Hey Shane it's

1872
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:11,780
my co-host from Horde House. It sure isn't. What do you mean? Yes you are. You're on that

1873
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:15,800
show. Oh yeah I guess I am sometimes. Right except this week you could only talk about

1874
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:19,940
Mass Effect. Which by the way screw you. I bought Mass Effect this week which is kind

1875
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:24,100
of like peer pressure in a way. And you do that a lot and I kind of despise you for it.

1876
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:29,500
It's kind of because I blew up your phone about it. You really did. My god. And I'm

1877
02:40:29,500 --> 02:40:33,180
like. I hope you have unlimited texting. Who is Kaiden and why is Shane in love with him?

1878
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:38,020
Does it? Alright anyway. What's up? What are you calling him for tonight? I was calling

1879
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:43,580
because I want to talk about something I don't normally talk about. What's that? Mass Effect.

1880
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:48,580
Of course. I've never heard you talk about Mass Effect before. Are you here to monopolize

1881
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:52,540
the show with Mass Effect chat just like you did on Horde House this week? Yes. Alright

1882
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:58,280
well what's up? I wanted to not talk about you know the story so much or how awesome

1883
02:40:58,280 --> 02:41:02,860
the game is. Don't spoil it. Don't talk about that ending that everybody's like petitioning.

1884
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:06,220
I don't know about the ending yet. I have not beat the game. Did you hear that people

1885
02:41:06,220 --> 02:41:11,500
are petitioning BioWare to change the ending? It's apparently that bad. Yeah I'm kind of

1886
02:41:11,500 --> 02:41:18,820
kind of scared. Like I don't want it to end so I don't get disappointed. But anyway that's

1887
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:26,780
not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how much respect I have for BioWare now. Oh.

1888
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:34,020
Yes because this is the first game I have ever played in which I feel like they did

1889
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:42,580
not take any stereotypes and put them into their gay characters. Not a single one. And

1890
02:41:42,580 --> 02:41:49,380
I think they actually humanized them instead of using them for comic relief or something

1891
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:56,860
to just flirt with or hook up with. What about Dragon Age? No Dragon Age is totally terrible

1892
02:41:56,860 --> 02:42:04,980
with that stuff. Zevran in the first game especially. But in this game I feel like they're

1893
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:12,180
just normal people who happen to be gay and I don't see that in games. And it really really

1894
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:19,180
makes me feel like BioWare is a company I should support more often. Interesting. I'm

1895
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:24,500
not sure what else I can really say to that. Have you only explored the male-male relationships

1896
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:30,740
in that game or have you looked into how it compares to male-female or female-female?

1897
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:35,340
Well and I'm only going to say it's for three because I've seen stuff on one where it was

1898
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:44,780
pretty I think I described it at work skanky. Well sometimes relationships are skanky. Yes

1899
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:53,260
but I just I wanted something more and this game has given it to me. I've only seen male-male

1900
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:58,580
and actually the one I romance technically is in gay but it's just because I couldn't

1901
02:42:58,580 --> 02:43:04,080
resist his charms. I won't say who because that could be a spoiler I guess but really

1902
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:09,740
romancing people isn't a spoiler. I found it interesting because I asked you in an email

1903
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:13,340
this week when you wouldn't shut up about the game. I asked you like what kind of different

1904
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:18,460
like relationship options were available and it seemed like the the the people that choose

1905
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:23,620
to play femshep who want to be in a relationship with a male so an opposite sex relationship

1906
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:29,660
but with a female care female lead was the most limited. Yes and three at least it is.

1907
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:33,680
I found that to be kind of sad because you know we want you know I'm sure there's a lot

1908
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:38,340
of ladies out there that would like to romance some men in their games and they don't really

1909
02:43:38,340 --> 02:43:43,820
get that option in this game. No they get romance ice cream tubs now instead because

1910
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:49,780
they're sad. That is very sad so well maybe DLC I guess you never know is there a possibility

1911
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:56,220
they're gonna add more romance options in later on? I don't know I I wouldn't imagine

1912
02:43:56,220 --> 02:44:03,820
so because the first DLC character is not romanceable to my knowledge and it'd be really

1913
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:10,620
awkward if they were but you never know it's Bioware they can they can do whatever they

1914
02:44:10,620 --> 02:44:17,340
want and do it right apparently but also that game is amazing and I have cried three times

1915
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:24,260
during it so far now. Three. It has beaten the previous game's record. What was the previous

1916
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:30,320
game before that? Suikoden 2. That was twice. So just to kind of go back to the main point

1917
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:35,820
of the call because you know to wrap up soon and all that why is this so important to you?

1918
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:41,700
Because it's something I can relate to like I don't want to relate to like the skanky

1919
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:50,380
options that people would have before I want you know a really nice story and that's what

1920
02:44:50,380 --> 02:44:56,960
I'm getting. What would you say to people who say why does Bioware have to put gay stuff

1921
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:05,340
in every game? Because they want to give more options to everybody. That is what I would

1922
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:13,980
say. Oh my god did somebody get shot in the background? No that is a washer being. Alright.

1923
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:17,180
Somebody just shot you for your opinion that's really unfortunate what a hideous place we

1924
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:21,960
live in. Are you okay you still there? Yeah I'm still here I'm just trying to do another

1925
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:27,580
conversation at the same time. That works out great. Well I guess yeah I mean one thing

1926
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:32,020
I've sensed even just from playing the first game before not even talking about relationships

1927
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:35,580
or whatever is that I do notice there's so many options in the conversation so forth

1928
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:39,180
to play the game in many different ways and it's something I kind of noticed in Star Wars

1929
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:45,060
too is you know you could kind of be although in Star Wars the paths were very well lit.

1930
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:51,460
Yeah I that's another thing I'm glad you kind of said something about like the choices in

1931
02:45:51,460 --> 02:45:58,700
the past the the one I took with the character I romanced in 3 for Mass Effect it wasn't

1932
02:45:58,700 --> 02:46:03,460
like you know we were having a normal dialogue conversation then bam here's a hook up with

1933
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:07,820
you option or a not hook up with you option it was something that just kind of evolved

1934
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:15,300
naturally and actually kind of came out of nowhere in my opinion but not in like. You

1935
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:21,820
alright? He cut out. Oh no I'm back sorry I hit the wrong button. I just it was nice

1936
02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:27,440
it just kind of went natural and I didn't have to pick stinky stuff to get there. That's

1937
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:32,980
one thing that some people I guess might misinterpret is that there's not the option like you know

1938
02:46:32,980 --> 02:46:40,560
it isn't on the menu like what should we do now oh well let's go kill aliens or let's

1939
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:46,020
do research on the next mission or let's go upstairs and fuck like rabbits it's not like

1940
02:46:46,020 --> 02:46:52,220
how it plays out. No it's nothing like that at all it's like I'm not going to try to do

1941
02:46:52,220 --> 02:46:59,140
this not spoilery and kind of be general something happens that's major and then well if you've

1942
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:03,640
played Mass Effect you can do missions and then one of like your home base of operations

1943
02:47:03,640 --> 02:47:10,540
is the Citadel that's not a spoiler it's always around so you do some missions and then something

1944
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:15,220
happens and then you can you know run around the Citadel and we just happen to have a friendly

1945
02:47:15,220 --> 02:47:21,140
lunch conversation that it turned into us going out all of a sudden in a really really

1946
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:28,860
nicely written scene and what's cool about that too is the actual gay guy in the game

1947
02:47:28,860 --> 02:47:34,380
I was doing some conversations with him and he said something about looking at some eye

1948
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:38,980
candy and one of my options were no I'm interested in women and the other was like well what

1949
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:41,660
about me and I picked up well what about me because I didn't want to screw up what I had

1950
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:46,080
already done and he's like well yeah of course I'm looking at you but I know you're with

1951
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:50,420
so-and-so so it's like oh crap the game actually knows the choices I've made and it's like

1952
02:47:50,420 --> 02:47:56,940
commenting on them. Interesting huh all right I guess I'm gonna have to hurry up and play

1953
02:47:56,940 --> 02:48:00,860
one and two so I can see more of this in action in three because one's still kind of basic

1954
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:05,900
but I just started. All right we gotta let you go to get more calls any other quick thoughts

1955
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:10,420
here before we let you go? No just oh also the multiplayer is really fun so sadly it's

1956
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:14,980
part of the experience to get the best ending from what I understand but I played it for

1957
02:48:14,980 --> 02:48:20,020
two hours straight today and had a blast so I suggest people at least give it a shot.

1958
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:24,820
All right there you go thanks for calling Shane. Thank you bye. Bye. All right 1877

1959
02:48:24,820 --> 02:48:28,880
game OLR or our username on skype is orange lounge radio in the meantime while we're waiting

1960
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:32,460
for calls let's go to twitter twitter.com slash OLR because we've got some interesting

1961
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:36,060
questions and comments on twitter this week I want to start with this one from the Rob

1962
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:42,020
D this is a bit of a whopper here to start with um at OLR how do you guys stay motivated

1963
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:47,000
each week to do a show have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular

1964
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,820
basis so two questions there how do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show you

1965
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:55,340
know I haven't think that question was asked a couple days ago coffee I've been thinking

1966
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:59,060
about that question I honestly don't know if I have an answer I don't know what keeps

1967
02:48:59,060 --> 02:49:04,540
me motivated to do this show well I the people obviously seeing you guys come out and chat

1968
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:08,400
and support what we're doing here is a huge motivator getting a hang with Matt and Jamie

1969
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:11,580
and knowing that we're like creating this thing on the internet that even if it's just

1970
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:15,300
like two or three people that enjoy it like people are enjoying it coffee that's a huge

1971
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:22,500
motivator very very very very are both very big motivators certainly and my own ego and

1972
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:26,060
like the phone line is lighting up right now that's it look at that my screen is like full

1973
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:31,220
of like rings right now so that's a huge motivator all names are recognized all right let's let's

1974
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:34,820
go to another call and see who's on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

1975
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:39,500
hey what's up this is excellent hey how you doing hey doing long doing well a long time

1976
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:44,980
I know it has been a while yeah I know hey I just kind of ironic um not to talk about

1977
02:49:44,980 --> 02:49:48,940
Mass Effect 3 because I haven't played it myself I did play the first two I just love

1978
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:54,660
how they did do the stuff though um from the choices you make in your first game can affect

1979
02:49:54,660 --> 02:50:01,020
a lot of outcomes in the second game um and how I supposedly guess how the stuff in the

1980
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:05,420
first and second can also impact the third I like how they they added that kind of like

1981
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:10,020
it's a continuous storyline so it's not like you're replaying something over and over and

1982
02:50:10,020 --> 02:50:13,940
over again that's brand new for a three part you know for a three part series I kind of

1983
02:50:13,940 --> 02:50:20,160
like the fact that how everything can have a pro or con effect to something else within

1984
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:24,640
the game that's the entire reason I started with one because I will tell you I was tempted

1985
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:29,820
to just jump ahead to three but I didn't also it's really cool to know the fact that they

1986
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:35,140
they took the inventory system and made it better and more flow and more easy thank god

1987
02:50:35,140 --> 02:50:39,340
because it's one it's one to two because one and two is so night and day and the controlling

1988
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:44,500
was two I played one and then there was a big gap between me playing one and part two

1989
02:50:44,500 --> 02:50:49,860
I'm like am I doing this right is this the right way I'm you know why does this feel

1990
02:50:49,860 --> 02:50:54,500
like it changed so much and it's kind of weird but you get used to it though it's not too

1991
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:58,740
much though within that game so so what else you've been playing lately just was because

1992
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:03,820
you're not playing mass effect 3 but what are you playing these days well other than

1993
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:13,740
wow la nor and I'm because my my I'm like you know me I'm an achievement whore I'm also

1994
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:19,140
such as for the Xbox so right now I'm like three four achievements shy from perfecting

1995
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:24,460
every single achievement within that game so I'm trying to get through that and then

1996
02:51:24,460 --> 02:51:29,740
I'm going to jump into a copy that my friend let me borrow a Saints Road three and try

1997
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:35,660
to get through that so my gamer add is so bad I have only ever got every single possible

1998
02:51:35,660 --> 02:51:42,980
achievement in one game one what my first one my first one was Assassin's Creed and

1999
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:48,920
that was a bitch mine you would never guess my perfect achievement game the only one is

2000
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:54,660
rally X on Xbox arcade new rally acts the remake because I did I used to legit love

2001
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:59,760
that game back in the day when I was a kid and so I'm I'm pretty decent at it but yeah

2002
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:04,220
that's that's the only one yeah I thought my second one was gonna be you know but yeah

2003
02:52:04,220 --> 02:52:09,620
some people can really mess you up in that game so still today so that's kind of intriguing

2004
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:17,500
so play rusty hearts too which is an awesome game if you like while I strongly just joining

2005
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:21,740
up with me whenever you see me on steam probably because I know we're friends play some rusty

2006
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:26,880
hearts with me man you'll like it trust me is this a free game or is this like yes hey

2007
02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:32,020
one or what it is no no no free to play it's absolutely awesome you can actually believe

2008
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:38,100
or not I made my own little guild within the game that that's how cool this thing is and

2009
02:52:38,100 --> 02:52:44,620
it's pretty much the sky's the limit and it's like how this point it's like wild type but

2010
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:51,100
also it's like when you ran through the dungeons it's more feeling like a first person scroll

2011
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:54,780
like you're going from room to room kind of like and you're being up on stuff but the

2012
02:52:54,780 --> 02:53:01,520
way if you see him being played it's really cool so all right well excellent any other

2013
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:06,460
quick shout outs you want to get out before we not really at this moment but also they

2014
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:11,380
need to quit putting the disc dlc within the disc and stuff and then charging double the

2015
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:15,660
money for that of the game with that that's getting ridiculous they really need to quit

2016
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:19,100
on that I understand they're trying to make some extra money but it's really seriously

2017
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:22,940
getting out of hand I agree with a lot of people on that subject it's gone too far all

2018
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:27,420
right excellent you take care buddy enjoy the various games and at one some one of these

2019

lots of enemies well I would offer to play you some time but you probably would uh absolutely

2052

2057
02:57:25,060 --> 02:57:28,820
because you know copyright and all that stuff all right one a seven seven game olr or a

2058
02:57:28,820 --> 02:57:32,840
username on skype is orange launch radio going back to the rob d question from earlier how

2059
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:39,260
do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show um you know obviously it's it's a lot

2060
02:57:39,260 --> 02:57:42,580
of it is the people and I don't know if I have like an easy answer for it you just kind

2061
02:57:42,580 --> 02:57:47,620
of have to make it a priority because if you allow yourself self to be like all oh but

2062
02:57:47,620 --> 02:57:50,720
the amazing race is on the night I really would just rather watch that instead then

2063
02:57:50,720 --> 02:57:54,060
it's gonna go kind of like fall apart like you just I think all of us have just kind

2064
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:59,060
of made like a commitment like we're gonna do olr no matter what now of course there's

2065
02:57:59,060 --> 02:58:03,300
gonna be some things that are more important and sometimes it's just because we need a

2066
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:09,960
break like Disneyland is Disneyland more important than olr yes well yes and no you know what

2067
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:15,300
I mean though if we did it every week then why would we do olr but anyhow the other half

2068
02:58:15,300 --> 02:58:18,820
the question real quick have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular

2069
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:24,140
basis yes it's called horde house and jamie had one for a while too and maybe she'll have

2070
02:58:24,140 --> 02:58:29,420
something new in the future as far as pre-recorded segments for the show um I don't know if that's

2071
02:58:29,420 --> 02:58:35,340
a suggestion but I'm always open to ideas there was I will say admit this there was

2072
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:38,920
a time where we were talking about doing not break music in the middle but something else

2073
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:43,220
so you never know what might happen here at olr we got another call coming in let's go

2074
02:58:43,220 --> 02:58:47,820
to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's ronma hey rama what's up buddy not

2075
02:58:47,820 --> 02:58:53,360
too much um I do have a couple things I want to discuss but rama yet again I have a bone

2076
02:58:53,360 --> 02:59:00,620
to pick with you me yeah you me yeah you what I do now all right I I missed part of the

2077
02:59:00,620 --> 02:59:08,900
show so before I go charging at you with guns blazing what is this comparison to hipsters

2078
02:59:08,900 --> 02:59:13,660
and video games something like that could you kind of explain that to me oh I don't

2079
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:19,300
even know what the hell was that about now I can't remember what happened two hours ago

2080
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:25,660
it was about um comparing because they were saying that you know well you know a console

2081
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:32,280
without a disk drive would sell well because the I was the ipad or not the ipad the one

2082
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:37,500
of the macbook um errors or whatever oh yeah you and you said everybody that owned my said

2083
02:59:37,500 --> 02:59:43,620
well the only problem so you need to go at loki not at me well no I didn't call gamers

2084
02:59:43,620 --> 02:59:49,580
hipsters a buck huh that's what I do best no I'm saying the other people that buy macbooks

2085
02:59:49,580 --> 02:59:58,820
are hipsters or at least macbook errors you because I've got the thinnest book ever great

2086
02:59:58,820 --> 03:00:05,340
are you a hipster rama no but I live 20 minutes away from Williamsburg the east coast central

2087
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:13,500
point for hipsters yes this is very true yeah I don't hate hipsters I just hate shut up

2088
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:20,340

talking about renting video games from the video store do you just hate that you've rented

2094
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:49,220
the same game over and over again because I had to save and somebody else rented it

2095
03:00:49,220 --> 03:00:53,580
and you got it you had to start it all over again because someone deleted your save I

2096
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:57,560
used to actually take great joy in deleting other people's save games in fact I've totally

2097
03:00:57,560 --> 03:01:03,780
rented cartridges and just wiped every game on the cartridge and then I use the characters

2122
03:03:32,820 --> 03:03:37,380
we wrap up tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet there's still several tweets damn it I closed the

2123
03:03:37,380 --> 03:03:46,860
tweet window to bring up that Kid Icarus story um tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet there we go

2124
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:53,500
the Disney stuff again all right uh we got a tweet from tech color tweets us and says

2125
03:03:53,500 --> 03:04:01,860
do all of you really hate Minecraft it's actually quite fun for like 10 minutes okay hate is

2126
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:07,860
a strong word I do not hate Minecraft because saying I hate Minecraft means I I think that

2127
03:04:07,860 --> 03:04:13,140
people that play Minecraft are like like not smart and that's not the case at all no I

2128
03:04:13,140 --> 03:04:19,700
get why people like Minecraft it's not really for me I cannot like the I I don't really

2129
03:04:19,700 --> 03:04:24,100
keep in mind I don't ever really like to use hate because I think it's a very strong word

2130
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:29,500
in a wasteful emotion but you can not like a game and not give a crap about who plays

2131
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:33,960
it you know if other people like it that's their thing but you can completely loathe

2132
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:38,820
the game you know it doesn't mean that you think anyone else that plays it is stupid

2133
03:04:38,820 --> 03:04:44,480
you can say like I hate Minecraft players then that's you know so I hate is a word reserved

2134
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:49,640
for like doing my taxes I thought I was really boring I was bored but I love watching my

2135
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:54,520
Minecraft videos I'll give you that I like watching the people that are really into it

2136
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:58,980
online Alan watches a lot of these and some of them are pretty funny but like my mind

2137
03:04:58,980 --> 03:05:03,180
when it comes to that just like I have this big open palette and like just do something

2138
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:08,140
with it before the goblins you know tear you up it's like I don't I don't it's weird like

2139
03:05:08,140 --> 03:05:14,960
I don't know what to do now I want to find like I was kind of thinking about trying it

2140
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:22,060
again with the high definition textures I will say I did really try to do terraria though

2141
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:26,660
I couldn't get into it I really you sent me that copy I did I even got like a four pack

2142
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:33,140
and send it to my friends and I could get into it I tried it was too like there just

2143
03:05:33,140 --> 03:05:36,900
needed to be more structured kind of like I needed a little bit of hand I'm the type

2144
03:05:36,900 --> 03:05:40,280
of person that wouldn't play Minecraft the way it was supposed to be I would turn off

2145
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:46,700
the enemies and just build shit all day that's what I would do I like this comment from DK

2146
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:50,660
pop man in the chat I would think dark soccer would like it from an artistic standpoint

2147
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:55,260
because that's kind of I'm not really an artist but you are a designer I mean yeah but the

2148
03:05:55,260 --> 03:06:00,660
thing is I have the Sims I see so you kind of just have a different outlet for it and

2149
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:05,940
I don't really play the Sims anymore either I mean usually if I'm sitting down to do design

2150
03:06:05,940 --> 03:06:10,680
I've got in design open and am making something that I'm going to print you know or putting

2151
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:15,300
something in my portfolio I am not you know trying to poopoo on Minecraft at all it's

2152
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:22,580
just you know I really couldn't get into it I mean I might try it again but to be honest

2153
03:06:22,580 --> 03:06:26,060
I'm still trying to find a job right now and I don't have the time to devote to anything

2154
03:06:26,060 --> 03:06:32,660
else that's distracting me but yet you're still here at this show yeah I've been here

2155
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:37,860
for 10 years I can't quit now all right Tiger class is a couple news tweets here I want

2156
03:06:37,860 --> 03:06:43,700
to read hold on because I have to do this for something else coming up okay I'm going

2157
03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:48,500
to Tiger claw a couple tweets here Minnesota lawmakers seek to ban community broadband

2158
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:53,140
what the title alone that seems a little silly here look at the story from game politics

2159
03:06:53,140 --> 03:06:59,980
dot com Minnesota would do legislation meant to forbid community broadband projects joining

2160
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:05,220
states like Georgia North Carolina hf 26 95 bars any community from building a broadband

2161
03:07:05,220 --> 03:07:11,740
network within the state meanwhile the companies that provide broadband in the state are refusing

2162
03:07:11,740 --> 03:07:19,040
to expand their networks to unders underserved unders excuse me underserved underserved underserved

2163
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:22,500
and unserved areas within the state remember I don't get to see these in advance because

2164
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:27,940
they're Twitter topics they come in during the show a trade group representing the industry

2165
03:07:27,940 --> 03:07:30,900
and the state claims they are not behind the bill before lawmakers activists have their

2166
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:36,420
doubts why would this be why would you ban that I don't like I'm not seeing the other

2167
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:41,020
side of this what's the good it sounds like other states have already done this why would

2168
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:47,980
you ban it a recent post on a community action group called stop the cap revealed that George's

2169
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:51,820
bill has been effectively shelved by being turned into what is called a study bill okay

2170
03:07:51,820 --> 03:07:55,780
so it didn't pass in Georgia if you're a citizen of one of the many towns not served by a broadband

2171
03:07:55,780 --> 03:07:58,820
service provider it would probably be in your best interest to ask your state representative

2172
03:07:58,820 --> 03:08:02,460
not to vote for this bill what's the pros about this I'm not seeing anything any can

2173
03:08:02,460 --> 03:08:06,100
anyone think of what a pro would be about this bill why would this bill be necessary

2174
03:08:06,100 --> 03:08:12,900
is it that they don't want I mean I thought competition was okay chatters help me out

2175
03:08:12,900 --> 03:08:18,580
because I'm maybe the cable providers or whatever like saying hey why are you giving away free

2176
03:08:18,580 --> 03:08:26,540
broadband that makes our expensive broadband look less wonderful I don't know I don't really

2177
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:32,540
see I don't even really see a point to this but I know I don't get it either I'm really

2178
03:08:32,540 --> 03:08:38,220
seen waiting to see if somebody in check and kind of jump in here don't steal the government

2179
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:44,740
hates competition all right let's see another tweet from Tiger Claw here fraud claim dismissed

2180
03:08:44,740 --> 03:08:51,220
an ex-Infinity ward heads versus Activision lawsuit a state Superior Court judge dismissed

2181
03:08:51,220 --> 03:08:57,500
one of the fraud claims by ex-Infinity ward heads Jason West and Vince Zampella against

2182
03:08:57,500 --> 03:09:01,780
their former employer Activision Blizzard they originally filed a lawsuit citing breach

2183
03:09:01,780 --> 03:09:07,020
of contract they added two counts of fraud to that saying they never intended to honor

2184
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:11,860
their Activision never intended to honor their contract but the judge dismissed one of the

2185
03:09:11,860 --> 03:09:16,940
counts agreeing with Activision that the claim should not go forward however there is still

2186
03:09:16,940 --> 03:09:25,260
another claim of promissory promissory fraud and that will be on a trial starting May 7th

2187
03:09:25,260 --> 03:09:30,380
so one counts been thrown out but there's still plenty other counts to go and the chatter

2188
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:36,940
say we're all as stumped as you good good thought all right let's go to a tweet from

2189
03:09:36,940 --> 03:09:44,940
101 DK pop man tweets us tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1 I don't know how to answer

2190
03:09:44,940 --> 03:09:50,060
this I don't know enough about the game but you know what I do know an expert that we

2191
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:56,580
could go to to ask to answer this question so let's get them back on the line here if

2192
03:09:56,580 --> 03:10:03,540
they answer hi Shane yes okay I had to call you back because we have a tweet that I can't

2193
03:10:03,540 --> 03:10:08,780
answer I need your help okay okay because I know you can answer this 101 DK pop man

2194
03:10:08,780 --> 03:10:16,660
sent us a tweet saying tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1 because you if you want

2195
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:21,980
the full story which you really really do if you're interested in Mass Effect it is

2196
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:29,180
good to have one because I did say that you could just get the Genesis comic but no you

2197
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:35,260
need to play through one so you get the entire freaking story for this amazing trilogy jank

2198
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:41,820
inventory system and all yes because you only have to put up with it for one game okay how

2199
03:10:41,820 --> 03:10:47,180
long is the game how long is Mass Effect 1 um I will say that I've only done one playthrough

2200
03:10:47,180 --> 03:10:54,100
of it and I didn't do hardly any side missions I think I did it in about 10 hours oh wow

2201
03:10:54,100 --> 03:11:02,020
yeah I just ran through it conversely Mass Effect 2 I did everything I could and minus

2202
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:11,540
two DLCs and I did that in about 25 and I'm already past 20 hours on Mass Effect 3 Wow

2203
03:11:11,540 --> 03:11:18,780
all right well there you go that's all I wanted all right all right bye from the expert all

2204
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:27,140
right one more tweet from SSJ100 Matt beware Dyson this vacuum actually hungers and lives

2205
03:11:27,140 --> 03:11:32,540
yes someone made a Sinistar Roomba vacuum cleaner you remember Sinistar the game that

2206
03:11:32,540 --> 03:11:38,500
would say beware I live well it looks like somebody has made a Roomba out of that and

2207
03:11:38,500 --> 03:11:47,220
I'm linked to a YouTube here I've never seen before oh lord it actually has a sticker on

2208
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:54,660
it that looks like the Sinistar oh my god that sounds like an airplane jet about ready

2209
03:11:54,660 --> 03:12:05,260
to take off it certainly does suck oh I get it because it's a vacuum okay that's a horrible

2210
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:11,060
noise to be playing on the podcast so I apologize but did you hear that I live beware I live

2211
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:14,140
all right that's it for tweets twitter.com slash olr if you want to send some in for

2212
03:12:14,140 --> 03:12:19,760
next maybe funnier if you could do either the space core or Wheatley all right last

2213
03:12:19,760 --> 03:12:27,300
minute stories Loki anything no I wanted to play the portal Mario game thing which the

2214
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:31,300
more I read about it looks even cooler we talked about that last week I know so play

2215
03:12:31,300 --> 03:12:37,500
it for next week I want a full review I well I found out the download that I had done wasn't

2216
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:42,540
correct so I had to redownload it all right all right that's it we're at three hours plus

2217
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:46,740
we need to wrap up the show we've had a lot of long shows lately we're just very opinionated

2218
03:12:46,740 --> 03:12:50,680
so we're gonna go around at your base final thoughts so we can wrap up tonight final thoughts

2219
03:12:50,680 --> 03:12:57,540
from me I'll start tonight my final thought is just thank you chatters and thank you podcasters

2220
03:12:57,540 --> 03:13:00,200
who download our show and listen to us like I really mean it like I know I always say

2221
03:13:00,200 --> 03:13:03,680
it at the end of each show but just kind of like thinking about the motivation question

2222
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:08,620
and all that stuff like you guys really are a big part of it like you know I know we were

2223
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:12,500
still doing a show back when like literally there were three people in chat and we still

2224
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:16,060
had fun with it and you know I'd like to think that I would still have fun with it even if

2225
03:13:16,060 --> 03:13:20,980
it's only one or two people but you know the fact that more and more people show up and

2226
03:13:20,980 --> 03:13:26,440
the family is growing and all that it is a huge motivator it's it's huge so thank you

2227
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:34,940
I mean it Loki your final thought making a grand theft auto map editor in Excel is difficult

2228
03:13:34,940 --> 03:13:40,120
and probably not the preferred language or it's not even really a programming language

2229
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:45,740
but the preferred method to do such thing but programming languages seem to make my

2230
03:13:45,740 --> 03:13:49,920
head explode so this is what I'm comfortable with I'm not sure I even want to know what

2233
03:14:02,660 --> 03:14:08,580
Auto into edible form and then back into hex code again so you can directly import it because

2234
03:14:08,580 --> 03:14:14,380
the program that someone made did a lot of rounding with numbers and it really fucks
