00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:20,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, March 11th, 2012, a new iPad claims to do something Xbox and PlayStation can't.

2
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:25,735
[SPEAKER_06]: One UK retailer is in financial trouble, and could the next Xbox be disk drive free?

3
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:36,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live with episode number 449 of our show for this March 11th of 2012.

6
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,959
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.

7
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,441
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

9
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:54,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Full.

10
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:56,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Full, full of orange chicken I see.

11
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:56,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

12
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:58,023
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my weaknesses.

13
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:01,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my DNA compelled me to eat it.

14
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Panda Express is like Starbucks around here.

15
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:05,566
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a crack.

16
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:12,928
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a place like, there's literally, you can go to a mall and there's Panda Express in the food court and then right next door in the other mall is another Panda Express.

17
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all next door to Starbucks.

18
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it works around here.

20
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, also say hello to, you know he loves his food too, say hello to Tech Master Loki!

21
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:23,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

22
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:24,634
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:24,814 --> 00:01:25,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

24
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You went pretty basic with your food choice tonight.

25
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:29,055
[SPEAKER_02]: You went to the McDonald's.

26
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:39,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was because I just, there's not, like I said, there's not a lot here to, or from my house to, you know, your apartment, so.

27
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

28
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:44,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like, like a ton of McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and...

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,200
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this part of town is really sad when it comes to food.

31
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:55,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, unless I pull off the freeway mid-trip, there wasn't really much for me to have.

32
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to go to Quiznos, but I was like, I had Quiznos yesterday.

33
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:04,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I had pizza yesterday, so I was like, I'll just have McDonald's.

34
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't be that bad.

35
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:08,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually pretty terrible, but it's all right.

36
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:11,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been not eating McDonald's, so, you know.

37
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:13,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Burger King is the way to go.

38
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,411
[SPEAKER_02]: At least our food is palatable.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:03:01,171
[SPEAKER_02]: and again 6 Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and join us live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters are not too happy about us bringing up food Uni starts us off tonight saying OMG dang you for mentioning Panda I want it now lol and they don't even pay us for these ads these free ads that we're giving away here on the show we need to put the clamp down on that alright no more freebies meh

40
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my food from Redacted.

41
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:34,620
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

42
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I finally started playing it, and while I'll save my opinions for a little bit here... I think it was the same year as Rock Band.

43
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it really?

44
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:05,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, within a week.

45
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:12,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I figure they come out about every other year, except for, I think, Mass Effect 2 originally had been bumped back.

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was a January release, wasn't it?

47
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:19,675
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3 it was, because that came out a year later, I think.

48
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have sworn that when Mass Effect 2 came out, it was really early in the year because when it got a lot of Game of the Year awards, people were like, that came out this year?

49
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it came out like right after Christmas.

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but anyway, this isn't about necessarily just the timing of things, but what I really wanted to ask was, has there ever been a game that just, it seemed like you missed the boat on it for so long, it just took you so long to get into it, and years later, here you are finally playing it?

51
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had a game like that where it took you like five years to get into it?

52
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't think of very many because I really can't play a lot of console stuff anymore.

53
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:53,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because of your hand and stuff.

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Mario Kart 7 for the first time yesterday.

56
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't make me throw up.

57
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:26,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's good.

58
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I let you play Mario Kart 7 when I got it.

59
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

60
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Loki's Ridge Racer.

61
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:33,365
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it, and it made me sick.

62
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:34,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's too bad.

63
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, anything you can think of that was a little bit delayed for you?

64
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

65
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:45,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, you've just been talking about the first game not that long ago, huh?

66
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:49,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're gonna be going to three pretty soon, I think.

67
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I asked them, like, hey, you guys wanna do number two?

68
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:57,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if we're gonna move to another game, we're gonna go to the latest one.

69
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Black Ops or anything, because...

70
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really into the Cold War stuff.

71
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We're more into the Modern Warfare stuff.

72
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:58,377
[SPEAKER_02]: probably five games were new that's a man I wish that was a goal I could realistically accomplish but I never beat games I really should force myself to but there's just there's so much other stuff I have to tackle that I wouldn't want to give myself a goal like that that's that's a lot that's up there with reading a hundred books in a year or something like that BlackWolf in chat says Beatmania 2DX I think I can think of one for you DarkSakra World of Warcraft

73
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it right at the beginning, though, too.

74
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, you did.

75
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, I had a vanilla account.

76
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I forgot about that.

77
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,631
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

78
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:09,377
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD says, playing new games is overrated.

79
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's usually a lot cheaper if you wait, that's for sure.

80
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally beat every single puzzle in Best Move for iOS.

81
00:07:34,103 --> 00:08:00,235
[SPEAKER_10]: and um it was pretty epic now I want them to release some more so that I can get more puzzles um I started another game called Star Mine that I bought on name alone and it's actually a pretty fun little puzzle game it's like a block sliding kind of game and then um I played some while on Sonic CD all right yeah there you go Loki

82
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I played just a few games this week other than Call of Duty.

83
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:15,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Played a little bit of the new Vita game, Motorstorm RC, which is pretty cool.

84
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different than a regular Motorstorm game.

85
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:22,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like a Super Sprint or Ivan Ironman, Stewards, Super Offroad type thing.

86
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:37,021
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've been playing that a bit and one of the things I was trying to do was beat because they have ghost data that you race basically in the game and so I was trying to beat that stuff and I was pretty happy that I was able to beat the ghost data that was in there.

87
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:38,841
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:13,589
[SPEAKER_04]: well it's not terrible but hey it's free so I guess you can't complain um

89
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:15,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

90
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:17,018
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little frustrating.

91
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I kind of ran the same thing with some of the other Ghost Data that I raced where I beat it and find out that, oh, look, I'm still ranked 3,000.

92
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:30,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, oh, there's times they're faster than mine.

93
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then why wasn't that the Ghost Data that I was racing?

94
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:35,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all really weird.

95
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:39,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I complained to, of course, got to complain to them, Bill.

96
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, bitch, I know this shit was free.

97
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:42,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say in an angry tweet?

98
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:44,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I did say in an angry tweet to...

99
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,107
[SPEAKER_02]: at PlayStation.

100
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

101
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are your games broken?

102
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:51,609
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, see, you would think it's at PlayStation, but no, it's at MotorStormRC.

103
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,831
[SPEAKER_04]: They have their own fucking Twitter account, and I'm like, what the fuck?

104
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:58,773
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't beat this goddamn ghost lap because it only does three of the four laps.

105
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We're aware of the issue.

106
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,268
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on it.

107
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of did something similar this week.

108
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:04,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent a tweet.

109
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: This is serious, not a joke.

110
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent a tweet to Awake NBC and I sent a tweet that said, please don't get cancelled.

111
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like the show and apparently not a lot of people are watching it.

112
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sent them a tweet and I said, please don't get cancelled.

113
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:18,796
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't reply to me.

114
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:19,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they've already been cancelled.

115
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

116
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:23,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That was alright.

117
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a little bit of that.

118
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of things that are a little frustrating with me.

119
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:30,646
[SPEAKER_04]: The camera is really annoying.

120
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:33,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish this game was a first person driving game.

121
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand maybe the camera is top down because one, it's an RC game.

122
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, but I've played other RC games that were first person or at least behind the car type thing, not this

123
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to figure it out from the top of the track.

124
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be about your love of Excite Truck again?

125
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,050
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not going to be about Excite Truck.

126
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was a racing game that was on, I think it was Revolt, was actually on the PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1.

127
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually pretty cool.

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an RC game.

129
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's a little frustrating though.

130
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:12,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you're racing, it's hard to see some of the track, get the really mess of the camera to, you know, get it just right.

131
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course they have cars you can buy, which...

132
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:40,203
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as I'm aware they don't have stats on those cars so I don't know what any of these other cars that I'm unlocking do other than different types and assuming the different types handle differently but as far as different cars within the same type I think it's just the way they look um I did download the free cake car that you can it's a cake slice car um

133
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:42,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was free.

134
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,045
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

135
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:49,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Luminous on the Vita as well.

136
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:56,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through and I decided, hey, I'm going to beat all the leaderboards on here, at least within my friends.

137
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I did that.

138
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I beat all the leaderboards and last I checked and I was on top of all of them.

139
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:28,080
[SPEAKER_04]: except for obviously uh some of the higher uh master class stuff because I haven't beat the master thing yet that's like really frustrating just trying to get all the trophies for that game um oh and ranked up to 50 because for some reason when I play Luminous it's actually when they start doing the world cube thing and you level up like 30 levels just by checking it once I still can't

140
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

141
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:51,030
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 or 9 p.m.

142
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific

143
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, with the time change and everything, it might be 7 to 8 p.m.

144
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:12,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific.

145
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:15,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's pretty much all I played.

146
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

147
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,482
[SPEAKER_02]: My Gaming Week.

148
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk about a few things I've been playing this week.

149
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,044
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been a few things.

150
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:22,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, first off is Mass Effect.

151
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:24,648
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't played it enough.

152
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, A, do you really want me to review a five-year-old game?

153
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I think...

154
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:41,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of you probably know how you feel, but since I did see somebody earlier had said they haven't played it and DarkSakura hasn't played it, I'll just quickly say, well, I haven't played enough to give you a full review, but I'll tell you this much.

155
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I am way less annoyed by the combat than I thought I would be.

156
00:13:45,217 --> 00:14:09,789
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know Mass Effect is very much about like use cover and hide behind things and get things and that's like why I could not play Gears of War and it's not that I think Gears of War is a bad game it's not it's a good game but I that whole like cover thing like no I want fucking Quake or Unreal where you run out there guns a-blazing that's more my kind of shooter so I thought the cover thing would really bother me but it's it's not and I think

157
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be real, I think a lot of that is because I'm playing on easy.

158
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:18,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think my squad mates really pick up the slack for me, which is totally fine by me because I'm really more playing for the story.

159
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:26,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did find through playing Star Wars The Old Republic and a little bit of Dragon Age, I do like Bioware's whole little conversational style.

160
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do see where the game can...

161
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn well be two completely separate games depending on how you are playing it.

162
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that.

163
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:39,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like that, that it can go in the different directions.

164
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But little annoyances I have so far.

165
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the interface is just kind of crappy.

166
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I hear that they fixed a lot of those issues in 2 and 3, so I'm not going to really harp on it.

167
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:55,894
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me just say, I really value the one button maps.

168
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:57,675
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say.

169
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:18,287
[SPEAKER_02]: but those are kind of nitpicking otherwise what I think especially for five years ago was graphically a good game and you know um pretty I guess ahead of its time in some ways but um I'll let you know how things progress after I actually play more of it because if I told you where I was right now you'd be like oh Rob you barely touched the damn game um a couple other things I've played um

170
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Rune Spell Overture.

171
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:35,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if I talked about this game before on the show, but it's a game I bought in one of those indie bundle collections that I got a key for on Steam, and maybe I played it a little bit back when I first got it, and I might have mentioned it in passing on the show, but I played it more in depth this week, and...

172
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that don't know it, I would say it's a little bit Puzzle Quest 2-ish meets a solitaire slash poker hybrid.

173
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:58,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds really weird, but the way you battle enemies is that you kind of have a solitaire-ish hand, and then they have one, and you form poker hands by moving your cards around.

174
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't follow the rules of Solitaire.

175
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,101
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be red on black or any of that stuff.

176
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:08,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can take their cards too and move them up into your hand and you're trying to form like the best poker hands.

177
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:13,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, five of a kind would be the best one, which is more of a Yahtzee, but you know what I mean?

178
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:24,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, you kind of battle that way, but on top of that, you have spells, which felt a little more like puzzle quests because you can kind of activate those based on the power that you've generated.

179
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

180
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool little time killer puzzle game and I imagine it's super cheap.

181
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:34,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it in a bundle so I bought it when it was a very, very reasonable price.

182
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Soundtrack's good too.

183
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me throw that out there.

184
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:38,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty deep story.

185
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:48,280
[SPEAKER_02]: No voice acting but some dialogue questions and it definitely seems like there's a fleshed out story that I'm not far enough in to really appreciate yet.

186
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:50,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

187
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,322
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other things I've been playing this week.

188
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:52,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

189
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:55,461
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:08,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Journey

191
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:30,817
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

192
00:17:52,975 --> 00:18:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where to put... Journey is definitely more like a platformer, but don't think of it like a platformer.

193
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:08,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being very careful and choosing my words carefully here because I think Journey is best experienced not knowing anything about it.

194
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I will tell you this, I sat down and played Journey.

195
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't tell you anything.

196
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,443
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no dialogue.

197
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, you know, do this or you need to go here or arrow or any help.

198
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one little, you know, the little controller will show up and it will say, you know, A is jump.

199
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

200
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once in a while it'll kind of pop up.

201
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of left to your own devices to figure out what the heck's going on.

202
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:59,689
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a game that's told really through its soundtrack in a way like I just I found the soundtrack to be amazing and really moving and then there's a twist to it there's a reason why it's called Journey and some of you probably know but I don't want to ruin it for you if you don't already know the band pops out and starts playing you on your way therefore it's part of the soundtrack I wish, I wish that would make it even more awesome but there's a twist

203
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:05,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it happened, I was like, wait a minute.

204
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,757
[SPEAKER_02]: What the... Do you know what I'm talking about, Loki?

205
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you read about this game at all?

206
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read about the game, but... I'm trying very hard not to ruin it for the listeners.

207
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:16,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to tell you during the break or something, but there's a little twist to it.

208
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:17,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

209
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:22,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize what was happening as it was happening.

210
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:28,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, this is so... How do I explain it?

211
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,500
[SPEAKER_02]: As it was happening, I was kind of like, I didn't...

212
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Realize what it really was at first, and then it kind of hit me, like, oh my gosh, this is this.

213
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about now.

214
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:41,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

215
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

216
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:44,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really?

217
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:45,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

218
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:52,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but there, yeah, but you know, like, it's, and then suddenly when you figure it out, you're like, oh my god, I had no idea that this was part of the game.

219
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:56,842
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, again, I said there's no dialogue, and there's not a lot to it.

220
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:03,446
[SPEAKER_02]: You're finding all these interesting ways you've never thought about before to now play this game.

221
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:03,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

222
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:22,581
[SPEAKER_02]: and it can go a variety of directions it can go a very customary direction or it can go in a direction where I never saw this twist happen I'm just gonna ignore it I don't give an F I'm gonna go do this what I was doing before and the game still kind of works in both ways now

223
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:30,560
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I will say about it is that it's short.

224
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like two or three hours tops.

225
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a $15 game.

226
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may not sit well with people.

227
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:46,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fair because we've been taught to know that games like that usually shouldn't cost that much money.

228
00:20:46,944 --> 00:21:11,674
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do think it's a it's a really good two three hour experience and there is some replay value in it I can see again there's several different ways to approach the game and um yeah I would recommend it but I think that play time is going to really scare some people off but and I think a lot of people are saying this this game is very much the games are art in motion

229
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

230
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:17,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't necessarily say, well, Roger Ebert needs to play this game.

231
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he could appreciate it.

232
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: But as somebody who's had some pretty miserable experiences on Xbox Live and had to put up with trolling in World of Warcraft and so forth, the experience that this game brought was really organic and neat.

233
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

234
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's really all I can say about it.

235
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:42,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, some of you know darn well what I'm talking about and you're just like, just say it.

236
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you, there's a reason why I'm not telling you.

237
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want you to be spoiled on that and seriously avoid reviews.

238
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:57,322
[SPEAKER_02]: The value of the game will be so much more if you know nothing about it going in.

239
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:58,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

240
00:21:58,824 --> 00:21:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't spoil it for yourself.

241
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You might figure it out right away.

242
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:07,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's all I'm going to say.

243
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,227
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

244
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:10,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me move on.

245
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had one more game I was playing.

246
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one I'm going to pick up this week, though.

247
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to pick that up.

248
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

249
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:18,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to test it out here if you want to see if it's worth 15 bucks or not.

250
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,821
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, because...

251
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:49,502
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's again it's a pretty basic platformer the visuals are not I think it's a very beautiful game but some people are going to go it's all desert it's just the desert desert desert but there's some very beautiful things they do like there's one level where you're kind of it's almost like a race like you're falling down a hill and you're kind of like you know having to move like it's almost like hydro thunder or something and it's like you're falling through the desert as the sun is setting it's really gorgeous so I forgot that I had one more game you have one more game you want to add that's fine because I'm done what did you want to add

252
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:51,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing Doctor Who The Mazes of Time.

253
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that actually good?

254
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty good so far.

255
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:55,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that an iPhone game?

256
00:22:55,623 --> 00:23:09,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you play as the Doctor and Amy and you have to, it's basically one person does one part of the puzzle and maybe has to stand on something so that it activates another part of the puzzle and then you have to figure out how to get both of them through the maze.

257
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:15,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just a fun little, it's a dollar right now so get it.

258
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

259
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:18,069
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

260
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

261
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some housekeeping before we get into news.

262
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have something tonight.

263
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:29,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something I'm going to surprise DarkSakura and Loki with on air.

264
00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:31,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Because aren't on-air surprises the best?

265
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:32,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Lord.

266
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let me tell you about this.

267
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:39,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a package in the mail this week from our buddy Brad at PodCulture.

268
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:41,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the package that we got.

269
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea what it was.

270
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Cardboard!

271
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:46,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's cardboard, but there's something inside this cardboard I think you should see.

272
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:48,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, Jamie, I think are really going to appreciate this.

273
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:49,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?

274
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's what was sent to us.

275
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:54,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And listeners, this can impact you as well.

276
00:23:55,757 --> 00:24:01,198
[SPEAKER_02]: These are vinyl decals of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.

277
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one for you.

278
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:05,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one for Matt.

279
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:06,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the cool thing.

280
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:10,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't take that off because once you do, you're going to have to stick it on something.

281
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I check the ink on everything.

282
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,113
[SPEAKER_10]: You know me.

283
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:12,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

284
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:13,353
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a nerd like that.

285
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:14,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

286
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:19,175
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some extra decals here, and I'm sure we'll give those away at some point, except I want to keep one for myself.

287
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:20,635
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other ones in here.

288
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:23,816
[SPEAKER_02]: These are hard to see, but hold them up to the light, and you can see.

289
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: These are like the white silhouette ones that you see on the backs of cars.

290
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:28,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

291
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

292
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:33,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like the artist here took kind of like the art and did that.

293
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like the way that looks.

294
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

295
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:36,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

296
00:24:38,869 --> 00:25:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: assuming that Loki and DarkSakura like this the guy is gonna I think we're gonna try he's offered to sell the stickers on his site so you guys can get them too of course you know they're not free guys it does cost money to make but I know the guy will be reasonable about the price I wouldn't mention it here on the show if I didn't think that and it's you know Brad from PogCulture is our buddy and of course I didn't put the name of the site here in front of me but I have the letter here it is

297
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:14,861
[SPEAKER_02]: DecalMike.com There it is, DecalMike.com and we're going to see what we can do to get that added to the store so you guys can check that out.

298
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the listeners are demanding pictures.

299
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that... It's going to be hard to take a picture of.

300
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:21,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

301
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:25,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you have to remember it's a vinyl decal of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.

302
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:27,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've seen the podcast... With Flash it could work.

303
00:25:27,637 --> 00:25:33,198
[SPEAKER_02]: You already know what it looks like but they're like little stickers and they're about the size... How big would you say that is?

304
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:34,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The size of your phone.

305
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the size of an iPhone but a little bit more square.

306
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a 3x3 or 3.5x3.5.

307
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So those of you guys that have been asking for OLR merchandise, because you know it's been how many years we still don't have a t-shirt, I think we'll be able to jump on this.

308
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to our buddy Brad at PodCulture, and of course Decal Mike for the hard work there.

309
00:25:53,813 --> 00:26:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But Brad from PodCulture is the one that essentially, I guess for lack of a better term, fronted the money, I guess for that, or kicked around the idea to get that started.

310
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to him.

311
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

312
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's probably not going to show up very well.

313
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:09,549
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPhone will not do it justice, but, you know.

314
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

315
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:19,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're a fan of Airwolf or, you know, Back to the Future, there's also decals on Decal Mike's site as well.

316
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:20,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

317
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be honest.

318
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a chance to browse the site yet, but he has some other stuff too.

319
00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:26,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's stuff like from Airwolf.

320
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: There's World of Warcrack.

321
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the Thundercat Sword, the Stargate SGC decal.

322
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the shows that Brad talks about on his show.

323
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:36,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised at all.

324
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's some...

325
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's, you know, it's hard to interrupt this.

326
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:42,276
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, you know, the pod culture stuff.

327
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:42,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, his other shows.

328
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:43,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

329
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:48,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Type 40, Geekspin, and, you know, a lot of stuff from Occupy Wall Street.

330
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:50,679
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the Guy Fawkes mask.

331
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Adalic.

332
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Adalic.

333
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

334
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Loves it!

335
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting up a few pictures.

336
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, you guys.

337
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And listeners, if you want to get these stickers, I have to do some... They're not there yet.

338
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:08,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to do some DMs and all that stuff on Twitter and get that all arranged, but they should be up.

339
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:10,871
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll remind you guys next week about that.

340
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:11,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

341
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:16,898
[SPEAKER_02]: My 3DS friends are asking for 3D pictures.

342
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,119
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it's a window decal.

343
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in 3D.

344
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:21,343
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D is not going to do it justice.

345
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:23,846
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

346
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:25,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's get into some gaming news.

347
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Less about us, more about the video games.

348
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

349
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:33,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a brief little web stream thing for the PlayStation Vita.

350
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:38,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping for a lot more US titles, but unfortunately they're all Japanese titles.

351
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:44,242
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't necessarily mean that this stuff won't be coming out over here or in other territories other than Japan.

352
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:46,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But as of right now, it's just all Japanese titles.

353
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting off, one of the titles that got announced was Phantasy Star Online 2 is coming to the Vita with PC cross-play.

354
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to be able to play against people that have the PC version as well.

355
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:03,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go, your first MMO on the Vita.

356
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:13,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure how the online's handled, but hell, if anything, the old PlayStation, or not PlayStation, the old...

357
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:24,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega Dreamcast, Phantasy Star Online was able to work over dial-up, so Phantasy Star Online 2 working over 3G, maybe?

358
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Be kind of interesting.

359
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:32,329
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on when that's going to be coming out, probably later this year, but it's still pretty cool.

360
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they also had a... I really hope this comes to America.

361
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I really want this to come to America.

362
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:44,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked... I'm probably the only person in the world that liked Phantasy Star Universe.

363
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is not PSU 2, this is PSO 2, and it's PSO 2 because PSU was not viewed as very good.

364
00:28:52,817 --> 00:29:01,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless, I'm a fan of this series and I hope that we are getting it in America because I was interested in it when they first announced the PC one.

365
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I like playing Phantasy Star Online offline.

366
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,394
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of fun.

367
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:10,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then you'd probably like those PSP games were just Phantasy Star Universe but offline.

368
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:12,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, meh.

369
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one where you could have the pizza box.

370
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:17,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Had some really weird tie-ins, remember that?

371
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Pizza Hut stuff, that was funny.

372
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Colonel Sanders in there or something like that?

373
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:29,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me because I think Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell are like all the same people.

374
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:30,704
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

375
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:31,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

376
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand Wars.

377
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:41,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Another RPG that's coming out as well on the Vita, Legend of Heroes, or Dragon Slayers, The Legend of Heroes.

378
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's coming out on the Vita as well.

379
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also announced that Gundam Seed Battle Destiny will be coming out on the Vita.

380
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:52,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, I guess...

381
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:59,039
[SPEAKER_04]: The sixth game in the Gundam Battle series, of which I am not familiar with.

382
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I am assuming those were only Japanese releases.

383
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:04,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Not surprised.

384
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:10,947
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one that was unannounced that was kind of like, oh, we're going to work with the fans to make this happen or something.

385
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:15,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It just reminded me too much of Mega Man Legends 3, so I just tuned that out.

386
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, unfortunately, no actual US titles or anything like that.

387
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:23,997
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 E3 E3 E3

388
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:58,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, and yeah, I mean, if you think about it, three months from launch, that's almost E3, so why not?

389
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:08,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've already, you know, kind of announced everything that's gonna be coming out, first party at least, up through the end of the second quarter, so...

390
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:12,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make sense that any of those other announcements are going to be at E3.

391
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:16,371
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably going to be a little bit of a lull during the summer, but you're going to get a lot of fall games.

392
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:19,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Resistance and Gravity Rush.

393
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:23,214
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, Gravity Rush, that would be the June title.

394
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:26,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance is going to be the May title.

395
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:29,337
[SPEAKER_04]: April, probably LittleBigPlanet.

396
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:33,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now here's what I'm wondering, because this was a Twitter conversation I was in this week.

397
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:42,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was asking when LittleBigPlanet was coming out, and I was like, well, supposedly it's April, but the box art isn't even finalized yet, and there's a lot that seems like it's still up in the air in the game.

398
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:47,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the game may be awesome, and I'm totally down with that if that's the case.

399
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Box art's finalized, just aside from the ESRB rating.

400
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really worried about them rushing it.

401
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:54,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want a rushed game.

402
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:56,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be rushed.

403
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:59,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking at this point it would get delayed to summer because we just haven't heard a lot about it.

404
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because this was your launch title.

405
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's already been delayed.

406
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I think putting it out in March would have been kind of... I mean, it would have been alright, but I think it's good that they're spacing their titles out because they had two titles coming out in March and they're going to have one each month coming.

407
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Major titles coming out soon.

408
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,516
[SPEAKER_04]: At least there's a lot more releases than there were on the 3DS.

409
00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:36,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember when the 3DS came out, the next month was pretty much... SpongeBob SquigglePants, there was... SpongeBob SquigglePants?

410
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:37,822
[SPEAKER_04]: SquigglePants, yes.

411
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was SquarePants.

412
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:39,623
[SPEAKER_04]: No, SquigglePants.

413
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:40,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this his cousin?

414
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:42,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the one that was like WarioWare.

415
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:44,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he marry into the SquigglePants family?

416
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:45,666
[SPEAKER_04]: He must have.

417
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he changed his last name.

418
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

419
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just remember that the releases were a lot slower, but...

420
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's kind of cool.

421
00:32:56,593 --> 00:33:00,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see some other stuff.

422
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:10,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping, because it's supposed to be a PlayStation Network title, I'm hoping that Retro City Rampage will be playable on the Vita, because that would be pretty awesome.

423
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:12,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be.

424
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't have to push a lot of graphics.

425
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:27,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, now that the Vita is out and they're talking about it, now our attention starts to shift towards the next batch of consoles that is the unknown.

426
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:34,977
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be, of course, the Wii U, the PlayStation 4 someday, and the next Xbox, or whatever they're going to end up calling it.

427
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:38,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should do the Apple thing and just call it the Xbox all over again.

428
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Xbox.

429
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Xbox.

430
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:43,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, like, so confusing.

431
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously...

432
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to get to it later in the show, so I'll talk about it then.

433
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:51,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.

434
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:58,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why they're doing it because of their other series of hardware devices.

435
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: For anything, I bought a Corolla.

436
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,341
[SPEAKER_02]: or I bought a Xerox machine.

437
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:08,501
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things that we don't necessarily address.

438
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:12,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Xerox machines have model numbers, Corollas, and different car manufacturers.

439
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:14,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 2012 Corolla or it's a 2011 Corolla.

440
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:17,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, but people don't necessarily refer to it by that.

441
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fine.

442
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:21,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They can call the stupid new iPad.

443
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what people are going to call it?

444
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,467
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having an argument we're supposed to be having in 30 minutes.

445
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not get tonight's list?

446
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

447
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:39,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, the next Xbox, the new Xbox Xbox Lube, Xbox I won't even call it that other number name because that's just a stupid name and I can't believe everybody always calls it that How about the X-Sphere?

448
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:45,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear the new system will be full of skateboarding games Yes, I was going to say the next Xbox Atari skateboarding game

449
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:47,853
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow.

450
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:59,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The big rumor going around this week about it, and what's interesting about this rumor is that we had a very similar rumor five weeks ago, and I seriously think everybody forgot, but we kind of already had this rumor.

451
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:06,106
[SPEAKER_02]: But it made the rounds again that the next Xbox won't have a disk drive.

452
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:09,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, supposedly the code name is Durango, speaking of cars.

453
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:14,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the next Xbox is supposed to not have a disk drive.

454
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:43,250
[SPEAKER_02]: um there's you know apparently it's leaked out even though there was big NDAs and all that and you know of course there's a way these things happen uh the next Xbox quote will offer the quote from MCV UK quote will offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid state card storage although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as SD so if I'm reading this correctly we've gone from cartridges to disc back to cartridge

455
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:44,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

456
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Is what they're saying with the next Xbox.

457
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:10,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing like a proprietary format like the Vita.

458
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:19,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically for security because that thing was getting hacked to shit and publishers didn't want to make games for the system because they're afraid that it's going to get pirated.

459
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:27,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wouldn't that just be forward thinking on Microsoft's part that Blu-ray is going to get hacked to shit if it hasn't been already and they don't want to... A, it's...

460
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's involved with Blu-ray, so why?

461
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, everybody's now crying.

462
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:52,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the death of the used game market.

463
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the death of retail.

464
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the death.

465
00:36:56,345 --> 00:37:01,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you don't have a disc, therefore, there's nothing to interchange.

466
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is going to go belly up.

467
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:07,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, why are people going here when we're talking about cartridges?

468
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,449
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like the Vita to me.

469
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:11,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'll probably be just like the Vita.

470
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:12,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even matter.

471
00:37:12,712 --> 00:37:14,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna have a drive of some sort.

472
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:16,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not gonna just get rid of physical discs.

473
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's still gonna be disc-based.

474
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:20,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that all these rumors are full of shit.

475
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:21,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's their source?

476
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:24,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's some guy that said he was under NDA.

477
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:26,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm under NDA, and guess what?

478
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:27,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking robot.

479
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a giant 50-foot tall robot.

480
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:30,786
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the new system.

481
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:36,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't supposed to tell you because I was under NDA, but it's a giant 50-foot fucking tall robot.

482
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to be able to hear.

483
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:37,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

484
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:40,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a response to the Sony AIBO.

485
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a giant fucking robot.

486
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:44,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

487
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:45,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I was under NDA.

488
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't hear it from me.

489
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:47,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant fucking robot.

490
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:51,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that is about how credible this is.

491
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

492
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:53,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so fucking stupid.

493
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:59,739
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had all these... Because it's just feeding into the goddamn... It's just troll bait is all it is.

494
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,301
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

495
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can buy everything physical now whether the disc is going to be a blu-ray disc or it's going to be a cartridge or whatever it doesn't matter but there's going to be some physical part to it I don't think the cartridge idea is so far-fetched we know that those little memory cards those tiny tiny ass memory cards on the PlayStation Vita can hold up to 32 gigabytes and that Sony is charging way more than those cards are really worth

496
00:38:49,737 --> 00:38:56,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in a couple years' time, when the Xbox New is a reality, you could probably fit... How much can a Blu-ray hold right now?

497
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:57,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 20 gigs?

498
00:38:57,804 --> 00:38:58,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 50-some gigs.

499
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it even... Oh, God, I thought it was less.

500
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:04,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because I was going to say, you could probably hold more on a card than you probably could... I mean, USB drives go higher.

501
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably looking at something where you can hold more on a card than you can on a disc.

502
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:14,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that even might be... And to be honest, I mean, that might be the reason why they're going that route is because...

503
00:39:15,499 --> 00:39:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: They're worried that they're going to run into the same problem they do with the DVD9 format where they're going to basically run out of disk space.

504
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:34,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just thinking ahead saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't do this because we want to have some sort of support for whatever formats that are larger than this because we don't want to have to come out with a new console.

505
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:36,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Macrossbox.

506
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,948
[SPEAKER_10]: It transforms into a Valkyrie and flies away with your money

507
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't on super high-speed internet or has that type of bandwidth a month.

508
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sometimes in our big urban areas, we live in a little bit of a bubble, those of us that live there, thinking everybody has that type of connection, but they don't.

509
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine even, let's just say they do have a high-speed connection.

510
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Say we have a cable, okay?

511
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:19,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Cable, it's pretty fast, right?

512
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:20,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

513
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

514
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the time for digital only.

515
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:10,923
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not Microsoft's fucking problem nor is it something that Microsoft really I think has to concern themselves with because let's face it GameStops are going to end up like Blockbuster it's a matter of time

516
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:17,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just, the thing with, well, Blockbuster was a whole other problem.

517
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't necessarily that people weren't going to rent.

518
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:20,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just mismanaged.

519
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:25,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think people are still looking for physical stuff.

520
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:26,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why Redbox is doing so well.

521
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:27,990
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still looking for discs.

522
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, it's more convenient now to go to a kiosk versus a store.

523
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:34,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still think people are looking for discs.

524
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because they want to be able...

525
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:37,959
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

526
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:02,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to admit, if the new Xbox was announced as digital only, I would have a slight hesitation.

527
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:14,923
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but I would want to know what's Microsoft... Clearly, Microsoft systems are not infallible to hacking, so how is my stuff going to be protected?

528
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:43,566
[SPEAKER_04]: and also on top of that I mean if they put out okay if Microsoft said we're gonna do only we're gonna do digital only and Sony said we're gonna do digital and disc people are gonna go with Sony they're gonna they're gonna buy a system that's gonna have physical media or medium but yeah I think though it's getting a lot more convenient to purchase digitally but it's not there's a lot of factors into just convenience and unfortunately the publishers are not quite understanding yet and

529
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something to think about.

530
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:52,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a great point to this on Twitter this week that I wouldn't have thought about right away, I must admit.

531
00:42:52,860 --> 00:43:00,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought it was just a great argument for why this is definitely a possibility that the next Xbox may not have any type of disc format at all.

532
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though everybody's rabble-rabbling about whether it would kill the used game market and da-da-da-da-da, if they got rid of the disc drive and da-da-da-da-da-da,

533
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox wouldn't be the first person to do it in fact another company's done it another company's cut out the disk drive completely and they have the most popular fucking computer in the world right now that everybody wants who is it apple apple where's the disk drive on the ipad where is it how didn't they even release a laptop that specifically doesn't have a disk drive in it you have to have some type of like airport hub in your home and people are eating it up

534
00:43:38,413 --> 00:43:41,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Xbox went this direction, they would not be the first.

535
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:42,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

536
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you're comparing the average gamer with a hipster.

537
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:48,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, it's just not going to work.

538
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand that people that buy Macs, okay?

539
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about iPods.

540
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:57,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about Macs.

541
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki, I was listening to PlayStation before it was mainstream, okay?

542
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:02,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about...

543
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:06,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like the brushed metal finish on this system.

544
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so sleek and wonderful.

545
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:11,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't care if it has only one USB port.

546
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:12,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need those pesky USB ports.

547
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:17,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, look, Loki, I only value the Atari 2600 with the wood paneling finishes on the side.

548
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't bring me those little plastic refurbs because they're not the real deal.

549
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:25,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a four-controller system before any of you did.

550
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:30,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, the only reason they took out the... I have two Atari 5200s.

551
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:30,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

552
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:40,464
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason they took out the disk drive is because they're like, we want to make the thinnest fucking laptop ever, and they did it, and then people are like, oh my god, it's so thin, I'm gonna buy it!

553
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's a fucking supermodel or something like that, and so they did.

554
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, hey, I can't fucking install any software on it, and Apple's like, well, that's okay, because no software is really supported by our system anyway, so, oh well, you don't need to download anything.

555
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: My Rob the Robot is 100% organic and gluten-free, okay?

556
00:44:55,914 --> 00:44:57,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it at Whole Foods, thank you.

557
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:00,817
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, the Fairchild Channel app is totally underappreciated.

558
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

559
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:06,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if they're going to go the Apple route, why don't we charge $4,000 for the goddamn system?

560
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as long as it's sexy enough, people will buy it.

561
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's, you know, performance-wise, not quite inferior to the competition for the same price.

562
00:45:15,823 --> 00:45:16,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey.

563
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:16,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

564
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:19,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Duke Nukem Forever is $5.

565
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

566
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:24,507
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Japanese Sonic soundtrack is clearly superior to the American one.

567
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:32,679
[SPEAKER_04]: and if we're talking about like, you know, devices without Who shops at Whole Foods anymore?

568
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:33,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I go to Farmer's Market.

569
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,281
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if we're talking about devices without I just drive to Mexico.

570
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,582
[SPEAKER_04]: This drives and stuff like that and how well they worked out.

571
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the netbook nowadays?

572
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

573
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:44,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a format that failed.

574
00:45:45,104 --> 00:45:47,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I understand you have one, but I'm talking about the format.

575
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:50,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that the format itself failed.

576
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not making them anymore.

577
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not making netbooks.

578
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not making netbooks anymore.

579
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:55,042
[SPEAKER_04]: People like disk drives.

580
00:45:55,902 --> 00:45:57,283
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not making netbooks anymore.

581
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,184
[SPEAKER_04]: They still make some.

582
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're the old ones.

583
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:04,086
[SPEAKER_04]: They're clearing that inventory out.

584
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:05,787
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no new netbooks coming out.

585
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:08,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I like mine.

586
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,644
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also the Transformer, which Dan has, which is a tablet and a netbook.

587
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:20,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And last I checked, most games out there are probably not a few megs versus the typical application size.

588
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:22,809
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

589
00:46:23,169 --> 00:46:32,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want a system without a disk drive and you want it in a brushed metal finish and you want it to be sleek and have a glowing apple symbol on the back of it, then fine.

590
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:36,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You go ahead and purchase yourself a disk drive-less system and

591
00:46:37,776 --> 00:46:40,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't come crying to me when you can't install anything on it.

592
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:40,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look.

593
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:42,997
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing I want to say on this story and then we can move on.

594
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:49,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the fact that Microsoft was asked to comment on this by the gaming blogs, as to be expected.

595
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:53,580
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about it is that they didn't 100% deny it.

596
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you think you're going to get the line that says, Microsoft does not comment on rumors or speculation and the line, right?

597
00:46:59,662 --> 00:47:01,022
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the actual quote.

598
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:13,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend its life cycle like introducing the world to controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships.

599
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:19,288
[SPEAKER_02]: We are always thinking about what is next for our platform and how to continue to defy the life cycle convention.

600
00:47:19,848 --> 00:47:21,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that we do not comment on rumors or speculation.

601
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's just PR spin and the do not comment it is a little weird to me in a way it says to me why are you talking about the new Xbox we're still extending the life of the Xbox 360 stop focusing on this new Xbox and our plans for it there's plenty to go on the 360 but maybe I don't know this is crazy crazy tinfoil hat time ready maybe there's a new 360 coming out that's like the Microsoft version of the PSP Go

602
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:56,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard it here first on Orange Zone Radio.

603
00:47:56,718 --> 00:47:57,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Just throwing it out there.

604
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:58,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Just throwing it out there.

605
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's, well, maybe, maybe.

606
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, here we go.

607
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:04,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

608
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: All I want to say, but maybe the one mistake that Microsoft won't make that Sony did that ruined the PSP Go is that maybe the system is priced right.

609
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,709
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now, Loki, what's your witty retort?

610
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: My witty retort is no one's going to buy it.

611
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:24,453
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my witty retort.

612
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:27,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to do that.

613
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Only Sony makes those stupid mistakes where they're like, Hey, yeah, we just announced the Vita.

614
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:35,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and we're going to put out a new PSP.

615
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,200
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

616
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

617
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:41,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it's not going to have any sort of Wi-Fi built in.

618
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:42,004
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

619
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:43,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

620
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:45,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

621
00:48:45,587 --> 00:48:46,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

622
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's plenty more comments we're going to hear on this.

623
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,492
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I did want to say, though, one thing I forgot to tie this to is

624
00:48:53,427 --> 00:49:04,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The story that this ties into from five weeks ago, we may not have been hearing about that they got rid of the disc, but we did hear the rumor about they won't play used games.

625
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, man.

626
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:14,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I was over in China the other day on the production line for the new Xbox, and that leg was a good 20 feet long.

627
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,933
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 foot robot, I'm telling you.

628
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:17,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox GFR?

629
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:20,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking about things that are full of shit.

630
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:24,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Mad Dog McCree.

631
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:26,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, poor guy.

632
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate that game.

633
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:30,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna tell you a story about Mad Dog McCree.

634
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,141
[SPEAKER_10]: One day... One day... Shut up.

635
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:36,443
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was working at... Shut up.

636
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:39,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Serious.

637
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:41,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I was working at Cyber Station and we had a Mad Dog McCree.

638
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:44,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking hate that because I had to clean that bitch.

639
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:48,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have to wash Grandpa's balls?

640
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Not as often as you do.

641
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have to polish his knobs?

642
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:56,034
[SPEAKER_10]: That has nothing to do with the game.

643
00:49:58,136 --> 00:50:03,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, Mad Dog McCree Rob is having a spasm right now.

644
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:06,144
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just laughing at the fact he said balls.

645
00:50:06,745 --> 00:50:07,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it's radio.

646
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:10,696
[SPEAKER_10]: He's all red in the face.

647
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:11,396
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cute.

648
00:50:13,038 --> 00:50:17,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, a group called Engine Software is porting Mad Dog McCree to the 3DS.

649
00:50:18,242 --> 00:50:19,723
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be released on the eShop.

650
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:25,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And scores of gamers across the world go, why?

651
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Because honestly, that game was not very good.

652
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:30,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a sequel.

653
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,034
[SPEAKER_10]: How did that game get a sequel?

654
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:36,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It had it at Solomon's that was by my college in Alabama.

655
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Dragon's Lair on the 3DS out yet?

656
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,961
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and why isn't it?

657
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:48,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, when I think of Laserdisc games immediately getting ported to everything in the fucking universe, I think of Dragon's Lair.

658
00:50:48,848 --> 00:50:51,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately followed by Space Ace.

659
00:50:51,830 --> 00:51:00,558
[SPEAKER_04]: When I think of Laserdisc games, I think your average consumer that has the 3DS probably doesn't know what a fucking Laserdisc is, nor would be interested in Mad Dog McCree.

660
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one more question about Mad Dog McCree on the 3DS.

661
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:13,444
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, since you were very familiar with Mad Dog McCree and you touched that machine in all its places, was Mad Dog McCree in 3D?

662
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:14,725
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it wasn't.

663
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:15,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Then why is it on the 3DS?

664
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm deaf in the other ear, thank you.

665
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:24,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and they said that they're not even going to port it over with any kind of 3D added into that.

666
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:29,993
[SPEAKER_10]: And the quote is, and I'm going to read it, there's really no 3D in the 3DS version because how are you going to do that?

667
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:57,454
[SPEAKER_04]: you know it's funny how are you gonna do that is also probably the answer to um we're gonna need to sell this game how are you gonna do that when no one gives a shit about this game seriously that game is awful i guarantee you'll sell you know twice as many copies as you did the wii version which is probably zero

668
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:03,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loki, two times zero is zero.

669
00:52:06,037 --> 00:52:07,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the math lesson.

670
00:52:07,077 --> 00:52:08,317
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just put them together, it's infinity.

671
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know how much it's going to cost?

672
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,459
[SPEAKER_10]: $4.99 in US dollars.

673
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,480
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how much you're overpaying by? $10.

674
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:19,862
[SPEAKER_10]: They should pay you to play it.

675
00:52:20,563 --> 00:52:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, on the Wii, they were charging like $19.99 for it.

676
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:30,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that it's only $5 is still gouging you.

677
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:31,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

678
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:32,709
[SPEAKER_10]: They should pay you.

679
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:35,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually $15 overpriced.

680
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:40,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they should be paying you $10.01 to play it for them.

681
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:42,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So they can say, oh, people got our game.

682
00:52:44,235 --> 00:52:44,595
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

683
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:46,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen.

684
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:48,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they just put tits in the game?

685
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people would want to buy it.

686
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:50,237
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

687
00:52:51,418 --> 00:53:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in playing a game that has that kind of Laserdisc vibe to it, and even a western theme, I recommend that you pick up Gunstringer with the DLC that was out there for it.

688
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:07,670
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that game, the time traveler game that was on Laserdisc?

689
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:09,331
[SPEAKER_10]: That had the cowboy.

690
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:10,552
[SPEAKER_10]: That horrible hologram one?

691
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:11,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, that was awful.

692
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:15,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it in the arcades and it was a terrible game.

693
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked Cliffjumper.

694
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat technology though.

695
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:20,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was really Lupin and the Castle of Cagliostro.

696
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:22,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you could literally touch that guy's balls.

697
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Lupin is coming back.

698
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:26,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

699
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:31,038
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to talk about balls anymore?

700
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want.

701
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,321
[SPEAKER_04]: No, thank goodness.

702
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's talk about last week.

703
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:42,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And last week we talked a little bit about Street Fighter X Tekken and all the...

704
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: The screwy things that they're doing with the download content with this game.

705
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, all the download content for the game is paid unlock content, which is fantastic.

706
00:53:52,976 --> 00:54:04,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, those wonderful PlayStation exclusive characters, aside from, okay, you know, the guy from Infamous, because it just wouldn't make sense that he was on the 360 version, and also, I believe, those two Japanese cats.

707
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else was also on the disc.

708
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:11,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Capcom insinuates...

709
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:26,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

710
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the excuse you want to use.

711
00:54:28,623 --> 00:54:33,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, why are the beginning and ending movies there?

712
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: All the data is on a disc.

713
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:37,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that you can use that for compatibility.

714
00:54:37,548 --> 00:54:41,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, Saints Row the Third, for example, they have compatibility patches.

715
00:54:41,831 --> 00:54:44,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's even some other games that have compatibility patches.

716
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:49,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a free download if you don't buy the DLC, but you can play against other people that have the DLC.

717
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:51,657
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

718
00:55:11,897 --> 00:55:12,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though all the content's on there.

719
00:55:13,258 --> 00:55:14,078
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the game selling?

720
00:55:15,499 --> 00:55:15,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

721
00:55:15,919 --> 00:55:16,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just been out for a week.

722
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good so far.

723
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought maybe you'd know from your... I mean, it seems to be pretty good.

724
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:23,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't heard the day one sales yet.

725
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:25,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hear people talking about it like I did Street Fighter 4.

726
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:38,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, I'm not to profess that I am this fighting game guru guy, but I don't hear as many people talking about it nearly as I am hearing talking about Mass Effect or that we're talking about Street Fighter 4 when it came out.

727
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, I find that interesting.

728
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering if there is a backlash occurring, yes or no.

729
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know I'm not going to buy it.

730
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I, it's not even so much the content on the disc thing, although I think that's kind of skeezy.

731
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the whole, there's going to be an Ultimate Edition at some point.

732
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know they're denying it.

733
00:55:57,277 --> 00:55:57,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe them.

734
00:55:58,638 --> 00:55:58,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

735
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:12,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe them maybe I'm being a fool but I'm gonna go off track what I could go off Capcom PR statement or I could go off track record PR track record I'm going track record

736
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:17,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4, Arcade Edition, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

737
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:42,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, this is great, on top of that, the Xbox 360 version has an issue with it.

738
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:44,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take your local teams online.

739
00:56:45,242 --> 00:56:51,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stated in the manual that you can, and the PS3 version can, but the 360, meh, just doesn't work.

740
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So, fantastic.

741
00:56:55,265 --> 00:57:06,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And their excuse is, well, the reason for that is the difference between, or the difference is because of the architecture differences between Xbox Live, gamer tags, and PlayStation Network IDs.

742
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:12,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure of the technical details, but basically it amounts to Sony made it so that you can mix and match online and offline.

743
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:14,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft made it so you can't.

744
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Mortal Kombat allows you to do that just fine, so that's full of shit.

745
00:57:20,994 --> 00:57:22,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 3 allowed you to do that too.

746
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,237
[SPEAKER_02]: How old is that game?

747
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:28,361
[SPEAKER_02]: But you used to be able to do split screen and you could go on Xbox Live together.

748
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:55,415
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah and also you can do that in Borderlands you can do that in Call of Duty I think you can do that in quite a few things but sure whatever yeah um okay so real quick I just want to talk about DLC because it seems like there's a whole lot of issues there's even one with you know I don't think it's one of the stories we have about Mass Effect 3 and the DLC and stuff like that

749
00:57:57,252 --> 00:58:04,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to set some ground rules on what I think should be acceptable for DLC and what shouldn't as far as timing and that kind of stuff.

750
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:07,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off with pay to unlock content.

751
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:10,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I never think that that should be acceptable at all.

752
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on disc.

753
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:13,177
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying for it.

754
00:58:13,217 --> 00:58:18,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The content was done before the disc was certified and it's ready to go.

755
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:19,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all ready.

756
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They planned it out so that you're going to have to pay for additional content for your game.

757
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:24,641
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like...

758
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Day 1 DLC

759
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:44,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is fine because the reason for that, for example, in the case of Mass Effect 3, games certified a month or so ago.

760
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And during that time, they were working on DLC, which they got done.

761
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:50,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on disc at all.

762
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:53,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It may use some assets from the game, but come on.

763
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:58,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're using characters from the game, of course, you're going to reuse some of that, but a lot of it's brand new.

764
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put it out.

765
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:01,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

766
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I might take shit for this opinion, but F you, it's my opinion.

767
00:59:05,404 --> 00:59:15,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand the logic that the people that are hating on the Mass Effect DLC are using because the logic is you shouldn't charge me for something that was being... Or what is it?

768
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:20,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That you shouldn't charge for something that you were already making for the game before the game came out, right?

769
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like the logic, right?

770
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that was true...

771
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:31,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't you have never bought Mass Effect 1 or 2 because, you know, they were just leading up to Mass Effect 3?

772
00:59:31,824 --> 00:59:35,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of.

773
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:41,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you should never have bought Saints Row 2 because you just get it for free with Saints Row 3 on PlayStation.

774
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:45,877
[SPEAKER_02]: You should never have bought White Knight Chronicles because you get the whole game free with White Knight Chronicles 2.

775
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: White Knight Chronicles was there for a shit game.

776
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:56,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, their logic is, okay, well, you should delay it until you have all the download content out for the game and you just put it on disk.

777
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they didn't do that.

778
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:07,559
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually just got it to the point where the first batch of DLC just happened to be done a month or so after they certified a disk, and boom, it's day one download content.

779
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:12,283
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it has to do with value.

780
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:16,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Is what you're paying for really worth what you're paying for it?

781
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:28,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though I'm not to that point in the series yet and I haven't formed my final opinion on Mass Effect, I'm pretty sure that for fans of Mass Effect, the on-disc experience presented with Mass Effect 3 is worth the price of admission.

782
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:32,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Street Fighter X Tekken, you know what?

783
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:40,379
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of hardcore fighting game fans and for those individuals, the price of the stuff that's on the disc and even the unlocked stuff is probably still worth it to them.

784
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:41,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to knock that.

785
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:51,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, everything in that Street Fighter X Tekken has been devalued based on Capcom's history of how they treat fighting games.

786
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:54,174
[SPEAKER_02]: is what is on that disc worth $60?

787
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to me when I know in nine months it'll be down to $40 with everything online included.

788
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:03,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference to me from where I'm sitting.

789
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:12,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and if you think that that game, by the time that all the DLC is released, is still going to be $60, you are sorely mistaken.

790
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:18,079
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is going to devalue pretty quick, especially if it doesn't sell very well.

791
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at the last Dead Rising 2 game that came out.

792
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:25,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, off the record, didn't do that well, and it's already marked down.

793
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:53,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I think though like there's some companies that are just taking it too far like even with I don't even know if I wouldn't blame Volition because I don't think it's the developer's fault I think it's a publisher's fault but let's look at Saints Row the third aside from the DLC that they actually have made separately and beyond you know that you actually download which is fucking terrible so far and it's really sad everything else has been paid on locked content

794
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:54,955
[SPEAKER_04]: everything else.

795
01:01:55,155 --> 01:02:00,538
[SPEAKER_04]: All the little costumes, all the little special weapons, those are all paid unlocked content.

796
01:02:00,558 --> 01:02:02,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all stuff that was on there.

797
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of your pre-order bonuses, that's all paid unlocked content.

798
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:12,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, it's something that, okay, you get the first thing, a DLC that comes out a month after the game comes out.

799
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:15,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's not paid unlocked content.

800
01:02:15,347 --> 01:02:20,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, those special weapons or skins or whatever, that's all on the disc.

801
01:02:20,591 --> 01:02:20,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're

802
01:02:21,591 --> 01:02:26,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, paying money, you know, to have that right, I guess.

803
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of sad, though, that they're like, you know, the publishers are getting mad.

804
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:33,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even the publishers, the developers, or maybe a little bit both.

805
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:39,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Developers and publishers are getting mad that people are complaining about, oh, well, you know what, too bad.

806
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:40,979
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how we wanted to do it.

807
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:44,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, that's not really, I mean...

808
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:47,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Humor the consumer a little bit.

809
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're planning on releasing these characters, say these 12 characters or whatever, just don't put them on the disc.

810
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:57,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have it so you download them later on.

811
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:00,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You would be doing the same thing.

812
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:03,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know as far as infrastructure costs go.

813
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:11,703
[SPEAKER_04]: If actually having more than just a key downloaded from Xbox Live or something costs more to the publisher or the developer than it does just the key.

814
01:03:12,603 --> 01:03:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

815
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:47,391
[SPEAKER_04]: and then that way people wouldn't bitch about it and they'd be like oh my god this is a great value because look at all these extra characters Capcom supporting the game long after it's been out this is fantastic versus I'm getting fucking ripped off because all this stuff was on the disc already notice same thing you're providing the same amount of content but it's perception

816
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:49,315
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

817
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:40,329
[SPEAKER_02]: so in other words the DLC allows you to not get something you know is going to be shitty exactly I didn't give a shit about Jill or Shuma Garath as we call him slash her Shuma-chan at home because all the characters I wanted to play were in the game when Ultimate came out I was like oh cool we get to hear you we have a new game I know this might be I already know what the answer to this question is but I'm going to ask it anyway what would you think if you went online and then suddenly you're fighting against someone else who's playing as the Mega Man you don't want to see

818
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:42,619
[SPEAKER_10]: DC.

819
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd seriously quit the match.

820
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:52,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, I'm the same person that if there is one single troll in my dungeon run, I will leave party.

821
01:04:53,908 --> 01:04:58,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my time is important and I don't have to put up with shit I don't like.

822
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:05,159
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want a game, I'm going to buy the game regardless of what's already on the disc.

823
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:06,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really care.

824
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm going to try to wrap this up.

825
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:12,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is sending a link to the official DLC response for Mass Effect 3.

826
01:05:13,465 --> 01:05:29,137
[SPEAKER_02]: In a nutshell, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's kind of what we already know is BioWare's approach to this is that they finished Mass Effect 3 before they did the DLC, but in order to do DLC, you have to kind of put, and this is the part that's kind of more information,

827
01:05:29,637 --> 01:05:37,403
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put the seeds of the DLC in the game or you can't have the DLC interact with the game that's already pressed on the disc.

828
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:38,703
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes sense.

829
01:05:40,224 --> 01:05:42,546
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have the code that's going to access the info.

830
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think there's any problem with having an outline of we know we want to do this, this, and this later on.

831
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row clearly did the same thing as Mediocre's content did.

832
01:05:51,672 --> 01:05:53,834
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew what packs they were going to do.

833
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:58,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they advertise it from day one that Gangsters in Space was going to be an add-on eventually?

834
01:05:58,457 --> 01:06:03,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Neato comment from E3VL or Evil I suppose in our chat room Whatever happened to unlocking characters the traditional way?

835
01:06:22,358 --> 01:06:23,560
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not... You can still do that in some games.

836
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:24,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Some games.

837
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:25,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cost-effective.

838
01:06:25,442 --> 01:06:26,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not a Capcom game.

839
01:06:27,545 --> 01:06:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a... But that's a sad... I mean, it's a good question, but it's a sad question.

840
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:33,352
[SPEAKER_02]: What did ever happen to that?

841
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:36,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the modern gamer, seriously, doesn't really want to work for anything.

842
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence why they'll put up the 99 cent unlock thing.

843
01:06:40,615 --> 01:06:43,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, because it's instant gratification.

844
01:06:43,997 --> 01:06:47,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you exactly why that's not unlocked in the traditional ways anymore.

845
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Because back in the day when a lot of that stuff was unlocked traditionally is through playing through the story mode.

846
01:06:53,803 --> 01:07:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, most gamers are split between single player and multiplayer, and a lot of people are purchasing this game just to play multiplayer, and they won't even touch the single player, and so why make someone go through the single player when they're not going to play it?

847
01:07:09,704 --> 01:07:12,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Game In the same font as Game Boy

848
01:07:35,754 --> 01:07:37,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, a type nerd would pick up on that.

849
01:07:37,976 --> 01:07:38,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pick up on that.

850
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:41,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Except their kerning is really tragic.

851
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:48,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to say closed pretty soon on the top of it if things keep going the way they're going because apparently game is in trouble.

852
01:07:48,906 --> 01:07:51,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, game, we've already heard of some trouble going on there.

853
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:53,570
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't sell Mass Effect 3.

854
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:54,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't there.

855
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter X Tekken, you can't get it at game.

856
01:07:57,813 --> 01:08:02,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not good when the retailer will not sell the games people are looking for.

857
01:08:02,197 --> 01:08:02,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

858
01:08:03,338 --> 01:08:04,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly what's going on here.

859
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this exact same thing happened with Blockbuster.

860
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:21,587
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened was, when they get into these financial problems where they're facing bankruptcy, or I don't know if they've even filed bankruptcy yet or whatever, these publishers are concerned about getting paid for their product.

861
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:47,644
[SPEAKER_04]: and so they don't extend them credit anymore and so because of that they're unable to purchase games where in the case of Blockbuster Blockbuster had to purchase games through a distributor and the distributor basically covered they floated them the credit I guess some way and so basically they assume all the risk for them and unfortunately it sounds like there's no UK distributor although I

862
01:08:48,444 --> 01:08:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine that there's not UK distributors, or maybe at least someone that's not willing to float that kind of credit risk.

863
01:08:54,668 --> 01:08:55,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what's going on here.

864
01:08:55,729 --> 01:09:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're seeing certain publishers that are not caring, certain games and stuff.

865
01:09:00,391 --> 01:09:02,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm assuming it's going to be a lot of publishers.

866
01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:06,715
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're talking EA, Ubisoft, I can't remember the other one.

867
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom.

868
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure who the publishers are because I know there's different publishers in the UK.

869
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:21,967
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, you're going to see it's going to be specific companies that are going to stop giving them credit, and that's why they're not carrying the games.

870
01:09:21,987 --> 01:09:26,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just to further illustrate how serious this issue is, apparently game is behind on the rent.

871
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:29,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to pay some landlords in about two weeks, and if they don't...

872
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousands of jobs could be at risk, and that is obviously not going to be good news.

873
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:49,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is a company that's kind of circling around like a hawk that might be picking these guys up, and that would be GameStop, or as we call it here on Sunday nights at all games, Evil G. GameStop particularly is interested in the Spanish arm of the business, apparently.

874
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:55,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this has to do with the fact that GameStop did try to do UK before, but they closed some stores.

875
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:58,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't necessarily mean they won't buy all of game.

876
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish is of particular interest.

877
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:03,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Other countries, maybe.

878
01:10:03,236 --> 01:10:05,098
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just waiting for it to devalue enough.

879
01:10:05,178 --> 01:10:05,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

880
01:10:05,938 --> 01:10:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll swoop right in.

881
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee that they'll probably buy it because it just makes sense.

882
01:10:13,963 --> 01:10:16,825
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to come out of this.

883
01:10:17,066 --> 01:10:20,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is kind of probably past that point.

884
01:10:20,168 --> 01:10:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have to be someone buying them.

885
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:25,151
[SPEAKER_02]: and Picaruno is in our chat room and I know he's from over there.

886
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,413
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice thing is with the whole spring forward here, we did a little early.

887
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:32,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an hour early for the folks overseas to tune into OLR Live now.

888
01:10:33,056 --> 01:10:35,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Picaruno says, I have 15 pounds.

889
01:10:35,118 --> 01:10:36,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see.

890
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:37,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pounds.

891
01:10:37,259 --> 01:10:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pounds?

892
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because I can't see how it translates over here because it comes up as special text.

893
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:42,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 15 pounds of vouchers with them.

894
01:10:43,183 --> 01:10:43,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Need to spend it soon.

895
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:49,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I would recommend if you have any sort of gift cards to the game, get those.

896
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:51,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Just buy something.

897
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, buy something.

898
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:55,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Trade them in for cash if you can do that over there.

899
01:10:55,783 --> 01:10:58,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you can't in California, but if it's a certain amount.

900
01:10:59,246 --> 01:11:00,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buy something soon.

901
01:11:00,406 --> 01:11:01,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll have to be an older game.

902
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:03,288
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

903
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:36,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob Cares So it's The Vita version is going to have HD remasters Of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 With all of the trophies And crap that the PS3 version does They didn't say anything about Peace Walker though

904
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:44,242
[SPEAKER_10]: There is something that says they have a rebalanced user interface that's going to go a little bit more with this transferring system that's being developed.

905
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:49,565
[SPEAKER_10]: What the transferring is, is basically some type of cloud storage.

906
01:11:49,685 --> 01:12:03,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Title User Storage, TUS, where your save game is going to transfer via whatever that cloud is, and you can access it on both PS3 and on Vita without using Wi-Fi.

907
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's... How tiny the gamer memory is, because I completely forgot about transferring.

908
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:12,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for reminding me.

909
01:12:13,188 --> 01:12:15,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the Japanese release date is June 28th.

910
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: It's summer over here, too.

911
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:18,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

912
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:20,960
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

913
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:24,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner.

914
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,064
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing.

915
01:12:25,124 --> 01:12:25,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

916
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:29,267
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got different things available with the touch panel.

917
01:12:29,908 --> 01:12:32,790
[SPEAKER_10]: You have zooming like with your binoculars on event scenes.

918
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: You can close up in the cinematics.

919
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:38,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of working in those little features of the Vita.

920
01:12:39,175 --> 01:12:39,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

921
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:40,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, make the Vita special.

922
01:12:40,576 --> 01:12:41,177
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of neat.

923
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:42,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought I'd add that.

924
01:12:42,698 --> 01:12:42,918
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

925
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:43,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Release dates.

926
01:12:43,839 --> 01:12:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki starting off here locally in the U.S.

927
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yakuza Dead Souls PlayStation 3

928
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: GG, I don't know, something based off a toy.

929
01:13:13,153 --> 01:13:16,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they have a toy that's hermit crabs.

930
01:13:16,154 --> 01:13:18,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, crappy DS game.

931
01:13:19,175 --> 01:13:21,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Silverlicious, based off a book series.

932
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also on the DS as well.

933
01:13:24,077 --> 01:13:25,997
[SPEAKER_04]: The 4-in-1 action pack from South Peak.

934
01:13:26,037 --> 01:13:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bunch of really terrible PlayStation Network games.

935
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:32,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sounds like fantastic fun there.

936
01:13:33,720 --> 01:14:02,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Birds of Steel on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well Tales of Graces F on Playstation 3 Ridge Racer on the Vita kinda wanna play that but it's still not fucking worth it FIFA Street on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Reality Fighters on the Vita

937
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:05,987
[SPEAKER_04]: and let's see what else here.

938
01:14:07,814 --> 01:14:08,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be it.

939
01:14:09,998 --> 01:14:12,839
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.

940
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:17,301
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan on the 360, Mass Effect 3 gets released on March the 15th.

941
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:18,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Japanese release.

942
01:14:19,081 --> 01:14:23,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that means all the dialogue has been redubbed with Japanese voice actors.

943
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:24,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume so.

944
01:14:25,844 --> 01:14:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there you go.

945
01:14:27,264 --> 01:14:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: SSX also coming out in Japan this week on the 360.

946
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:33,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, it's pretty much the same story.

947
01:14:33,326 --> 01:14:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect is there as well.

948
01:14:35,127 --> 01:15:01,507
[SPEAKER_02]: and SSX but there are some other games coming out as well Resident Evil 5 AE or Biohazard 5 AE and Revival Selection HD Remaster Twin Pack so there's like a whole little like double games for a little less money Sengoku Basara 3 Utage Double Pack comes out as well as Shin Sengoku Musou Online Ryujin Ranbu comes out this week and that is obviously it's an online game is that Dynasty Warriors?

949
01:15:02,668 --> 01:15:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Slaughter Mania 5 Black Lagoon

950
01:15:29,102 --> 01:15:32,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cool thing is, it's a slot machine and then a chick with a big gun.

951
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,971
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, you're going to give me that money or I'll put a bullet in you.

952
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:39,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a slot machine.

953
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,096
[SPEAKER_02]: There's little like anime cut scenes with guns and cigarettes.

954
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:43,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the twin B one.

955
01:15:43,478 --> 01:15:44,279
[SPEAKER_10]: All sorts of vices.

956
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Also FIFA soccer on the Vita.

957
01:15:49,205 --> 01:15:50,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't shoot the players.

958
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no guns to be found in FIFA soccer.

959
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:53,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You can throw a ball at their heads.

960
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:53,749
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.

961
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:56,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the 3DS real quick.

962
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one game coming out from D3 this week.

963
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:03,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Onanoko to Mishitsuni Ittara comes out this week.

964
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:09,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what it is, but it's another game featuring girls in school uniforms.

965
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Dating sim.

966
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:10,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.

967
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:17,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the Dateline guys are going to show up at my house just for bringing that picture up on my computer.

968
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:19,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you from the beginning it was a dating sim.

969
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a seat over there.

970
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:22,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, no, Ko is like little girl.

971
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't import the game or what's-his-name will show up at your house.

972
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Hansen, is that his name?

973
01:16:29,332 --> 01:16:29,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

974
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:30,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy that game.

975
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:31,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we go to another country now?

976
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

977
01:16:32,374 --> 01:16:33,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, how about the UK?

978
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:37,078
[SPEAKER_10]: On March 12th, all zombies must die!

979
01:16:38,299 --> 01:16:40,301
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 13th, shoot many robots.

980
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:41,382
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a clever name.

981
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:42,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And warp.

982
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:47,407
[SPEAKER_10]: On March 14th, Journey for the PS3, which Rob discussed at the top of the show.

983
01:16:48,127 --> 01:16:50,088
[SPEAKER_10]: and ShootManyRobots on the Xbox 360.

984
01:16:50,828 --> 01:17:12,233
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 16th, Bit.Trip Complete on Wii and Bit.Trip Saga on 3DS, FIFA Street, Inazuma 11.2 Firestorm slash Blizzard on DS, Rayman Origins on 3DS, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 and Yakuza Dead Souls and I'll go ahead and say the 17th because it's the Sunday and we'll be here is Tekken 3D Prime.

985
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:16,794
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D fighting movies.

986
01:17:16,814 --> 01:17:17,514
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually Saturday.

987
01:17:18,871 --> 01:17:20,051
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, stuff.

988
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:21,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

989
01:17:22,152 --> 01:17:24,772
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

990
01:17:25,652 --> 01:17:29,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Loki, whatever possible surprise news story could you be talking about next?

991
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:32,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about the iPad.

992
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:38,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know, shocker, there was a new iPad announced this week and it's called the new iPad.

993
01:17:38,355 --> 01:17:39,415
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you hadn't heard.

994
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:40,375
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you hadn't heard.

995
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:41,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm full of lust.

996
01:17:41,736 --> 01:17:46,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much all the rumored stuff except for the really weird stuff that they started rumoring this week.

997
01:17:47,217 --> 01:17:47,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

998
01:17:48,257 --> 01:17:56,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the Retina display, it's got the upgraded camera that was in the iPhone 4S, quad-core A5X processor, and also a...

999
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

1000
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,550
[SPEAKER_02]: 4G connectivity.

1001
01:18:08,111 --> 01:18:12,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody's phone is starting to show 4G connectivity even though they're not 4G phones.

1002
01:18:12,474 --> 01:18:13,255
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on AT&T.

1003
01:18:13,515 --> 01:18:20,080
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because of the multiple different types of 4G networks that existed and they're all being solidified into the one that I think Verizon uses.

1004
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:51,305
[SPEAKER_04]: so those are out and of course it's going to range anywhere in price for the wifi version from $4.99 to $6.99 depending on how much storage you want or for the 4G $6.29 through $8.29 and they will go on sale this week March 16th fantastic of course with this they got to show that hey we can do games so they showed off a new Infinity Blade game

1005
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:53,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Infinity Blade Dungeons.

1006
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a prequel to Infinity Blade and looked kind of like God of War.

1007
01:18:58,251 --> 01:19:06,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also a flight sim game called Sky Gamblers that kind of looked like Ace Combat, and that was from Namco.

1008
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, no buttons.

1009
01:19:09,781 --> 01:19:11,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Still no buttons, other than the home button.

1010
01:19:12,504 --> 01:19:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you buy an iCade, which isn't an official Apple product, so they don't talk about it.

1011
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:17,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1012
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:37,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because they made a claim, there was a claim during the press conference where they attacked essentially the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and said, this thing does more pixels at once than a, millions, millions more pixels at once than a Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 because the resolution is greater than 1080p.

1013
01:19:38,054 --> 01:19:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: 1080 means 1080 by, and one of these suckers is what, 2000 something?

1014
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like 29-something.

1015
01:19:44,171 --> 01:19:48,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, graphics aren't everything.

1016
01:19:48,272 --> 01:19:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a really beautiful game that controls like shit, and it will be terrible.

1017
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:55,935
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also how the developers utilize it.

1018
01:19:55,955 --> 01:20:06,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because you have to up-res everything, or you have to make your games actually utilize that stuff in order for it to work out, plus the hardware and everything.

1019
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:07,555
[SPEAKER_04]: limitations there.

1020
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:16,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong, those games are probably going to look really nice, but do I really want a game that controls via tilt or touchscreen?

1021
01:20:16,941 --> 01:20:25,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some of the touchscreen stuff, I mean, Infinity Blade was alright with touchscreen, but it's just... I don't know.

1022
01:20:25,945 --> 01:20:26,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

1023
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:36,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Brag about your resolution of your screen and stuff like that, but at the same time, also, you gotta remember you do have some faults.

1024
01:20:36,462 --> 01:20:40,484
[SPEAKER_10]: There are people that are completely swayed by SHINee, so... Well, I'm not going to lie.

1025
01:20:40,524 --> 01:20:41,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I still kind of want one.

1026
01:20:41,645 --> 01:20:45,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... I don't feel like I need one right away at this point.

1027
01:20:45,747 --> 01:20:48,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, not even from a game standpoint.

1028
01:20:48,749 --> 01:20:53,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, I want to watch movies in bed on that thing because there's not going to be a better screen than that.

1029
01:20:53,091 --> 01:20:55,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a Vita, you know.

1030
01:20:55,653 --> 01:20:56,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cry me a river.

1031
01:20:56,553 --> 01:20:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be okay not having one of those day one.

1032
01:20:58,522 --> 01:21:02,164
[SPEAKER_10]: And see, I was actually already planning on getting one because I have a legitimate need of it for school.

1033
01:21:02,184 --> 01:21:03,725
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some really good note-taking apps.

1034
01:21:04,585 --> 01:21:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have the whole iUniversity book thing now, too, that's pretty cool.

1035
01:21:08,027 --> 01:21:18,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, there's also an app that will let you type in your notes and it timestamps your notes in conjunction with where you started it in the lecture while it records the lecture.

1036
01:21:18,992 --> 01:21:21,193
[SPEAKER_10]: And for me, with my hand, that's perfect.

1037
01:21:21,653 --> 01:21:49,314
[SPEAKER_10]: because then I can record my lecture and actually take notes and say this slide was used at this point or this and that and the other was used at that point which I'm using my notebook already yes I'm using my notebook which is just fine but for my hand problems you know typing on an iPad will be easier so I'm actually now that the new ones are you know there I'm going to get one that's the plan anyway I have a legitimate need for it I'm buying it for school

1038
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:55,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I probably don't even have to ask you how you feel about the new iPad.

1039
01:21:56,143 --> 01:22:01,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, just to go back to our chat room at chat.orange.com, Amiga777 says, Really?

1040
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,050
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually going to be the real name?

1041
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:05,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that the article I read was going to be a joke.

1042
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that the name is the new iPad.

1043
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:08,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the name.

1044
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:10,718
[SPEAKER_02]: The name is iPad.

1045
01:22:11,769 --> 01:22:12,249
[SPEAKER_02]: iPad 3 or iPad HD

1046
01:22:35,436 --> 01:22:36,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say iPad HD.

1047
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:40,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I still don't know why they gotta be all stubborn about it.

1048
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not gonna put a number on it.

1049
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,942
[SPEAKER_04]: You make it sound like we release these things every few years or something.

1050
01:22:44,982 --> 01:22:45,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what the hell?

1051
01:22:46,043 --> 01:22:48,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's branding and marketing.

1052
01:22:48,805 --> 01:22:49,425
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

1053
01:22:51,252 --> 01:22:54,114
[SPEAKER_10]: They do it that way because they have to do it that way.

1054
01:22:54,715 --> 01:23:01,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they want people, when you think of iPad, they want you to think of the newest, best version of it that they have.

1055
01:23:02,201 --> 01:23:02,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

1056
01:23:03,802 --> 01:23:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel bad for those that can't tell the difference.

1057
01:23:07,044 --> 01:23:13,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there will be people out there that buy iPad off Craigslist and get one of those first generation iPads.

1058
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:15,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the buyer beware.

1059
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:16,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1060
01:23:16,532 --> 01:23:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, I feel a little bad for those people.

1061
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:20,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't.

1062
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:24,844
[SPEAKER_10]: If they didn't take the time to contact the seller and verify it, that's their fault.

1063
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more story before the classic game of the week.

1064
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is... Rock Band!

1065
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:33,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1066
01:23:34,788 --> 01:23:35,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Still relevant.

1067
01:23:36,508 --> 01:23:37,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I'm not talking about Rock Band 4.

1068
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that.

1069
01:23:39,209 --> 01:23:41,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I gotta admit, this is a really nice thing to hear.

1070
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix has basically commented that Rock Band releases aren't stopping.

1071
01:23:47,431 --> 01:23:55,153
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the few things to come out of Game Developers Conference 2012, Harmonix says, quote, We've been really pleased with the continued performance of Rock Band downloadable content.

1072
01:23:55,533 --> 01:24:04,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We've delivered over four years of weekly DLC and over 3,500 songs to the music platform, and we have no plans to stop weekly releases anytime soon.

1073
01:24:04,835 --> 01:24:11,498
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a song you still want, Rock Band folks encourage you to go look at the Facebook app that they have and vote for artists on the wish list.

1074
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:17,782
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of makes me wonder if Guitar Hero is ever going to come back because how can you compete with that kind of a library?

1075
01:24:19,002 --> 01:24:19,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be difficult.

1076
01:24:20,183 --> 01:24:24,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmonix, by the way, also said they have no intentions of doing Rock Band 4 this year.

1077
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some other projects going on right now.

1078
01:24:26,946 --> 01:24:33,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe Rock Band is on the back burner until the next, you know, Xbox or PlayStations are being talked about.

1079
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:35,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe some of those features being used.

1080
01:24:35,808 --> 01:24:37,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm strangely okay with this.

1081
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:43,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as much as I love Rock Band and would love to see a Rock Band 4, I kind of get where, well, maybe there's not a whole lot else you can do with it.

1082
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:49,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to them for continuing to support the game with true DLC.

1083
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:51,153
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1084
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: True, reasonably priced, varied, not on the disc DLC.

1085
01:24:56,454 --> 01:24:56,994
[SPEAKER_02]: DLC.

1086
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:58,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1087
01:24:59,276 --> 01:25:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is continuing to support it.

1088
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:04,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they say that they're going to support it weekly, they support it weekly.

1089
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:08,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And they continue to support it, unlike some companies.

1090
01:25:09,164 --> 01:25:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami.

1091
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:12,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1092
01:25:33,823 --> 01:25:34,504
[SPEAKER_02]: has a song.

1093
01:25:34,624 --> 01:25:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy the obscurity of that stuff.

1094
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That might have been the first DLC bundle.

1095
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:39,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

1096
01:25:39,627 --> 01:25:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that was the one you talked about a lot.

1097
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:41,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?

1098
01:25:41,789 --> 01:25:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's take a look.

1099
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:44,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can look it up.

1100
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:48,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it when it first came out and I already forgot, sorry.

1101
01:25:49,915 --> 01:25:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: But now Rhythm Party, if you have all the DLC, is up to like, I don't know, 20, no, about 20 songs maybe?

1102
01:25:58,385 --> 01:25:58,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake!

1103
01:25:58,605 --> 01:25:58,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake!

1104
01:26:26,272 --> 01:26:26,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1105
01:26:26,592 --> 01:26:33,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, if Alan can do Half-Life while I'm gone, then I can do Quake.

1106
01:26:34,215 --> 01:26:40,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Quake is... If you don't know what Quake is, then you need to get out from under the rock that you've been under for the last 20 years.

1107
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Quake is a first-person shooter game that came out by...

1108
01:26:46,218 --> 01:26:48,160
[SPEAKER_10]: The same people that gave us Doom.

1109
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprise, surprise.

1110
01:26:51,043 --> 01:26:53,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And it spawned a whole series of games.

1111
01:26:53,205 --> 01:26:55,027
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually came out on Steam on August 3rd, 2007.

1112
01:26:57,108 --> 01:27:17,370
[SPEAKER_10]: basically you have to go navigate through the level and you face enemies and you have to open doors and do different things but when you start a level you have three different pathways it's an easy medium and hard skill level and to get to like the nightmare level you have to go into a secret passageway and stuff

1113
01:27:18,451 --> 01:27:27,153
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, you've got different episodes of about eight levels each, and there's even a low-gravity episode, too.

1114
01:27:28,413 --> 01:27:34,215
[SPEAKER_10]: But you collect all these different items, and you carry them on to the next level, and then the next level gets, you know, more challenging.

1115
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:40,516
[SPEAKER_10]: When you die, you have to restart at the beginning of that level, but you can save your game as many times as you want.

1116
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:43,077
[SPEAKER_10]: You also do have multiplayer, like a deathmatch.

1117
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:45,597
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got, I think there was Capture the Flag?

1118
01:27:46,118 --> 01:27:46,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1119
01:27:46,758 --> 01:27:47,358
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean...

1120
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:48,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1121
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to switch from the ambient noises to the actual music here.

1122
01:28:20,223 --> 01:28:30,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty much what happened with this game after that.

1123
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:35,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a VGA full color game.

1124
01:28:35,856 --> 01:28:37,357
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an ASCII version of it, did you know that?

1125
01:28:38,183 --> 01:28:39,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did know that.

1126
01:28:39,704 --> 01:28:41,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an ASCII version of Quake.

1127
01:28:42,165 --> 01:28:44,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where the Quake engine went with this.

1128
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:49,167
[SPEAKER_10]: That game engine has been in so many other games.

1129
01:28:49,227 --> 01:28:56,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically it uses, it was polygon models instead of the sprites, you know, the way that Doom did it.

1130
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:01,392
[SPEAKER_10]: You have full 3D level design, different light maps that are pre-rendered.

1131
01:29:02,012 --> 01:29:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got all kinds of abilities to modify it because there is a huge Quake modding community out there.

1132
01:29:11,395 --> 01:29:16,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember bringing up on the show playing Gacha Quake, which was a Gachamon patch for Quake.

1133
01:29:17,297 --> 01:29:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have talked about this on the show before.

1134
01:29:19,377 --> 01:29:21,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it came out before, but it's not as pleasant as you believe.

1135
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:23,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know it was developed by John Carmack?

1136
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:24,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I did know that.

1137
01:29:25,299 --> 01:29:26,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1138
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Michael Abrash and John Cash, as opposed to Johnny Cash, who was dead.

1139
01:29:31,101 --> 01:29:31,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Who wasn't at the time.

1140
01:29:32,582 --> 01:29:32,782
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1141
01:29:35,183 --> 01:29:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And not his son either.

1142
01:29:36,023 --> 01:29:38,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just thinking about, you know, the people that did the soundtrack.

1143
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:41,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny Cash was involved with the cover, but never mind.

1144
01:29:41,525 --> 01:29:41,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1145
01:29:43,727 --> 01:29:44,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1146
01:29:44,948 --> 01:29:50,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But this was pretty much the king of first-person shooter games for the longest time.

1147
01:29:50,311 --> 01:29:56,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, even I played the shit out of this game in college.

1148
01:29:56,575 --> 01:29:57,616
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to call.

1149
01:29:57,656 --> 01:30:01,679
[SPEAKER_02]: This was back when we used modems to dial into everything.

1150
01:30:01,699 --> 01:30:06,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But my friends at Sonoma State had one of those state-of-the-art T1 lines or whatever.

1151
01:30:06,262 --> 01:30:08,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd all call into their server at Sonoma State.

1152
01:30:08,763 --> 01:30:11,045
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd play the fuck out of this game until like 2 in the morning.

1153
01:30:11,185 --> 01:30:11,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1154
01:30:11,685 --> 01:30:12,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So much fun.

1155
01:30:13,086 --> 01:30:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayers.

1156
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:28,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, well, basically, before there was even a demo, id Software put out Q-Test, which is February 24th, 1996, that was a tech demo that had three multiplayer maps.

1157
01:30:29,172 --> 01:30:35,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, it just lit a fire, because when Quake came out, there were servers everywhere popping up.

1158
01:30:37,277 --> 01:30:38,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Just basically like you were saying.

1159
01:30:40,259 --> 01:30:47,262
[SPEAKER_10]: And there were people reskinning the textures, reskinning the whole levels, making new maps, you name it.

1160
01:30:47,462 --> 01:30:48,963
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what really came out.

1161
01:30:49,163 --> 01:30:57,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically scripted in Quake C, was I believe the coding for it.

1162
01:30:58,047 --> 01:31:01,569
[SPEAKER_10]: And the first Quake mod that came out was Team Fortress.

1163
01:31:02,869 --> 01:31:30,192
[SPEAKER_10]: which was capture the flag but it had that class system basically and we know where Team Fortress has gone since then so there was also three wave capture the flag there was you know I've actually seen where someone used they did it first in Quake and then went and did it in Half-Life where they redid the whole ending of of Cube 2

1164
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:33,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1165
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:38,961
[SPEAKER_10]: But there were like different, you know, they created different bots for it.

1166
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:41,226
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Rocket Arena where...

1167
01:31:43,246 --> 01:31:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Quaked Unquick Quaked Unquicker

1168
01:32:13,448 --> 01:32:15,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, there's all kinds of different

1169
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:20,087
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really blown up since then.

1170
01:32:20,147 --> 01:32:25,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to this image on here that's basically the family tree of Quake games.

1171
01:32:26,431 --> 01:32:34,094
[SPEAKER_10]: We have on here, coming from Quake, we have QuakeWorld that spawned Twilight, more QuakeWorld, ZQuake, FTE.

1172
01:32:35,595 --> 01:32:41,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Doom 3 eventually came from Quake 3, which was built on Quake 2, built from the first Quake.

1173
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:44,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got all of these different ones.

1174
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Medal of Honor, Allied Assault.

1175
01:32:48,242 --> 01:33:12,417
[SPEAKER_10]: we have STV Elite Forces 2 on the list we have Paintball Jedi Academy there's all kinds of games on here that run off of variants of the original Quake engine so basically your first person shooters are what they are today because of Quake just saying and also you can play it on the Amiga

1176
01:33:15,151 --> 01:33:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that's how old this game was.

1177
01:33:16,752 --> 01:33:18,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually runs on an Amiga.

1178
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:20,193
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a port for it on the Amiga.

1179
01:33:20,634 --> 01:33:21,154
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

1180
01:33:21,194 --> 01:33:22,494
[SPEAKER_10]: The ports I really need to get into.

1181
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:27,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they made the source code public some time ago, right?

1182
01:33:27,797 --> 01:33:27,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1183
01:33:29,178 --> 01:33:35,360
[SPEAKER_10]: The Commodore Amiga port was done in 1998 by Clickboom, but it's only available in 68K.

1184
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:39,763
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a Linux version that was made by an id Software employee.

1185
01:33:39,783 --> 01:33:41,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course there was a Linux version.

1186
01:33:41,643 --> 01:33:42,824
[SPEAKER_10]: For fun, in his spare time.

1187
01:33:44,184 --> 01:33:49,146
[SPEAKER_10]: and then in 1999 there's a retail version for Linux that was put out by Macmillan Digital.

1188
01:33:50,107 --> 01:33:53,248
[SPEAKER_10]: They also had two add-ons which was the offering for Linux.

1189
01:33:54,469 --> 01:33:57,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a Mac version now that was done by MacSoft.

1190
01:33:59,651 --> 01:34:02,252
[SPEAKER_10]: It came out on Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64,

1191
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:05,322
[SPEAKER_10]: There are all kinds of versions.

1192
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:06,962
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Nintendo DS versions of Quake.

1193
01:34:06,982 --> 01:34:08,303
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Quake DS and SeaQuake.

1194
01:34:09,764 --> 01:34:12,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So you name it, you can play Quake on it probably.

1195
01:34:12,085 --> 01:34:13,685
[SPEAKER_10]: You can probably play Quake on a toaster.

1196
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:15,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it.

1197
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:18,108
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1198
01:34:18,128 --> 01:34:20,369
[SPEAKER_02]: A true, true classic indeed.

1199
01:34:20,549 --> 01:34:20,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake.

1200
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:26,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember playing Quake 3 on the Dreamcast with our Ethernet adapter.

1201
01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:28,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Quake 3 was amazing.

1202
01:34:28,259 --> 01:34:28,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1203
01:34:28,759 --> 01:34:32,561
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to just play Quake-inspired games, go play Quake Live.

1204
01:34:32,601 --> 01:34:34,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's basically Quake 3.

1205
01:34:35,243 --> 01:34:37,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though there's lots of differences between Quake 1 and Quake 3, eh.

1206
01:34:38,224 --> 01:34:40,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a good time.

1207
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:40,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Asky Quake.

1208
01:34:41,726 --> 01:34:42,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Asky Quake is just funny.

1209
01:34:43,087 --> 01:34:44,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's funny for like two seconds.

1210
01:34:44,468 --> 01:34:44,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1211
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:46,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, this is annoying.

1212
01:34:46,669 --> 01:34:47,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Escape.

1213
01:34:47,209 --> 01:34:48,230
[SPEAKER_10]: This makes my eyes hurt.

1214
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:48,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

1215
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:48,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

1216
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:52,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1217
01:34:52,539 --> 01:34:53,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plenty more to come.

1218
01:34:53,619 --> 01:34:54,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go anywhere.

1219
01:34:54,259 --> 01:34:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't stop your iPods.

1220
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't turn off your live stream of all games because we've got plenty more to come.

1221
01:34:58,201 --> 01:35:05,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid Fire News, Fugle Question, Mailbag, FUs, your calls, more news when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1222
01:35:13,193 --> 01:35:16,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1223
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Cammy greater than Chun-Li

1224
01:35:59,266 --> 01:36:00,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have to tell you where that came from.

1225
01:36:00,967 --> 01:36:01,168
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1226
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:02,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's little brother.

1227
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:04,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it either Dan's?

1228
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:12,777
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was a friend of ours' son was saying, whenever Cammy does her wind pose and turns around, she goes, look at my butt.

1229
01:36:13,637 --> 01:36:14,678
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what he would say.

1230
01:36:15,058 --> 01:36:15,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1231
01:36:16,698 --> 01:36:29,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to make the argument that it's because she's not American, though, so I can't make that argument, but I thought that they're drawing some sort of comparison to soundtracks of a certain other game, and one being superior to the other.

1232
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the non-Japanese being superior.

1233
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it right now.

1234
01:36:35,428 --> 01:36:36,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

1235
01:36:36,769 --> 01:36:37,109
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1236
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be fair, the UK and Japanese have the same soundtrack, so ha!

1237
01:36:43,323 --> 01:36:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Akuma JP says, I don't use female characters.

1238
01:36:46,045 --> 01:36:46,625
[SPEAKER_02]: In any game?

1239
01:36:47,586 --> 01:36:58,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just Street Fighter he's talking about, but I notice in fighting games that the female characters tend to be like the ones that are quick and agile, you know, I know that's kind of stereotype, but that's how I use almost all female characters.

1240
01:36:58,854 --> 01:36:59,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

1241
01:36:59,574 --> 01:37:01,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Except in King of Fighters where they all look androgynous.

1242
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:05,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be a pretty good Chun-Li player back in the day.

1243
01:37:05,303 --> 01:37:09,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a very non-agile, large female character.

1244
01:37:09,225 --> 01:37:10,886
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably do exist.

1245
01:37:12,047 --> 01:37:12,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think.

1246
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd probably have to go to the Neo Geo series.

1247
01:37:14,968 --> 01:37:20,752
[SPEAKER_10]: The only character that I can think of in the Street Fighter series that's female and sizable would be Elena and her legs.

1248
01:37:24,494 --> 01:37:25,255
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also...

1249
01:37:28,368 --> 01:37:29,209
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I can't think of one.

1250
01:37:30,649 --> 01:37:35,552
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that there's male characters that are, you know... Oh, yeah.

1251
01:37:35,712 --> 01:37:37,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Vega, if you want to do Street Fighter.

1252
01:37:37,313 --> 01:37:39,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm thinking of the sizable male characters.

1253
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:40,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, yeah.

1254
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Rufus.

1255
01:37:41,915 --> 01:37:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I'm saying.

1256
01:37:42,636 --> 01:37:44,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a large, sassy black woman.

1257
01:37:44,937 --> 01:37:45,257
[SPEAKER_04]: You do?

1258
01:37:46,478 --> 01:37:47,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to think of one.

1259
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can create to your heart's content in Soul Calibur.

1260
01:37:52,501 --> 01:38:08,551
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was thinking Ivy doesn't exactly of course nothing in Soul Calibur is really agile I mean it's Soul Calibur is kind of a different style of fighting I guess that's not true some would say like Voldo is like an agile type of character but Voldo is also into bondage and shows off his package regularly not that there's anything wrong with that

1261
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:10,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

1262
01:38:10,272 --> 01:38:11,973
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get back into some gaming news.

1263
01:38:12,874 --> 01:38:16,316
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a lot of room to go here before we get to your calls later on in the show.

1264
01:38:16,376 --> 01:38:17,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, how about some news?

1265
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:20,079
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's talk about the new SimCity.

1266
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:23,562
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed it off at GDC, and it looks pretty.

1267
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:28,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not scheduled to come out until 2013, and it will be on PC.

1268
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:32,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like they've really amped up the detail.

1269
01:38:32,467 --> 01:38:38,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything from actually seeing the individual cars driving around to how much control you have over it.

1270
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:40,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous the amount of control.

1271
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,692
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty awesome looking.

1272
01:38:42,132 --> 01:38:45,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will run on this new glass box engine.

1273
01:38:46,834 --> 01:38:50,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, like I said, it's really, really detailed.

1274
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:54,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so very cool looking game.

1275
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:04,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, this has nothing to do with SimCity, but my mind is still stuck on the whole you want a large, sassy lady in a fighting game.

1276
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:08,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mind, for some reason, instantly went to Latrice Royale from RuPaul's Drag Race.

1277
01:39:09,219 --> 01:39:13,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And that made me think, wouldn't RuPaul's Drag Race make the best fighting game ever?

1278
01:39:14,183 --> 01:39:14,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

1279
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:17,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The time has come for you to lip-sync for your life.

1280
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:19,947
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really, your life.

1281
01:39:22,649 --> 01:39:24,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking that Oprah should be downloadable.

1282
01:39:25,211 --> 01:39:25,712
Yeah.

1283
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:26,887
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

1284
01:39:47,353 --> 01:39:54,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they had a... I'm not talking about the first computer one, because obviously the old school one I think a lot of us have played, because there was a port of it on Super Nintendo.

1285
01:39:54,375 --> 01:40:01,457
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was one on CD that had, like, it whored the full motion video, and there was some bad video.

1286
01:40:01,697 --> 01:40:02,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play it?

1287
01:40:02,777 --> 01:40:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not play that one.

1288
01:40:04,357 --> 01:40:10,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The first SimCity game I played was on 5 1⁄4 floppies that was in black and white.

1289
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the monitor I had was in black and white, but...

1290
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Really old SimCity.

1291
01:40:15,861 --> 01:40:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I played SimCity 2000 a little bit.

1292
01:40:18,822 --> 01:40:20,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really care for it too much.

1293
01:40:20,163 --> 01:40:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, whoa, this is way more complicated than SimCity.

1294
01:40:24,205 --> 01:40:29,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute I was like, wait, I have to build piping and shit too?

1295
01:40:29,628 --> 01:40:30,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's this game.

1296
01:40:30,689 --> 01:40:32,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to manage your sewer systems.

1297
01:40:32,249 --> 01:40:34,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I just want to build buildings and have Godzilla attack them.

1298
01:40:36,002 --> 01:40:40,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the most scary thing ever, ever for SimCity.

1299
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:41,046
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1300
01:40:41,606 --> 01:40:56,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this guy who basically created the most efficient city in SimCity with 6 million people and fully functioning everything, but the thing that he sacrificed was longevity of the people, so he had them dying off at like 50.

1301
01:40:58,118 --> 01:41:02,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But his city was the most efficient, and he spent four years making it.

1302
01:41:03,866 --> 01:41:21,819
[SPEAKER_10]: that's frightening and he's got himself exactly it's the forever alone guy he plays SimCity but seriously there's like a YouTube on there of him bragging about his shit with this epic music and all I can think of that's so sad speaking of YouTube I've got to play this for you guys since you haven't seen it this is one of the great

1303
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut scenes from that SimCity PC.

1304
01:41:24,842 --> 01:41:27,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when everything had to have full motion video?

1305
01:41:27,644 --> 01:41:27,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1306
01:41:28,445 --> 01:41:31,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was like that period where like every adventure game had it.

1307
01:41:31,088 --> 01:41:35,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's a great cut scene back from the SimCity days.

1308
01:41:35,692 --> 01:41:41,258
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like one of the action news sequences that would chime into your game when things happen.

1309
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:51,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the SimCity nuclear power plant.

1310
01:42:09,113 --> 01:42:10,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Oscar goes to... Her horribly bad lipstick.

1311
01:42:10,914 --> 01:42:13,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic ass bitch from SimCity Action News.

1312
01:42:38,206 --> 01:42:38,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie!

1313
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:38,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie!

1314
01:42:53,486 --> 01:42:54,147
I couldn't help it.

1315
01:42:54,207 --> 01:42:55,508
[SPEAKER_02]: How insensitive.

1316
01:42:55,648 --> 01:42:56,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't know.

1317
01:42:57,069 --> 01:42:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: That might not be that different.

1318
01:42:58,189 --> 01:42:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: We should try that.

1319
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:00,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so fucking down with that.

1320
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:02,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1321
01:43:02,112 --> 01:43:03,833
[SPEAKER_10]: The first thing that popped in my head was Night Trap.

1322
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Tino Plato.

1323
01:43:06,755 --> 01:43:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Dad.

1324
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, shame on you.

1325
01:43:09,037 --> 01:43:09,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So?

1326
01:43:11,417 --> 01:43:12,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of funny.

1327
01:43:12,377 --> 01:43:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1328
01:43:14,498 --> 01:43:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all down for that.

1329
01:43:15,238 --> 01:43:17,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know what happened to SimCityActionNewsLady.

1330
01:43:17,759 --> 01:43:19,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these people might actually be famous, for all we know.

1331
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she is.

1332
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:22,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

1333
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:29,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing this to harp on her acting skills or whatever, because let's face it, we all got to get work somewhere, moving from community theater to SimCity.

1334
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been in one more game than I have.

1335
01:43:31,765 --> 01:43:32,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1336
01:43:32,985 --> 01:43:36,226
[SPEAKER_02]: More people have seen her than listened to this podcast, I'm sure of that.

1337
01:43:36,706 --> 01:43:42,169
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, my point is, that stuff would just cut right into the middle of your game when you were playing SimCity.

1338
01:43:42,209 --> 01:43:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you'd be doing your thing, do-do-do-do-do-do, and then all of a sudden that fucking full-motion video would come in.

1339
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:48,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddammit, I'm trying to play a game!

1340
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:50,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1341
01:43:52,492 --> 01:43:54,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, SimCity 5, hope it doesn't suck.

1342
01:43:56,114 --> 01:43:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think SimCity 1's gonna be in it, though.

1343
01:43:58,254 --> 01:43:59,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, phew, thank God.

1344
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:01,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, poor, poor Dana Plato.

1345
01:44:01,927 --> 01:44:03,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it my turn?

1346
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:20,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Loki's... Loki's done one story.

1347
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Finish your shit!

1348
01:44:22,221 --> 01:44:23,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid fire news.

1349
01:44:23,401 --> 01:44:24,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we were talking about... I derailed.

1350
01:44:25,182 --> 01:44:27,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about SimCity, okay?

1351
01:44:27,043 --> 01:44:27,223
[SPEAKER_04]: My fault.

1352
01:44:27,283 --> 01:44:27,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished my coffee.

1353
01:44:27,983 --> 01:44:28,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious.

1354
01:44:28,483 --> 01:44:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise to be fast.

1355
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:33,465
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one would be Sorcery finally has a date.

1356
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:36,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, hey, they talked about it during E3 as a big thing.

1357
01:44:36,766 --> 01:44:40,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it went poof, disappeared, and just delay, delay, delay.

1358
01:44:40,808 --> 01:44:42,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Diabolical Pitch, Grasshopper, Connect, Zombies, Baseball

1359
01:45:01,717 --> 01:45:03,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That game will be out April 4th.

1360
01:45:03,799 --> 01:45:06,362
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, what a weird fucking game that is.

1361
01:45:06,582 --> 01:45:09,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But that'll be out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1362
01:45:10,325 --> 01:45:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, it's a really weird fucking game.

1363
01:45:13,308 --> 01:45:16,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But would you have it any other way with Grasshopper Manufacturer?

1364
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:16,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with weird.

1365
01:45:17,592 --> 01:45:17,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1366
01:45:17,892 --> 01:45:18,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Throwing baseballs at zombies.

1367
01:45:19,354 --> 01:45:20,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So with Kinect.

1368
01:45:21,195 --> 01:45:21,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Good time.

1369
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:22,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1370
01:45:23,283 --> 01:45:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: PvP has been taken out.

1371
01:45:24,104 --> 01:45:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: For now.

1372
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:46,734
[SPEAKER_02]: which might lend a hint as to what the holdup is with this game.

1373
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about it here.

1374
01:45:47,795 --> 01:45:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've been talking about it all the time on Horde House.

1375
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:51,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This game has been delayed, delayed, delayed.

1376
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:57,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no Blizzard game is ever truly delayed because they don't, you know, but let's be real.

1377
01:45:57,364 --> 01:45:58,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The beta's been out forever.

1378
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:00,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like the game is done.

1379
01:46:00,346 --> 01:46:02,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question has been, what's the holdup?

1380
01:46:02,086 --> 01:46:11,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it might have been PvP because this official press release came out on Blizzard's site that basically says, you know, we're counting down the days, getting ready to announce this release date.

1381
01:46:11,671 --> 01:46:14,992
[SPEAKER_02]: We have come to realize that PvP is not up to the standards.

1382
01:46:15,532 --> 01:46:23,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We will release it in a patch following the game's launch, to which a lot of people kind of roll their eyes and go, oh, patching in the content after the game.

1383
01:46:23,536 --> 01:46:50,762
[SPEAKER_02]: but let's be fair PC games kind of do this anyway a lot and something as robust as PvP and they're not going to charge you extra for it I think it's okay if they're going to do that PvP wasn't really in Diablo 2 so it was something new to Diablo 3 so whereas I'm sure some folks will be disappointed if it'll get the damn game out already then I'm okay with this taking a little bit of a break so they do say that when PvP does come out multiple arena maps, theme locations and so forth

1384
01:46:51,682 --> 01:46:57,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't in the beta, so I guess it's not that surprising that PvP is getting cut out.

1385
01:46:57,968 --> 01:47:00,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully a release date for Diablo before too long.

1386
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:08,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully a release date soon for this game, too, because I know the screenshots that came out for it this week have me very excited, as I'm sure a lot of you.

1387
01:47:08,437 --> 01:47:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is Kingdom Hearts 3D, or Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance.

1388
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1389
01:47:13,361 --> 01:47:16,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of the screenshots came out this week that show Sora in...

1390
01:47:16,783 --> 01:47:18,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam, son of Flynn

1391
01:47:36,923 --> 01:47:37,263
[SPEAKER_02]: and Riku.

1392
01:48:00,994 --> 01:48:01,454
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they don't.

1393
01:48:23,546 --> 01:48:27,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see a Kingdom Hearts 3 on consoles already, but I'll take this to hold me over.

1394
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:31,929
[SPEAKER_02]: One other quick story here about Dead or Alive 5.

1395
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:35,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead or Alive 5 has a new character on the roster.

1396
01:48:35,691 --> 01:48:38,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be familiar if you've ever played a little game called Virtua Fighter.

1397
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:42,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira Yuki will be in the next Dead or Alive game.

1398
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:43,594
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1399
01:48:43,994 --> 01:48:45,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a Virtua Fighter fan.

1400
01:48:45,615 --> 01:48:46,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I'm not.

1401
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:47,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Worlds are colliding.

1402
01:48:47,636 --> 01:48:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't really either, but there you go.

1403
01:48:50,777 --> 01:49:02,293
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, my husband liked it and I was like, the only time I ever played any version of that game for like any period of time was because I was trying to knock off Kage's mask in Virtua Fighter 2.

1404
01:49:03,675 --> 01:49:03,976
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1405
01:49:05,899 --> 01:49:07,220
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1406
01:49:30,618 --> 01:49:35,883
[SPEAKER_10]: and then Assassin's Creed 3 will be on the Wii U and there is a trailer out.

1407
01:49:37,284 --> 01:49:42,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And isn't this the one that's like the Native American one that's taking place during the American Revolution?

1408
01:49:42,369 --> 01:49:43,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe it is.

1409
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:52,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it actually has big battles that are going on including the Continental Army versus the British Army.

1410
01:49:52,437 --> 01:49:53,258
[SPEAKER_10]: All kinds of cool stuff.

1411
01:49:53,799 --> 01:49:55,060
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, actually I have to tell you something.

1412
01:49:56,261 --> 01:49:56,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

1413
01:49:57,358 --> 01:50:02,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Assassin's Creed came up in my Renaissance history class.

1414
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:15,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Because apparently it shows the towns so realistically that my teacher was able to use the models in the game to show us the Palazzo and all kinds of different places in Venice.

1415
01:50:16,584 --> 01:50:17,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I would mention that.

1416
01:50:18,805 --> 01:50:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1417
01:50:20,345 --> 01:50:20,885
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1418
01:50:38,897 --> 01:50:41,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really tie-in to the drink Propel, or is that just the name?

1419
01:50:42,018 --> 01:50:42,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Speculation.

1420
01:50:42,938 --> 01:50:43,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

1421
01:50:44,558 --> 01:50:46,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just a clever name, but yeah.

1422
01:50:46,919 --> 01:50:52,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, yo, dog, I heard you like Propel, so you can play Propel while you drink Propel and propel your head through the screen.

1423
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Old meme is old.

1424
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but it's still funny sometimes.

1425
01:50:56,361 --> 01:50:56,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm done.

1426
01:50:59,061 --> 01:50:59,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick.

1427
01:50:59,641 --> 01:50:59,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1428
01:51:01,162 --> 01:51:07,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this might be a coincidence, but I was looking for the...

1429
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Actress that played... I was just about to say the chatters found something on that, but go ahead.

1430
01:51:15,646 --> 01:51:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what you got first.

1431
01:51:16,807 --> 01:51:19,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Stephanie Fargo is the actress that did that.

1432
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:23,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny enough, search for Stephanie Fargo on Facebook.

1433
01:51:23,413 --> 01:51:24,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get Stephanie Fargo.

1434
01:51:25,314 --> 01:51:32,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You do, however, get Stephanie... I believe it's Goats, who happens to be a news reporter.

1435
01:51:33,301 --> 01:51:34,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a coincidence or what?

1436
01:51:34,762 --> 01:51:35,043
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1437
01:51:35,743 --> 01:51:36,724
[SPEAKER_04]: She's also blonde.

1438
01:51:37,104 --> 01:51:38,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be the one.

1439
01:51:38,405 --> 01:51:42,047
[SPEAKER_04]: She could have actually turned this into a career.

1440
01:51:43,949 --> 01:51:49,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that this is the person because there's very little to go on because, you know, IMDB and stuff.

1441
01:51:49,312 --> 01:51:53,155
[SPEAKER_04]: But, man, that would be a coincidence.

1442
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: OL Army, bring me Stephanie Fargo.

1443
01:51:57,658 --> 01:51:58,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask questions.

1444
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:02,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And she looks like age-wise that it could be.

1445
01:52:02,161 --> 01:52:04,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, show me because I can't find her like you've got it.

1446
01:52:07,327 --> 01:52:09,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Stephanie Fargo's photos, address, phone, email.

1447
01:52:09,869 --> 01:52:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: See, look, I did a search for Stephanie Fargo.

1448
01:52:13,213 --> 01:52:15,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't encourage people to stalk like this.

1449
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:17,797
[SPEAKER_02]: This is borderline a problem.

1450
01:52:18,137 --> 01:52:20,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, news anchor reporter?

1451
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:22,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1452
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that would be a coincidence.

1453
01:52:25,164 --> 01:52:25,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.

1454
01:52:26,525 --> 01:52:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it doesn't really look like her to me It's hard to say because that's like the 90s haircut Well, SSJ100Matt was the chatter that said Stephanie Fargo is the SimCity news hiker Her IMDB says that she's only been in SimCity Well, that's IMDB I was like, you all have problems Stop stalking these poor full motion actors

1455
01:52:50,905 --> 01:52:51,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you guys.

1456
01:52:51,907 --> 01:52:52,227
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1457
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1458
01:52:58,432 --> 01:53:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week we ask you guys a question on the Facebook and the Google+.

1459
01:53:01,753 --> 01:53:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You put them together, it's Fugle.

1460
01:53:04,413 --> 01:53:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook Google Question of the Week.

1461
01:53:06,194 --> 01:53:15,496
[SPEAKER_02]: With the recent announcement of the new iPad, the statement was made by Apple that the resolution of the device was greater than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 experience.

1462
01:53:15,796 --> 01:53:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you consider the iPad a gaming device for the core gamer?

1463
01:53:19,336 --> 01:53:20,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Why or why not?

1464
01:53:20,076 --> 01:53:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've kind of said our piece on this.

1465
01:53:21,817 --> 01:53:23,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some of the answers.

1466
01:53:23,477 --> 01:53:24,278
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of answers.

1467
01:53:24,318 --> 01:53:26,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't read them all, but I'm going to read some of these.

1468
01:53:28,764 --> 01:53:29,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1469
01:53:29,405 --> 01:53:33,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Jennifer J. says, To be completely honest, I don't see it as much of a gaming machine.

1470
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:37,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there are games made for it and whatnot, but I really don't see it going anywhere.

1471
01:53:37,275 --> 01:53:38,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I might be wrong.

1472
01:53:39,618 --> 01:53:40,818
[SPEAKER_02]: John K says, Jim H says,

1473
01:53:58,343 --> 01:54:00,686
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's a gaming machine of a different sort.

1474
01:54:01,066 --> 01:54:10,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to see that Nintendo and Sony's newer portable consoles aren't going to sell like past incarnations because Apple and Android have all the casual pick-up-and-play gamers locked up.

1475
01:54:10,596 --> 01:54:12,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a story on that coming up in a minute here.

1476
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunter R says, First of all, the resolution claim is contingent on the apps that run on the iPad.

1477
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:24,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, the PS3 can do 1080p, but how many games actually run at that resolution?

1478
01:54:25,121 --> 01:54:27,782
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the iPad being a gaming device, I don't buy it.

1479
01:54:28,182 --> 01:54:32,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play many games on my iPad, and the games I do play are mainly board and card games.

1480
01:54:32,442 --> 01:54:34,103
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mostly due to the control scheme.

1481
01:54:34,563 --> 01:54:40,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Having my fingers get in the way of the display is a problem for most games, but is not a problem for board and card games.

1482
01:54:41,144 --> 01:54:48,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I use my iPad more to watch videos, use Twitter, check my email, read online articles, and type up long rambling passages that may or may not be interesting.

1483
01:54:48,847 --> 01:54:49,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as this one?

1484
01:54:49,507 --> 01:54:50,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1485
01:54:51,068 --> 01:54:51,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1486
01:54:52,048 --> 01:54:55,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Katsuhiko J says, for a pick-up-and-go experience, yes.

1487
01:54:55,769 --> 01:54:57,070
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say the full name on that one.

1488
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:57,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a...

1489
01:54:59,091 --> 01:55:01,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I always say first in the lesson at OTA, Janai.

1490
01:55:02,112 --> 01:55:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: For a pick-up-and-go experience, yes.

1491
01:55:03,933 --> 01:55:06,434
[SPEAKER_02]: For a sit-down-and-play-for-hours experience, probably not.

1492
01:55:06,894 --> 01:55:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: That is decided by the game, whether it's Tiny Tower or Grand Theft Auto.

1493
01:55:10,715 --> 01:55:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, I can see myself playing Tiny Tower for two to three minutes and be satisfied.

1494
01:55:15,237 --> 01:55:18,698
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way I can play it for many hours straight, not even 30 minutes.

1495
01:55:19,158 --> 01:55:21,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't replace your PS3 or your 360.

1496
01:55:21,619 --> 01:55:27,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like that, kind of calling it out like that, because that's a lot of what I see and I've

1497
01:55:28,181 --> 01:55:31,983
[SPEAKER_02]: IOS Gaming versus, you know, playing on the consoles.

1498
01:55:32,063 --> 01:55:33,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about that time investment.

1499
01:55:33,964 --> 01:55:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of games that just take, like, seconds.

1500
01:55:37,326 --> 01:55:38,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Last one from Facebook here.

1501
01:55:38,927 --> 01:55:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike B says,

1502
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:58,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the thinking, but you have to be living in a fantasy world for Microsoft to suddenly get along with the Apple devices like that.

1503
01:55:59,498 --> 01:56:02,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But why aren't we seeing that type of stuff with the Windows phones?

1504
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we are a little bit.

1505
01:56:04,002 --> 01:56:08,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there is Xbox Live stuff on there, and I think you can even go so far as to earn some achievement points.

1506
01:56:08,726 --> 01:56:16,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the whole cross-platform playing, but if the Vita can interface with a PC, I mean, anything else is just a matter of time, I'm sure.

1507
01:56:17,373 --> 01:56:19,635
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as Gears of War, hmm.

1508
01:56:19,855 --> 01:56:22,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Owner Stephanie Fargo, a gorgeous Amazonian former actress with an uproarious laugh.

1509
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that article too.

1510
01:56:45,091 --> 01:56:47,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's Revolution Fitness.

1511
01:56:48,075 --> 01:56:49,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's a fitness instructor now.

1512
01:56:49,597 --> 01:56:52,060
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be her.

1513
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,004
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't look Amazonian in the video there.

1514
01:56:55,024 --> 01:56:56,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she was also sitting down.

1515
01:56:56,086 --> 01:56:58,188
[SPEAKER_02]: She might have bulked up if she took a fitness instructor role.

1516
01:57:01,012 --> 01:57:01,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1517
01:57:01,912 --> 01:57:02,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Carlos M. says, Definitely.

1518
01:57:02,612 --> 01:57:06,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I do more gaming on my Zoom tablet than on my PS3 and Wii combined, and my Xbox beats it just because of Dragon Age.

1519
01:57:24,885 --> 01:57:33,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly vouch for the quality of games, not only graphics-wise, but also on their entertainment value.

1520
01:57:34,036 --> 01:57:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if only they'd release a Final Fantasy or Bioware RPG there...

1521
01:57:39,682 --> 01:57:41,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be fair, I just want to get this out there.

1522
01:57:42,084 --> 01:57:51,754
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some really good Final Fantasy ports on iPhone, which would be the Final Fantasy 1, 2, and 3, and I believe 3 has an iPad version too.

1523
01:57:52,615 --> 01:57:54,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, I think, Tactics too.

1524
01:57:54,637 --> 01:58:00,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect supposedly has a spin-off game that's on iOS, but my friends that are obsessed with Mass Effect tell me it stinks.

1525
01:58:01,063 --> 01:58:02,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's giving the thumbs down too.

1526
01:58:04,066 --> 01:58:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: here's my favorite comment of them all from Derek H the iPad is a gaming device just like a picture of Bea Arthur as a contraceptive it'll work in an emergency but it should never be your first choice unless you're Deadpool

1527
01:58:24,437 --> 01:58:25,318
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1528
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, I know as much as you want to... First off, that was a hilarious comment in the beginning, but I will say for the second half of it, video editor...

1529
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:09,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I mean, I wouldn't use it for anything serious, but I took a trip up to like Lake Tahoe and I did like little video and I did it in iMovie and it was really easy and it made a cool, fun little thing to post on Facebook.

1530
01:59:10,139 --> 01:59:17,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wouldn't make it much more serious than that, but I was actually really pleased with video editing on the iPhone because it was really super easy.

1531
01:59:18,044 --> 01:59:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But granted, if I was going to do anything professional, I would do it on a Mac or a PC.

1532
01:59:24,008 --> 01:59:24,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Credit card machine.

1533
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:26,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a restaurant the other day.

1534
01:59:27,691 --> 01:59:30,133
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the waiter taking my order on an iPod.

1535
01:59:30,734 --> 01:59:31,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't believe it.

1536
01:59:31,715 --> 01:59:32,736
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where technologies come.

1537
01:59:33,497 --> 01:59:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same restaurant you were at the other day.

1538
01:59:35,179 --> 01:59:36,240
[SPEAKER_02]: You were telling me when you came in here.

1539
01:59:36,553 --> 01:59:51,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Well something else too is that a friend of mine who used to do drive-by appraisals actually would do them with his iPad mounted on the front of his bike and would basically drive around the house on his bike and take pictures of the home.

1540
01:59:53,249 --> 01:59:58,574
[SPEAKER_10]: What a drive-by appraisal is for people who don't know is when a mortgage company hires somebody to go make sure the house is lived in.

1541
01:59:59,514 --> 02:00:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1542
02:00:15,188 --> 02:00:16,109
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1543
02:00:40,366 --> 02:00:43,308
[SPEAKER_04]: and, of course, it hasn't even quite hit a year yet.

1544
02:00:43,848 --> 02:00:49,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be March 27th, but close enough, I guess.

1545
02:00:51,943 --> 02:01:01,067
[SPEAKER_04]: By comparison, I guess they said 9 million units of software have been sold and $1.2 billion in revenue it's generated so far.

1546
02:01:01,367 --> 02:01:04,788
[SPEAKER_04]: The original DS sold 2.3 million units in its first year.

1547
02:01:05,989 --> 02:01:14,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, during February, 200,000 of those are actually, or actually, I'm sorry, it's not 2,000.

1548
02:01:15,593 --> 02:01:19,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 200,000 systems were moved during February.

1549
02:01:20,198 --> 02:01:22,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mario Galaxy has sold 5 million units as well.

1550
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's doing pretty well.

1551
02:01:25,963 --> 02:01:28,525
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo Wii also sold about 228,000 units.

1552
02:01:28,906 --> 02:01:29,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 3DS itself, 135.

1553
02:01:29,747 --> 02:01:32,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still not doing too bad, even though the 3DS is out.

1554
02:01:40,301 --> 02:01:42,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft didn't do too bad as well.

1555
02:01:42,803 --> 02:01:55,352
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold almost half a million units for the Xbox 360 and reached the top console spot for 14 consecutive months.

1556
02:01:56,973 --> 02:01:57,773
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not bad.

1557
02:02:00,444 --> 02:02:04,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation Move, they've shipped 10.5 million units.

1558
02:02:05,547 --> 02:02:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, as I've mentioned in the past before when they talk about shipping units for the Move, you can't really compare that to the Kinect.

1559
02:02:14,693 --> 02:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Kinect, they've sold, I can't remember how many units for the Kinect.

1560
02:02:22,217 --> 02:02:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite a bit.

1561
02:02:23,258 --> 02:02:26,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's actually still more than 10 million units.

1562
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1563
02:02:29,681 --> 02:02:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they exactly counting for the PlayStation Move?

1564
02:02:33,885 --> 02:02:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Wii, you can use multiple Move units per system.

1565
02:02:38,688 --> 02:02:39,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they counting the camera?

1566
02:02:39,829 --> 02:02:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they counting the navigation controller?

1567
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:42,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Any accessories?

1568
02:02:42,911 --> 02:02:43,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Move units.

1569
02:02:44,032 --> 02:02:46,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bet the math is as fuzzy as possible.

1570
02:02:47,489 --> 02:02:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be willing to bet, yeah.

1571
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:53,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So, 10.5 million units, that could be significantly less households.

1572
02:02:53,792 --> 02:03:01,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And judging by the sales of move-only games, I would guess it's probably... I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I don't think I know anyone in real life that has a PlayStation Move.

1573
02:03:02,355 --> 02:03:03,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people on the internet.

1574
02:03:03,316 --> 02:03:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you do?

1575
02:03:04,216 --> 02:03:04,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1576
02:03:05,217 --> 02:03:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I play with it?

1577
02:03:06,377 --> 02:03:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1578
02:03:06,937 --> 02:03:10,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why I don't know anybody, because nobody ever says, let's play Move.

1579
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: it's it's sad because it's not bad it's actually a pretty good peripheral I mean I would prefer to use the move over connect but you know I think for some things to connect is way better like dancing games I think it would be a lot better you know tracking you versus you know the move controller for like core games like um you know shooters and stuff it's probably way better like I would play um what was it uh

1580
02:03:39,195 --> 02:03:39,655
[SPEAKER_04]: God, no.

1581
02:03:40,015 --> 02:03:49,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play some of the third-person shooters or whatever, the gun games and stuff, with a move controller versus trying to even remotely do that with a Kinect camera.

1582
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wouldn't be accurate at all.

1583
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:52,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, it has buttons.

1584
02:03:52,201 --> 02:03:53,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Buttons are important, right?

1585
02:03:53,441 --> 02:03:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1586
02:03:55,963 --> 02:03:56,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important.

1587
02:03:58,689 --> 02:03:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1588
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:01,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what about the sales figures overall?

1589
02:04:01,771 --> 02:04:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do we think this is saying?

1590
02:04:03,152 --> 02:04:06,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is the 3DS recovered or whatever?

1591
02:04:06,174 --> 02:04:07,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this says to me, yes.

1592
02:04:20,784 --> 02:04:30,354
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii, though, I can guarantee you that the Wii systems, even 200,000, that's still, I think, on the downturn.

1593
02:04:30,854 --> 02:04:35,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the slate of Wii games coming out, they're kind of done with that system.

1594
02:04:35,959 --> 02:04:39,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of games that aren't getting Wii ports anymore.

1595
02:04:39,623 --> 02:04:41,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gone.

1596
02:04:41,925 --> 02:04:42,266
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1597
02:04:43,519 --> 02:04:52,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this might make Loki sad because I don't know who he's going to make fun of now, but Peter Molyneux has left Microsoft, meaning he's left Lionhead Studios as well.

1598
02:04:52,364 --> 02:04:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

1599
02:04:53,304 --> 02:04:54,725
[SPEAKER_02]: His head was too big for the building.

1600
02:04:54,765 --> 02:04:55,405
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to leave.

1601
02:04:56,946 --> 02:04:59,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they had to carve him a new door on the way out.

1602
02:05:00,067 --> 02:05:01,828
[SPEAKER_02]: He's left for a startup called 22 Cans.

1603
02:05:04,582 --> 02:05:05,142
[SPEAKER_02]: 22 cans.

1604
02:05:05,502 --> 02:05:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 22 cans.

1605
02:05:07,142 --> 02:05:08,363
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a direction.

1606
02:05:08,403 --> 02:05:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be interesting.

1607
02:05:11,023 --> 02:05:12,283
[SPEAKER_02]: He did leave some parting words.

1608
02:05:12,343 --> 02:05:23,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And his parting words were, quote, It is with mixed emotions that I make the decision to leave Microsoft and Lionhead Studios, the company that I co-founded in 1997, at the conclusion of development of Fable the Journey.

1609
02:05:24,326 --> 02:05:29,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I remain extremely passionate and proud of the people, products, and experiences that we created.

1610
02:05:29,667 --> 02:05:30,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on rails.

1611
02:05:31,787 --> 02:05:33,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I added the last part, but the rest of it's true.

1612
02:05:33,889 --> 02:05:34,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is on rails.

1613
02:05:36,710 --> 02:05:37,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1614
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:39,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It is apparently an amicable breakup.

1615
02:05:40,453 --> 02:05:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still Facebook friends, from what I understand.

1616
02:05:44,115 --> 02:05:46,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe sometimes they'll just end up in bed together.

1617
02:05:46,397 --> 02:05:49,179
[SPEAKER_02]: They might throw some shade at each other once in a while, but that'll be the extent of it.

1618
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:52,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to make a game about a little boy named Milo.

1619
02:05:52,881 --> 02:05:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Then Chris Hansen showed up, so now I'm on a limb.

1620
02:05:56,684 --> 02:05:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to a company called 22 Cans.

1621
02:05:57,945 --> 02:05:58,285
[SPEAKER_02]: 22 Cans.

1622
02:05:58,465 --> 02:05:58,725
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1623
02:06:03,614 --> 02:06:04,635
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a porn company.

1624
02:06:05,155 --> 02:06:05,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

1625
02:06:06,816 --> 02:06:07,197
[SPEAKER_04]: 22 cans.

1626
02:06:07,837 --> 02:06:11,440
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the people that they have standing out on the street with an empty can saying, put money in me.

1627
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: What level is this show sunken to?

1628
02:06:13,701 --> 02:06:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Not low enough.

1629
02:06:14,982 --> 02:06:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, Dana Plato.

1630
02:06:16,263 --> 02:06:19,725
[SPEAKER_02]: What you talking about, Jamie?

1631
02:06:20,826 --> 02:06:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is where you send us emails every week and DarkSakura has to read them.

1632
02:06:29,144 --> 02:06:32,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you read the emails from our kind and generous listeners this week?

1633
02:06:34,388 --> 02:06:36,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, OLR, I like you.

1634
02:06:36,150 --> 02:06:37,591
[SPEAKER_10]: You're my favorite show ever.

1635
02:06:37,671 --> 02:06:38,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make them up.

1636
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:40,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1637
02:06:40,854 --> 02:06:41,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, OLR.

1638
02:06:41,654 --> 02:06:45,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say thank you for talking me out of buying Street Fighter Cross Tekken.

1639
02:06:45,437 --> 02:06:50,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very excited to get it, but after hearing how over a quarter of the complete roster is paid to unlock, I had to say hell no.

1640
02:06:51,462 --> 02:06:55,386
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I went to GameStop yesterday to pre-order the game, but I got a 3DS instead.

1641
02:06:55,906 --> 02:06:57,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I got Mario Kart, so I'm down to play someone.

1642
02:06:58,448 --> 02:07:02,951
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy before me was buying a PS3 and Just Dance 3, and I pre-ordered the game as well.

1643
02:07:03,791 --> 02:07:18,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at the register next to him, and the lady checking me out asked if I wanted to pre-order any games, and I told her that I wanted to get Street Fighter X Tekken, but went on about how a quarter of the roster was paid to unlock, and the guy was checking out next to me, freaked out.

1644
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,321
[SPEAKER_10]: You could totally see the surprise in his eyes when I blurted that out.

1645
02:07:22,821 --> 02:07:25,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure she was pissed that I might have talked the guy out of a sale, oh well.

1646
02:07:26,543 --> 02:07:27,564
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that's just nuts.

1647
02:07:28,784 --> 02:07:34,926
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 characters, probably $5 a piece to buy would mean that'd be $60, which is the cost of a game.

1648
02:07:35,446 --> 02:07:39,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you telling me that I'd have to shell out the same amount of money in order to get the full experience?

1649
02:07:40,688 --> 02:07:41,828
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a big link on there.

1650
02:07:41,848 --> 02:07:42,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna relink.

1651
02:07:45,329 --> 02:07:47,471
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why they did it to save on hard drive space.

1652
02:07:48,572 --> 02:07:53,816
[SPEAKER_10]: But they didn't explain when they'd be unlocked, and I'm guessing $3 to $5 a piece, which is still too much.

1653
02:07:54,657 --> 02:07:59,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, they did that with Jill and Shu McGrath in the two Marvel vs. Capcom 3 games, but that's just for two characters.

1654
02:07:59,721 --> 02:08:03,824
[SPEAKER_10]: If all 12 characters were available in a bundle for like $10, then I'll stop bitching.

1655
02:08:04,444 --> 02:08:05,505
[SPEAKER_10]: But I doubt that'll happen.

1656
02:08:05,765 --> 02:08:10,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I also thought it was funny that the PS3 exclusive characters can also be found on the Xbox version.

1657
02:08:10,609 --> 02:08:15,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Their files were found in the disc, so if anyone is good at hacking, you might be able to play as cool on the Xbox.

1658
02:08:15,913 --> 02:08:17,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's it.

1659
02:08:17,394 --> 02:08:17,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

1660
02:08:17,974 --> 02:08:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for reading this.

1661
02:08:19,115 --> 02:08:21,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to your 10th-iversary, Stan.

1662
02:08:22,878 --> 02:08:27,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, the reason why they're probably on the disc is because it's the same information just ported

1663
02:08:27,481 --> 02:08:30,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it's kind of lazy porting in a way.

1664
02:08:30,523 --> 02:08:33,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know that sounds really harsh, but it kind of is what it is.

1665
02:08:34,825 --> 02:08:41,489
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I want to say about that, it's kind of scary that we kind of talked not one, but two people out of buying the game.

1666
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what we set out to do.

1667
02:08:44,071 --> 02:08:49,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not trying to discourage people from buying the game because, you know, again, there's fighting game fans out there that are going to eat this up.

1668
02:08:49,574 --> 02:08:50,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.

1669
02:08:50,455 --> 02:08:51,055
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fine.

1670
02:08:51,115 --> 02:08:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your money.

1671
02:08:51,615 --> 02:08:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy what you want.

1672
02:08:52,836 --> 02:09:19,516
[SPEAKER_02]: but um you know we're all about people making informed decisions and it sounds like that's what happened in this case is that people kind of realized like wait a minute I'm gonna have to pay $60 and then if I want everything I have to pay 60 more dollars maybe only to see a super uber collection at the end of the year I I kind of talked myself out of it with that same logic I think that's why I asked Loki earlier what did the sales look like for this game because I want to see if it's just more than the three of us now that we're up to anyhow

1673
02:09:20,894 --> 02:09:21,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

1674
02:09:22,676 --> 02:09:26,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, let me say first you guys and lady are amazing.

1675
02:09:26,679 --> 02:09:32,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Between Loki's rants of rage and DarkSakura and Sky's epic trolls, you make a three hour podcast very entertaining.

1676
02:09:32,364 --> 02:09:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a troll.

1677
02:09:34,366 --> 02:09:34,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Epic trolls.

1678
02:09:34,987 --> 02:09:36,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an epic troll.

1679
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:41,933
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that you are a troll, it's that you have done trolling.

1680
02:09:42,853 --> 02:09:44,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trolling you for compliments.

1681
02:09:44,714 --> 02:09:44,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch.

1682
02:09:45,655 --> 02:09:46,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, please.

1683
02:09:47,236 --> 02:09:52,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, granted, I haven't listened to you guys from the beginning mostly because I was 10 when you guys started.

1684
02:09:52,118 --> 02:09:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1685
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:00,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the past three years... Emailers, I totally appreciate your emails.

1686
02:10:01,564 --> 02:10:03,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't say that ever again.

1687
02:10:05,953 --> 02:10:11,496
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the past three years, you guys have taught me about old school games, system hackings, and other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head.

1688
02:10:12,016 --> 02:10:19,660
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys can make a long car drive seem shorter, a boring day entertaining, and a regular guy seem crazy because he can't stop laughing in the middle of class.

1689
02:10:20,361 --> 02:10:24,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you guys keep podcasting, really enjoy the show, signed Haseo Sumiragawa.

1690
02:10:24,403 --> 02:10:24,763
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

1691
02:10:24,963 --> 02:10:28,285
[SPEAKER_10]: If there are trophy whores listening to this show, you can add me on P.S.N.

1692
02:10:28,345 --> 02:10:31,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Haseo underscore Sumiragawa.

1693
02:10:31,988 --> 02:10:32,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Hellions!

1694
02:10:47,734 --> 02:10:47,974
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1695
02:10:48,214 --> 02:10:48,495
What?

1696
02:11:16,756 --> 02:11:26,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Being that China is an emerging market, not just in video games, but also in different aspects of our modern day economy, it makes sense that Blizzard would tailor make something for the Chinese public.

1697
02:11:27,819 --> 02:11:33,941
[SPEAKER_10]: This also makes me think of the possibilities that could happen if Blizzard decides to tailor make something to any other emerging markets.

1698
02:11:34,001 --> 02:11:37,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, one of the possibilities began to take tangible shape in my mind.

1699
02:11:38,282 --> 02:11:40,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Behold, the Jersey Darians.

1700
02:11:41,524 --> 02:11:41,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Lord.

1701
02:11:42,624 --> 02:11:42,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1702
02:11:43,265 --> 02:11:44,045
[SPEAKER_10]: This is funny now.

1703
02:11:44,986 --> 02:11:46,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming from the mythical realm of Shortopia.

1704
02:11:47,068 --> 02:11:48,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Smush, smush.

1705
02:11:48,789 --> 02:11:49,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what that means.

1706
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:55,814
[SPEAKER_10]: The Jersey Darians are an orange race whose clothes, hair, and muscular definitions appeal mostly to people of their own race.

1707
02:11:56,514 --> 02:12:00,257
[SPEAKER_10]: The Jersey Darians are not a smart race, but just try telling them that.

1708
02:12:00,597 --> 02:12:07,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Criticizing a Jersey Darian may result in you getting your teeth punched in by an orange troll whose over-stylized hair makes up for the bulk of their height.

1709
02:12:08,497 --> 02:12:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them's pregnant, you know.

1710
02:12:10,518 --> 02:12:10,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1711
02:12:11,778 --> 02:12:12,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't need to know that.

1712
02:12:12,759 --> 02:12:14,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It just made my life hurt.

1713
02:12:14,879 --> 02:12:28,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Other possibilities for expansion packs for the emerging markets include, for the English, the Cockney Darians, for the Irish, the U2 Darians, for the Somalians, the not Jack Sparrow Pyro Darians, and for Utah, the Conservative Control Freaky Darians.

1714
02:12:32,506 --> 02:12:53,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought of the best argument ever for gay marriage or, you know, equal marriage because there's really no such thing as gay marriage but I have the best argument ever I can't get married but Snooki can just think about that for a minute

1715
02:12:56,609 --> 02:13:00,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the country we live in, folks.

1716
02:13:02,152 --> 02:13:04,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Santorum wants Snooki to get married.

1717
02:13:05,853 --> 02:13:06,313
But not me.

1718
02:13:07,194 --> 02:13:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1719
02:13:08,214 --> 02:13:09,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, OLR crew.

1720
02:13:10,195 --> 02:13:11,275
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something else that email wanted to say.

1721
02:13:11,375 --> 02:13:12,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Pandarian thing in China.

1722
02:13:13,516 --> 02:13:18,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about this on The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, a show all about the world of Warcraft.

1723
02:13:18,298 --> 02:13:20,059
[SPEAKER_02]: www.hordehouse.com Wink.

1724
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:38,329
[SPEAKER_02]: um we talked a little bit about this and actually I don't think the claim is as far-fetched as some think it's ironic because there was a time when people were saying it can't be Pandaria they're not going to do Pandaria because there's laws in China against panda people like you can't that's defacing pandas and da da da da da da da

1725
02:13:39,891 --> 02:13:41,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think what you're saying is too far-fetched.

1726
02:13:41,852 --> 02:13:47,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of a win-win situation for Blizzard because, yes, they can do a very respectful thing for the Chinese culture.

1727
02:13:47,597 --> 02:13:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, here in the States and other countries like Canada and UK and so forth, we kind of like that culture.

1728
02:13:55,504 --> 02:13:58,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that are like, you know, pandas are cute.

1729
02:13:58,166 --> 02:14:00,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they like the architecture and all that.

1730
02:14:00,668 --> 02:14:02,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense.

1731
02:14:03,965 --> 02:14:05,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I still forgot to reserve the name Orange Chicken.

1732
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:25,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1733
02:14:26,521 --> 02:14:27,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, all our crew.

1734
02:14:27,581 --> 02:14:28,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, to DarkSakura.

1735
02:14:28,642 --> 02:14:31,904
[SPEAKER_10]: While I do respect you preferring the Japanese... Oh, God.

1736
02:14:31,964 --> 02:14:32,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1737
02:14:32,684 --> 02:14:36,307
[SPEAKER_10]: The Japanese Sonic CD soundtrack, I must side with Bobby Blackwolf and claim the U.S.

1738
02:14:36,327 --> 02:14:37,247
[SPEAKER_10]: soundtrack is superior.

1739
02:14:37,407 --> 02:14:38,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, your opinion.

1740
02:14:39,168 --> 02:14:44,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Despite the fact that Sonic CDs... Where every gamer has a voice, a really... That's why I'm pointing out an opinion.

1741
02:14:44,912 --> 02:14:46,173
[SPEAKER_02]: A really wrong voice.

1742
02:14:48,223 --> 02:14:48,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got the hand.

1743
02:14:49,384 --> 02:14:50,364
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was a high five.

1744
02:14:50,584 --> 02:14:51,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1745
02:14:52,465 --> 02:14:54,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were making me talk to that.

1746
02:14:54,766 --> 02:14:55,706
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was giving you a high five.

1747
02:14:57,727 --> 02:15:05,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Despite the fact that Sonic CD's musics have a style different from the other Sonic games for its time, at least to me anyway, the Japanese music sounds very cheesy.

1748
02:15:05,651 --> 02:15:09,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's way too upbeat and has some hammy voice samples that are out of place.

1749
02:15:09,313 --> 02:15:16,836
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the US tunes composed by Spencer Nielsen do a fantastic job of fitting in with the atmosphere of each level, even if it sounds a little new agey at times.

1750
02:15:17,924 --> 02:15:19,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's kind of why I have a problem with it.

1751
02:15:19,625 --> 02:15:20,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound like Sonic music.

1752
02:15:21,426 --> 02:15:23,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a question for the whole OLR crew.

1753
02:15:24,007 --> 02:15:27,389
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the best deals that you've had for video game or video game hardware?

1754
02:15:27,749 --> 02:15:35,994
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I've recently had a Circuit City Tiger Direct Honor, an erroneous $40 price tag for a 32GB PlayStation Vita memory card.

1755
02:15:37,095 --> 02:15:38,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally just bought Mass Effect for $11.

1756
02:15:39,756 --> 02:15:40,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was pretty good.

1757
02:15:40,817 --> 02:15:42,057
[SPEAKER_10]: This is also by Full Brazilian.

1758
02:15:43,878 --> 02:15:45,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that name so much.

1759
02:15:46,812 --> 02:15:49,253
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the most that's ever been shaved off a price for you?

1760
02:15:49,273 --> 02:15:58,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I know one on Dan's behalf where he traded his Sega CD for a Neo Geo and games.

1761
02:15:59,277 --> 02:16:00,257
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Steam?

1762
02:16:00,558 --> 02:16:01,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anything on Steam?

1763
02:16:02,538 --> 02:16:04,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought like every Doom game ever for $3.

1764
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:07,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of good deals there.

1765
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And I randomly get free games from people.

1766
02:16:09,721 --> 02:16:11,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my Dreamcast for $40. $40.

1767
02:16:14,562 --> 02:16:15,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing deal.

1768
02:16:16,243 --> 02:16:19,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are still fucking rad to have.

1769
02:16:19,344 --> 02:16:21,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamcast Twin Sticks for Oratario Tangram.

1770
02:16:23,346 --> 02:16:24,407
[SPEAKER_10]: We paid $45 for them.

1771
02:16:24,867 --> 02:16:26,368
[SPEAKER_10]: They were going eBay for like $500.

1772
02:16:27,008 --> 02:16:30,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I won my Dreamcast at a QZAR all-nighter.

1773
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:34,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1774
02:16:34,612 --> 02:16:35,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we've gotten...

1775
02:16:38,621 --> 02:16:41,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first model PlayStation when they were still going for $700.

1776
02:16:42,423 --> 02:16:45,425
[SPEAKER_10]: We got $100 back from Discover.

1777
02:16:45,445 --> 02:16:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: $700 for that first PlayStation?

1778
02:16:47,205 --> 02:16:49,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they were about that much in the beginning, weren't they?

1779
02:16:49,967 --> 02:16:52,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but we got $100 back from Discover.

1780
02:16:52,728 --> 02:16:54,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dan got his manager's discount on it.

1781
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:56,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess that's kind of good.

1782
02:16:56,730 --> 02:16:57,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And it still works.

1783
02:16:59,151 --> 02:17:00,592
[SPEAKER_10]: And it still plays all of our old stuff.

1784
02:17:02,232 --> 02:17:03,233
[SPEAKER_10]: So next email.

1785
02:17:03,496 --> 02:17:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

1786
02:17:04,556 --> 02:17:05,237
[SPEAKER_02]: How many more emails?

1787
02:17:05,597 --> 02:17:05,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Three.

1788
02:17:06,377 --> 02:17:06,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Geez!

1789
02:17:07,397 --> 02:17:07,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I know!

1790
02:17:08,257 --> 02:17:08,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

1791
02:17:08,738 --> 02:17:09,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Every gamer gets a voice.

1792
02:17:10,338 --> 02:17:11,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the show is three and a half hours long.

1793
02:17:12,218 --> 02:17:12,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, OLR.

1794
02:17:13,039 --> 02:17:18,080
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple weeks ago, DarkSakura did a classic game of the week, which inspired me to get the game for my iPod Touch.

1795
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:20,441
[SPEAKER_10]: More specifically, Puzzle Bobble, a.k.a.

1796
02:17:20,501 --> 02:17:21,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Bust a Move.

1797
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:23,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It was well worth the $5 I spent to get it.

1798
02:17:23,382 --> 02:17:25,422
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very addicting and is full of awesomeness.

1799
02:17:25,782 --> 02:17:26,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep up the good work.

1800
02:17:26,643 --> 02:17:27,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Vince Raven.

1801
02:17:28,143 --> 02:17:28,443
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

1802
02:17:28,503 --> 02:17:30,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure everyone votes for President Cat in the elections.

1803
02:17:30,724 --> 02:17:31,324
[SPEAKER_10]: LOLXD.

1804
02:17:33,527 --> 02:17:33,947
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.

1805
02:17:34,888 --> 02:17:39,209
[SPEAKER_10]: If President Cat was running for Republican, then I think everybody else would not make it.

1806
02:17:40,410 --> 02:17:41,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, huh?

1807
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:41,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

1808
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:42,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to read if there was a question.

1809
02:17:42,711 --> 02:17:43,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I got distracted.

1810
02:17:43,251 --> 02:17:44,031
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there was no question.

1811
02:17:44,211 --> 02:17:46,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody sent me naked photos of one of the people from Glee.

1812
02:17:46,452 --> 02:17:47,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, I want to see that.

1813
02:17:47,853 --> 02:17:52,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wasn't listening to the... Female or male?

1814
02:17:52,435 --> 02:17:52,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Female.

1815
02:17:53,095 --> 02:17:53,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, who?

1816
02:17:54,435 --> 02:17:56,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... It's a video game podcast, right?

1817
02:17:57,497 --> 02:18:00,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just thanking me for referring... What?

1818
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:00,878
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1819
02:18:02,259 --> 02:18:02,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1820
02:18:07,865 --> 02:18:10,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to video games.

1821
02:18:10,428 --> 02:18:11,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1822
02:18:11,629 --> 02:18:12,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that vag in the background?

1823
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:13,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be.

1824
02:18:13,691 --> 02:18:14,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1825
02:18:14,592 --> 02:18:15,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a mirror.

1826
02:18:15,793 --> 02:18:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1827
02:18:16,113 --> 02:18:20,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you see, Jamie, women have a vagina.

1828
02:18:20,778 --> 02:18:21,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1829
02:18:22,059 --> 02:18:22,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And so do you.

1830
02:18:27,895 --> 02:18:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a bitch.

1831
02:18:28,536 --> 02:18:29,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Read an email.

1832
02:18:29,837 --> 02:18:30,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Love you, mean it.

1833
02:18:31,978 --> 02:18:32,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Greetings, OLR.

1834
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:34,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1835
02:18:35,261 --> 02:18:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I just heard that Diablo 3 is now removing PvP to speed up their release time.

1836
02:18:40,025 --> 02:18:41,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting real tired of companies.

1837
02:18:41,766 --> 02:18:42,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be really tired.

1838
02:18:42,987 --> 02:18:43,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1839
02:18:43,948 --> 02:18:44,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, what was the question?

1840
02:18:44,849 --> 02:18:44,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Girl.

1841
02:18:44,969 --> 02:18:45,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1842
02:19:13,795 --> 02:19:17,938
[SPEAKER_10]: It's talking about the Diablo 3 removing the PvP and saying tired of games.

1843
02:19:18,378 --> 02:19:18,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1844
02:19:19,118 --> 02:19:22,100
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, coming out with stuff that's going to be DLC later.

1845
02:19:23,041 --> 02:19:24,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And people having to pay for it.

1846
02:19:24,222 --> 02:19:25,543
[SPEAKER_10]: But they say they're not going to charge for it.

1847
02:19:25,563 --> 02:19:28,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I think it's still the, you mean it's not going to have everything on it?

1848
02:19:28,805 --> 02:19:29,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Meh.

1849
02:19:29,785 --> 02:19:33,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with it because I don't want to wait nine more months for the game to come out.

1850
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like waiting for a baby.

1851
02:19:37,372 --> 02:19:39,814
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have we been waiting for Diablo 3?

1852
02:19:40,194 --> 02:19:44,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And PvP was not one of the elements I personally cared about as much.

1853
02:19:44,798 --> 02:19:48,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it later when they patch it in, but I don't need it right away.

1854
02:19:48,101 --> 02:19:50,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It is like waiting for a baby without the indigestion.

1855
02:19:50,463 --> 02:19:50,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1856
02:19:58,652 --> 02:20:02,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally agree with the fact that gamers don't want to work for unlocks anymore i.e.

1857
02:20:02,576 --> 02:20:11,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur 5 everything is there to use right away and the modes are rather lacking the good old days of gaming are dwindling folks

1858
02:20:14,142 --> 02:20:14,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

1859
02:20:15,703 --> 02:20:16,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

1860
02:20:16,863 --> 02:20:17,683
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1861
02:20:17,803 --> 02:20:18,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Or at least that's all I'm going to read.

1862
02:20:19,424 --> 02:20:21,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

1863
02:20:21,404 --> 02:20:23,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Jamie sadly had to cut a few out tonight.

1864
02:20:23,725 --> 02:20:24,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

1865
02:20:24,445 --> 02:20:26,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I just said if any more arrived, I wasn't going to read them.

1866
02:20:27,126 --> 02:20:27,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next week.

1867
02:20:28,467 --> 02:20:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1868
02:20:28,927 --> 02:20:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki will read them next week.

1869
02:20:30,067 --> 02:20:30,507
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1870
02:20:31,308 --> 02:20:32,828
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be funny if Loki read them.

1871
02:20:33,529 --> 02:20:34,849
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done them before when you're not here.

1872
02:20:35,382 --> 02:20:36,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but while I was here.

1873
02:20:38,388 --> 02:20:39,189
[SPEAKER_02]: The mailbag?

1874
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1875
02:20:40,091 --> 02:20:40,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1876
02:20:41,153 --> 02:20:41,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1877
02:20:42,796 --> 02:20:45,522
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where we get angsty because... because...

1878
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:02,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Upity male bitches.

1879
02:21:03,531 --> 02:21:04,572
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to uppity male bitches.

1880
02:21:05,112 --> 02:21:05,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

1881
02:21:05,613 --> 02:21:05,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Not you.

1882
02:21:06,173 --> 02:21:06,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1883
02:21:07,854 --> 02:21:08,635
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, okay.

1884
02:21:09,415 --> 02:21:10,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a friend.

1885
02:21:10,496 --> 02:21:11,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know where this is going.

1886
02:21:11,617 --> 02:21:12,437
[SPEAKER_10]: You know where this is going.

1887
02:21:12,457 --> 02:21:14,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I know absolutely where this is going.

1888
02:21:14,659 --> 02:21:15,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know, you didn't even have to say it.

1889
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:20,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Who occasionally acts like a stereotypical hysterical woman.

1890
02:21:23,045 --> 02:21:24,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And doesn't admit.

1891
02:21:24,325 --> 02:21:25,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's Nathan Lane in the birdcage.

1892
02:21:27,498 --> 02:21:40,328
[SPEAKER_10]: and doesn't ever admit, well, except for this time, when said person has done something wrong or, you know, gives the roundabout, passive-aggressive type of apology, you know what I mean?

1893
02:21:40,988 --> 02:21:42,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

1894
02:21:44,231 --> 02:22:04,797
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm getting kind of sick of it and I'm getting sick of just that sense of entitlement so but you know what we talked it out things are better I hope that said person watches it but I really got so pissed off that I I haven't been this angry in a long time I got so pissed off I burped

1895
02:22:07,338 --> 02:22:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not lying.

1896
02:22:07,958 --> 02:22:10,079
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent me a message and wow, girl, I just burped.

1897
02:22:10,659 --> 02:22:11,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so angry.

1898
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:11,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I burped.

1899
02:22:12,759 --> 02:22:13,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw up in my mouth.

1900
02:22:14,419 --> 02:22:15,280
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awful.

1901
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And the place I didn't want to do it either.

1902
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:18,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at synagogue.

1903
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:20,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sick and had to leave.

1904
02:22:21,481 --> 02:22:22,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I was so mad.

1905
02:22:23,161 --> 02:22:23,781
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awful.

1906
02:22:24,401 --> 02:22:24,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1907
02:22:25,622 --> 02:22:26,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1908
02:22:26,922 --> 02:22:28,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Girl, F you to Rob.

1909
02:22:28,382 --> 02:22:30,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounded like you were done.

1910
02:22:30,603 --> 02:22:31,483
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have one more.

1911
02:22:31,583 --> 02:22:31,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1912
02:22:32,103 --> 02:22:33,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I forgot what it was.

1913
02:22:33,163 --> 02:22:33,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1914
02:22:33,723 --> 02:22:34,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1915
02:22:34,483 --> 02:22:36,744
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Daylight Savings Time, you whore.

1916
02:22:38,137 --> 02:22:38,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Who were?

1917
02:22:39,458 --> 02:22:39,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Who were?

1918
02:22:40,179 --> 02:22:48,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, okay, last time I went to the Jewish Film Festival, I come home at like 1 and sit down to, you know, check all my email and everything.

1919
02:22:48,906 --> 02:22:52,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at the clock, next thing I know it's 3 because boom, time skip.

1920
02:22:52,990 --> 02:23:00,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm not in bed until like after 4 because I had all this crap to do that I thought I still had another hour to do because I forgot about it.

1921
02:23:01,477 --> 02:23:03,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1922
02:23:20,511 --> 02:23:20,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1923
02:23:22,093 --> 02:23:28,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you to the donut shop in Folsom for not having the baking maple donuts.

1924
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:31,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You sold out of them at what, like 10 in the morning?

1925
02:23:32,064 --> 02:23:35,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, that is just ridiculous.

1926
02:23:36,368 --> 02:23:37,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a single donut.

1927
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think that they would be popular and you'd make a ton of them.

1928
02:23:41,093 --> 02:23:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's my thought.

1929
02:23:45,563 --> 02:23:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just unfair.

1930
02:24:03,252 --> 02:24:03,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1931
02:24:04,033 --> 02:24:04,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more?

1932
02:24:04,753 --> 02:24:05,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1933
02:24:05,174 --> 02:24:05,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1934
02:24:05,494 --> 02:24:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what happens if I cut someone off.

1935
02:24:08,256 --> 02:24:13,040
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to Daylight Savings Time as well.

1936
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a dirty whore.

1937
02:24:14,221 --> 02:24:16,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had two cups of coffee today to compensate.

1938
02:24:16,863 --> 02:24:17,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one!

1939
02:24:17,623 --> 02:24:18,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Two cups of coffee.

1940
02:24:18,384 --> 02:24:19,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I did two, thanks to you.

1941
02:24:19,845 --> 02:24:21,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, fuck, I had three.

1942
02:24:22,267 --> 02:24:22,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to catch up.

1943
02:24:24,713 --> 02:24:36,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I had a really crazy week last week, but a lot of good news and a lot of I don't really feel one way or the other about it news.

1944
02:24:37,418 --> 02:24:38,418
[SPEAKER_02]: When it rains, it pours.

1945
02:24:38,558 --> 02:24:42,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not necessarily an FU, but it's just, damn, I'm going to be busy.

1946
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:46,581
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the fact that there aren't more hours in the day.

1947
02:24:46,641 --> 02:24:48,742
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's one less, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.

1948
02:24:49,162 --> 02:24:50,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I say FU to Daylight Savings Time?

1949
02:24:50,523 --> 02:24:51,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really mean it.

1950
02:24:51,943 --> 02:24:52,363
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1951
02:24:53,184 --> 02:24:57,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can back you up in that completely because fuck it.

1952
02:24:57,627 --> 02:24:58,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, because I'm right.

1953
02:24:58,248 --> 02:24:59,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I like more night time.

1954
02:25:00,109 --> 02:25:01,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I want night time savings time.

1955
02:25:04,232 --> 02:25:06,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to some more news before we get to your calls.

1956
02:25:06,714 --> 02:25:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the 800 number works again this week.

1957
02:25:08,675 --> 02:25:11,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, but we have a few more stories first.

1958
02:25:11,137 --> 02:25:11,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1959
02:25:11,998 --> 02:25:17,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about hopefully not anything I was looking up there.

1960
02:25:18,102 --> 02:25:19,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to talk about that.

1961
02:25:20,203 --> 02:25:20,684
[SPEAKER_02]: More boobs?

1962
02:25:21,687 --> 02:25:22,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's the same boobs.

1963
02:25:25,236 --> 02:25:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Valve.

1964
02:25:28,817 --> 02:25:33,338
[SPEAKER_04]: They, of course, came out and debunked the whole Steam Box debacle thing.

1965
02:25:33,738 --> 02:25:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone was conspiring that they were making some sort of console, and of course, that's not the case.

1966
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:53,722
[SPEAKER_04]: What they were doing, though, is they were making test boxes to test out their big picture initiative, which is basically developing an interface for Steam that looks nice on TV displays.

1967
02:25:54,322 --> 02:26:21,260
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's what those boxes were being used for not necessarily a game console but I mean if you think about it likely story no it actually does sound like a likely story so um you know if you think about it though I mean that kind of setup you could use a pc next to your hooked up to your tv and kind of treat it like a game box you know or something like that I don't know all right

1968
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:24,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are you bummed out with this news?

1969
02:26:24,861 --> 02:26:26,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you hoping for a Steam box?

1970
02:26:26,902 --> 02:26:28,043
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't really care.

1971
02:26:29,083 --> 02:26:30,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a Steam account.

1972
02:26:31,285 --> 02:26:31,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1973
02:26:31,565 --> 02:26:32,365
[SPEAKER_02]: That's surprising.

1974
02:26:32,485 --> 02:26:34,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been neat, but it's not the end of the world.

1975
02:26:35,027 --> 02:26:38,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's still going to be a really good service for the PC, so...

1976
02:26:39,509 --> 02:26:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think I'm right on the Half-Life 3 thing, though, so that means there's not going to be Half-Life 3 until this Steam Box is ready, years and years away.

1977
02:26:46,791 --> 02:26:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, maybe I'm trolling a little bit.

1978
02:26:49,592 --> 02:26:52,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trolling as much as Adidas is, though.

1979
02:26:52,573 --> 02:26:54,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know Adidas, the sporting company?

1980
02:26:54,294 --> 02:26:57,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we don't talk about them a lot with games, but THQ has been sued.

1981
02:26:58,815 --> 02:26:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's my coach.

1982
02:27:24,955 --> 02:27:31,506
[SPEAKER_02]: MyCoach247 got canned.

1983
02:27:32,087 --> 02:27:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: THQ told Adidas in December that it would not be able to present the product and developers who were working on the project were laid off.

1984
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:41,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this was one of those things.

1985
02:27:41,478 --> 02:27:42,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard about the layoffs of THQ.

1986
02:27:42,919 --> 02:27:44,680
[SPEAKER_02]: This was one of those things that was affected.

1987
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And Adidas isn't happy.

1988
02:27:47,002 --> 02:27:49,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So they won $10.6 million in damages.

1989
02:27:50,164 --> 02:27:55,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all scary similar to that Beyonce lawsuit we heard about where they got sued over the canceled Beyonce game.

1990
02:27:56,248 --> 02:27:56,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

1991
02:27:56,869 --> 02:27:57,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that wasn't THQ.

1992
02:27:57,689 --> 02:27:58,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It was somebody else.

1993
02:27:58,210 --> 02:28:03,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, THQ is refusing to turn over the publishing materials to an alternative developer.

1994
02:28:04,234 --> 02:28:06,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably not good if that's true.

1995
02:28:07,476 --> 02:28:07,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.

1996
02:28:07,976 --> 02:28:08,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all allegedly.

1997
02:28:10,194 --> 02:28:15,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Adidas is seeking an injunction preventing THQ from selling or transferring the rights to another company.

1998
02:28:16,957 --> 02:28:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe this was something they were trying to sell off to get some of the money back.

1999
02:28:20,439 --> 02:28:24,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But nope, Adidas won't have it, and they're going to have to duke this out in a court of law.

2000
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, Judge Judy.

2001
02:28:28,442 --> 02:28:29,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But probably not.

2002
02:28:29,723 --> 02:28:31,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get settled, as they always do.

2003
02:28:32,204 --> 02:28:33,784
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura, we need something better.

2004
02:28:33,804 --> 02:28:35,085
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some more warm, fuzzy news.

2005
02:28:37,727 --> 02:28:42,091
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm all for like... Okay, how about Samurai Yeti and Ninja Werewolves?

2006
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:48,918
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a teacher, whose name is Ben Bertoli, he's a 6th grade teacher, who turned his classroom into an MMO.

2007
02:28:50,339 --> 02:29:04,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, he set up an experience system and achievements for doing certain things in conjunction with his class, even giving out extra experience for when people turned in extra credit essays and stuff.

2008
02:29:05,985 --> 02:29:11,947
[SPEAKER_10]: The students are actually helping him remember to keep track of everyone's experience on a tracking board.

2009
02:29:12,387 --> 02:29:13,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't talk about Class Realm.

2010
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:38,001
[SPEAKER_10]: is completely voluntary.

2011
02:29:38,761 --> 02:29:40,362
[SPEAKER_10]: XP is the backbone of Class Realm.

2012
02:29:40,422 --> 02:29:42,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Every 10 XP you earn pushes you to the next level.

2013
02:29:42,803 --> 02:29:43,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone starts off at level one.

2014
02:29:44,804 --> 02:29:58,891
[SPEAKER_10]: XP can be obtained by doing simple things as answering questions, joining in class discussion, working hard on an assignment, helping others, participation, random encounter Friday, and gaining achievements.

2015
02:29:59,211 --> 02:30:03,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Random encounter Friday is when he lets a wild boar loose in the classroom.

2016
02:30:05,070 --> 02:30:08,171
[SPEAKER_10]: 4.

2017
02:30:05,450 --> 02:30:08,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Achievements are gained by completing specific tasks.

2018
02:30:09,771 --> 02:30:16,013
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, a student can obtain Bookworm by reading two unassigned chapter books and explaining the plot and characters to me.

2019
02:30:17,434 --> 02:30:20,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Each achievement has four levels, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Master.

2020
02:30:20,895 --> 02:30:22,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Each level is harder to reach than the one before it.

2021
02:30:23,395 --> 02:30:24,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Boys are pitted against girls.

2022
02:30:25,376 --> 02:30:32,258
[SPEAKER_10]: The gender that can acquire the most achievements by the end of the year will earn extra recess and an ice cream party during lunch.

2023
02:30:34,389 --> 02:30:51,275
[SPEAKER_10]: each Friday is random here's the secret because it's the sixth grade everybody will win the ice cream party so you don't even have to try because that's how these things work hush everyone who wants to battle will put their name in a hat I will draw out two names and they will battle students will be asked a question oh my god it's battle royale shut up

2024
02:30:52,135 --> 02:31:21,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I will repeat the question twice and start battle music The first to write the correct answer on the board and put their hands up will win XP You can only answer once Question subjects are chosen at random Students may join in alliances of up to six classroom citizens The alliance with the highest combined level at the end of the year wins a pizza party All info except for the current amount of XP each student has will be listed online and in the classroom for students and parents to see

2025
02:31:22,867 --> 02:31:25,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, apparently, it's been a big hit.

2026
02:31:26,008 --> 02:31:32,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone's been super enthusiastic and really trying to participate in it.

2027
02:31:32,729 --> 02:31:36,370
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, there's one he called the Newbery Achievement that's based off the Newbery Medal.

2028
02:31:39,071 --> 02:31:41,651
[SPEAKER_10]: It's earned by writing an unassigned five-paragraph essay.

2029
02:31:42,451 --> 02:31:45,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had 20 essays turned into him in the first week.

2030
02:31:45,552 --> 02:31:47,992
[SPEAKER_10]: that are written during students' free time outside of their other work.

2031
02:31:49,433 --> 02:31:52,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently this is really popular.

2032
02:31:53,394 --> 02:31:54,794
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids like it and they're learning with it.

2033
02:31:55,694 --> 02:31:56,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty cool.

2034
02:31:58,054 --> 02:32:02,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Sally, Little Jimmy, you've been called into battle.

2035
02:32:06,816 --> 02:32:07,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to battle!

2036
02:32:10,317 --> 02:32:11,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, for real.

2037
02:32:14,006 --> 02:32:19,390
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's getting kids to actually participate in school and enjoy learning, I think it's a great thing.

2038
02:32:20,391 --> 02:32:21,712
[SPEAKER_02]: In all seriousness, it is.

2039
02:32:22,072 --> 02:32:23,954
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I have to fuck with it because that's what I do here.

2040
02:32:24,354 --> 02:32:25,255
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is.

2041
02:32:25,735 --> 02:32:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that dissimilar from stuff even I experienced when I was that age.

2042
02:32:31,079 --> 02:32:33,920
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, back when some of our listeners weren't even born.

2043
02:32:34,361 --> 02:32:42,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember in the seventh grade, our science teacher used to have these meters that would fill up with time.

2044
02:32:42,905 --> 02:32:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we answered questions correctly or volunteered to do things or do extra work, we would move up the ladder a little bit.

2045
02:32:49,588 --> 02:32:51,489
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to the top, you got a free day.

2046
02:32:52,009 --> 02:32:55,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a free day in the class, you know, like no work, no nothing.

2047
02:32:55,991 --> 02:33:00,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, you know, screw off day or study lab or whatever, which, you know, was kind of cool.

2048
02:33:00,913 --> 02:33:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of a similar thing, right?

2049
02:33:02,273 --> 02:33:03,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You gain experience.

2050
02:33:03,774 --> 02:33:10,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember in the fifth grade, we had a whole little like village with its own economy because I remember one thing I did.

2051
02:33:10,677 --> 02:33:13,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran a shop that rented Nintendo games in my fifth grade class.

2052
02:33:13,978 --> 02:33:14,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

2053
02:33:14,478 --> 02:33:21,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would rent games to, you know, my classmates for like 10 of the fake bucks that were named after the teacher.

2054
02:33:21,801 --> 02:33:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like my business.

2055
02:33:23,262 --> 02:33:24,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Shroop Bucks.

2056
02:33:25,824 --> 02:33:26,184
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2057
02:33:26,845 --> 02:33:27,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Shroop Bucks.

2058
02:33:27,745 --> 02:33:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just don't, you know, I don't want to.

2059
02:33:29,927 --> 02:33:30,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, that wasn't the name.

2060
02:33:31,047 --> 02:33:32,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, same idea.

2061
02:33:32,849 --> 02:33:34,830
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole battle thing is just really funny to me.

2062
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:35,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2063
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help but think of Hunger Games.

2064
02:33:36,891 --> 02:33:38,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everybody's all talking about right now.

2065
02:33:38,753 --> 02:33:39,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a crap.

2066
02:33:41,835 --> 02:33:41,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

2067
02:33:43,308 --> 02:33:52,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, I say good for you, and he's apparently a regular reader and commenter on Kotaku, so the news is just really catching fire.

2068
02:33:52,932 --> 02:33:56,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope that it's actually something that he can market for other schools.

2069
02:33:57,114 --> 02:33:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you did there, catching fire.

2070
02:33:59,875 --> 02:34:00,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

2071
02:34:01,136 --> 02:34:02,016
[SPEAKER_10]: What, don't stand in fire?

2072
02:34:02,236 --> 02:34:03,617
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the Hunger Games reference.

2073
02:34:03,637 --> 02:34:05,237
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hunger Games sequel is catching fire.

2074
02:34:10,322 --> 02:34:20,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a shit about Hunger Games.

2075
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:23,412
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I've ever heard of it is the name.

2076
02:34:23,952 --> 02:34:24,433
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2077
02:34:24,513 --> 02:34:25,633
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know anything about it.

2078
02:34:25,954 --> 02:34:27,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And guess who doesn't want to know anything about it?

2079
02:34:28,055 --> 02:34:28,696
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be me.

2080
02:34:29,036 --> 02:34:29,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

2081
02:34:30,217 --> 02:34:30,737
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

2082
02:34:31,938 --> 02:34:32,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't care.

2083
02:34:32,659 --> 02:34:33,199
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hungry.

2084
02:34:35,020 --> 02:34:37,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a bunch of hippos and they're really hungry.

2085
02:34:41,267 --> 02:34:43,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what that sound is?

2086
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:43,730
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2087
02:34:43,790 --> 02:34:48,135
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my head repeatedly hitting the microphone as I bang it into it.

2088
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I've successfully derailed the show.

2089
02:34:56,535 --> 02:35:02,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, help us get back on track and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2090
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, I wonder what Rob was like when kids didn't return the Nintendo games on time.

2091
02:35:08,582 --> 02:35:09,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you mean to them?

2092
02:35:10,123 --> 02:35:12,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, just one finger for each day late.

2093
02:35:16,887 --> 02:35:17,668
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we roll.

2094
02:35:18,548 --> 02:35:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2095
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:24,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tony Hawk, um,

2096
02:35:26,209 --> 02:35:27,010
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a little sad.

2097
02:35:27,831 --> 02:35:28,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad, Tony Hawk.

2098
02:35:30,715 --> 02:35:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: He says that Ride was a bit rushed and that people didn't give it a chance.

2099
02:35:37,403 --> 02:35:39,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, you should try Tony Hawk's Ride.

2100
02:35:40,687 --> 02:35:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a chance.

2101
02:35:42,048 --> 02:35:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the game may have been a little rushed and the critics didn't like it.

2102
02:35:47,219 --> 02:35:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a chance.

2103
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:56,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that didn't stop them from creating a sequel that I would assume wouldn't have been as rushed because, you know, they would have had a whole year to polish it, but still sucked.

2104
02:35:56,901 --> 02:36:00,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see the logic there, but whatever.

2105
02:36:00,601 --> 02:36:01,301
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was rushed.

2106
02:36:03,382 --> 02:36:14,844
[SPEAKER_04]: He's quoted, I think Ride was a bit rushed for a number of reasons, mostly because probably for about the first half of the development process, it was just figuring out how to make a board and how to make it work.

2107
02:36:16,784 --> 02:36:18,428
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in uncharted territory.

2108
02:36:20,679 --> 02:36:26,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So the game was a bit rushed, but I still feel critics never really gave it a chance in terms of learning how to play.

2109
02:36:27,322 --> 02:36:34,746
[SPEAKER_04]: They got on it, and they went straight into expert mode because supposedly they were expert gamers, and they didn't really learn the mechanics of how the board works.

2110
02:36:35,266 --> 02:36:41,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I felt like already in their mind, they'd made up their decision before it came out.

2111
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:47,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a gimmick, and it was a peripheral and whatnot, and they never really took the time to learn how to play it.

2112
02:36:47,392 --> 02:36:48,273
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2113
02:37:04,572 --> 02:37:05,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2114
02:37:29,008 --> 02:37:31,470
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no excuses, Tony Hawk.

2115
02:37:31,631 --> 02:37:32,672
[SPEAKER_04]: The game sucked.

2116
02:37:32,812 --> 02:37:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

2117
02:37:33,472 --> 02:37:41,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a dumb idea because Activision thought, hey, we're going to cash in on all these peripheral games because we made money on DJ Hero.

2118
02:37:43,182 --> 02:37:45,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think DJ Hero came out around the same time.

2119
02:37:45,243 --> 02:37:50,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we made money on Guitar Hero, so we're going to put out this peripheral game because people like peripherals.

2120
02:37:50,428 --> 02:37:51,890
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes them more interactive.

2121
02:37:53,151 --> 02:37:54,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just didn't work out.

2122
02:37:55,253 --> 02:37:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Get over it.

2123
02:37:55,734 --> 02:37:55,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Get over it.

2124
02:38:17,893 --> 02:38:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more story for you guys.

2125
02:38:19,695 --> 02:38:24,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2126
02:38:25,282 --> 02:38:27,244
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about a little bit of resolution.

2127
02:38:27,264 --> 02:38:30,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I just reported on some legal troubles in one area, but this is about...

2128
02:38:32,273 --> 02:38:35,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolution to one lawsuit that was going to happen.

2129
02:38:35,594 --> 02:38:37,675
[SPEAKER_02]: This was between Bethesda and Mojang.

2130
02:38:37,695 --> 02:38:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember this.

2131
02:38:39,315 --> 02:38:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It was over the name Scrolls.

2132
02:38:42,436 --> 02:38:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

2133
02:38:42,856 --> 02:38:47,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Bethesda felt that the name Scrolls was infringing on its trademark for Elder Scrolls.

2134
02:38:47,918 --> 02:38:49,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And people might get confused.

2135
02:38:50,439 --> 02:38:58,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like when I reviewed Journey earlier in the show, I had to clarify that it's not the one about the 1980s band, you know, because the games are so similar once you've played them.

2136
02:39:00,242 --> 02:39:00,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow...

2137
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some tweets.

2138
02:39:04,302 --> 02:39:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that official statements come from tweets now.

2139
02:39:07,865 --> 02:39:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: That they have settled with yay heart.

2140
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:14,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The settlement is that we give them the trademark.

2141
02:39:14,962 --> 02:39:18,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We get to keep the name and won't make an Elder Scrolls competitor using the name.

2142
02:39:19,085 --> 02:39:19,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the settlement.

2143
02:39:20,226 --> 02:39:22,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you don't get to hear about the details of the settlement.

2144
02:39:22,307 --> 02:39:25,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just glad no finance stuff were changed or whatever.

2145
02:39:26,831 --> 02:39:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get to have a trademark on Scrolls, but Bethesda will leave them alone as long as they don't try to infringe on epic epicness of first-person role-playing games, which I don't think Scrolls was supposed to be.

2146
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:44,582
[SPEAKER_02]: there you go fantastic fantastic

2147
02:39:45,379 --> 02:39:54,003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we are going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2148
02:39:54,843 --> 02:39:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, we're already getting calls.

2149
02:39:56,404 --> 02:40:00,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And, by the way, we will go to the Twitter here, also twitter.com slash OLR.

2150
02:40:00,265 --> 02:40:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: But first we have some calls coming in.

2151
02:40:01,766 --> 02:40:02,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2152
02:40:02,746 --> 02:40:03,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2153
02:40:03,707 --> 02:40:04,547
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Shane.

2154
02:40:04,647 --> 02:40:07,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shane, it's my co-host from Horde House.

2155
02:40:07,928 --> 02:40:08,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It sure isn't.

2156
02:40:10,289 --> 02:40:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

2157
02:40:10,809 --> 02:40:11,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

2158
02:40:11,310 --> 02:40:11,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on that show.

2159
02:40:12,597 --> 02:40:13,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I guess I am sometimes.

2160
02:40:13,977 --> 02:40:17,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, except this week you could only talk about Mass Effect, which by the way, screw you.

2161
02:40:18,259 --> 02:40:23,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Mass Effect this week, which was kind of like peer pressure in a way, and you do that a lot, and I kind of despise you for it.

2162
02:40:24,020 --> 02:40:26,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of because I blew up your phone about it.

2163
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:28,301
[SPEAKER_02]: You really did, my god.

2164
02:40:29,622 --> 02:40:30,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have unlimited texting.

2165
02:40:30,702 --> 02:40:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is Kaiden, and why is Shane in love with him?

2166
02:40:35,393 --> 02:40:35,734
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

2167
02:40:35,754 --> 02:40:37,075
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you calling in for tonight?

2168
02:40:37,456 --> 02:40:40,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I was calling because I want to talk about something I don't normally talk about.

2169
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:41,401
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

2170
02:40:43,103 --> 02:40:43,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect.

2171
02:40:44,485 --> 02:40:44,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course!

2172
02:40:44,946 --> 02:40:46,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard you talk about Mass Effect before.

2173
02:40:47,649 --> 02:40:51,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you here to monopolize the show with Mass Effect chat just like you did on Horde House this week?

2174
02:40:51,647 --> 02:40:51,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2175
02:40:52,267 --> 02:40:52,608
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2176
02:40:52,648 --> 02:40:54,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's up?

2177
02:40:54,469 --> 02:40:58,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to not talk about the story so much or how awesome the game is.

2178
02:40:59,152 --> 02:41:00,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't spoil it.

2179
02:41:00,573 --> 02:41:02,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about that ending that everybody's petitioning.

2180
02:41:02,934 --> 02:41:04,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the ending yet.

2181
02:41:04,175 --> 02:41:05,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not beat the game.

2182
02:41:05,115 --> 02:41:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that people are petitioning BioWare to change the ending?

2183
02:41:08,217 --> 02:41:09,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's apparently that bad.

2184
02:41:09,514 --> 02:41:12,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of scared.

2185
02:41:13,215 --> 02:41:16,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want it to end so I don't get disappointed.

2186
02:41:17,855 --> 02:41:19,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, that's not what I'm talking about.

2187
02:41:20,216 --> 02:41:25,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about how much respect I have for BioWare now.

2188
02:41:25,697 --> 02:41:25,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh?

2189
02:41:26,637 --> 02:41:37,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because this is the first game I have ever played in which I feel like they did not take any stereotypes seriously.

2190
02:41:37,979 --> 02:41:53,354
[SPEAKER_07]: and put them into their gay characters not a single one and I think they actually humanized them instead of using them for comic relief or something to just flirt with or hook up with what about Dragon Age?

2191
02:41:53,934 --> 02:41:57,658
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dragon Age is totally terrible with that stuff.

2192
02:41:58,759 --> 02:42:00,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Zevran in the first game, especially.

2193
02:42:01,602 --> 02:42:10,271
[SPEAKER_07]: But in this game, I feel like they're just normal people who happen to be gay, and I don't see that in games.

2194
02:42:10,632 --> 02:42:16,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really, really makes me feel like BioWare is a company I should support more often.

2195
02:42:18,689 --> 02:42:19,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2196
02:42:19,129 --> 02:42:20,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what else I can really say to that.

2197
02:42:21,351 --> 02:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you only explored the male-male relationships in that game or have you looked into how it compares to male-female or female-female?

2198
02:42:30,578 --> 02:42:41,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and I'm only going to say it's for three because I've seen stuff on one where it was pretty, I think I described it at work, skanky.

2199
02:42:41,327 --> 02:42:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes relationships are skanky.

2200
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:51,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but I wanted something more, and this game has given it to me.

2201
02:42:51,624 --> 02:42:59,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I've only seen male-male, and actually the one I romance technically isn't gay, but it's just because I couldn't resist his charms.

2202
02:43:00,590 --> 02:43:06,074
[SPEAKER_07]: And I won't say who, because that could be a spoiler, I guess, but really, romancing people isn't a spoiler.

2203
02:43:07,293 --> 02:43:27,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it interesting because I asked you in an email this week when you wouldn't shut up about the game, I asked you what kind of different relationship options were available and it seemed like the people that choose to play FemShep who want to be in a relationship with a male, so an opposite sex relationship but with a female lead, was the most limited.

2204
02:43:27,167 --> 02:43:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2205
02:43:27,907 --> 02:43:29,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, in three at least it is.

2206
02:43:29,731 --> 02:43:39,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that to be kind of sad because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of ladies out there that would like to romance some men in their games and they don't really get that option in this game.

2207
02:43:39,887 --> 02:43:44,631
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they get to romance ice cream tubs now instead because they're sad.

2208
02:43:44,991 --> 02:43:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very sad.

2209
02:43:47,193 --> 02:43:48,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe DLC.

2210
02:43:48,134 --> 02:43:48,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you never know.

2211
02:43:48,915 --> 02:43:51,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a possibility they're going to add more romance options in later on?

2212
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:52,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2213
02:43:54,960 --> 02:44:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't imagine so because the first DLC character is...

2214
02:44:01,065 --> 02:44:05,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Romanceable, to my knowledge, and it'd be really awkward if they were.

2215
02:44:06,990 --> 02:44:07,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But you never know.

2216
02:44:08,011 --> 02:44:08,811
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Bioware.

2217
02:44:08,871 --> 02:44:12,514
[SPEAKER_07]: They can do whatever they want and do it right, apparently.

2218
02:44:13,635 --> 02:44:18,619
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, that game's amazing, and I have cried three times during it so far now.

2219
02:44:19,019 --> 02:44:19,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Three.

2220
02:44:20,060 --> 02:44:22,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It has beaten the previous game's record.

2221
02:44:23,643 --> 02:44:24,984
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the previous game before that?

2222
02:44:25,644 --> 02:44:26,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Suikoden II.

2223
02:44:27,105 --> 02:44:27,806
[SPEAKER_02]: That was twice.

2224
02:44:27,826 --> 02:44:28,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice.

2225
02:44:28,641 --> 02:44:34,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of go back to the main point of the call, because, you know, to wrap up soon and all that, why is this so important to you?

2226
02:44:35,486 --> 02:44:37,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's something I can relate to.

2227
02:44:38,508 --> 02:44:43,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't want to relate to, like, the skanky options that people would have before.

2228
02:44:45,873 --> 02:44:50,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I want, you know, a really nice story, and that's what I'm getting.

2229
02:44:52,017 --> 02:44:57,821
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say to people who say, why does Bioware have to put gay stuff in every game?

2230
02:44:59,462 --> 02:45:01,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they want to give more options to everybody.

2231
02:45:04,831 --> 02:45:05,673
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what I would say.

2232
02:45:05,833 --> 02:45:07,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, did somebody get shot in the background?

2233
02:45:08,397 --> 02:45:10,420
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that is a washer being...

2234
02:45:13,809 --> 02:45:15,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody just shot you for your opinion.

2235
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:16,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really unfortunate.

2236
02:45:16,411 --> 02:45:17,612
[SPEAKER_02]: What a hideous place we live in.

2237
02:45:18,572 --> 02:45:18,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?

2238
02:45:18,872 --> 02:45:19,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still there?

2239
02:45:20,293 --> 02:45:20,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm still here.

2240
02:45:20,974 --> 02:45:23,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to do another conversation at the same time.

2241
02:45:23,696 --> 02:45:24,676
[SPEAKER_02]: That works out great.

2242
02:45:25,937 --> 02:45:26,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess, yeah.

2243
02:45:26,638 --> 02:45:37,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one thing I've sensed, even just from playing the first game before, not even talking about relationships or whatever, is that I do notice there's so many options in the conversation and so forth to play the game in many different ways.

2244
02:45:37,745 --> 02:45:39,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something I kind of noticed in Star Wars, too.

2245
02:45:40,907 --> 02:45:43,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Although in Star Wars, the paths were very well lit.

2246
02:45:44,969 --> 02:45:47,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's another thing.

2247
02:45:48,831 --> 02:45:51,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you kind of said something about the choices and the paths.

2248
02:45:52,772 --> 02:46:05,617
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I took with the character I romanced in 3 for Mass Effect, it wasn't like we were having a normal dialogue conversation, then bam, here's a hook up with you option or a not hook up with you option.

2249
02:46:05,637 --> 02:46:08,658
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something that just kind of evolved naturally.

2250
02:46:08,818 --> 02:46:12,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually kind of came out of nowhere in my opinion, but not in like a...

2251
02:46:15,239 --> 02:46:15,700
[SPEAKER_02]: You alright?

2252
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:16,761
[SPEAKER_02]: He cut out.

2253
02:46:17,561 --> 02:46:18,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I'm back.

2254
02:46:18,202 --> 02:46:21,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I hit the wrong button.

2255
02:46:21,425 --> 02:46:21,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice.

2256
02:46:22,006 --> 02:46:27,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of went natural, and I didn't have to pick skanky stuff to get there.

2257
02:46:27,271 --> 02:46:34,639
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing that some people, I guess, might misinterpret, is that there's not the option, like, you know, it isn't on the menu, like...

2258
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:37,341
[SPEAKER_02]: What should we do now?

2259
02:46:37,761 --> 02:46:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, let's go kill aliens, or let's do research on the next mission, or let's go upstairs and fuck like rabbits.

2260
02:46:45,744 --> 02:46:46,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like how it plays out.

2261
02:46:48,402 --> 02:46:49,663
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's nothing like that at all.

2262
02:46:49,743 --> 02:46:54,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I'm not, okay, gotta try to do this not spoilery and kind of be general.

2263
02:46:54,727 --> 02:47:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Something happens that's major, and then, well, if you've played Mass Effect, you can do missions, and then one of your home base of operations is the Citadel.

2264
02:47:04,735 --> 02:47:05,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a spoiler.

2265
02:47:05,636 --> 02:47:06,557
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always around.

2266
02:47:07,758 --> 02:47:22,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do some missions and then something happens and then you can, you know, run around the Citadel and we just happen to have a friendly lunch conversation that turned into us going out all of a sudden in a really, really nicely written scene.

2267
02:47:23,806 --> 02:47:51,465
[SPEAKER_07]: and what's cool about that too is the actual gay guy in the game I was doing some conversations with him and he said something about looking at some eye candy and one of my options were no I'm interested in women and the other one was like well what about me and I picked up well what about me because I didn't want to screw up what I had already done and he's like well yeah of course I'm looking at you but I know you're with so and so so it's like oh crap the game actually knows the choices I've made and it's like commenting on them

2268
02:47:52,607 --> 02:47:53,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2269
02:47:55,252 --> 02:48:01,605
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I guess I'm going to have to hurry up and play one and two so I can see more of this in action in three because one's still kind of basic, but I just started.

2270
02:48:03,154 --> 02:48:04,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we gotta let you go to get more calls.

2271
02:48:05,016 --> 02:48:06,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other quick thoughts here before we let you go?

2272
02:48:07,259 --> 02:48:07,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, nope.

2273
02:48:07,960 --> 02:48:19,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, also the multiplayer is really fun, so sadly it's part of the experience to get the best ending from what I understand, but I played it for two hours straight today and had a blast, so I suggest people at least give it a shot.

2274
02:48:20,053 --> 02:48:20,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you go.

2275
02:48:20,995 --> 02:48:21,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for calling, Shane.

2276
02:48:22,336 --> 02:48:22,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, bye.

2277
02:48:23,177 --> 02:48:23,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2278
02:48:23,797 --> 02:48:23,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2279
02:48:48,286 --> 02:48:49,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So two questions there.

2280
02:48:49,186 --> 02:48:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show?

2281
02:48:52,487 --> 02:48:53,688
[SPEAKER_02]: That question was asked a couple days ago.

2282
02:48:53,728 --> 02:48:54,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Coffee.

2283
02:48:54,928 --> 02:48:56,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been thinking about that question.

2284
02:48:56,489 --> 02:48:57,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't know if I have an answer.

2285
02:48:58,169 --> 02:49:00,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what keeps me motivated to do this show.

2286
02:49:01,610 --> 02:49:02,751
[SPEAKER_02]: The people, obviously.

2287
02:49:03,111 --> 02:49:07,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing you guys come out and chat and support what we're doing here is a huge motivator.

2288
02:49:07,372 --> 02:49:14,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting to hang with Matt and Jamie and knowing that we're creating this thing on the internet that even if it's just two or three people that enjoy it, people are enjoying it.

2289
02:49:14,454 --> 02:49:14,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Coffee.

2290
02:49:14,935 --> 02:49:15,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge motivator.

2291
02:49:16,315 --> 02:49:16,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinkberry.

2292
02:49:17,056 --> 02:49:17,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinkberry.

2293
02:49:17,737 --> 02:49:18,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Coffee, Pinkberry.

2294
02:49:18,598 --> 02:49:20,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Are both very big motivators, certainly.

2295
02:49:20,881 --> 02:49:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And my own ego.

2296
02:49:22,423 --> 02:49:24,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the phone line is lighting up right now.

2297
02:49:24,666 --> 02:49:25,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.

2298
02:49:25,087 --> 02:49:27,590
[SPEAKER_02]: My screen is like full of like rings right now.

2299
02:49:27,630 --> 02:49:28,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge motivator as well.

2300
02:49:28,531 --> 02:49:29,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all names I recognize.

2301
02:49:30,073 --> 02:49:30,353
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2302
02:49:31,134 --> 02:49:33,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another call and see who's on the line.

2303
02:49:33,057 --> 02:49:33,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2304
02:49:33,878 --> 02:49:34,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2305
02:49:34,892 --> 02:49:35,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up?

2306
02:49:35,492 --> 02:49:36,133
[SPEAKER_05]: This is X-Link.

2307
02:49:36,193 --> 02:49:37,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?

2308
02:49:37,954 --> 02:49:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, doing well.

2309
02:49:38,934 --> 02:49:39,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time.

2310
02:49:39,594 --> 02:49:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it has been a while.

2311
02:49:41,616 --> 02:49:42,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

2312
02:49:42,636 --> 02:49:46,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's just kind of ironic, not to talk about Mass Effect 3, because I haven't played it myself.

2313
02:49:47,018 --> 02:49:48,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play the first two.

2314
02:49:48,379 --> 02:49:56,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love how they did do the stuff, though, from the choices you make in your first game can affect a lot of outcomes in the second game.

2315
02:49:58,826 --> 02:50:02,832
[SPEAKER_05]: and how I supposedly guess how the stuff in the first and second can also impact the third.

2316
02:50:02,872 --> 02:50:06,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they added that kind of like a continuous storyline.

2317
02:50:06,918 --> 02:50:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like you're replaying something over and over and over again that's brand new for a three-part series.

2318
02:50:13,648 --> 02:50:15,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like the fact that how

2319
02:50:16,354 --> 02:50:20,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything can have a pro or con effect to something else within the game.

2320
02:50:20,858 --> 02:50:26,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the entire reason I started with 1, because I will tell you, I was tempted to just jump ahead to 3, but I didn't.

2321
02:50:27,383 --> 02:50:34,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it's really cool to know the fact that they took the inventory system and made it better and more flowed and more easy.

2322
02:50:34,589 --> 02:50:36,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God, because in 1, it's a bit of a nightmare.

2323
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:39,873
[SPEAKER_05]: From 1 to 2, because 1 and 2 is so night and day, and the controlling was too.

2324
02:50:40,633 --> 02:50:44,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I played 1, and then there was a big gap between me playing 1 and Part 2.

2325
02:50:44,577 --> 02:50:44,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like,

2326
02:50:45,953 --> 02:50:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I doing this right?

2327
02:50:46,974 --> 02:50:47,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the right way?

2328
02:50:47,855 --> 02:50:51,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does this feel like it's changed so much?

2329
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird, but you get used to it.

2330
02:50:54,103 --> 02:50:56,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not too much, though, within the game.

2331
02:50:56,526 --> 02:50:57,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else have you been playing lately?

2332
02:50:58,608 --> 02:51:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're not playing Mass Effect 3, but what are you playing these days?

2333
02:51:01,832 --> 02:51:02,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

2334
02:51:03,422 --> 02:51:05,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than WoW, L.A.

2335
02:51:06,124 --> 02:51:07,925
[SPEAKER_05]: North.

2336
02:51:08,486 --> 02:51:11,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You know me, I'm a human whore.

2337
02:51:12,488 --> 02:51:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also such as for the Xbox, so right now I'm like

2338
02:51:16,803 --> 02:51:21,027
[SPEAKER_05]: My gamer ADD is so bad, I have only ever got every single possible achievement in one game.

2339
02:51:21,627 --> 02:51:24,690
[SPEAKER_05]: For my first one, my first one was Assassin's Creed.

2340
02:51:42,766 --> 02:52:10,260
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was a bitch mine you would never guess my perfect achievement game the only one is Rally-X on Xbox Live Arcade new Rally-X the remake because I used to legit love that game back in the day when I was a kid and so I'm pretty decent at it but yeah that's the only one yeah I thought my second one was going to be Uno but yeah some people can really mess you up in that game so still to this day so that's kind of intriguing so hmm

2341
02:52:12,164 --> 02:52:14,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Play Rusty Hearts 2, which is an awesome game.

2342
02:52:14,305 --> 02:52:21,186
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like WoW, I strongly suggest joining up with me whenever you see me on Steam, Rob, because we're friends.

2343
02:52:21,266 --> 02:52:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Play some Rusty Hearts with me, man.

2344
02:52:22,406 --> 02:52:23,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll like it, trust me.

2345
02:52:24,786 --> 02:52:27,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a free game, or is this like a pay one, or what?

2346
02:52:27,527 --> 02:52:27,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

2347
02:52:28,047 --> 02:52:28,527
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

2348
02:52:28,587 --> 02:52:29,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Free to play.

2349
02:52:29,427 --> 02:52:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely awesome.

2350
02:52:30,467 --> 02:52:33,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually, believe it or not, I made my own little guild within the game.

2351
02:52:34,548 --> 02:52:36,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how cool this thing is.

2352
02:52:38,029 --> 02:52:40,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much sky's the limit, and it's like

2353
02:52:41,925 --> 02:52:42,926
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you explain it?

2354
02:52:42,966 --> 02:52:54,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like WoW type, but also it's like when you're running through the dungeons, it's more feeling like a first-person scroll, like you're going from room to room kind of like, and you're being off on stuff.

2355
02:52:54,615 --> 02:52:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way, if you see him being played, it's really cool, so...

2356
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:00,090
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2357
02:53:00,590 --> 02:53:04,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, X-Link, any other quick shout-outs you want to get out before we get more calls?

2358
02:53:04,611 --> 02:53:12,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really at this moment, but also they need to quit putting the disc DLC within the disc and stuff and then charging double the money for that of the game.

2359
02:53:13,073 --> 02:53:14,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's getting ridiculous.

2360
02:53:14,473 --> 02:53:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: They really need to quit on that.

2361
02:53:16,234 --> 02:53:19,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand they're trying to make some extra money, but it's really seriously getting out of hand.

2362
02:53:19,854 --> 02:53:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with a lot of people on that subject.

2363
02:53:21,915 --> 02:53:22,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone too far.

2364
02:53:22,975 --> 02:53:23,215
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2365
02:53:23,675 --> 02:53:23,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

2366
02:53:24,015 --> 02:53:24,695
[SPEAKER_02]: You take care, buddy.

2367
02:53:24,735 --> 02:53:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the various games.

2368
02:53:26,076 --> 02:53:28,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of these days I'll catch up in Mass Effect.

2369
02:53:29,337 --> 02:53:30,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

2370
02:53:30,117 --> 02:53:30,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Quit playing Tying Tower.

2371
02:53:30,977 --> 02:53:31,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Do so.

2372
02:53:31,457 --> 02:53:31,937
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll love it.

2373
02:53:32,338 --> 02:53:32,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try.

2374
02:53:33,018 --> 02:53:35,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But Alan makes me check on my tower.

2375
02:53:36,999 --> 02:53:38,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't want to play.

2376
02:53:38,219 --> 02:53:40,040
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, show me the people in your tower.

2377
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:41,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the people in your tower.

2378
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:43,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably said that way you can play Mass Effect.

2379
02:53:43,581 --> 02:53:47,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And then soon if, you know, what was said earlier.

2380
02:53:47,782 --> 02:53:48,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we get to that earlier?

2381
02:53:50,663 --> 02:53:51,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were going to talk about that.

2382
02:53:52,684 --> 02:53:54,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed half of your show, unfortunately.

2383
02:53:54,985 --> 02:53:59,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm running Dragon's Soul with my new guild, unfortunately.

2384
02:53:59,227 --> 02:54:00,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The guild master put me in charge of it.

2385
02:54:00,867 --> 02:54:01,948
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, here you go.

2386
02:54:02,268 --> 02:54:03,088
[SPEAKER_05]: You're running this team.

2387
02:54:03,128 --> 02:54:05,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, uh, okay.

2388
02:54:05,189 --> 02:54:06,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're running it in the weekends.

2389
02:54:06,650 --> 02:54:08,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, oh, gravy.

2390
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:10,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got to lead a raid this week.

2391
02:54:10,871 --> 02:54:12,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk all about it on Horde House this week.

2392
02:54:13,312 --> 02:54:13,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

2393
02:54:13,772 --> 02:54:14,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.

2394
02:54:14,593 --> 02:54:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We should swap notes.

2395
02:54:15,753 --> 02:54:16,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, man.

2396
02:54:16,253 --> 02:54:16,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk to you later.

2397
02:54:17,654 --> 02:54:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done a raid since everyone stopped playing on our server I'm sorry, I just went where there was a lot of people I picked based on the times, it was all the times They were like, we raid this and this day from this and this time I'm like, great, that works for my schedule, let's do it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2400
02:54:43,973 --> 02:54:52,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know Jamie is already tired about the Sonic CD soundtrack thing, but... She's gonna go to the bathroom, I'll be back when you're done.

2401
02:54:52,339 --> 02:54:53,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him have his voice.

[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay, go ahead.

2403
02:54:55,601 --> 02:54:55,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

2404
02:54:55,941 --> 02:55:08,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I like both soundtracks, both the Japanese and the American one, but the best Sonic game soundtrack is Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

2405
02:55:09,352 --> 02:55:09,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2406
02:55:10,693 --> 02:55:11,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, totally.

2407
02:55:11,474 --> 02:55:12,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, finally.

2408
02:55:13,156 --> 02:55:17,080
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you are the peace convention calling into the show.

2409
02:55:18,381 --> 02:55:20,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially ice cap level, am I right?

2410
02:55:21,685 --> 02:55:22,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

2411
02:55:22,185 --> 02:55:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I can sign on to that.

2412
02:55:24,901 --> 02:55:45,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic CD, Japanese, American, they both suck compared to Sonic 3 Ice Cap, Ice Cap Music, so much the best Finally, a peace treaty has been negotiated Now we just need to get Bobby to sign, alright Yeah, we need to We'll see, we'll see Well, what else is on your mind?

2413
02:55:45,147 --> 02:55:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing lately?

2414
02:55:48,808 --> 02:55:52,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly Team Fortress 2 and Beat Hazard.

2415
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:54,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Beat Hazard.

2416
02:55:54,450 --> 02:55:55,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They just ported that to iPhone.

2417
02:55:55,810 --> 02:55:56,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to play it though.

2418
02:55:58,631 --> 02:56:02,012
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to port it to Android so I can play it there too.

2419
02:56:04,153 --> 02:56:05,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I play a lot of Beat Hazard.

2420
02:56:07,234 --> 02:56:09,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm at level 340 right now.

2421
02:56:09,614 --> 02:56:09,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang.

2422
02:56:13,484 --> 02:56:14,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a lot.

2423
02:56:14,464 --> 02:56:18,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not even on the top of the leaderboard, so yeah.

2424
02:56:20,646 --> 02:56:21,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2425
02:56:22,687 --> 02:56:24,408
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some good songs to play?

2426
02:56:24,428 --> 02:56:26,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Beat Hazard, you get to do your own soundtrack.

2427
02:56:27,128 --> 02:56:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some good songs?

2428
02:56:28,509 --> 02:56:30,569
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of your favorite songs to play in Beat Hazard?

2429
02:56:32,210 --> 02:56:41,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly, I'm going to go by genre, electronic music, trance, lots of music with heavy bass.

2430
02:56:43,197 --> 02:56:49,282
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets you lots of points, and it's pretty fun to play, especially on suicide mode.

2431
02:56:49,982 --> 02:56:50,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of enemies.

2432
02:56:51,443 --> 02:57:01,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would offer to play you sometime, but you probably would absolutely kill me, because I had some problems with some of those achievements for the holiday event, and it was pretty sad.

2433
02:57:01,752 --> 02:57:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow, Actdeft, I'm going to wrap up to let you go and get more calls, but I leave you with the official Peace Treaty music of OLR.

2434
02:57:12,608 --> 02:57:12,908
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

2435
02:57:12,928 --> 02:57:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to jam to this while we wait for our next call.

2436
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:16,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2437
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:16,650
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2438
02:57:16,930 --> 02:57:17,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2439
02:57:18,351 --> 02:57:18,751
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2440
02:57:18,831 --> 02:57:19,031
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2441
02:57:19,051 --> 02:57:19,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2442
02:57:22,092 --> 02:57:22,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

2443
02:57:23,933 --> 02:57:24,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

2444
02:57:24,294 --> 02:57:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only play a clip because, you know, copyright and all that stuff.

2445
02:57:26,815 --> 02:57:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2446
02:57:27,595 --> 02:57:30,556
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2447
02:57:30,597 --> 02:57:34,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to the Rob D question from earlier, how do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show?

2448
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:40,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously, a lot of it is the people.

2449
02:57:40,221 --> 02:57:42,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I have an easy answer for it.

2450
02:57:42,062 --> 02:57:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of have to make it a priority.

2451
02:57:44,502 --> 02:57:48,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you allow yourself to be like, oh, but the Amazing Race is on tonight.

2452
02:57:48,984 --> 02:57:50,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really would just rather watch that instead.

2453
02:57:50,664 --> 02:57:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's going to kind of fall apart.

2454
02:57:52,325 --> 02:57:57,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of us have just kind of made a commitment like, we're going to do OLR no matter what.

2455
02:57:57,867 --> 02:58:01,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, there's going to be some things that are more important.

2456
02:58:01,790 --> 02:58:04,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's just because we need a break, like Disneyland.

2457
02:58:04,552 --> 02:58:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Disneyland more important than OLR?

2458
02:58:06,293 --> 02:58:06,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2459
02:58:06,853 --> 02:58:09,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes and no.

2460
02:58:09,755 --> 02:58:10,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean, though?

2461
02:58:10,496 --> 02:58:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: If we did it every week, then why would we do OLR?

2462
02:58:12,677 --> 02:58:13,878
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyhow.

2463
02:58:14,958 --> 02:58:15,999
[SPEAKER_02]: The other half of the question, real quick.

2464
02:58:16,359 --> 02:58:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular basis?

2465
02:58:19,661 --> 02:58:20,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's called Horde House.

2466
02:58:21,903 --> 02:58:24,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jamie had one for a while, too, and maybe she'll have something new in the future.

2467
02:58:25,425 --> 02:58:27,106
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as pre-recorded segments for the show...

2468
02:58:28,891 --> 02:58:32,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a suggestion, but I'm always open to ideas.

2469
02:58:33,653 --> 02:58:38,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, I will admit this, there was a time where we were talking about doing not break music in the middle, but something else.

2470
02:58:39,055 --> 02:58:41,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never know what might happen here at OLR.

2471
02:58:42,176 --> 02:58:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: We got another call coming in.

2472
02:58:43,056 --> 02:58:43,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to it.

2473
02:58:43,616 --> 02:58:44,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2474
02:58:44,477 --> 02:58:44,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2475
02:58:45,337 --> 02:58:45,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma.

2476
02:58:46,057 --> 02:58:46,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ranma.

2477
02:58:46,578 --> 02:58:47,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?

2478
02:58:47,658 --> 02:58:48,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much.

2479
02:58:49,399 --> 02:58:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a couple things I want to discuss, but Ranma, yet again, I have a bone to pick with you.

2480
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:54,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

2481
02:58:55,201 --> 02:58:55,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you.

2482
02:58:55,741 --> 02:58:56,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

2483
02:58:56,641 --> 02:58:57,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you.

2484
02:58:57,182 --> 02:58:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do now?

2485
02:58:58,662 --> 02:59:10,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I missed part of the show, so before I go charging at you with guns blazing, what is this comparison to hipsters and video games, something like that?

2486
02:59:11,235 --> 02:59:12,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you kind of explain that to me?

2487
02:59:13,357 --> 02:59:15,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't even know, what the hell was that about now?

2488
02:59:17,850 --> 02:59:19,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what happened two hours ago.

2489
02:59:19,431 --> 02:59:20,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting old for this.

2490
02:59:20,212 --> 02:59:34,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about comparing – because they were saying that, well, a console without a disk drive would sell well because the – was it the iPad or – not the iPad, one of the MacBook Airs or whatever.

2491
02:59:34,882 --> 02:59:38,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, and you said everybody that owned an iPad was a hipster.

2492
02:59:38,605 --> 02:59:40,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to go at Loki, not at me.

2493
02:59:40,626 --> 02:59:41,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I –

2494
02:59:43,136 --> 02:59:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh lord, passing the buck, huh?

2495
02:59:45,718 --> 02:59:46,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do best.

2496
02:59:46,939 --> 02:59:50,502
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm saying the people that buy MacBooks are hipsters.

2497
02:59:51,243 --> 02:59:53,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least MacBook Airs.

2498
02:59:53,665 --> 02:59:56,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've got the thinnest book ever.

2499
02:59:57,288 --> 02:59:58,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2500
02:59:58,809 --> 02:59:59,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a hipster, Ranma?

2501
03:00:00,871 --> 03:00:06,516
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I live 20 minutes away from Williamsburg, the East Coast central point for hipsters.

2502
03:00:06,796 --> 03:00:08,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is very true.

2503
03:00:08,738 --> 03:00:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2504
03:00:10,163 --> 03:00:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate hipsters.

2505
03:00:11,923 --> 03:00:12,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hate the hip.

2506
03:00:12,723 --> 03:00:12,983
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

2507
03:00:13,584 --> 03:00:14,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

2508
03:00:15,464 --> 03:00:16,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I love everybody.

2509
03:00:16,104 --> 03:00:16,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Rob.

2510
03:00:16,824 --> 03:00:17,044
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2511
03:00:17,304 --> 03:00:20,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, the Fairchild Channel F is underappreciated.

2512
03:00:20,445 --> 03:00:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got mine at Whole Foods.

2513
03:00:21,485 --> 03:00:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally the pinnacle.

2514
03:00:22,525 --> 03:00:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gluten-free.

2515
03:00:24,806 --> 03:00:25,786
[SPEAKER_10]: You go to Whole Foods?

2516
03:00:25,806 --> 03:00:26,766
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't go to Whole Foods.

2517
03:00:26,786 --> 03:00:29,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to farmer's markets way before there was a Whole Foods.

2518
03:00:29,886 --> 03:00:30,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me started.

2519
03:00:30,747 --> 03:00:32,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I only like partial foods.

2520
03:00:33,907 --> 03:00:34,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2521
03:00:34,227 --> 03:00:37,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just call in to start shit, or do you have something gaming-related to talk about?

2522
03:00:37,708 --> 03:00:38,608
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

2523
03:00:38,708 --> 03:00:39,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

2524
03:00:39,188 --> 03:00:39,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Double thing.

2525
03:00:39,868 --> 03:00:40,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

2526
03:01:01,713 --> 03:01:21,674
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'll name the characters Poop, Fart, Lol you know I used to rent Final Fantasy 3 like every time same game every time I went in one day to rent it someone came in like right before me bought the copy with my save on it oh ouch yeah

2527
03:01:24,456 --> 03:01:27,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in chat says, isn't Seattle hipster central?

2528
03:01:28,039 --> 03:01:31,822
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go to Netflix and watch a show called Portlandia.

2529
03:01:32,182 --> 03:01:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm going to say.

2530
03:01:34,084 --> 03:01:35,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally true.

2531
03:01:38,107 --> 03:01:38,708
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyhow.

2532
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:46,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last thing I called about was, I know that you're a big fan of Kid Icarus, right?

2533
03:01:46,554 --> 03:01:47,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like it.

2534
03:01:47,995 --> 03:01:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the anime trailer?

2535
03:01:51,229 --> 03:01:59,735
[SPEAKER_02]: You posted that to my Facebook and I forgot to look because I got distracted because somebody else had posted the new Garbage single and I was like, well, what do I like more?

2536
03:02:00,116 --> 03:02:01,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Kid Icarus or Garbage, the band?

2537
03:02:02,397 --> 03:02:03,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And Garbage won.

2538
03:02:03,958 --> 03:02:04,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me look at it now.

2539
03:02:05,019 --> 03:02:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you posted here the other day from your website?

2540
03:02:08,922 --> 03:02:09,803
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't post me.

2541
03:02:11,468 --> 03:02:13,489
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2543
03:03:09,844 --> 03:03:12,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2544
03:03:12,352 --> 03:03:13,276
[SPEAKER_02]: But any other quick thoughts?

2545
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay fabulous.

2546
03:03:15,785 --> 03:03:16,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I will.

2547
03:03:16,606 --> 03:03:17,206
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bye.

2548
03:03:17,927 --> 03:03:18,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2549
03:03:19,067 --> 03:03:20,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for calling in tonight.

2550
03:03:20,728 --> 03:03:23,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Our phones were lit up tonight, so some of you didn't get through.

2551
03:03:23,210 --> 03:03:29,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry, but send an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and DarkSakura will read your thoughts next week.

2552
03:03:29,515 --> 03:03:33,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have got to wrap up, and I've still got some tweets to go here before we wrap up.

2553
03:03:33,757 --> 03:03:35,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

2554
03:03:35,499 --> 03:03:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still several tweets.

2555
03:03:36,700 --> 03:03:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, I closed the tweet window to bring up that Kid Icarus story.

2556
03:03:44,486 --> 03:03:46,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

2557
03:03:46,608 --> 03:03:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go with the Disney stuff again.

2558
03:03:48,129 --> 03:03:48,429
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2559
03:03:49,590 --> 03:03:51,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a tweet from TechColor.

2560
03:03:52,273 --> 03:03:55,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweets us and says, do all of you really hate Minecraft?

2561
03:03:56,297 --> 03:03:58,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually quite fun for like 10 minutes.

2562
03:03:59,560 --> 03:03:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2563
03:04:01,491 --> 03:04:02,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate is a strong word.

2564
03:04:02,752 --> 03:04:12,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not hate Minecraft because saying I hate Minecraft means I think that people that play Minecraft are not smart and that's not the case at all.

2565
03:04:12,999 --> 03:04:15,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I get why people like Minecraft.

2566
03:04:15,821 --> 03:04:17,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really for me.

2567
03:04:17,322 --> 03:04:19,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot like the game.

2568
03:04:19,303 --> 03:04:25,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really, keep in mind, I don't ever really like to use hate because I think it's a very strong word and a wasteful emotion.

2569
03:04:26,024 --> 03:04:30,186
[SPEAKER_10]: But you cannot like a game and not give a crap about who plays it, you know.

2570
03:04:30,626 --> 03:04:32,146
[SPEAKER_10]: If other people like it, that's their thing.

2571
03:04:32,586 --> 03:04:34,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can completely loathe the game.

2572
03:04:35,767 --> 03:04:38,370
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it doesn't mean that you think anyone else that plays it is stupid.

2573
03:04:38,890 --> 03:04:43,095
[SPEAKER_10]: You can say like, I hate Minecraft players, then that's, you know.

2574
03:04:43,315 --> 03:04:45,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate is a word reserved for like doing my taxes.

2575
03:04:45,677 --> 03:04:46,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I was really boring.

2576
03:04:47,879 --> 03:04:48,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I was bored.

2577
03:04:48,820 --> 03:04:50,462
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love watching Minecraft videos.

2578
03:04:51,338 --> 03:04:52,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

2579
03:04:52,699 --> 03:04:54,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I like watching the people that are really into it online.

2580
03:04:55,099 --> 03:04:57,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan watches a lot of these and some of them are pretty funny.

2581
03:04:57,580 --> 03:05:05,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But my mind when it comes to that, I have this big open palette and just do something with it before the goblins tear you up.

2582
03:05:06,002 --> 03:05:08,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

2583
03:05:08,183 --> 03:05:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.

2584
03:05:11,004 --> 03:05:17,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I was kind of thinking about trying it again with the high definition textures.

2585
03:05:19,033 --> 03:05:21,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I did really try to do Terraria though.

2586
03:05:22,116 --> 03:05:22,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't get into it.

2587
03:05:23,016 --> 03:05:23,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried it too.

2588
03:05:24,137 --> 03:05:25,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You sent me that copy.

2589
03:05:25,118 --> 03:05:25,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

2590
03:05:25,679 --> 03:05:27,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I even got like a four pack and sent it to my friends.

2591
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:28,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried.

2592
03:05:28,121 --> 03:05:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us could get into it.

2593
03:05:29,302 --> 03:05:29,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried.

2594
03:05:30,943 --> 03:05:36,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too, like there just needed to be more structure to kind of like, I needed a little bit of handling.

2595
03:05:36,487 --> 03:05:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the type of person that wouldn't play Minecraft the way it was supposed to be.

2596
03:05:39,590 --> 03:05:42,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I would turn off the enemies and just build shit all day.

2597
03:05:43,373 --> 03:05:44,094
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I would do.

2598
03:05:44,554 --> 03:05:45,155
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.

2599
03:05:45,335 --> 03:05:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this comment from DKPopMan in the chat.

2600
03:05:47,617 --> 03:05:50,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think DarkSakura would like it from an artistic standpoint.

2601
03:05:51,601 --> 03:05:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really an artist, but you are a designer.

2602
03:05:53,603 --> 03:05:56,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but the thing is, I have The Sims.

2603
03:05:58,008 --> 03:06:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, so you kind of just have a different outlet for it.

2604
03:06:00,572 --> 03:06:02,252
[SPEAKER_10]: and I don't really play the Sims anymore either.

2605
03:06:03,172 --> 03:06:09,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, usually if I'm sitting down to do design, I've got InDesign open and I'm making something that I'm going to print.

2606
03:06:10,294 --> 03:06:11,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Or putting something in my portfolio.

2607
03:06:12,474 --> 03:06:18,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to poo-poo on Minecraft at all, it's just I really couldn't get into it.

2608
03:06:18,995 --> 03:06:26,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I might try it again, but to be honest I'm still trying to find a job right now and I don't have the time to devote to anything else that's distracting me.

2609
03:06:28,937 --> 03:06:48,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet you're still here at this show Yeah, I've been here for 10 years I can't quit now Alright, Tiger Claw says there's a couple news tweets here I want to read Hold on, because I have to do this for something else coming up Okay Going to Tiger Claw, a couple tweets here Minnesota lawmakers seek to ban community broadband What?

2610
03:06:49,255 --> 03:06:51,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The title alone, that seems a little silly here

2611
03:06:51,637 --> 03:07:06,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave you the story from GamePolitics.com Minnesota would do legislation meant to forbid community broadband projects joining states like Georgia and North Carolina HF2695 bars any community from building a broadband network within the state

2612
03:07:08,351 --> 03:07:20,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, the companies that provide broadband in the state are refusing to expand their networks to underserved and unserved areas within the state.

2613
03:07:20,977 --> 03:07:23,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I don't get to see these in advance because they're Twitter topics.

2614
03:07:23,918 --> 03:07:24,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in during the show.

2615
03:07:26,461 --> 03:07:41,521
[SPEAKER_02]: a trade group representing the industry in the state claims they are not behind the bill before lawmakers activists have their doubts why would this be why would you ban that I don't like I'm not seeing the other side of this what's the good and it sounds like other states have already done this why would you ban it

2616
03:07:44,833 --> 03:07:51,657
[SPEAKER_02]: A recent post on a community action group called Stop the Cap revealed that Georgia's bill has been effectively shelved by being turned into what is called a study bill.

2617
03:07:51,717 --> 03:07:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it didn't pass in Georgia.

2618
03:07:53,378 --> 03:07:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a citizen of one of the many towns not served by a broadband service provider, it would probably be in your best interest to ask your state representative not to vote for this bill.

2619
03:08:00,262 --> 03:08:01,403
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the pros about this?

2620
03:08:01,423 --> 03:08:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing anything.

2621
03:08:02,423 --> 03:08:04,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anyone think of what a pro would be about this bill?

2622
03:08:04,945 --> 03:08:06,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would this bill be necessary?

2623
03:08:06,225 --> 03:08:10,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that they don't want... I mean, I thought competition was okay.

2624
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:13,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatters, help me out, because I'm not thinking of it.

2625
03:08:13,691 --> 03:08:19,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's the cable providers or whatever, like, saying, hey, why are you giving away free broadband?

2626
03:08:19,434 --> 03:08:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes our expensive broadband look less wonderful.

2627
03:08:25,658 --> 03:08:26,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2628
03:08:26,078 --> 03:08:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really see... I don't even really see a point to this, but...

2629
03:08:31,195 --> 03:08:32,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I don't get it either.

2630
03:08:32,055 --> 03:08:36,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really waiting to see if somebody in chat can kind of jump in here.

2631
03:08:37,337 --> 03:08:37,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't steal.

2632
03:08:37,877 --> 03:08:39,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The government hates competition.

2633
03:08:40,278 --> 03:08:41,018
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2634
03:08:41,078 --> 03:08:41,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2635
03:08:41,478 --> 03:08:42,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Another tweet from Tigerclaw here.

2636
03:08:43,559 --> 03:08:47,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Fraud claim dismissed in ex-Infinity Ward heads versus Activision lawsuit.

2637
03:08:48,120 --> 03:08:48,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2638
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:59,669
[SPEAKER_02]: A state superior court judge dismissed one of the fraud claims by ex-Infinity Ward heads Jason West and Vince Zampella against their former employer, Activision Blizzard.

2639
03:08:59,970 --> 03:09:02,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They originally filed a lawsuit citing breach of contract.

2640
03:09:03,233 --> 03:09:12,340
[SPEAKER_02]: They added two counts of fraud to that, saying Activision never intended to honor their contract, but the judge dismissed one of the counts.

2641
03:09:13,141 --> 03:09:15,462
[SPEAKER_02]: agreeing with Activision that the claim should not go forward.

2642
03:09:15,502 --> 03:09:24,564
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is still another claim of promissory fraud, and that will be on a trial starting May 7th.

2643
03:09:25,244 --> 03:09:28,225
[SPEAKER_02]: So one count's been thrown out, but there's still plenty of other counts to go.

2644
03:09:29,965 --> 03:09:31,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chatters say, we're all as stumped as you.

2645
03:09:33,866 --> 03:09:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good thought.

2646
03:09:35,326 --> 03:09:41,888
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to a tweet from 101DKPopMan tweets us, tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1.

2647
03:09:44,284 --> 03:09:45,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to answer this.

2648
03:09:46,525 --> 03:09:47,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about the game.

2649
03:09:48,145 --> 03:09:48,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

2650
03:09:48,966 --> 03:09:52,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know an expert that we could go to to answer this question.

2651
03:09:52,867 --> 03:09:54,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get them back on the line here.

2652
03:09:56,488 --> 03:09:57,128
[SPEAKER_02]: If they answer.

2653
03:09:58,769 --> 03:09:59,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Shane?

2654
03:10:00,349 --> 03:10:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2655
03:10:00,789 --> 03:10:03,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I had to call you back because we have a tweet that I can't answer.

2656
03:10:04,110 --> 03:10:04,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your help.

2657
03:10:05,331 --> 03:10:05,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2658
03:10:05,471 --> 03:10:07,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because I know you can answer this.

2659
03:10:08,072 --> 03:10:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: 101DKPopMan sent us a tweet saying, tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1.

2660
03:10:13,581 --> 03:10:39,739
[SPEAKER_07]: because you if you want the full story which you really really do if you're interested in Mass Effect it is good to have one because I did say that you could just get the Genesis comic but no you need to play through one so you get the entire freaking story for this amazing trilogy jank inventory system and all yes because you only have to put up with it for one game

2661
03:10:41,783 --> 03:10:42,764
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is the game?

2662
03:10:42,904 --> 03:10:43,884
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is Mass Effect 1?

2663
03:10:45,346 --> 03:11:10,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that I've only done one playthrough of it and I didn't do hardly any side missions I think I did it in about 10 hours Oh wow, that's a lot shorter than I thought it would be I just ran through it Conversely, Mass Effect 2 I did everything I could minus two DLCs and I did that in about 25 and I'm already past 20 hours on Mass Effect 3 Wow

2664
03:11:11,519 --> 03:11:12,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, there you go.

2665
03:11:12,541 --> 03:11:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I wanted.

2666
03:11:14,165 --> 03:11:14,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2667
03:11:14,706 --> 03:11:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, bye.

2668
03:11:17,513 --> 03:11:18,315
[SPEAKER_02]: From the expert.

2669
03:11:18,796 --> 03:11:19,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more tweet.

2670
03:11:23,021 --> 03:11:26,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Beware, Dyson, this vacuum actually hungers and lives.

2671
03:11:27,303 --> 03:11:31,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, someone made a Sinistar Roomba vacuum cleaner.

2672
03:11:31,365 --> 03:11:35,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Sinistar, the game that would say, Beware, I live.

2673
03:11:36,088 --> 03:11:40,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks like somebody has made a Roomba out of that, and I'm linked to a YouTube here I've never seen before.

2674
03:11:41,150 --> 03:11:41,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Lord.

2675
03:11:45,773 --> 03:11:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has a sticker on it that looks like the Sinistar.

2676
03:11:51,596 --> 03:11:52,176
[SPEAKER_09]: That is great.

2677
03:11:52,196 --> 03:11:54,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that sounds like an airplane jet about ready to take off.

2678
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:59,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly does suck.

2679
03:12:00,361 --> 03:12:04,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I get it, because it's a vacuum.

2680
03:12:04,324 --> 03:12:07,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's a horrible noise to be playing on the podcast, so I apologize.

2681
03:12:07,466 --> 03:12:08,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you hear that?

2682
03:12:08,246 --> 03:12:09,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Beware, I live.

2683
03:12:09,387 --> 03:12:10,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Beware, I live.

2684
03:12:11,208 --> 03:12:12,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's it for tweets.

2685
03:12:12,249 --> 03:12:14,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send some in for next week.

2686
03:12:14,530 --> 03:12:17,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be funnier if you could do either the Space Corps or Wheatley.

2687
03:12:18,592 --> 03:12:20,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, last minute stories.

2688
03:12:20,433 --> 03:12:21,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, anything?

2689
03:12:22,651 --> 03:12:22,831
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

2690
03:12:24,092 --> 03:12:29,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to play the Portal Mario game thing, which the more I read about it, it looks even cooler.

2691
03:12:29,734 --> 03:12:30,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that last week.

2692
03:12:30,734 --> 03:12:30,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2693
03:12:31,054 --> 03:12:31,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So play it for next week.

2694
03:12:32,295 --> 03:12:33,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a full review.

2695
03:12:33,655 --> 03:12:38,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I found out the download that I had done wasn't correct, so I had to redownload it.

2696
03:12:38,917 --> 03:12:39,177
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2697
03:12:39,598 --> 03:12:39,878
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2698
03:12:40,839 --> 03:12:41,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2699
03:12:41,319 --> 03:12:42,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at three hours plus.

2700
03:12:42,620 --> 03:12:43,461
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to wrap up the show.

2701
03:12:43,481 --> 03:12:44,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of long shows lately.

2702
03:12:44,822 --> 03:12:45,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just very opinionated.

2703
03:12:46,724 --> 03:12:49,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go around to everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up tonight.

2704
03:12:50,206 --> 03:12:52,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts from me.

2705
03:12:52,088 --> 03:12:52,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start tonight.

2706
03:12:52,849 --> 03:12:55,891
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is just thank you, chatters.

2707
03:12:56,231 --> 03:12:58,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, podcasters who download our show and listen to us.

2708
03:12:58,874 --> 03:12:59,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I really mean it.

2709
03:12:59,554 --> 03:13:01,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know I always say it at the end of each show.

2710
03:13:01,596 --> 03:13:04,438
[SPEAKER_02]: But just kind of like thinking about the motivation question and all that stuff.

2711
03:13:04,498 --> 03:13:06,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you guys really are a big part of it.

2712
03:13:07,060 --> 03:13:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

2713
03:13:08,241 --> 03:13:24,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we were still doing a show back when literally there were three people in chat and we still had fun with it and I'd like to think that I would still have fun with it even if it was only one or two people but the fact that more and more people show up and the family is growing and all that is a huge motivator.

2714
03:13:24,329 --> 03:13:25,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.

2715
03:13:25,690 --> 03:13:26,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

2716
03:13:26,570 --> 03:13:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it.

2717
03:13:27,951 --> 03:13:28,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

2718
03:13:30,871 --> 03:13:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Making a Grand Theft Auto map editor in Excel is difficult.

2719
03:13:35,032 --> 03:13:48,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably not the preferred language, or it's not even really a programming language, but the preferred method to do such thing, but programming languages seem to make my head explode, so this is what I'm comfortable with.

2720
03:13:48,676 --> 03:13:51,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I even want to know what you're up to over there, to be honest.

2721
03:13:52,339 --> 03:13:56,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making an Excel file that will direct... You don't say!

2722
03:13:57,162 --> 03:13:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I don't say.

2723
03:13:58,744 --> 03:14:07,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That will directly translate the hex code from a map file from Grand Theft Auto into edible form and then back into hex code again.

2724
03:14:07,490 --> 03:14:15,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can directly import it because the program that someone made did a lot of rounding with numbers and it really fucks everything up.

2725
03:14:15,376 --> 03:14:17,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And their program's terribly broken.

2726
03:14:18,299 --> 03:14:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2727
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,782
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2728
03:14:24,889 --> 03:14:25,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

2729
03:14:27,453 --> 03:14:27,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2730
03:14:28,835 --> 03:14:30,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid daylight savings.

2731
03:14:31,099 --> 03:14:31,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want another coffee?

2732
03:14:33,263 --> 03:14:36,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be very... Alright, that's gonna do it guys.

2733
03:14:36,467 --> 03:14:39,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's the line I give you at the end of every show but it's for a reason.

2734
03:14:39,150 --> 03:14:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys as always for tuning in and listening to our show.

2735
03:14:42,034 --> 03:14:43,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2736
03:14:43,836 --> 03:14:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a free show.

2737
03:14:44,737 --> 03:14:45,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have commercials.

2738
03:14:46,018 --> 03:14:47,941
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not paid for those food plugs in the beginning.

2739
03:14:48,001 --> 03:14:48,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear, I swear.

2740
03:14:49,102 --> 03:14:49,922
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2741
03:15:14,414 --> 03:15:16,556
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, of course, Five Star Reviews and iTunes.

2742
03:15:17,416 --> 03:15:18,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Votes and Podcast Alley even.

2743
03:15:18,877 --> 03:15:19,958
[SPEAKER_02]: This was brought up last week.

2744
03:15:20,238 --> 03:15:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate each and every single way you guys spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.

2745
03:15:24,141 --> 03:15:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That, my friends, is a huge, huge motivator.

2746
03:15:27,523 --> 03:15:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm motivated to do it all again next week with my co-hosts DarkSakura and Loki for episode 450 of Orange Lounge Radio.

2747
03:15:36,509 --> 03:15:41,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have anything big planned yet, but if Loki and DarkSakura keep up the good work, maybe...

2748
03:15:42,893 --> 03:15:47,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do a full motion video actress where is she now clip.

2749
03:15:47,516 --> 03:15:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the actress, but the actor from Mega Race has actually done quite a few things.

2750
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,221
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hunt somebody down.

2751
03:15:54,241 --> 03:15:55,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hunt him down.

2752
03:15:55,061 --> 03:15:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

2753
03:15:56,062 --> 03:15:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want for episode 450.

2754
03:15:57,743 --> 03:15:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try and make it happen.

2755
03:15:58,764 --> 03:15:59,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do our best.

2756
03:15:59,364 --> 03:16:00,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

2757
03:16:00,245 --> 03:16:00,765
[SPEAKER_02]: 451, if nothing else.

2758
03:16:01,186 --> 03:16:01,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

2759
03:16:01,926 --> 03:16:03,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard Dana Plano went underground.

2760
03:16:03,687 --> 03:16:04,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

2761
03:16:07,464 --> 03:16:09,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so hipster you only listen to underground bands?

2762
03:16:10,385 --> 03:16:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2763
03:16:10,825 --> 03:16:12,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, was she cast in Six Feet Under?

2764
03:16:12,345 --> 03:16:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are bad.

2765
03:16:14,086 --> 03:16:14,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad kids.

2766
03:16:15,406 --> 03:16:15,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2767
03:16:16,426 --> 03:16:17,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice to each other.

2768
03:16:17,967 --> 03:16:19,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she a working stiff now?

2769
03:16:21,648 --> 03:16:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ending the show.

2770
03:16:23,048 --> 03:16:25,809
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
