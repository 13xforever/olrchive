00:13.951 --> 00:18.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, March 4th, 2012, could Valve be entering the home console market?

00:18.715 --> 00:25.480
[SPEAKER_09]: Some Sony titles are scheduled to be taken offline, and one 80s video game cartoon character is set for an all-new series.

00:31.502 --> 00:35.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.704
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.764 --> 00:44.126
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live with episode number 448 of our program on this March the 4th of 2012.

00:44.626 --> 00:45.246
[SPEAKER_06]: March 4th.

00:45.326 --> 00:50.208
[SPEAKER_06]: March 4th and join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us.

00:50.428 --> 00:50.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap.

00:51.148 --> 00:51.348
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

00:51.428 --> 00:51.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap what?

00:52.189 --> 00:53.449
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's my dad's birthday.

00:53.956 --> 00:55.538
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:14.576 --> 01:15.837
[SPEAKER_06]: and she was the raffle fairy.

01:15.897 --> 01:17.778
[SPEAKER_06]: If you saw the Umlaut thing, she was the raffle fairy.

01:18.258 --> 01:20.659
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, she sent me this shirt and it's great.

01:20.819 --> 01:21.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

01:21.180 --> 01:26.262
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Professor Plum and Colonel... Okay, you'll take a picture and upload it on orangeloungeradio.com.

01:26.282 --> 01:27.143
[SPEAKER_14]: I have seen that Woot shirt.

01:27.423 --> 01:29.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it was a Woot shirt.

01:29.424 --> 01:30.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Techmaster Loki.

01:31.305 --> 01:32.425
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with everybody tonight?

01:32.465 --> 01:34.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody wants to just jump right in before I introduce them.

01:35.347 --> 01:35.887
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

01:36.988 --> 01:52.024
[SPEAKER_14]: professional radio at its best I'm just a woot shirt expert because I check that site all the time and I'm very I have to cut down on the amount of t-shirts I buy because you know I have a lot of t-shirts already but damn there's so many good video game shirts there oh yeah

01:52.644 --> 01:56.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do they let fans vote on shirts there, or is that only Threadless that does that?

01:56.965 --> 02:01.046
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, yeah, they have a thing that they call, well, they have the derby.

02:01.587 --> 02:06.808
[SPEAKER_14]: It's usually a theme, and then they'll create a shirt that wins that theme, and then they'll be for sale.

02:06.908 --> 02:20.292
[SPEAKER_14]: And they also have a thing called the Reckoning, which they have 20 shirts, and people who buy them, whatever shirts are more popular, stay on the list, and the ones that are not popular fall off the list, and they get replaced next week.

02:20.452 --> 02:20.752
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.

02:21.913 --> 02:22.213
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:22.933 --> 02:28.098
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would like the Woot shirts better, though, if I could get, like, better girly style shirts.

02:28.398 --> 02:32.021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they don't have, like, girl sizes or anything like that.

02:32.101 --> 02:37.325
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the Woot shirts end up just being ridiculous for me because I hate the way that regular t-shirts fit.

02:37.706 --> 02:44.831
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for my ginormous rack, right, if I'm gonna get a shirt that's gonna fit me everywhere else, it's gonna be too tight on the girls.

02:45.092 --> 02:45.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

02:45.752 --> 02:51.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, I look like, you know, it's the 80s and you wear your shirt all slouched out with the little clip on the side.

02:51.995 --> 02:53.336
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no.

02:53.376 --> 02:54.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's time to bring back that style.

02:54.797 --> 02:56.437
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes old-fashioned makes comebacks.

02:56.738 --> 02:56.878
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:57.938 --> 02:58.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

02:58.859 --> 03:00.920
[SPEAKER_11]: How about that rat tail and members only jacket, huh?

03:01.960 --> 03:08.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I actually wore a members-only jacket to a Rocky Horror Show, like, that was probably last year at some point, because, you know, that kind of stuff's funny.

03:08.505 --> 03:11.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, no one's going to get that because they weren't in on that conversation.

03:11.427 --> 03:11.868
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, look.

03:12.408 --> 03:14.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Join our chatroom, chat.orangeloundtreater.com.

03:14.710 --> 03:15.470
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a live show.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.712
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been for going on almost 10 years now.

03:17.732 --> 03:24.457
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of which, Tigerclaw in our chatroom starts us off tonight saying, Episode 448, you guys just have two more shows until you reach 450.

03:25.658 --> 03:26.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Any plans for the big 450 show?

03:28.260 --> 03:28.981
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do.

03:29.622 --> 03:30.683
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not really a milestone.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.224
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, yeah, I don't see 450s a milestone.

03:32.264 --> 03:33.626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like diet milestone.

03:33.706 --> 03:37.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when we have the 10 year coming up in three months.

03:38.410 --> 03:38.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

03:38.731 --> 03:39.572
[SPEAKER_06]: A little over three months.

03:39.612 --> 03:43.876
[SPEAKER_06]: We still, we haven't, guys, legit, we have no idea what we're doing for the 10 year anniversary right now.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.718
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to address something right now to Reginator.

03:46.418 --> 03:46.839
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what's up?

03:47.851 --> 03:50.772
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing is going to get me to eat ham, bacon, and shellfish.

03:52.492 --> 03:55.673
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have something called principles, and it's not a whim.

03:55.953 --> 03:58.314
[SPEAKER_06]: You did have that bacon milkshake, but there was no real bacon in it.

03:58.434 --> 03:59.635
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and I tasted it.

03:59.655 --> 04:01.295
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no real good in that either.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.976
[SPEAKER_14]: They just took a vanilla milkshake and said, hey, we're going to ruin this.

04:05.396 --> 04:16.800
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a difference between getting a vegetarian to eat a piece of beef on a whim, a dare, rather than having someone break a religious tradition.

04:17.580 --> 04:19.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to piss off one of the hosts, join our chatroom.

04:19.681 --> 04:23.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Say something offensive.

04:23.501 --> 04:24.742
[SPEAKER_14]: Talking about woot shirts here.

04:25.462 --> 04:28.803
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got, like, already on their reckoning right now.

04:28.863 --> 04:30.103
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the shirts that they have.

04:30.123 --> 04:35.084
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 8, 1985, The Year of the Plumber, which has a bunch of Mario-themed stuff on there.

04:35.964 --> 04:42.806
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got number 11, which is Hey, Listen, which depicts Link falling asleep in class.

04:43.606 --> 04:44.987
[SPEAKER_14]: and, uh, let's see here.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.648
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a number 14.

04:46.808 --> 04:50.370
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of this is going around, uh, which is the arrow through the knee stuff.

04:51.150 --> 05:03.517
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and it goes in the dark and, um, not really gaming related, but they have the, uh, it guys, uh, coat of arms, which, you know, refresh, reinstall, reboot.

05:04.998 --> 05:05.278
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

05:05.298 --> 05:06.999
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just some awesome stuff on there.

05:09.548 --> 05:28.663
[SPEAKER_06]: I do you know now I'm starting to sound like a commercial but I will say this I have found some good stuff on just the Woot general site like that's where I got my Tron gaming mouse that I have for like 35 bucks and I think normally it's about 80 dollars and I do check Woot every day for the matching keyboard because I'm like if if the mouse went on clearance then the keyboard's got to go on clearance at some point I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting I want that Tron keyboard

05:28.903 --> 05:31.765
[SPEAKER_14]: I got some jump drives out there once, but I lost them all again.

05:32.005 --> 05:35.527
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought like four of them, too, and I lost every single one of them.

05:36.047 --> 05:36.628
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them.

05:36.668 --> 05:38.629
[SPEAKER_14]: They just like, poof, disappeared.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.831
[SPEAKER_14]: I had one disintegrate on me, but the other three were lost.

05:42.506 --> 05:45.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, instead of talking about video game t-shirts, let's get to video games.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to kick off tonight talking a little bit about GDC.

05:49.654 --> 05:56.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Developers Conference, of course, is a huge industry event that's happening just across the bridge over in San Francisco, not far from us.

05:57.183 --> 05:58.645
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kicks off this week.

05:58.865 --> 05:59.606
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Tuesday?

06:00.027 --> 06:00.547
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Wednesday?

06:00.587 --> 06:02.530
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people are starting to show up in town already for it.

06:04.190 --> 06:32.100
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little bit unknowing to the specifics of GDC because I don't go it's not a media event they don't want media people there it's really for game developers a great way to do some networking I know people in the industry that go to like look for new people and you know hiring event especially with some of the bad news we've had lately in the industry like for example one story that didn't make our show roll tonight but it's been a big pretty big deal in the industry this week Blizzard laid off 600 people this week unfortunately so you know with with

06:33.220 --> 06:40.063
[SPEAKER_06]: The change and, you know, how these... The subscriber loss and WoW and the fact that Diablo 3 is pretty much in the can and what have you.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.524
[SPEAKER_06]: They unfortunately laid off 600 people.

06:41.944 --> 06:47.186
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good news, or I mean, whatever possible good news you can make of that... The upside?

06:47.666 --> 06:48.367
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the upside.

06:48.387 --> 06:48.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put it that way.

06:48.967 --> 06:56.210
[SPEAKER_06]: The upside is that, hey, GDC is this week, so maybe some of those folks can take their resumes up to GDC and do some networking and you never know what you might find.

06:56.250 --> 07:00.872
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be, you know, some good to come out of all that.

07:01.392 --> 07:01.492
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

07:01.832 --> 07:03.433
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great networking event.

07:04.293 --> 07:09.834
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the past couple years, it does seem like big things have come out of it.

07:10.035 --> 07:12.235
[SPEAKER_06]: And there have been some big media things.

07:12.275 --> 07:20.658
[SPEAKER_06]: And I even remember one year in particular, I think it was about two years ago, one of those networks, Spiker G4, actually covered a Sony press conference to talk all about the move.

07:21.218 --> 07:24.119
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had released quite a bit of details about the move at GDC.

07:24.799 --> 07:34.427
[SPEAKER_06]: And now this year, kind of leading into GDC, we're starting to hear little rumblings about, you know, SimCity 5 information is apparently leaked to the web and, you know, that is supposed to be happening.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.289
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the Valve thing we'll talk about in a minute, I'm sure is on everybody's mind.

07:37.710 --> 07:42.374
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you think there's going to be any whopper of news at GDC this year?

07:43.895 --> 07:46.557
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as announcements go, I don't think so.

07:48.499 --> 07:48.799
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

07:50.296 --> 07:52.877
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe... I don't know if Nintendo's going to be showing any Wii U stuff.

07:52.897 --> 07:54.137
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think Nintendo's there.

07:55.598 --> 07:56.958
[SPEAKER_14]: But it would be cool if they were.

07:57.098 --> 07:59.019
[SPEAKER_06]: They've shown little tidbits in the past.

07:59.039 --> 08:01.760
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to say, wasn't the Mario 3D game first revealed?

08:01.780 --> 08:05.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the logo was first at GDC, and it showed the raccoon tail.

08:05.161 --> 08:06.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that came out of last year's GDC.

08:06.561 --> 08:07.842
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that was Tokyo Game Show.

08:08.082 --> 08:11.203
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the whole... Something about... Or E3.

08:11.963 --> 08:16.349
[SPEAKER_06]: A Pikmin game is what turned into Mario Sunshine or something.

08:17.610 --> 08:23.777
[SPEAKER_06]: My memory is a little fuzzy on that, but I seem to remember something about the Pikmin series ended up becoming something else.

08:23.818 --> 08:25.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in chat will remember.

08:26.761 --> 08:28.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has dropped little tidbits like that.

08:28.503 --> 08:31.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Miyamoto did a keynote one year, I seem to recall.

08:33.591 --> 08:35.992
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I hope there's some cool stuff that we'll see out of that.

08:36.572 --> 08:39.313
[SPEAKER_14]: There's just a lot of different events going on around the same time.

08:40.893 --> 08:46.595
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I mean, I don't think we're going to see a lot from Sony, especially on the Vita because they have their own kind of event for that.

08:47.635 --> 09:01.199
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to probably, I would hope, I would hope we'd see something on the Wii U because, I mean, yeah, they're going to show some stuff at E3, but like for developers, they kind of have to say, hey, here's what we have because you're going to have to make some games for this.

09:02.506 --> 09:03.207
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

09:23.184 --> 09:27.248
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't see any sense in bringing out this big to-do.

09:27.509 --> 09:31.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the system specs when that's what E3 is going to be about.

09:31.472 --> 09:33.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's got to bring it to this year's E3.

09:34.175 --> 09:41.542
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be just a full-on, this is the Wii U, this is the final prototype, these are the games that are coming out this holiday.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.265
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what you have to see from Nintendo at this year's E3.

09:44.545 --> 09:45.005
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.

09:46.106 --> 09:46.247
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

09:47.358 --> 09:56.987
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting to me, though, is that it would have been a good opportunity for them to do this whole last story reveal and all that stuff that kind of came out last week, but they did their own thing, so whatever.

09:58.889 --> 10:08.278
[SPEAKER_06]: One other question I want to ask about Game Developers Conference, you know, what it really is more about is getting to sit in and hear from seasoned game designers about, you know, how they think about game design and so on.

10:08.838 --> 10:16.202
[SPEAKER_14]: I know something that you might see, like you would see from Nintendo would be talking about their new Nintendo network or whatever that they're going to have, the infrastructure for that.

10:16.222 --> 10:16.983
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great thought.

10:17.163 --> 10:21.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's more stuff that's going to be catered towards, okay, here's what we can do for you for development.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.586
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to allow you to patch your games.

10:24.186 --> 10:28.389
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this new technology that's first available now on Nintendo.

10:29.089 --> 10:29.429
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

10:29.489 --> 10:35.713
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo is going to be doing something with independent development, perhaps, like think something like Xbox Indie Games.

10:35.853 --> 10:36.113
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

10:36.993 --> 10:37.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

10:38.634 --> 10:46.481
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we got one bit of bad news about indie games on the 3DS tonight, but VVVVV, Cave Story, you know, there are some pretty good titles on the 3DS.

10:46.501 --> 10:50.725
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, but I think that they'd be worried that someone's going to trump them at their own game.

10:50.745 --> 10:55.049
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be honest, yeah, there's a lot of indie developers that could make another Mario game or another...

10:55.849 --> 10:57.771
[SPEAKER_14]: and Zelda or something of that caliber.

10:58.432 --> 11:01.775
[SPEAKER_14]: And they wouldn't want it taking away the thunder of some of their own stuff.

11:01.855 --> 11:04.278
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll just piggybacking on your thought because I think it's a good thought.

11:04.438 --> 11:09.342
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo is going to do anything for the indie developers, I think it's going to come out at GDC.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's no better time to announce something like that.

11:11.665 --> 11:12.646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great thought.

11:13.567 --> 11:18.792
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see Microsoft do something with the indie games.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.315
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of games on there.

11:22.355 --> 11:23.616
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be nice to promote stuff.

11:23.636 --> 11:27.260
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's going to be an overhaul at all, this would be the great time to do it.

11:27.340 --> 11:31.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Changes in Sony Home, although they just really did a bunch of that, so I don't think that could be it.

11:32.605 --> 11:37.490
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation Home was all revealed at GDC some time ago, about three or four years ago.

11:38.891 --> 12:06.669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what else Sony you know maybe something we haven't thought of yet maybe something with the Vita maybe developing or who knows let me ask this question though I was about to ask this and you jumped in GDC is really about kind of hearing from the seasoned developers and you know what they their methods of game design and so forth if you could go to GDC and listen to one developer talk who would you want to hear lecture at GDC anybody DarkSakura Loki who would you want to go to GDC and see

12:08.945 --> 12:09.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Kojima.

12:09.886 --> 12:10.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Kojima?

12:10.466 --> 12:10.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?

12:10.886 --> 12:12.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because he's a badass?

12:12.487 --> 12:13.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty badass.

12:14.949 --> 12:20.332
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I'd like to get some of the classic developers there to lecture the new school on how the old school did it.

12:20.712 --> 12:24.355
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Yuji Naka or Yu Suzuki, you know.

12:25.848 --> 12:33.353
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the guys who pretty much revolutionized video games.

12:33.393 --> 12:35.194
[SPEAKER_11]: Without them, we wouldn't have any of this today.

12:35.775 --> 12:43.400
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I would want to see the old guard pass on the baton to the new guard with some good advice.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.582
[SPEAKER_11]: And not necessarily in terms of announcing anything new.

12:48.103 --> 12:52.886
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see them say, you need to remember all of this in mind and stop putting out crap.

12:53.766 --> 12:54.467
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much it.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.168
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just like to see anybody talk about Grand Theft Auto 5.

12:57.448 --> 13:00.071
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care who it is.

13:00.131 --> 13:02.835
[SPEAKER_14]: Just somebody show me some stuff and talk about it.

13:03.155 --> 13:06.299
[SPEAKER_14]: They could be like, and here's what we have footage-wise.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.003
[SPEAKER_14]: Go.

13:09.243 --> 13:11.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackwolf in our chatroom says Tim Schafer.

13:11.266 --> 13:12.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with all that's going on with the...

13:14.049 --> 13:30.116
[SPEAKER_14]: Kickstarter and all that I'd love to hear well I guess I guess the people that paid for that are gonna hear about that first we don't hear about it at GDC you know who I wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe you wouldn't like to hear would not like to hear from yeah let me talk about how important Twisted Metal is I don't care

13:31.156 --> 13:35.501
[SPEAKER_06]: I, my dream would be Sid Meier, you know, because I have made it no secret on the show.

13:35.701 --> 13:38.744
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a big fan of all things civilization, but it's not even just that.

13:38.804 --> 13:45.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think I would like to go to a Sid Meier panel where he talks about covert action really wasn't that bad of a game.

13:46.872 --> 13:47.712
[SPEAKER_06]: because it wasn't.

13:47.892 --> 13:50.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Sid Meier thinks covert action, they tried to do too much.

13:51.574 --> 13:52.754
[SPEAKER_06]: Old school PC game.

13:53.374 --> 13:53.874
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

13:54.014 --> 13:56.755
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to get into the specifics, but that would be the panel I'd want to see.

13:56.835 --> 13:57.435
[SPEAKER_14]: Covert action.

13:57.695 --> 13:58.556
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't that bad.

13:58.776 --> 14:03.177
[SPEAKER_14]: You did hear, though, that he's got some sort of input on the new XCOM game.

14:03.817 --> 14:05.818
[SPEAKER_14]: I did hear about that.

14:06.298 --> 14:08.519
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, we've got this problem.

14:08.559 --> 14:09.419
[SPEAKER_14]: We need your help.

14:09.839 --> 14:11.820
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Actdeft brings up Mizuguchi.

14:14.481 --> 14:15.701
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great one.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.541
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a whore for all things Q Entertainment.

14:17.721 --> 14:19.762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm unapologetically on the show.

14:20.102 --> 14:23.643
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, my one true love, Igarashi.

14:23.903 --> 14:24.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it.

14:24.423 --> 14:25.243
[SPEAKER_11]: I was surprised you didn't say that.

14:25.403 --> 14:31.224
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be cool if we saw Harmonix there talking about something because they're cooking something up right now and I don't really know what.

14:31.244 --> 14:31.264
[SPEAKER_14]: E3.

14:31.284 --> 14:31.704
[SPEAKER_06]: I think E3.

14:34.245 --> 14:58.571
[SPEAKER_06]: you know GDC is not a media thing it's not really the time to announce your new games your new plat not even platforms your new like integrated services your new services yes your new games not so much so all righty uh BlackWolf in our chat room says I've seen a Sid Meier talk you know rub it in BlackWolf Bobby BlackWolf of course before us live at all games radio five o'clock pacific because when he does his show we're on at six sunday nights

14:59.231 --> 15:02.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Wolf says, Will Wright's talks are really, really, really spastic and all over the place.

15:03.233 --> 15:07.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Will Wright has like 500 PowerPoint slides for a one hour talk and I'm not exaggerating.

15:07.495 --> 15:08.315
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I will say this.

15:08.495 --> 15:11.476
[SPEAKER_06]: I was fortunate enough one year to see, remember when Spore?

15:11.776 --> 15:12.357
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that.

15:12.557 --> 15:14.858
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to go see Will Wright demoing it.

15:15.058 --> 15:16.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that Will Wright demoing it?

15:16.738 --> 15:17.979
[SPEAKER_14]: I completely forgot that.

15:18.059 --> 15:18.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

15:18.979 --> 15:21.360
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't see the one where it was Robin Williams demoing it.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.301
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have rather seen the Robin Williams one.

15:23.481 --> 15:25.582
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved seeing Will Wright demo it.

15:25.642 --> 15:26.162
[SPEAKER_06]: It was his game.

15:29.004 --> 15:30.105
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened to that game?

15:30.145 --> 15:31.287
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

15:31.467 --> 15:35.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny enough, I think it's a lot of what I said about covert action a minute ago.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.156
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think Spore was not that bad, but it just tried to do too much.

15:40.237 --> 15:42.580
[SPEAKER_06]: It tried to be 17 different games in one.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.262
[SPEAKER_06]: It just didn't work out so well.

15:44.942 --> 16:04.820
[SPEAKER_06]: but I loved watching them talk about it you know developers have such a passion for their games you know it's they can even like crappy games like I would watch the guys who made Fusion Frenzy on Xbox 360 or no Fusion Frenzy 2 excuse me the really bad one on 360 I'd watch them talk about their game because they'd be at least enthusiastic about it Barbie Horse Adventures heck yeah

16:05.140 --> 16:05.620
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

16:05.640 --> 16:06.220
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

16:06.620 --> 16:08.981
[SPEAKER_11]: This was at a Classic Gaming Expo a few years back.

16:09.081 --> 16:11.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the one that we were all at.

16:11.882 --> 16:18.904
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to see a bunch of the Atari guys talking about developing for the... It was all vector-based and everything.

16:18.964 --> 16:19.344
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, good times.

16:19.504 --> 16:28.107
[SPEAKER_11]: And just listening to those guys reminisce and tease each other and talk about the little bits of code they were able to sneak in and having hardly any room to sneak it in with and...

16:28.747 --> 16:29.967
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really cool.

16:30.147 --> 16:32.608
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like hearing about all the behind-the-scenes stuff.

16:32.628 --> 16:34.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys were fucking rock stars.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you have to remember, some of those early games were one dude.

16:37.829 --> 16:40.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yars' Revenge was Howard Scott Warshaw.

16:40.810 --> 16:41.850
[SPEAKER_06]: He also did E.T.

16:42.090 --> 16:43.130
[SPEAKER_06]: We forgive him.

16:43.751 --> 16:47.171
[SPEAKER_06]: David Crane did some of the early... I think he did Slot Machine on Atari.

16:48.072 --> 16:49.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you will about it, but it was an early game.

16:49.832 --> 16:52.273
[SPEAKER_11]: But meeting the guys that did Robotron and...

16:54.353 --> 17:18.130
[SPEAKER_11]: and also um and he's a he's a man I've actually had a long conversation with a few times is uh he did a lot of the Williams pinball tables it was um Steve Ritchie really nice guy he did a lot of the voices for No Fear and Black Knight and um listening to him talk about developing just the pinball tables about the physics that go into it and everything I like hearing about that enthusiasm and

17:18.850 --> 17:24.714
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe no one else is as into it as they are, but their enthusiasm is contagious.

17:25.095 --> 17:28.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody is if they have these pinball expos across the country.

17:29.298 --> 17:29.678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying.

17:29.778 --> 17:30.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

17:30.879 --> 17:33.741
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you're not as interested in it as they are, they're still contagious.

17:34.461 --> 17:35.702
[SPEAKER_11]: Their enthusiasm is contagious.

17:35.862 --> 17:36.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

17:36.623 --> 17:36.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

17:37.023 --> 17:48.631
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, speaking of that, I actually watched, it was a translated video of the guys doing the urinal games at Sega, and talking about them and how enthusiastic about their project was.

17:49.352 --> 17:50.553
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to go pee!

17:50.593 --> 17:52.194
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously, it's funny.

17:52.254 --> 17:57.958
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a good sense of humor about it, because they're like, yeah, we know this is weird, but hey, we're developing it.

17:58.258 --> 18:04.262
[SPEAKER_14]: So, with that in mind, I'd actually want to see the people, I'd want to hear from the guys that are developing these arcade games.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.664
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, the really weird arcade games in Japan, like the ones where you eat the

18:06.784 --> 18:11.088
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see what the motivation for that is.

18:11.128 --> 18:12.489
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just amazing.

18:12.850 --> 18:15.232
[SPEAKER_14]: Tetris with a giant fucking controller.

18:15.932 --> 18:16.813
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just awesome.

18:18.194 --> 18:19.075
[SPEAKER_06]: It does sound awesome.

18:19.495 --> 18:20.817
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that table flipping game.

18:20.857 --> 18:22.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, why won't the arcades here get that?

18:23.859 --> 18:26.281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a one joke pony, but damn it's a good joke.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a joke that won't get old.

18:28.463 --> 18:28.483
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

18:29.309 --> 18:48.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, if only you had the resources Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks We've talked a lot about GDC, which is great I want to talk about the video games we've been playing this week You know, just talking to the crew a little bit before the show It sounds like we've had a bit of a classic, a little bit of a retro week But let's go around and see what folks have been playing, DarkSakura I've been playing the shit out of Sonic CD What'd I tell ya?

18:49.517 --> 18:50.097
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck yeah!

18:50.478 --> 18:56.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, I didn't really play the shit out of it I played like four full levels of Sonic CD What brought on the Sonic CD urge?

18:56.930 --> 18:58.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Last night I was looking at Steam.

18:58.031 --> 18:59.631
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, holy shit, it's on Steam.

18:59.711 --> 19:00.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.092
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Dan yelled at me today.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.493
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, why are you buying games we already have?

19:04.693 --> 19:05.793
[SPEAKER_14]: That happens a lot on Steam.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.034
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, like he should talk.

19:07.094 --> 19:09.235
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

19:09.335 --> 19:09.635
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

19:10.015 --> 19:12.936
[SPEAKER_14]: Buying games that you guys already have.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.517
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually trying to think about that.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.417
[SPEAKER_14]: How many versions of Strider do you own?

19:18.078 --> 19:19.459
[SPEAKER_06]: At Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

19:19.519 --> 19:25.601
[SPEAKER_11]: Technically, the only reason that we have another version of the first Strider is because it came with Strider 2.

19:27.674 --> 19:29.034
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that right there.

19:29.974 --> 19:32.815
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have Strider on Genesis, and we have The Nest Strider, which is a different game.

19:33.535 --> 19:35.295
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if I'm blending shows together.

19:35.336 --> 19:38.196
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have brought this up last week, but I loved what you posted on Facebook.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.997
[SPEAKER_06]: You posted on Dan's wall, and it was Strider NES.

19:41.177 --> 19:42.137
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that bad.

19:42.777 --> 19:43.757
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we brought it up last week.

19:43.777 --> 19:44.697
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a Capcom blog.

19:45.277 --> 19:46.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Shows blur together.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.078
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, and I'm like, agree.

19:48.378 --> 19:50.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan says it's a decent game.

19:50.178 --> 19:52.559
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've read some of the Strider Hiryu manga.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.700
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:15.646 --> 20:18.667
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have had the moon music play in some of the levels just for fun.

20:19.147 --> 20:19.748
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been great.

20:19.828 --> 20:21.508
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

20:21.709 --> 20:34.154
[SPEAKER_11]: At any rate, I told them flat out I wanted the Japanese soundtrack because someone did a version of Sonic CD basically using all Sprite rips and everything and the Japanese soundtrack.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.215
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like a brand new Sonic CD.

20:39.076 --> 20:41.217
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to find it and put it on our Tumblr.

20:41.597 --> 20:44.078
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can download the whole thing, burn it, and it'll play on a Sega CD.

20:45.379 --> 20:46.579
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, that was Dance Point.

20:46.599 --> 20:47.800
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got it on the Sega CD.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.041
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we need to have this other one?

20:49.061 --> 20:50.322
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if it's got better music.

20:51.503 --> 20:52.804
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it does have better music.

20:53.265 --> 20:57.728
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the intro and outro, it's no lyrics.

20:58.269 --> 20:59.029
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just instrumental.

20:59.530 --> 21:00.510
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, boo.

21:01.471 --> 21:07.376
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I also played, I actually was going to play some Bastion and then I was like, no.

21:09.397 --> 21:10.278
[SPEAKER_11]: I did find Blue Dragon.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.740
[SPEAKER_02]: The girl changed her mind.

21:13.341 --> 21:15.422
[SPEAKER_02]: The girl, I'll tab to a different game instead.

21:16.382 --> 21:20.483
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did play a lot of WoW, but I sort of like... Addict.

21:21.483 --> 21:23.464
[SPEAKER_11]: Dealer, who's been on every time I've been on?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.545
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I was homesick one day this week, alright?

21:26.965 --> 21:30.186
[SPEAKER_11]: And last night, and... We should run a dungeon!

21:30.726 --> 21:31.286
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we should.

21:31.366 --> 21:32.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did.

21:32.027 --> 21:32.927
[SPEAKER_11]: We did, it was fun.

21:33.307 --> 21:35.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, even though I hate Old Man.

21:35.528 --> 21:35.728
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway...

21:38.590 --> 21:44.094
[SPEAKER_11]: I had been hitting this kind of rut where I would log on to an alt, check my box, and then I'm like, okay, I'm done.

21:45.415 --> 21:45.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.756
[SPEAKER_11]: My auction, my mailbox.

21:48.797 --> 21:51.259
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I would log on to another one and go, I'm done.

21:51.639 --> 21:53.320
[SPEAKER_11]: And then log on to another one and go, I'm done.

21:53.781 --> 21:55.822
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just sit on my main chatting with people.

21:56.242 --> 21:57.964
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't even playing, I'd just be talking to people.

21:58.604 --> 22:24.174
[SPEAKER_11]: and finally I got on the Drenden gyaru who is going to be dressed like a hobag once she's 85 because she's gal and decided I actually really like Shadow Priest now so I just been I kind of got my love for the game back instead of just you know chatting with people and also a really good friend of mine I found out is on there and so I've been chatting with her

22:24.594 --> 22:46.220
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes it does just take a change of scenery or a change of character and this is you know true of any MMO you know I know our frame of reference as well but any MMO like you know things unfortunately were starting to get a little stale on the alliance side where I was playing because no one was ever on but you and maybe John and then we weren't raiding anymore so it's like I'll go try this mage over here and raid you know and it's it's kind of reinvigorated like oh now I have something to do in the game

22:46.758 --> 22:51.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we actually have been invited for raiding with another guild now.

22:52.021 --> 22:52.961
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an open invitation.

22:53.141 --> 22:53.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nice.

22:53.661 --> 22:55.762
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we actually want to do alliance raids, we've got people.

22:55.922 --> 22:56.863
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you more offline.

22:57.043 --> 22:57.863
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

22:58.284 --> 23:08.008
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm actually going to be on Tuesday night, or actually Tuesday during the day before my yoga class, I'm logging on to Star Trek Online to find my Scotsman.

23:08.849 --> 23:13.331
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to be having one day a week at Star Trek Online because they miss me.

23:13.491 --> 23:15.252
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a year and a half and they miss me.

23:15.712 --> 23:17.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody yell out, you know?

23:17.754 --> 23:19.375
[SPEAKER_04]: She can't handle anymore, Captain!

23:19.635 --> 23:20.796
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have the power!

23:20.977 --> 23:25.580
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny, they're mostly architects.

23:25.701 --> 23:33.407
[SPEAKER_11]: When the football place, the dome, collapsed, they were all in TeamSpeak talking about it.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I bet it was cheaply made.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.011
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet, you know, they should fire their architect.

23:38.091 --> 23:42.034
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, they probably just did it that way because it's America and we build everything cheap.

23:42.354 --> 23:42.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

23:43.852 --> 23:44.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

24:00.127 --> 24:02.248
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been pretty excited about that.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.030
[SPEAKER_11]: They made a lot of changes to DS9.

24:05.871 --> 24:11.454
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned it before, but you can go in the captain's office and there's a lot of cool stuff in there.

24:13.215 --> 24:14.796
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Luminous over here last week.

24:15.136 --> 24:16.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I mentioned that.

24:20.179 --> 24:20.779
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.061
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had a little bit more diverse of a gaming week.

24:24.741 --> 24:25.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

24:25.342 --> 24:26.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how about you?

24:26.302 --> 24:26.943
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

24:28.083 --> 24:29.104
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play hardly anything.

24:30.865 --> 24:34.926
[SPEAKER_14]: Luminous, I played that actually for at least a couple hours this week.

24:35.567 --> 24:36.247
[SPEAKER_14]: Same game too.

24:36.347 --> 24:38.028
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, one game was an hour.

24:39.969 --> 24:41.669
[SPEAKER_14]: The one I still have paused right now.

24:42.950 --> 24:44.711
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've been playing that.

24:45.491 --> 24:51.694
[SPEAKER_14]: And I downloaded the demo for Reality Fires, which I hear is really terrible, but it's a demo on free.

24:51.734 --> 24:52.514
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to want to try it.

24:52.554 --> 24:54.655
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully I'll try that this week.

24:56.528 --> 25:11.405
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, really, I mean, aside from playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto while working on mod stuff still, because I've been working on one since like a year ago, and I want to get it done so I don't have to work on it anymore.

25:13.886 --> 25:41.972
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare played that this week played it with my life because we had a bet going that if I lost a game between Wednesday and Friday that I'd have to publicly apologize at our company meetings or party whatever you want to call it on the microphone to everybody but fortunately I'm that good so I didn't have to all I apologize for at the end of the last did you get something out of it?

25:42.826 --> 25:46.808
[SPEAKER_14]: All I did at the very end of it is I just apologized for them sucking so bad.

25:47.569 --> 25:48.970
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're rubbing it.

25:51.071 --> 25:51.731
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's just fun.

25:51.911 --> 25:52.772
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just playing with them.

25:52.912 --> 25:54.273
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand their frustration.

25:56.154 --> 25:59.816
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like I'm kind of crazy sometimes.

25:59.836 --> 26:02.677
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I try to be fair.

26:02.697 --> 26:04.518
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

26:04.638 --> 26:09.961
[SPEAKER_14]: They claim shenanigans, but there's no such thing.

26:10.401 --> 26:11.142
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about it.

26:11.793 --> 26:12.113
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

26:12.954 --> 26:13.594
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week.

26:13.914 --> 26:15.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an interesting gaming week.

26:15.515 --> 26:17.716
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really play a lot of new, new stuff.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little Final Fantasy XIII too, and I'm continuing to play WoW, as DarkSakura mentioned earlier.

26:22.439 --> 26:26.121
[SPEAKER_06]: But I went back and rediscovered some old stuff that I just skipped.

26:26.201 --> 26:29.743
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them you guys are seriously going to laugh at me, but you know what?

26:29.803 --> 26:31.404
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have time to play everything.

26:31.744 --> 26:33.487
[SPEAKER_11]: He's playing Barbie Pony Adventure.

26:33.507 --> 26:35.390
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing Barbie Pony Adventure, shut up.

26:35.871 --> 26:40.158
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am playing Uncharted, the first one, from 2007.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I finally started getting into the Uncharted series this week.

26:44.886 --> 26:45.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

26:46.525 --> 26:46.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

26:47.006 --> 26:47.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I was bored.

27:07.968 --> 27:14.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like the storytelling a lot in it, and obviously this is the strength of the series I gather from people as a whole.

27:15.675 --> 27:21.240
[SPEAKER_06]: The camera and controls kind of bug me a little bit, like I really want to spin the camera ways it doesn't want to go sometimes.

27:21.720 --> 27:27.345
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than those little quirks, which I think is the same complaint you probably heard about this game, oh, I don't know, five years ago when it was new.

27:27.745 --> 27:28.665
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:46.913 --> 27:48.755
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Mod Nation Racers this week.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.956
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking the Vita one.

27:49.996 --> 27:51.597
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking the PlayStation 3 one.

27:51.617 --> 27:55.160
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Mod Nation Racers on PlayStation 3 for like $17 used.

27:55.980 --> 28:00.284
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a great little local chain we have here called Dimple here in Sac, Grimino.

28:01.045 --> 28:09.852
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have all sorts of used games because they have like Super Nintendo games and Dreamcast games and Atari 2600 games, which is awesome.

28:10.472 --> 28:13.975
[SPEAKER_06]: The only unfortunate thing is that the Super Nintendo games...

28:14.195 --> 28:14.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

28:33.809 --> 28:34.109
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

29:03.477 --> 29:04.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

29:26.205 --> 29:27.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.

29:27.225 --> 29:35.648
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've had kind of a renaissance week, I guess, if you want to call 2007 and 2009 or 10, whenever modern age erasers came out, renaissance.

29:36.328 --> 29:37.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Renaissance.

29:37.908 --> 29:40.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Which happened smack dab in the middle of Fred Lee.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.249
[SPEAKER_06]: We're humans with day jobs.

29:42.329 --> 29:44.270
[SPEAKER_06]: We sometimes miss big games.

29:44.330 --> 29:45.170
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a day job.

29:46.310 --> 29:47.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody hire me.

29:47.651 --> 29:49.331
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've been doing a lot of volunteer stuff, so.

29:50.351 --> 29:50.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

29:50.952 --> 29:51.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeping yourself busy.

29:51.612 --> 29:51.712
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

29:52.852 --> 29:53.173
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

29:54.033 --> 29:56.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to some quick housekeeping.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.858
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to quickly plug our Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

30:00.138 --> 30:05.623
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio and also Twitter, OLR on Twitter.

30:06.804 --> 30:14.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind you can always find different places to interact with OLR in our community on our website at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Up in the upper right-hand corner is a box called Extended Play.

30:17.492 --> 30:44.291
[SPEAKER_06]: and you'll see logos for all big social networking sites and it helps you find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners and OLR listeners really are the best people because everybody in our little community really subscribes to the theory of don't be a dick when you're playing games online so if you want to play with people who aren't assholes I really urge you to play with the OLR because it's a really great bunch of people there's Steam community there's you know Xbox threads and all that stuff so find some OLR fans and play some games

30:45.120 --> 30:46.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's talk about the news.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.650
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's going to start us off with a whopper.

30:49.304 --> 30:57.750
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, apparently there's a lot of rumors going around saying that Valve is working on a Steam Box gaming console.

30:58.570 --> 31:01.793
[SPEAKER_14]: And that it's something that might be announced at GDC this week.

31:03.354 --> 31:06.456
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots and lots and lots of rumors kind of regarding that.

31:06.496 --> 31:14.522
[SPEAKER_14]: The first thing was that there was some sort of like... Coming from this website, The Verge...

31:15.402 --> 31:17.604
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

31:34.320 --> 31:41.425
[SPEAKER_14]: The hardware they're seeing right now is currently an Intel Core i7 with 8 gigs of RAM and an NVIDIA GPU.

31:41.985 --> 31:52.271
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess any devices that are built to those standards will run any PC title and will support any other digital distribution platform like EA's Origin Service and stuff like that.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.573
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sounds like it's almost like some sort of...

31:57.402 --> 32:00.583
[SPEAKER_14]: Digital Distribution box, which makes sense because that's what Steam is.

32:01.743 --> 32:10.466
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, they're talking about that they had some sort of different controllers and stuff that they were working on.

32:11.086 --> 32:21.629
[SPEAKER_14]: One that kind of looks a little bit like, I guess, that MLG pad that they have from Mad Catz, the one with the swappable D-pads and analog sticks and stuff like that.

32:22.009 --> 32:26.011
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're going to have some sort of framework or a controller that would allow you to do that.

32:26.051 --> 32:29.573
[SPEAKER_14]: Where you'd be able to have, okay, I want an analog stick.

32:29.633 --> 32:36.436
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, no, I want a joystick, like an arcade joystick or something like that instead.

32:36.576 --> 32:37.417
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I want something else.

32:39.278 --> 32:40.118
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of neat.

32:40.818 --> 32:41.439
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing...

32:43.427 --> 32:48.470
[SPEAKER_14]: They're saying also that, well actually there's some photos that maybe have leaked out of this as well.

32:49.130 --> 33:10.122
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming from a Twitter account that was one of the Valve employees, Greg Coomer, apparently from back in November 2nd, he's all, built this tiny PC, an i7 quad core, 8 gigs of RAM, and a Zotac Z68 motherboard with onboard NVIDIA mobile graphics.

33:10.902 --> 33:12.283
[SPEAKER_14]: Runs Portal 2 fast.

33:12.583 --> 33:16.705
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, isn't that convenient that all those specs happen to match up with what the rumors were?

33:17.445 --> 33:19.266
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it would be small enough.

33:19.446 --> 33:23.707
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost looks like, well, it's a micro or mini ITX box.

33:23.807 --> 33:30.030
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, it's like an Apple TV size with Wi-Fi and stuff like that.

33:30.150 --> 33:32.651
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I could see something like that happening.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.992
[SPEAKER_14]: God, can you imagine if that was like an Apple thing?

33:36.572 --> 33:41.154
[SPEAKER_14]: Not necessarily, oh, Steam Box, but it's Apple Steam Box or something like that.

33:43.932 --> 34:02.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know I would think Apple would want to focus on something that ties into its own thing you know for forever I would think that they would open up the game store to work on Apple TV and I think a lot of people have been wondering about that but we may get that announcement this week isn't there like some big yeah there's the iPad 3 but I don't I don't see that no

34:04.419 --> 34:11.945
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, there's definitely some hints or whatever coming from that Twitter account that they're working on some sort of console device or something like that.

34:12.545 --> 34:24.635
[SPEAKER_14]: So lots of rumored stuff right now and of course pictures of the controller and this is coming from some patents that are out there.

34:24.815 --> 34:28.898
[SPEAKER_14]: Video game controller having user swappable control components.

34:29.839 --> 34:30.119
[SPEAKER_14]: So

34:31.560 --> 34:33.601
[SPEAKER_14]: So, interesting.

34:34.041 --> 34:35.942
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be something like that.

34:37.662 --> 34:48.266
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's interesting that one of the first things, and I heard Bobby talk about this on his show too, and I gotta admit, one of the first things that came to my mind when I read about this was the Phantom console.

34:48.626 --> 34:49.446
[SPEAKER_06]: It was talked about at E3.

34:49.466 --> 34:53.628
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a laughing stock, but in some ways, it wasn't all that different.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.750
[SPEAKER_06]: The Phantom was a little PC box.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.471
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all digital distribution.

34:57.791 --> 35:08.360
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing, though, that really killed it and why people were like, no thanks, was that they wanted to charge a fee to just have the damn box and then charge for the games on top of that.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.081
[SPEAKER_06]: And I definitely don't see a Steam box doing that.

35:10.121 --> 35:12.223
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, this concept isn't...

35:12.643 --> 35:18.747
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be more like OnLive where they have their streaming box and the controller and stuff like that and then you use their service.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.148
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this could be something similar.

35:21.329 --> 35:37.399
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's going to be something that you're streaming content with, although I could see them doing some sort of streaming service or whatever, but I think this is more of a digital distribution where you download it and this thing is powerful enough to run most games.

35:37.939 --> 35:39.280
[SPEAKER_14]: At least I would hope.

35:39.320 --> 35:39.980
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know with a...

35:41.261 --> 35:43.582
[SPEAKER_14]: A mobile Nvidia chip?

35:43.622 --> 35:45.062
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess it's possible.

35:45.122 --> 35:54.884
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, hell, I have a mobile Nvidia chip in my laptop, and it can run most games, and it's really hot doing so, but it can do it.

35:55.465 --> 35:56.665
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is actually pretty old.

35:58.485 --> 35:59.245
[SPEAKER_14]: At least the chip is.

35:59.326 --> 36:04.987
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing would just be very interesting, because you're legitimately just selling somebody a PC that hooks up to their television, which...

36:05.767 --> 36:07.629
[SPEAKER_06]: I know at DarkSakura's house, they already have one.

36:07.689 --> 36:09.230
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen a lot of people do that.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.932
[SPEAKER_14]: And most PCs would hook up to a TV nowadays.

36:12.052 --> 36:12.792
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of them have.

36:12.812 --> 36:14.374
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's got HDMI.

36:14.614 --> 36:17.876
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if it's got a dedicated graphics card, they always have HDMI out.

36:17.916 --> 36:18.937
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all in the marketing.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people don't think to do that.

36:20.498 --> 36:20.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

36:20.898 --> 36:26.342
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I'm like, for real, that's, I mean, what is this box giving us that a lot of laptops don't have?

36:26.362 --> 36:41.191
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the thing, though, is with the specs, though, basically, okay, you need to have this much RAM, this much processing power, this kind of chip release, this, you know, as low as this chip, and then basically I can just download the software.

36:41.371 --> 36:43.733
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, that's Steam, and I can play games.

36:44.013 --> 36:45.034
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah.

36:45.074 --> 36:47.255
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I can play Steam on my TV.

36:47.315 --> 36:48.936
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but you know what?

36:48.956 --> 36:49.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Already.

36:50.337 --> 37:01.237
[SPEAKER_06]: at first I just kind of looked at this like whatever I don't think this is as big of a deal as people make it out to be but then the more I thought about it I was thinking what if this is what they've been saving Half-Life 3 for

37:04.181 --> 37:27.073
[SPEAKER_06]: what if this is the way to get Half-Life 3 and that would be the huge what I mean my god they could sell an entire console out of one game if there's any game in the world that could push a console by itself it would be Half-Life 3 all you have to do announce Half-Life 3 is going to be the pack-in game for this console or it's going to be exclusive window 90 day this thing's going to sell like a mother

37:28.564 --> 37:29.285
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37:42.839 --> 37:52.792
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I, but the thing is though with the specs, I mean, unless they're making some actual proprietary boards or something like that, which they could be, but I don't think they are.

37:53.233 --> 37:59.261
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can't really, you could almost like say, okay, give me the part list and I'll build one myself.

37:59.321 --> 37:59.802
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

38:01.275 --> 38:02.616
[SPEAKER_06]: People would figure it out, though.

38:02.836 --> 38:10.962
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, TigerClaw says, Valve should totally make a special edition Steam box shaped like the weighted companion cube.

38:11.603 --> 38:13.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about another way to sell a ton of them.

38:13.584 --> 38:14.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make them cute!

38:16.306 --> 38:18.148
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Behazard on an HDTV is glorious.

38:44.895 --> 38:52.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, a lot of games look really good on the TV just because, you know, it's got a different way of the way it's kind of projects the images than a monitor.

38:52.559 --> 38:55.821
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, a lot of games look really good, especially when it's a huge TV.

38:56.922 --> 39:02.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Derek H takes a different position in our chat room saying no non-PC gamer knows what Half-Life is.

39:02.805 --> 39:03.685
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no Mario.

39:03.725 --> 39:05.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, it ain't even Sonic.

39:05.146 --> 39:05.866
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not true.

39:06.147 --> 39:06.447
[SPEAKER_06]: I was.

39:06.587 --> 39:06.787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:07.187 --> 39:07.968
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

39:07.988 --> 39:08.668
[SPEAKER_06]: The orange box?

39:08.728 --> 39:08.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:09.248 --> 39:10.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange box did have Half-Life.

39:10.806 --> 39:11.767
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:30.465 --> 39:41.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would people that are fans of a primarily PC franchise, you know, as much as Half-Life was in the orange box, it's still primarily a PC franchise.

39:41.198 --> 39:43.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would those people jump ship to buy a new console?

39:43.120 --> 39:43.761
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, here's the thing.

39:44.102 --> 39:49.047
[SPEAKER_14]: I would buy a console, or we'd probably pick up multiple consoles if they were cheap enough.

39:49.668 --> 39:50.108
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:12.647 --> 40:33.153
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and I will say again I'm I'm just fueling fanboy fire by my suggestion at Half-Life 3 but it's kind of you know if Valve was gonna do what everybody else did it would make sense but we can just hope that Valve wouldn't do something like that but no no matter what it would sure make a sweet showcase game wouldn't it if nothing else show off the power

40:34.213 --> 40:34.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

40:35.174 --> 40:36.135
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't see it happening.

40:36.195 --> 40:41.341
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would love for them to prove me wrong and then I can just go see, you know, watch them flop.

40:42.482 --> 40:46.346
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, Half-Life 3 would sell to the core Half-Life fans.

40:47.066 --> 40:50.590
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, before long they try to figure out some way to get it to run on the PC.

40:50.730 --> 40:56.176
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd be, you know, they try to find ways to, because I mean, if basically if it is going to be a PC, they try to find some way of hacking it.

40:56.676 --> 41:01.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, and I don't, you know, again, my whole thing was just like maybe like a 90-day window.

41:01.159 --> 41:05.322
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, yeah, if this thing is just a PC, then, you know, that would be kind of, it wouldn't work.

41:05.842 --> 41:08.144
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I'm just throwing out ideas.

41:08.644 --> 41:16.070
[SPEAKER_11]: And keep in mind, they already, it took them, you know, PlayStation emulation happened on PCs.

41:16.830 --> 41:23.315
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything that will run on a disc or in some digital format, people have tried to emulate on a PC regardless.

41:23.515 --> 41:24.796
[SPEAKER_11]: So someone's going to figure it out.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.358
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they might just realize that.

41:28.778 --> 41:28.998
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

41:29.018 --> 41:29.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who knows?

41:29.439 --> 41:31.740
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll see something about it at E3 this year.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.741
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the time to show off a new console.

41:34.482 --> 41:39.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of E3, there's some rumors this week that the Wii U is going to have its price revealed at E3.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.106
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it has to have its price revealed at E3.

41:41.446 --> 41:44.448
[SPEAKER_06]: But the rumors this week are exactly what that price is set to be.

41:45.148 --> 41:46.129
[SPEAKER_06]: An unnamed source...

41:46.949 --> 41:48.570
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta love those guys.

41:48.630 --> 41:57.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Disgruntled employee or something told the site Wii U Daily that the Wii U will retail for $299.99 when it comes into North America after E3.

41:58.137 --> 41:59.819
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's just an educated guess.

42:00.119 --> 42:04.382
[SPEAKER_06]: $299 in the US, $299 euros in Europe, $20,000 yen in Japan.

42:04.882 --> 42:08.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has stated before that they're gonna try to price it like it's the 360 or the PlayStation 3.

42:09.686 --> 42:13.849
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked last week on the show about why it cannot be more than $450.

42:13.909 --> 42:14.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

42:15.710 --> 42:19.655
[SPEAKER_06]: I think $2.99 sounds a lot more reasonable for what Nintendo is trying to do here.

42:20.336 --> 42:23.600
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of with you, Loki.

42:25.482 --> 42:30.468
[SPEAKER_06]: I could say an unnamed source told Orange Lounge Radio that, and that would be a pretty darn good risk to take.

42:30.989 --> 42:33.292
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, $2.99 is a really good educated guess.

42:33.803 --> 42:37.585
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, I mean, we use daily, no offense, no one's really heard of you.

42:38.505 --> 42:42.967
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you get it correct, then you're like, oh, hey, look, we said it first.

42:43.107 --> 42:45.388
[SPEAKER_14]: If you get it wrong, no one's going to remember that you said that.

42:45.668 --> 42:57.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes, and we can tell you from firsthand, because this very show used to blow the lid on something, and nobody knew who we were, and we knew we were right, but by the time it was announced, nobody cared, you know?

42:57.833 --> 42:59.533
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it happens.

43:02.474 --> 43:03.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Crush 3D is cancelled, by the way.

43:05.195 --> 43:05.395
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

43:05.415 --> 43:06.215
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Sega game.

43:06.455 --> 43:07.116
[SPEAKER_14]: Crush 3D.

43:07.216 --> 43:07.836
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is that?

43:07.856 --> 43:08.816
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember what it is.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.316
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a 3DS game they just put a demo out for.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.077
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not publishing it anymore.

43:14.137 --> 43:15.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, where did that come from?

43:15.738 --> 43:17.618
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would they put a demo out if it's been cancelled?

43:17.718 --> 43:18.518
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't make any sense.

43:19.118 --> 43:21.339
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of demos come out for games that end up not happening.

43:22.062 --> 43:23.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, but I don't know.

43:23.222 --> 43:24.883
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like the whole... Well, it's not now.

43:25.163 --> 43:25.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe later.

43:26.383 --> 43:26.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

43:27.143 --> 43:29.984
[SPEAKER_11]: It could possibly be that the demo was just a way to gauge interest.

43:30.244 --> 43:32.245
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they said they were going to do that for Mega Man at one point.

43:32.405 --> 43:33.765
[SPEAKER_14]: And the demo didn't even come out for that.

43:34.665 --> 43:35.105
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

43:35.465 --> 43:42.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I have a little more on the Wii U. There may have already been some changes to the Wii U. There's some diagrams that are circulating out there on the internet.

43:42.667 --> 43:49.869
[SPEAKER_06]: The original design of the Wii U had like a raised analog stick, but apparently this new one has those more flat

43:50.169 --> 43:52.391
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they always had the circle pads.

44:10.151 --> 44:20.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumor is that Nintendo could have leaked it themselves to see how the community feels about it, which isn't beyond the realm of possibility, and Neil Gaff would be an excellent place to do it.

44:22.417 --> 44:23.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently two diagrams out there.

44:23.837 --> 44:31.921
[SPEAKER_14]: It would make sense that we have two circle pads to coincide with the redesigned 3DS with two circle pads that will eventually be coming.

44:32.661 --> 44:36.723
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's just like saying, you know, tomorrow is Monday.

44:38.604 --> 45:03.830
[SPEAKER_06]: um I don't really know how I feel about one or the other I think I'm a slight I mean I don't hate the circle pads but I think I'm a slight more fan of the analog sticks because you can grab the analog sticks too you don't just have to use them with your thumb but sometimes for classic games I'll actually kind of pinch the stick and use it that way and you can't do that with a circle pad it's harder to kind of I don't know there's like less resistance on this it's like going from an NES pad to the NES max

45:04.861 --> 45:05.401
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:35.025 --> 45:38.948
[SPEAKER_11]: There is that Capcom Namco Sega 3DS game.

45:39.188 --> 45:41.250
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've got teasers out in the form of chromosomes.

45:41.830 --> 45:43.432
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're specially colored chromosomes.

45:44.753 --> 45:50.578
[SPEAKER_11]: And for people who don't know what chromosomes look like, they look like weird disjointed X's.

45:51.939 --> 45:53.200
[SPEAKER_11]: There's your biology lesson.

45:53.480 --> 45:56.022
[SPEAKER_06]: They hang from the ceilings in a lot of science classrooms.

45:56.423 --> 45:57.744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they do.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.561
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:22.234 --> 46:26.056
[SPEAKER_11]: My papa collected Alabama football Coke bottles.

46:26.777 --> 46:28.197
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Bear Bryant foot bottles.

46:28.437 --> 46:31.379
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure people relatively know who Bear Bryant was.

46:31.479 --> 46:35.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've heard of the old school bottle, bottle collecting, glass bottle collecting.

46:35.361 --> 46:39.663
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, back to Namco, Sega, Capcom, Dai.

46:41.304 --> 46:47.729
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are all colored specially and there's some speculation as to what these colors are indicating.

46:48.270 --> 46:51.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Like one of them is from Namco, maybe a Klonoa one.

46:51.552 --> 46:52.233
[SPEAKER_11]: It's blue and yellow.

46:54.114 --> 47:06.744
[SPEAKER_11]: From Capcom, there is one that's definitely zero colored in the fact that it's red and gold with a little green and a little blue and a little white, which definitely is the distribution on zeros colors.

47:07.365 --> 47:08.926
[SPEAKER_11]: And a Bayonetta one for Sega.

47:09.946 --> 47:12.607
[SPEAKER_11]: One that's all mostly black and sexy.

47:13.167 --> 47:15.988
[SPEAKER_14]: So could this be a weird... How does an ex become sexy?

47:17.388 --> 47:18.248
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Bayonetta.

47:18.768 --> 47:20.188
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be black and sexy.

47:20.369 --> 47:21.729
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter what it is, it's Bayonetta.

47:21.789 --> 47:29.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Could this be some weird... I mean, either now we're looking at weird-ass fighting game, Mario... Not Mario, Smash Brothers type thing.

47:29.671 --> 47:30.511
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a breeding game.

47:30.751 --> 47:30.811
[SPEAKER_10]: Or...

47:32.112 --> 47:33.455
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, it's like Pokemans.

47:33.836 --> 47:36.381
[SPEAKER_06]: What about like a platformer type of thing?

47:36.481 --> 47:37.884
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's a breeding game.

47:38.065 --> 47:38.886
[SPEAKER_06]: A breeding game?

47:39.247 --> 47:41.953
[SPEAKER_06]: Three companies got together to come up with a freaking breeding game?

47:42.375 --> 47:46.217
[SPEAKER_11]: You can have, like, Bayonetta and Zero get it on and have Bay of Zero.

47:46.337 --> 47:47.217
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Sega is in this.

47:47.257 --> 47:47.557
[SPEAKER_11]: No, thank you.

47:47.577 --> 47:51.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps we're going to race these characters derby style.

47:51.759 --> 47:53.360
[SPEAKER_14]: That's probably a fucking kart racer.

47:54.380 --> 47:55.060
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

47:55.100 --> 47:55.660
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

47:57.221 --> 48:04.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I kind of see, like, okay, if you could have... All right, think in terms of Soul Calibur, how you can make your own custom characters.

48:05.645 --> 48:11.087
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could have, you know, pick the best bits of different, you know, stock characters for these companies...

48:12.768 --> 48:17.411
[SPEAKER_11]: and then make your own fighting game character that you would upload and share on the internet.

48:17.471 --> 48:19.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh God, do not steal my ideas, all of you companies.

48:20.193 --> 48:22.835
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll call it Mega Man Universe and then we'll cancel it.

48:24.916 --> 48:28.479
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just an idea that just suddenly popped through my head that I thought would be cool.

48:28.939 --> 48:34.863
[SPEAKER_06]: What if it's like somebody actually made a game out of Super Mario crossover but it's not Mario?

48:34.883 --> 48:35.864
[SPEAKER_11]: What if it's a puzzle game?

48:36.204 --> 48:54.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Bayonetta and Mario Brothers that'd be weird it's called Puzzle Zone not get Mario Brothers out of your head but the whole crossover like Bayonetta ends up in the Mega Man universe the only thing here's the thing which it was Mega Man universe okay well here's the game there's only one game that kind of reminds me of this and once again the name escapes me but it was for the um

48:56.047 --> 49:02.850
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say the PlayStation 2, and it was a crossover game with, I want to say Bandai and Hudson.

49:03.751 --> 49:10.874
[SPEAKER_14]: So you had Barbie versus Solid Snake versus Bomberman versus Optimus Prime.

49:10.894 --> 49:12.394
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that at some anime convention.

49:12.434 --> 49:13.075
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was like...

49:13.915 --> 49:26.661
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and keep in mind, there's always been the Robot Taisen, the Robot Wars games that have, you know, multiple series worth of, you know, you have Evangelions versus Gundams.

49:26.721 --> 49:29.582
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was a Japanese announcement, right?

49:29.742 --> 49:36.845
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be something, you know, that's more what we'd see in that market versus what we'd see across, you know, whatever.

49:38.433 --> 49:41.657
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I just, I feel like, why another fighting game?

49:41.797 --> 49:42.979
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it doesn't have to be a fighting game.

49:42.999 --> 49:44.541
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember Namco Cross Capcom?

49:44.901 --> 49:45.923
[SPEAKER_14]: Tactical strategy game.

49:46.003 --> 49:46.564
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, right, right.

49:46.644 --> 49:47.124
[SPEAKER_14]: That failed.

49:47.385 --> 49:47.665
[SPEAKER_14]: Twice.

49:49.027 --> 49:50.348
[SPEAKER_14]: So, maybe they'll do that.

49:51.330 --> 49:54.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma in our chatroom says, Peach and Daisy dress like Bayonetta.

49:55.395 --> 49:56.657
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's how you pronounce that?

49:57.967 --> 49:59.508
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nintendo's not really involved.

49:59.528 --> 50:07.376
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on the 3DS, but it's not a... Nintendo wasn't involved as one of the companies, so I don't know.

50:07.996 --> 50:09.277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably just a fucking kart racer.

50:09.297 --> 50:09.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going with that.

50:10.719 --> 50:13.621
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, I like the idea of a Pokemon game starring Bayonetta.

50:15.782 --> 50:16.502
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on.

50:16.522 --> 50:17.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta whip them all.

50:17.843 --> 50:21.566
[SPEAKER_14]: Dream Mix TV World Fighters was the game I was thinking of.

50:21.686 --> 50:22.766
[SPEAKER_14]: That game was kind of derpy.

50:23.687 --> 50:24.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're orange, right?

50:24.548 --> 50:25.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Said it in chat, too.

50:25.408 --> 50:25.688
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

50:25.748 --> 50:30.031
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a Nintendo GameCube game, but I believe it was also PlayStation 2.

50:30.712 --> 50:31.872
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one on the DS, too.

50:31.892 --> 50:33.233
[SPEAKER_06]: It had Twinbee in it.

50:34.134 --> 50:35.214
[SPEAKER_06]: Twinbee is great!

50:35.795 --> 50:37.916
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just fan wank speculation.

50:38.096 --> 50:38.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to something else.

50:40.078 --> 50:41.098
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

50:41.219 --> 50:45.642
[SPEAKER_14]: So Sony is going to be announcing some new Vita stuff probably pretty soon, actually this week.

50:46.143 --> 50:50.086
[SPEAKER_14]: March 9th, they're going to be holding their own live streaming Vita reveal event.

50:50.627 --> 50:57.192
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of sounds like something that Nintendo did last week or the week before last at some point.

50:58.233 --> 50:59.554
[SPEAKER_14]: On the day that the Vita came out.

50:59.894 --> 51:01.515
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, on the day the Vita came out.

51:02.396 --> 51:03.997
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo doesn't have any games coming out on the 9th.

51:04.077 --> 51:05.137
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wait, they have one.

51:05.898 --> 51:07.399
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, no they don't have anything.

51:08.019 --> 51:11.701
[SPEAKER_14]: It just reminded me because Mario Party 9 is coming out next week.

51:13.042 --> 51:15.103
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, so they're going to be announcing some stuff.

51:15.143 --> 51:21.187
[SPEAKER_14]: It's supposed to happen I guess at 6am Eastern.

51:22.287 --> 51:27.030
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hope you're up early or like me, I'm just going to wake up and read the news the next day.

51:30.443 --> 51:56.603
[SPEAKER_06]: the 24 hour news sites will be all over this to see whoever can post it first so you know it'll be by the time we roll out of bed and translate it and all that good stuff so well I mean we know that there are a lot of games in the pipeline for Vita because when they announced it they were talking about all these freaking games like you know that was 100 games so you know maybe more information about Final Fantasy 10 reimagining and some of these other things we've heard about it

51:56.874 --> 51:59.695
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection will be this summer, so that's kind of cool.

51:59.895 --> 52:01.495
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

52:01.895 --> 52:04.996
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got first party games coming out.

52:05.356 --> 52:12.198
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing for really April yet, but for May and June they've got that covered already, first party titles.

52:12.438 --> 52:17.099
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess because kind of in March they have a few first party titles coming out.

52:17.519 --> 52:24.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would think we're going to hear through the summer and then maybe a couple teasers for holiday and then E3 is when they really blow the lid off of holiday games.

52:25.001 --> 52:27.545
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this conference is really about the summer.

52:28.326 --> 52:33.373
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really a way for Sony to reinforce, hey, we're not abandoning the Vita.

52:33.433 --> 52:35.316
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have this constant stream of games.

52:35.817 --> 52:38.220
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet, they haven't said a lot about, and it's out really soon.

52:39.161 --> 52:40.824
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't have an official street date yet.

52:42.444 --> 52:45.225
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now it's hovering at the end of March, maybe April.

52:45.605 --> 52:48.285
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be a good April title because there's nothing in April right now.

52:48.445 --> 52:52.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the game you're going to hear more about at this event for sure.

52:53.126 --> 52:56.547
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a must buy for sure.

52:56.887 --> 52:58.347
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a lot of stuff coming out.

53:00.087 --> 53:00.927
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just going to be exciting.

53:01.267 --> 53:04.268
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully it's more exciting than Motorstorm RC, which looks like crap.

53:05.208 --> 53:10.209
[SPEAKER_06]: This might also be where they're going to unveil that they made the PlayStation games backwards compatible.

53:11.571 --> 53:11.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally?

53:12.431 --> 53:12.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

53:12.992 --> 53:13.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

53:14.552 --> 53:15.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Big feature announcement?

53:15.833 --> 53:16.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

53:16.333 --> 53:16.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly?

53:16.793 --> 53:17.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully?

53:18.074 --> 53:18.814
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2?

53:19.434 --> 53:20.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I'm pushing it.

53:21.555 --> 53:22.316
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know though, right?

53:22.616 --> 53:25.817
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

53:25.837 --> 53:29.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of PlayStation 2, there's some games you're not going to be able to play much longer.

53:29.819 --> 53:30.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Sony games.

53:30.819 --> 53:35.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Sony games are having their servers closed on March 29th of this year.

53:35.501 --> 53:36.862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Sony Online Entertainment.

53:37.182 --> 53:40.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually don't think all of these are PS2 games, but I know

53:40.643 --> 53:43.524
[SPEAKER_06]: EverQuest Online Adventures is closing.

53:43.724 --> 53:48.665
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot that this game was on the PlayStation 2, but it was kind of like a spinoff of the main EverQuest game.

53:49.065 --> 53:51.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're a fan of this game, you'll no longer be able to play it after March 29, 2012.

53:52.385 --> 53:57.406
[SPEAKER_06]: The other games that are going away, I, honest to God, have never heard of any of these.

53:57.766 --> 54:02.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Cosmic Rift, Infantry, and Star Chamber, the Harbinger Saga.

54:02.167 --> 54:03.528
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard of Cosmic Rift.

54:03.928 --> 54:05.208
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't tell you what it is.

54:05.228 --> 54:05.548
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of...

54:07.076 --> 54:07.638
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, let me look.

54:08.843 --> 54:10.931
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've heard of it.

54:14.567 --> 54:42.493
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly thought that all the games on Playstation 2 had their servers shut off a long time ago like you know when Amplitude went down and you know all the old sports games Cosmic Rift is a two dimensional massively multiplayer video game designed by lead programmer Jeff Peterson it is a science fiction universe it is provided as part of the station pass through Sony Online Entertainment this is a Windows game

54:43.953 --> 54:50.977
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released open beta April 2001 and it's completely free to play as of June 26, 2011.

54:52.197 --> 54:53.218
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they're shutting it down.

54:54.058 --> 54:59.441
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks kind of like an old school shooter game.

55:00.041 --> 55:02.663
[SPEAKER_06]: and like old school space shooter.

55:03.384 --> 55:07.667
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but obviously these games must have had their fans to keep them going this long.

55:07.747 --> 55:08.607
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's unfortunate.

55:08.627 --> 55:09.948
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably shaking their fist right now.

55:09.988 --> 55:11.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why haven't you heard of my game?

55:11.809 --> 55:16.453
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, unfortunately they're getting shut down now because it just wasn't enough to keep it profitable.

55:16.853 --> 55:17.413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens.

55:17.754 --> 55:20.696
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got to suck when you buy an online game like that, you know?

55:21.936 --> 55:28.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my heart jumped as beat when I saw this headline because I was like, fuck, are they going to shut off Mod Nation Racers a month after I bought it?

55:29.042 --> 55:30.743
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, but it was all old stuff.

55:30.803 --> 55:31.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing on PlayStation 3.

55:33.626 --> 55:34.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Dodge that bullet.

55:36.169 --> 55:37.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

55:37.150 --> 55:39.953
[SPEAKER_06]: We're coming up on release dates here after one more story from DarkSakura.

55:41.335 --> 55:41.915
[SPEAKER_11]: Again?

55:42.216 --> 55:42.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

55:42.796 --> 55:43.817
[SPEAKER_11]: How about some Minecraft news?

55:44.678 --> 55:47.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know we have, like, what, five people that play Minecraft?

55:48.027 --> 55:55.717
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Minecraft Pocket Edition actually hit 1 million paid downloads on Android.

55:56.418 --> 55:59.201
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently it's doing pretty well on iOS.

55:59.261 --> 56:03.626
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the 26th position in the top paid app charts.

56:04.367 --> 56:06.068
[SPEAKER_11]: So, not bad, huh?

56:06.729 --> 56:14.214
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a tweet that came out from Daniel Kaplan, who is the business developer behind it.

56:14.494 --> 56:18.116
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, Minecraft Pocket Edition has now sold more than 1 million copies.

56:18.176 --> 56:21.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks all the support, and I hope you will like the coming updates.

56:22.559 --> 56:24.140
[SPEAKER_11]: So, good?

56:25.741 --> 56:27.302
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray for people who like Minecraft.

56:29.164 --> 56:31.385
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:21.925 --> 57:27.691
[SPEAKER_14]: Mass Effect 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC.

57:28.051 --> 57:30.594
[SPEAKER_14]: Also the collector's edition with that as well.

57:31.235 --> 57:33.457
[SPEAKER_14]: Country Dance All-Stars for Kinect.

57:34.237 --> 57:34.878
[SPEAKER_14]: That's out this week.

57:35.078 --> 57:37.661
[SPEAKER_14]: Nicktoons MLB 3D for the 3DS.

57:38.762 --> 57:40.544
[SPEAKER_14]: Lego Harry Potter Years 5 through 7 on the Vita.

57:40.564 --> 57:41.144
[SPEAKER_14]: Unit 13 on the Vita.

57:44.707 --> 58:11.959
[SPEAKER_14]: MLB 12 The Show on PlayStation 3 and the Vita The Sims 3 Showtime they have that expansion coming out also Showtime Plus that includes the regular game as well and the shark jumping The Sims 3 Showtime Katy Perry Collector's Edition that's coming out on PC what basic bitch game is this?

58:13.649 --> 58:14.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Katie Perry what?

58:15.151 --> 58:20.516
[SPEAKER_14]: The Sims 3 Showtime Expansion, Katie Perry Collector's Edition.

58:21.417 --> 58:29.125
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what deal there is between EA and Katie Perry, but there was that whole Simlish song she did.

58:29.465 --> 58:30.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was cute!

58:31.005 --> 58:32.466
[SPEAKER_14]: She must be a Closet Sims fan.

58:32.506 --> 58:33.946
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's part of this.

58:34.046 --> 58:35.286
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tying into this thing.

58:36.067 --> 58:36.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I was years ago.

58:36.967 --> 58:41.628
[SPEAKER_14]: You get an exclusive stage and Katy Perry accessories.

58:41.868 --> 58:43.288
[SPEAKER_14]: Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it.

58:43.328 --> 58:44.029
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

58:44.129 --> 58:44.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Katy Perry!

58:45.809 --> 58:48.010
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I... I also need to interject with some breaking news.

58:48.450 --> 58:48.630
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

58:49.310 --> 58:50.410
[SPEAKER_11]: IOS game for free right now.

58:50.690 --> 58:50.890
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

58:51.010 --> 58:53.391
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor Who The Maze Is In Time is free on the IOS store.

58:54.631 --> 58:56.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, more important news than Katy Perry.

58:56.112 --> 58:56.872
[SPEAKER_11]: For a limited time.

58:57.452 --> 58:57.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

58:59.144 --> 59:12.475
[SPEAKER_14]: Also this week, in case you want to save a little bit of money, they have a 2K Sports 2-pack, NBA 2K12, and MLB 2K12, which I think saves you $50 because each one of those games is still full price, which is kind of interesting.

59:12.495 --> 59:16.378
[SPEAKER_14]: And then last but not least, Mario Party 9, one week today.

59:17.539 --> 59:18.360
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Wii, of course.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.401
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddamn, nine of them?

59:20.041 --> 59:20.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Party 9.

59:22.253 --> 59:27.154
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when the first game looked like it was Mario Party 3, but it was just the horrible art on the box.

59:28.115 --> 59:35.076
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, Mario Party 9 is not technically the ninth Mario Party game because there was one on the DS as well.

59:35.136 --> 59:36.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute, who's making those games now?

59:36.597 --> 59:37.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it Hudson?

59:37.677 --> 59:40.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Hudson was making them before, and now who's making them?

59:42.578 --> 59:43.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's making them.

59:43.919 --> 59:45.039
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they brought it back.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.089
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's look at Japan.

59:47.129 --> 59:49.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Japan's got a busy week, too, on the Xbox 360.

59:49.550 --> 59:51.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan Wake gets a price reduction, Platinum Collection.

59:52.051 --> 59:54.792
[SPEAKER_06]: So does Dance Evolution, which we have as Dance Masters here.

59:55.713 --> 59:59.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Dudonpachi Resurrection gets a price reduction, as does Dream Club Zero.

01:00:00.035 --> 01:00:05.517
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, big release over there for Japan, Street Fighter X Tekken in a regular and collector's package.

01:00:05.858 --> 01:00:07.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Two other games coming out this week.

01:00:07.198 --> 01:00:12.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit, I got really excited because my eyes blended these two titles together for a minute.

01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:17.304
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Birds of Steel and Blades of Time.

01:00:18.105 --> 01:00:19.566
[SPEAKER_06]: And I read that as Blades of Steel.

01:00:20.107 --> 01:00:21.348
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are two separate games.

01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:30.235
[SPEAKER_06]: Birds of Steel is kind of your Konami's answer to Ace Combat because those old school flight simulator things are pretty popular in Japan.

01:00:30.555 --> 01:00:35.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Blades of Time is a little more of a God of War Bayonetta-esque action-y.

01:00:35.136 --> 01:00:38.096
[SPEAKER_14]: The unofficial sequel to X-Blades, if you remember that one.

01:00:38.116 --> 01:00:38.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:39.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:00:39.537 --> 01:00:41.377
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that is supposed to be coming out this week as well.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:41.837
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot.

01:00:41.877 --> 01:00:42.697
[SPEAKER_14]: That's on PS3 and 360.

01:00:43.257 --> 01:00:44.337
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so here in the US as well.

01:00:44.437 --> 01:00:44.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:00:44.837 --> 01:00:45.238
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

01:00:45.278 --> 01:00:47.678
[SPEAKER_14]: Birds of... Wait, no.

01:00:47.738 --> 01:00:48.378
[SPEAKER_14]: Blades of Time.

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I said Blades of Steel.

01:00:50.238 --> 01:00:50.939
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he knew that too.

01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:51.919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's confusing.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:52.399
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

01:00:52.459 --> 01:00:53.599
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

01:00:54.039 --> 01:00:54.759
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:57.060
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Birds of Steel.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.400
[SPEAKER_14]: That's coming out...

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.901
[SPEAKER_14]: later this month.

01:01:02.381 --> 01:01:08.122
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be funny if it was like a, you know, it's pigeons playing hockey or something like that.

01:01:08.242 --> 01:01:11.063
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami, you need to bring back your hockey classic.

01:01:11.303 --> 01:01:12.083
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they can.

01:01:12.143 --> 01:01:15.744
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, you know, people have rights to hockey now.

01:01:15.904 --> 01:01:20.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, can't you put out just like what they did with Tecmo Bowl where they just make up team and players or something?

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:24.106
[SPEAKER_14]: Or make birds play hockey and call it Birds of Steel.

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:27.610
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, look, we got to go to the PlayStation 3 and talk about what they're getting.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Birds of Steel and Blades of Time are there as well.

[SPEAKER_06]: Mobile Suit Gundam UC comes out in the Japanese and Asian regions.

[SPEAKER_06]: And Street Fighter X Tekken gets its release on PlayStation 3 as well.

01:01:38.584 --> 01:01:41.347
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Nobunaga no Yabu Online.

01:01:42.088 --> 01:02:08.346
[SPEAKER_06]: Hounosho comes out this week this must be another Nobunaga online game I thought they already had one so I don't know if this is an expansion or what but you know these Nobunaga games are crazy over there it is not the Nobunaga Pokemon game because this is not a Nintendo system this is Sony PlayStation 3 coming out on the PlayStation Vita this week Unit 13 in Japan and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week Girls RPG Cinderella Life

01:02:09.209 --> 01:02:13.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D Hatsune Miku Future Stars Project Mirai Accessory Sets UK

01:02:27.617 --> 01:02:28.398
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stuff.

01:02:28.698 --> 01:02:30.039
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, there's a number of things.

01:02:30.239 --> 01:02:32.481
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 6th, we have Unit 13 for the Vita.

01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:34.963
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 7th, we have I Am Alive.

01:02:35.963 --> 01:02:39.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Trine 2 and Twisted Metal and Velocity.

[SPEAKER_11]: On the 8th is Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.

01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:48.233
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the 9th is Azura's Wrath, Mass Effect 3, and Street Fighter X Tekken.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:51.026
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick, I want to mention this going to our chat room.

01:02:54.708 --> 01:02:56.490
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma dropped a tip about Mario Party 9.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:00.393
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the folks that are actually developing it is ND Cube.

01:03:00.413 --> 01:03:04.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo might be publishing it because ND Cube is a Nintendo subsidiary.

01:03:04.876 --> 01:03:08.619
[SPEAKER_06]: They made in the past, they did some GameCube and Game Boy Advance games.

01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:11.441
[SPEAKER_06]: F-Zero Maximum Velocity was one of the games that they did.

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.124
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wii Party, I guess, was their game too.

01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:16.605
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember Wii Party?

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:16.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.854
[SPEAKER_06]: So this minigame collection thing is right up their alley.

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:22.202
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

01:03:23.651 --> 01:03:25.633
[SPEAKER_06]: We... Party!

01:03:26.894 --> 01:03:30.416
[SPEAKER_06]: We... Let's move on with a few more stories and then our classic game of the week.

01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:30.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:40.003
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully it doesn't... Well, I know it's going to do a lot better than Wii Party because Wii Party was... Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about patent trolls.

01:03:40.123 --> 01:03:46.348
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there is another patent troll that came after Nintendo, suing them over the Wii Fit game and balance board.

01:03:46.428 --> 01:03:49.090
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember even seeing... It was the XR Station.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:51.352
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just this big lever thing that people squeeze...

01:03:52.453 --> 01:04:06.604
[SPEAKER_14]: It was actually showed, I guess, in 2008 as it was called Squeeze, S-Q-W-E-E-Z-E, and they had a Wii Remote peripheral or something like that.

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:07.285
[SPEAKER_14]: It's weird.

01:04:07.705 --> 01:04:10.127
[SPEAKER_14]: But as you can imagine, they lost.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.249
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hooray!

01:04:12.609 --> 01:04:16.012
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's like three trolls down and millions more to go.

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:19.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:04:38.619 --> 01:04:40.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty dumb.

01:04:57.002 --> 01:04:58.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll be able to get something pushed through.

01:04:58.783 --> 01:05:00.925
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't put it past them.

01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:13.395
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, as much as I'd hate to see a company controlling the government, if it's for some positive, that would be kind of nice.

01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:15.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to finish this train of thought?

01:05:17.677 --> 01:05:18.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

01:05:19.398 --> 01:05:20.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about what you're really saying.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:27.784
[SPEAKER_06]: If a corporation controlled the US, it might not be so bad if... If it was positive.

01:05:28.045 --> 01:05:29.446
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, corporations are people.

01:05:29.746 --> 01:05:30.166
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember.

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:31.427
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go there.

01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:35.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to finish your thought?

01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:37.632
[SPEAKER_14]: I already finished my thought.

01:05:37.652 --> 01:05:38.152
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, all right.

01:05:39.013 --> 01:05:40.634
[SPEAKER_14]: I said if they did it for the positive.

01:05:40.674 --> 01:05:46.038
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if they said, you know, fuck you, we own the patent system now, bitches, then, you know, that's a little different.

01:05:47.341 --> 01:05:51.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, somebody that got told fuck you this week was the makers of The Binding of Isaac.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:55.086
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a popular indie title that is already out there on PC.

01:05:55.186 --> 01:06:01.791
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very Zelda-inspired, and so it would have felt right at home on the 3DS, but apparently those talks have broken down.

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:12.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Binding of Isaac is from Team Meat, of course, the folks behind Super Meat Boy, and after a long internal debate, according to Twitter, Nintendo has decided not to allow The Binding of Isaac on the 3DS.

01:06:12.858 --> 01:06:17.221
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying it's because of, quote, questionable religious content.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:22.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Bobby, the guy before us here at All Games Radio, he wanted me to bring this up on the show.

01:06:22.465 --> 01:06:23.725
[SPEAKER_06]: He even said it at the end of his show.

01:06:24.226 --> 01:06:29.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it more questionable religious content or questionable resemblance to Legend of Zelda content?

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:31.150
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:06:31.431 --> 01:06:36.514
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you gotta... I don't know if that... I mean, I haven't really played The Binding of Isaac extensively.

01:06:36.554 --> 01:06:38.695
[SPEAKER_06]: I've listened to the soundtrack, though, oddly enough, but I haven't played the game.

01:06:39.356 --> 01:06:43.539
[SPEAKER_06]: VVVVV's got a lot in common with Metroid, so I don't know, but...

01:06:45.575 --> 01:06:46.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:06:47.757 --> 01:06:54.002
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess part of the story is that it's a child running away after God tells the child's mother to sacrifice him.

01:06:54.062 --> 01:06:55.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a God-like voice, I should say.

01:06:55.503 --> 01:06:57.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like the God, but a God-like voice.

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:01.668
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe some of that questionable sacrifice and things.

01:07:01.948 --> 01:07:04.190
[SPEAKER_11]: If he read the Bible, he'd know Isaac got away.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:06.091
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:07.911
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

01:07:08.411 --> 01:07:17.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some further stuff that developed this week is that I want to read somewhere that, I don't know if this was Fanboy Wank, so take this with a grain of salt, but Team Meat's already in talks with Sony.

01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:21.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be the likely alternative, go to the Vita.

01:07:22.328 --> 01:07:22.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

01:07:23.128 --> 01:07:28.770
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D.GameHeroes was awfully a lot like a certain Nintendo classic, and it ended up on the PlayStation 3, so why not?

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:37.154
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing, too, they were saying, you know, basically that maybe it's because it was M-rated or something like that, but there's a lot of M-rated content already on there, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D.

01:07:38.214 --> 01:07:39.755
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:10.449
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you're not going to allow all sorts of content on your shop online what's the point in having all these content filters if you're going to filter it before it even gets out there?

01:08:11.232 --> 01:08:15.734
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like an interesting reason, but something to take with a grain of salt.

01:08:15.754 --> 01:08:17.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, that reason is coming from Team Meat.

01:08:17.415 --> 01:08:18.635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not coming from Nintendo.

01:08:19.055 --> 01:08:23.017
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, though, this is kind of like a whole thing alluding to even the new console.

01:08:23.397 --> 01:08:27.379
[SPEAKER_14]: There's so much, even with the Wii, it was like... Well, maybe not so much with the Wii, but like...

01:08:27.919 --> 01:08:33.583
[SPEAKER_14]: They were like, okay, listen, we want to shed this kiddie game company thing.

01:08:33.763 --> 01:08:42.668
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to shed that kind of perception of us, and we really want to bring the hardcore gamer back into everything with our consoles.

01:08:43.108 --> 01:08:48.031
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, sure enough, when the Wii came out, let's put out kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:50.473
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and we'll put out all the games that might appeal to everybody.

01:08:50.553 --> 01:08:52.334
[SPEAKER_14]: Eh, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.

01:08:52.834 --> 01:09:01.362
[SPEAKER_14]: and then, you know, with this new console, hey, we're making a hardcore console that's gonna, you know, support all types of games and it's gonna be, you know, it's really gonna get the hardcore user back behind it.

01:09:01.843 --> 01:09:05.826
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it's gonna be kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games in HD.

01:09:06.087 --> 01:09:09.730
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, you may have, you know, Assassin's Creed or something like that because they can run it now.

01:09:10.831 --> 01:09:21.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me bring up this because Bobby's really kind of stressing his point here in the chat room about this and shares a screenshot and I totally get it because he's sharing the screenshot and it looks like the fucking Legend of Zelda.

01:09:21.677 --> 01:09:30.642
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the way on down to the little mini map with the rectangular rooms in the upper left hand corner, little spaces for the A and B buttons and your life meter.

01:09:30.682 --> 01:09:36.385
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the design of the screen and even the look of the dungeons, everything is the freaking Legend of Zelda.

01:09:36.785 --> 01:09:38.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maybe it's not so much

01:09:38.726 --> 01:09:42.887
[SPEAKER_06]: The questionable religious content, but I think it might be a combination.

01:09:43.287 --> 01:09:46.267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's questionable religious content that sure looks a lot like Zelda.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:47.708
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want people thinking Nintendo did this.

01:09:47.728 --> 01:09:50.388
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, who made the statement, though, about why it's not on the shop?

01:09:50.408 --> 01:09:50.728
[SPEAKER_14]: Team Meat.

01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:53.269
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, see, that's the thing.

01:09:53.549 --> 01:10:00.430
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think if it's Nintendo and they're saying, you know, this looks a little too much like The Legend of Zelda, that might look a little weird.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:05.471
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Team Meat would go, yeah, we couldn't get it on the store because it looks a little too much like The Legend of Zelda.

01:10:05.491 --> 01:10:06.271
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are like...

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:11.433
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can kind of see that, but when they do the religious content, they're trying to throw some pressure towards...

01:10:31.701 --> 01:10:37.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and people would think it's a Zelda game with all this questionable mom sacrifices the child.

01:10:37.146 --> 01:10:38.368
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell kind of game is this?

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:39.609
[SPEAKER_14]: I do agree people are stupid.

01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:42.652
[SPEAKER_14]: This is how we get Katy Perry collector's editions of The Sims.

01:10:43.633 --> 01:10:44.273
[SPEAKER_06]: This is true.

01:10:46.956 --> 01:10:48.697
[SPEAKER_06]: What about a Katy Perry Legend of Zelda?

01:10:48.717 --> 01:10:49.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be offensive?

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.160
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't happen.

01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:53.792
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it would be offensive to everybody.

01:10:55.153 --> 01:10:55.693
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody.

01:10:55.713 --> 01:11:01.937
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Rob, the only other person that I know who does those what-ifs about things that never happen is my friend's four-year-old.

01:11:04.439 --> 01:11:05.859
[SPEAKER_11]: What if this was a racetrack?

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we would be racing.

01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:10.302
[SPEAKER_11]: But what if we were racing?

01:11:10.522 --> 01:11:11.283
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not racing.

01:11:12.412 --> 01:11:16.777
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't really, I mean, yeah, the layout is Zelda-ish, but there's enough different.

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:22.983
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that... Well, yeah, this screenshot that Bobby shared in the bottom right-hand corner, it says all stats up.

01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:25.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Legend of Zelda didn't have stats.

01:11:25.586 --> 01:11:35.716
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, on top of that, if Nintendo was really going to be pushy about that, they could have gone after Newtopia back in the day, which was almost exactly like A Link to the Past.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:42.025
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is just down to the design of the freaking screen.

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:45.686
[SPEAKER_06]: At least Utopia kind of looked a little different.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:51.989
[SPEAKER_14]: Team Meat should be ashamed of themselves for blatantly ripping off The Legend of Zelda.

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.970
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they shouldn't.

01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:56.031
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:58.172
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's play devil's advocate here.

01:11:58.713 --> 01:12:05.656
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're giving so much shit to Zynga for ripping off Tiny Tower, then why can't we give them shit for ripping off The Legend of Zelda?

01:12:06.212 --> 01:12:08.753
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not ripping it down to a T though.

01:12:08.813 --> 01:12:10.594
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the original Zelda didn't have stats.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.756
[SPEAKER_14]: It did, but they weren't actually visible stats.

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:19.779
[SPEAKER_14]: Because obviously, why would I pick up different armor or different swords if they all had the same stats?

01:12:19.839 --> 01:12:21.340
[SPEAKER_06]: I see blood in this game.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Zelda have blood?

01:12:23.141 --> 01:12:23.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't think it did.

01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:28.503
[SPEAKER_14]: It had sparkles, and sparkles meant violence.

01:12:29.264 --> 01:12:29.924
[SPEAKER_14]: And smoke.

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:30.944
[SPEAKER_14]: There was smoke.

01:12:30.964 --> 01:12:31.905
[SPEAKER_14]: Where there's smoke, there's fire.

01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:34.786
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, I see your point.

01:12:55.797 --> 01:12:57.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit of a rip-off, but let's see.

01:12:57.358 --> 01:12:59.600
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Real quick, sorry to interrupt real quick.

01:13:01.841 --> 01:13:02.662
[SPEAKER_14]: But you do it so well.

01:13:02.842 --> 01:13:03.142
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

01:13:03.642 --> 01:13:05.163
[SPEAKER_14]: Real quick question to DarkSakura.

01:13:05.404 --> 01:13:09.366
[SPEAKER_14]: You were talking about that one game that came out that was very similar to Link to the Past or whatever.

01:13:09.866 --> 01:13:11.628
[SPEAKER_14]: Did that have the Nintendo seal of approval?

01:13:11.668 --> 01:13:13.529
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's basically approving the fact that

01:13:13.649 --> 01:13:14.770
[SPEAKER_14]: They like games that look like this.

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.472
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't come out on the NES.

01:13:18.573 --> 01:13:19.533
[SPEAKER_11]: It should still have the similar rule.

01:13:19.573 --> 01:13:20.374
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a TurboGrafx game.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Newtopia, Newtopia 2.

01:13:22.616 --> 01:13:28.220
[SPEAKER_11]: But they didn't push for any kind of copyright infringement or anything like that.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it looked almost identical, it was a different game.

01:13:31.882 --> 01:13:32.203
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

01:13:32.363 --> 01:13:33.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk about the other classics now?

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:35.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Sonic CD.

01:13:36.046 --> 01:13:37.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Sonic CD it is.

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:39.108
[SPEAKER_06]: So much for that music.

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:41.490
[SPEAKER_11]: We already played a bunch of it while Loki was talking.

01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:44.992
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to start from the beginning.

01:13:45.572 --> 01:13:48.033
[SPEAKER_11]: The Japanese version had better music.

01:13:48.853 --> 01:13:49.153
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:13:49.533 --> 01:13:50.633
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, if you would do me a favor.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:54.655
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm going to get into the rest of this later, but I'd like for this to stay on.

01:13:55.015 --> 01:13:56.655
[SPEAKER_11]: Play the U.S.

01:13:56.695 --> 01:13:58.196
[SPEAKER_11]: music first, if you don't mind.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:14:00.656
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say, the YouTube here is really quiet.

01:14:00.796 --> 01:14:01.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.

01:14:01.577 --> 01:14:01.917
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:03.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if the English one's any louder.

01:14:03.737 --> 01:14:03.997
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

01:14:04.438 --> 01:14:04.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:14:05.338 --> 01:14:06.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now listen to this, everybody.

01:14:09.359 --> 01:14:11.620
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the first level in The Bad Future.

01:14:13.381 --> 01:14:14.482
[SPEAKER_11]: Skip just a little bit ahead.

01:14:16.983 --> 01:14:17.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see that?

01:14:17.683 --> 01:14:21.885
[SPEAKER_11]: It has that kind of dark, jungly sound.

01:14:22.085 --> 01:14:26.006
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like one of those bands, the pan flute bands that play at the strip mall.

01:14:26.487 --> 01:14:27.867
[SPEAKER_11]: Play at Downtown Disney.

01:14:28.287 --> 01:14:29.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Now play the Japanese one.

01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:37.791
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, play the Japanese one.

01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:38.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

01:14:38.152 --> 01:14:38.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:41.496
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic the Hedgehog CD

01:15:00.582 --> 01:15:04.766
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was the first appearance of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose.

01:15:05.647 --> 01:15:12.073
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out in Japan on September 23, 1993, in Europe in October 1993, in North America on November 19, 1993.

01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:22.203
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out on the PC in 1996 and was included in the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005 for PS2 and GameCube.

01:15:22.363 --> 01:15:24.865
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an enhanced version that was just recently released.

01:15:25.726 --> 01:15:32.973
[SPEAKER_11]: and December 2001 on Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, iOS and Android and then we have a PC version that came out January 19, 2012.

01:15:33.053 --> 01:15:38.899
[SPEAKER_11]: There is supposed to be a Windows Phone version coming out first quarter 2012.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.341
[SPEAKER_11]: Just thought I would mention that too.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.901
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, for anyone who's played a Sonic game, this is a freaking Sonic game.

01:15:46.161 --> 01:15:47.501
[SPEAKER_11]: He has the spin dash.

01:15:48.621 --> 01:15:49.642
[SPEAKER_11]: You collect the rings.

01:15:49.682 --> 01:15:52.262
[SPEAKER_11]: You go underwater, which I hate underwater levels.

01:15:52.622 --> 01:15:54.923
[SPEAKER_11]: You had the invincibility shield.

01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:56.963
[SPEAKER_11]: You had the speed shoes.

01:15:58.784 --> 01:15:59.444
[SPEAKER_06]: The music ran out.

01:15:59.464 --> 01:16:00.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I play some other tracks here?

01:16:00.824 --> 01:16:01.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, play some other.

01:16:01.744 --> 01:16:03.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do Palm Tree Panic Zone.

01:16:03.305 --> 01:16:03.885
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like fun.

01:16:05.326 --> 01:16:08.427
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually the present version of that same level.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.910
[SPEAKER_11]: Which they did a remixed version of this one slower for the American one.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.311
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway.

01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:22.235
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, you also have with the spin dash you have the super peel out that lets you zoom into quick speed from a standing point.

01:16:23.176 --> 01:16:24.797
[SPEAKER_11]: Either rolling or in running position.

01:16:25.137 --> 01:16:28.639
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's faster than the spin dash but it leaves Sonic more vulnerable.

01:16:29.324 --> 01:16:56.404
[SPEAKER_11]: and then each of the levels has three acts you have two main levels and a boss act and one thing I have to say is that the boss levels are actually pretty neat because it's kind of a departure from the way that the normal boss levels went like one of the ones that I did right before I left was one where you chase Eggman or Robotnik for people who are sticklers for the American version you chase Eggman all the way through the level until you've got him busted so it's pretty cool

01:16:57.389 --> 01:16:59.031
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

01:17:17.712 --> 01:17:30.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you go into the future by default, then you go into a bad future, where it's basically over-industrialized and everything is, you know, dead and decaying and awful.

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:39.198
[SPEAKER_11]: You go into the past, it's like, for example, I always forget the name of it, like something Chaos Collision, I think it is.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:43.759
[SPEAKER_11]: But I always refer to it as pretty much the Casino Night, because it's like...

01:17:44.779 --> 01:17:48.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Every Sonic game that has a pinball theme in there.

01:17:48.843 --> 01:17:50.504
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not the freaking Chemical Zone, thank God.

01:17:50.885 --> 01:17:57.831
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, instead of it being all pinball-y and, you know, nighttime casino looking, it's...

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:03.658
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this neat looking pristine jungle thing.

01:18:04.238 --> 01:18:05.358
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool looking.

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:21.285
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you've managed to do a lot of good things and destroy things in the past, then when you go to the future again, instead of going back to the modern... You have to basically go through the past and destroy a robot generator that's hidden in the level.

01:18:21.825 --> 01:18:29.029
[SPEAKER_11]: So that when you go back in the regular time and then you go to the future again, you're sort of in this Technogion future where everything is...

01:18:30.049 --> 01:18:38.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Technology and nature all working together, synergy, you know, it's just... What kind of hippie stuff is this?

01:18:39.237 --> 01:18:43.700
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's clean energy and, you know, everything is cool.

01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:45.381
[SPEAKER_11]: We're sustainable.

01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:47.763
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the big, you know, key word, sustainable today.

01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:58.792
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, you know, in the past, when you destroy the robot generator, then that actually kills all the robots in the future.

01:19:00.113 --> 01:19:11.639
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you have to go after Robotnik for his level, because his level is always in a bad future, you actually go after him in a good future where he's weaker and you don't have all of the bad guys in your way.

01:19:13.095 --> 01:19:14.076
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really unique.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:24.847
[SPEAKER_11]: So also if you have more than 50 rings, by the end of the act a big gold ring appears and if you jump onto it, then you have to go around and destroy these purple UFOs that are floating around the level.

01:19:25.548 --> 01:19:35.418
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of that sort of Mario Kart looking, like old school Mario Kart looking pathway where it's all the pixelated, you know, Mode 70 looking stuff.

01:19:36.799 --> 01:19:40.701
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can... You slow down by going through water.

01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:41.982
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get speed-ups through there.

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:45.424
[SPEAKER_11]: You can destroy blue UFOs that give you more time.

01:19:46.025 --> 01:19:49.026
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can get speed shoes and different things.

01:19:49.066 --> 01:19:55.470
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you destroy all of the purple UFOs, then you get a time stone.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:58.272
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can get the good ending if you collect all seven time stones.

01:19:58.592 --> 01:20:01.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's this game's version of Chaos Emeralds.

01:20:03.435 --> 01:20:03.635
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:10.484
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, though, you automatically get that good feature if you have all the time.

01:20:10.524 --> 01:20:16.609
[SPEAKER_11]: So you also have a backup save using either the internal memory on the Sega CD or a RAM cartridge.

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:19.452
[SPEAKER_11]: And it'll save at the end of every third act.

01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:24.496
[SPEAKER_11]: What I can tell you, too, is that it saves automatically the same way on the Steam version.

01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:28.059
[SPEAKER_11]: You see the little now-saving icon at the bottom.

01:20:28.079 --> 01:20:29.980
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

01:20:31.562 --> 01:20:32.462
[SPEAKER_11]: And it does have...

01:20:34.961 --> 01:20:44.369
[SPEAKER_11]: An instant game over scenario, so Sonic will just jump off the screen if you leave the game alone for three minutes without it being paused.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:49.132
[SPEAKER_11]: Now for the newer version, you can actually play as Tails.

01:20:49.773 --> 01:20:51.694
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I should say Miles Tails Prower.

01:20:52.635 --> 01:21:01.602
[SPEAKER_11]: And he has a spin dash, the spin attack, and he can fly with his little tail rotating, but he doesn't have the super peel out and you cannot earn achievements with him.

01:21:03.503 --> 01:21:05.725
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also use the Spin Dash physics from Sonic 2.

01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:07.145
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.

01:21:08.746 --> 01:21:22.393
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically the way that this goes is that Sonic and Amy, Amy Rose, show up at Never Lake where the little planet, not the little big planet, just the little planet, shows up the last month of every year.

01:21:22.433 --> 01:21:24.254
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's month of the time, basically.

01:21:25.434 --> 01:21:42.800
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh they basically find out that Eggman's taking it over and things are getting crappy and then Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy oh no so Sonic has to go get the time zones the time stones and the seven jewels that alter time and save Amy and destroy Sonic and free the little big I mean the little planet

01:21:43.695 --> 01:21:50.261
[SPEAKER_11]: See, at this game, actually, Yuji Naka moved to the U.S.

01:21:50.782 --> 01:21:56.066
[SPEAKER_11]: to found the Sega Technical Institute and worked with Sonic Team to make Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

01:21:56.667 --> 01:22:09.879
[SPEAKER_11]: But in Japan, a separate development team that was headed by Oshima Naoto, who was the creator of Sonic, worked on Sonic CD, and they were supposed to be the same game, just a Sega CD version and a cartridge version.

01:22:10.379 --> 01:22:11.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:22:26.683 --> 01:22:27.424
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:42.643 --> 01:22:44.446
[SPEAKER_11]: and Cosmic Eternity Believe in Yourself.

01:22:45.267 --> 01:22:54.702
[SPEAKER_11]: And the boss music also sampled the song Work That Sucker to Death by 70s artists Xavier Bootsy Collins and George Clinton.

01:22:54.722 --> 01:22:55.824
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically Parliament.

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:57.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

01:22:57.507 --> 01:22:57.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:23:00.203 --> 01:23:12.112
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, and, uh, now the US one was actually, uh, redone completely by, um, Spencer Nilsson, who did a bunch of Sega Saturn soundtracks.

01:23:13.013 --> 01:23:17.036
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, and then there was that Sonic Boom song that was redone.

01:23:18.647 --> 01:23:24.689
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I really think... I mean, I'm not saying that the American soundtrack was bad by any means.

01:23:24.789 --> 01:23:25.350
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:26.210
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really good.

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:30.532
[SPEAKER_11]: But in comparison to the Japanese soundtrack, there's no comparison.

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.292
[SPEAKER_11]: The Japanese soundtrack was way amazing.

01:23:33.253 --> 01:23:33.793
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um...

01:23:35.254 --> 01:23:47.819
[SPEAKER_11]: There actually, as far as that Sonic You Can Do Anything and the Cosmic Eternity Believe in Yourself, the reason why we have an instrumental version is that the lyrics belong to Casey Rankin, who died in 2009.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.521
[SPEAKER_11]: So the rights haven't been released by the estate.

01:23:53.582 --> 01:23:59.625
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a 20th anniversary soundtrack that came out in Japan that actually has a version of Sonic Boom on it.

01:24:00.945 --> 01:24:02.567
[SPEAKER_11]: including a remastered Japanese track.

01:24:03.467 --> 01:24:04.768
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I said, there were other ports.

01:24:05.569 --> 01:24:14.597
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a PC version in 1996, which was the debut Sonic title under Sega PC's brand.

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:21.002
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out in Japan on August 9th, 1996, in North America on August 26th, 1996, and in Europe October 3rd, 1996.

01:24:22.763 --> 01:24:27.225
[SPEAKER_11]: and it has a full animated intro and ending sequence.

01:24:27.806 --> 01:24:38.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just that really clipped looking one that came on the Sega CD because it really didn't handle the heavy animations like that as we've all known for anyone of us who had ever owned a copy of Dragon's Lair.

01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:40.752
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying, Dragon's Lair, not all that great.

01:24:42.401 --> 01:24:47.025
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also re-released with the Sonic Gems Collection on the GameCube and PS2 in 2005.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:53.290
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the PC version with improved frame rate and action speed.

01:24:55.172 --> 01:24:57.734
[SPEAKER_11]: And it did have some emulation errors, though.

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:26.149
[SPEAKER_11]: and the European version actually of that one used the US soundtrack but had higher quality versions of it and then as I said we've got the Xbox Live Arcade version that was playable at PAX Prime 2011 and we've got the versions on PSN, PC, iOS, Windows Phone coming out and there's Android and then the port was actually redeveloped by Scratch using this retro engine

01:25:26.949 --> 01:25:29.290
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why it's so nice and smooth.

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.110
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we have it on Steam.

01:25:31.911 --> 01:25:33.411
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's excellent on Steam.

01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:34.051
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's only $4.

01:25:34.912 --> 01:25:35.972
[SPEAKER_11]: You owe it to yourself to buy this.

01:25:36.552 --> 01:25:37.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercial, commercial, commercial.

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:40.853
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running out of soundtrack songs here.

01:25:40.953 --> 01:25:42.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, done.

01:25:43.294 --> 01:25:43.914
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was quick.

01:25:44.295 --> 01:25:44.995
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, there it is.

01:25:45.555 --> 01:25:50.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, just telling you, the Sonic CD story was what became the Sonic the comic.

01:25:51.217 --> 01:25:55.238
[SPEAKER_11]: And the story was adapted into the Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog comic book.

01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:59.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic CD!

01:25:59.468 --> 01:26:01.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Confession, I've never played it.

01:26:02.289 --> 01:26:02.550
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:26:03.570 --> 01:26:09.473
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of Sonic games out there, and I never owned a Sega system, so I had to kind of play them all at friends' houses, or like, you know, in retrospect.

01:26:09.493 --> 01:26:19.957
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

[SPEAKER_06]: I'm poor!

01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:22.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe later.

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:23.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what.

01:26:24.282 --> 01:26:26.304
[SPEAKER_06]: When I beat Uncharted and Mod Nation Racers, I'll buy it.

01:26:26.324 --> 01:26:26.804
[SPEAKER_06]: Good lord.

01:26:26.824 --> 01:26:28.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I gotta beat something.

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:29.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:26:29.327 --> 01:26:30.348
[SPEAKER_06]: I got something you can beat.

01:26:30.428 --> 01:26:30.989
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shut up.

01:26:31.069 --> 01:26:35.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're gonna take a break and when we come back, we got plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.

01:26:35.473 --> 01:26:36.635
[SPEAKER_06]: A new segment here on the show.

01:26:36.695 --> 01:26:37.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Get excited.

01:26:37.796 --> 01:26:40.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Some news about Street Fighter Cross Tech and I don't think you're gonna like.

01:26:40.579 --> 01:26:41.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Loki doesn't like it.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:27:11.011
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe a mailbag segment FUs of the week and I apologize in advance yes we are somehow going to bring up Justin Bieber and relate it to video games I am so so sorry but you really have to hear this story don't disconnect there's a reason just trust me the Justin Bieber singing toothbrush is compatible with Xbox Live Arcade it is not shush don't make stuff up alright we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio stay tuned

01:27:17.256 --> 01:27:17.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:27:36.944 --> 01:27:38.806
[SPEAKER_06]: and sometimes we'll field questions from chat.

01:27:38.826 --> 01:27:49.773
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, we have somebody in chat right now that's Evil or E3VL wants to know, anyone know if the Vita trophies are separate from PlayStation 3 or is it all cumulative?

01:27:50.413 --> 01:27:56.557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting because it looks like they are cumulative because when you look at your trophies on the Vita, you see everything.

01:27:56.958 --> 01:28:00.200
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you look at them in the PlayStation 3, you don't see the Vita games.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.821
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.000
[SPEAKER_06]: You play a lot of PlayStation.

01:28:32.761 --> 01:28:37.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first I want to bring up a couple quick things.

01:28:38.962 --> 01:28:47.025
[SPEAKER_06]: One, I have to follow up to this interesting Twitter discussion that I caught wind of earlier this week between a listener of ours at Orange Lounge Radio and...

01:28:47.785 --> 01:29:16.592
[SPEAKER_06]: a guy at another podcast and a lot of you I know are very familiar with the website CheapAssGamer and the guy behind the website CheapyD who I got to admit I don't have time to listen to every podcast I'm sorry so I don't really listen to the show but I've seen the website it's a great concept great idea I'm sure he's done very well for himself off of that he's a fan of Saints Row 3 I know that and so we're in good company I think with that we were big fans of Saints Row 3 too but I guess well

01:29:17.092 --> 01:29:19.654
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, actually, I should get that on Steam now that it's half price.

01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:20.974
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the sale.

01:29:21.014 --> 01:29:23.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, you're like a walk-in commercial tonight, young lady.

01:29:23.376 --> 01:29:24.096
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help it.

01:29:24.156 --> 01:29:24.876
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Steam.

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:26.097
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a consumer whore.

01:29:26.157 --> 01:29:28.639
[SPEAKER_14]: So do they have that console on their way to your house already?

01:29:29.199 --> 01:29:30.640
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the reason why I bring it up.

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I guess something was said on the last show about what's the oldest podcast.

01:29:35.722 --> 01:29:38.204
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were wondering if at seven years it might be them.

01:29:38.704 --> 01:29:41.866
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I didn't hear it again, I'm just picking up on what I got for Twitter.

01:29:41.886 --> 01:29:44.748
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I misappropriated that quote, I totally apologize in advance.

01:29:45.148 --> 01:29:53.013
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of our listeners jumped in and actually tweeted him and said, actually, Orange Lounge Radio has been doing this for 10 years.

01:29:53.413 --> 01:29:58.617
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just thought that was really awesome that one of our listeners kind of like jumped in there, Henderson Mann, so big thank you to that.

01:29:59.157 --> 01:30:03.200
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, that's why I'm always very careful about jumping in, you know,

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.901
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:26.198 --> 01:30:29.639
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know what All Games Interactive was before we hooked up with the show.

01:30:30.159 --> 01:30:33.780
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know this whole pseudo stuff and everything that Scott Rubin had before G4.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.781
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know any of that stuff before we joined forces with them.

01:30:36.821 --> 01:30:38.401
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm always a little nervous.

01:30:38.521 --> 01:30:42.442
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're the longest running live show about video games.

01:30:42.722 --> 01:30:43.902
[SPEAKER_06]: We're one of the.

01:30:44.042 --> 01:30:45.162
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the protection.

01:30:45.283 --> 01:30:45.903
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the.

01:30:46.743 --> 01:30:47.483
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our little protection.

01:30:47.503 --> 01:30:48.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Diction, because we don't know what else is out there.

01:30:49.044 --> 01:30:50.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, we're the most important.

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:51.686
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it, stop it.

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:55.910
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's alright, you just have to know that we are the official podcast of the planet Earth.

01:30:56.330 --> 01:31:01.354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, that claim we staked a long time ago and I'm sorry buddy, it's ours.

01:31:01.534 --> 01:31:02.515
[SPEAKER_06]: You can lease it for a quarter.

01:31:03.135 --> 01:31:20.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just to clear the air on a few things though, just so we set the record straight, the very first Orange Lounge Radio Live, a show all about DDR and music-based games and community and, you know, talking shit at the restaurant after a long night of playing DDR, was June 23rd, 2002, at Live 365, where we used to have a station.

01:31:22.605 --> 01:31:50.963
[SPEAKER_06]: and we released our first podcast January 3rd of 2005 it was a separate show at the time called the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition because for a while we were here in studio for about four and a half hours we would do our live three hour music game community show and then we do our hey guys it's only gonna be 20 minutes show on other games that grew into an hour I mean just the the talk about other games really took over and that is why in 2006 we

01:31:51.903 --> 01:32:15.280
[SPEAKER_06]: we merged the two shows and because you know the music game stuff was not you know we didn't have enough community things to talk about everything was getting very centralized with people playing at home and so forth so that all started I think we married him in 2006 or so I think it was about a year of the to-go show and then we married him in 2006 I would like to think that this is their bastard stepchild when we did that it was so much fun

01:32:16.354 --> 01:32:17.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was so much fun.

01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:19.137
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you shot yourself in the foot.

01:32:19.357 --> 01:32:24.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, SSG100Matt says, yeah, but OLR has to be the first live podcast to use Skype.

01:32:25.041 --> 01:32:26.683
[SPEAKER_06]: You used Skype when it was in beta form.

01:32:27.323 --> 01:32:30.446
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think we have that claim.

01:32:30.706 --> 01:32:32.107
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.

01:32:32.127 --> 01:32:37.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was looking around the internet at that time, so I don't think anybody else was using Skype in a radio format to take calls at the time.

01:32:37.371 --> 01:32:40.814
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I'm nervous to stake that claim because I don't know what else is out there.

01:32:41.414 --> 01:32:44.076
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we are the first proven.

01:32:46.418 --> 01:32:47.659
[SPEAKER_11]: We are documented.

01:32:47.859 --> 01:32:53.243
[SPEAKER_11]: So if somebody else can provide their documentation that they did it before us, we'll happily relinquish the title.

01:32:53.363 --> 01:32:56.185
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be fair, I mean, it's not a title we really use.

01:32:56.225 --> 01:32:57.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Relinquish more like share.

01:32:58.405 --> 01:33:01.008
[SPEAKER_11]: We really are the podcast of the universe.

01:33:01.688 --> 01:33:02.429
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys.

01:33:02.449 --> 01:33:06.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently what was supposed to be a humble thing turned into not so much.

01:33:06.734 --> 01:33:07.335
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:14.023
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, guys, we don't... There's a reason we don't want to just whore ourselves as we're the longest running video game podcast.

01:33:14.043 --> 01:33:14.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know...

01:33:17.086 --> 01:33:46.561
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody that's doing this podcast having done it this long we can tell you first hand it's not that easy it takes a lot of dedication so you know what seven years is a fucking great accomplishment so props to you know and the service that the CheapAssGamer show provides to the community is amazing and you know lots of people really rely on that website you know to drive their game sales so props to their great idea that's taken off and has held for the past seven years I know there's a lot of shows that have been running for a very long time there's a lot of shows on this network

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:47.582
[SPEAKER_06]: DeadPixelLive.com

01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:05.043
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.001
[SPEAKER_06]: What could be more American than that, even though he lives in Japan?

01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:38.183
[SPEAKER_14]: My problem is my wife would not let me spend that kind of money on that.

01:34:38.804 --> 01:34:41.966
[SPEAKER_14]: If I hadn't met my wife, I'd be in Saints Row the Third.

01:34:43.891 --> 01:35:11.116
[SPEAKER_06]: but now you have a mini mat that is true and I still am in Saints Row the Third thanks to their awesome character I don't want to discuss this too much longer because this feels very self-serving but let me address a couple of the comments in chat Technus in chat says so you guys were around during the days when I still listen to Adam Curry's podcast to find more podcasts to listen to yes and in fact we were nominated or we won the best gaming podcast at the first podcast awards Jamie Wint I shook his hand and she sat right behind his hair

01:35:11.856 --> 01:35:38.204
[SPEAKER_11]: and his butt actually his butt was by my head for a while you're weird I was sick okay I'm at this thing sick as sick can be in LA so I'm even sicker because LA air you know disagrees with me I turn around and I see this black clad ass look up see the the the shaggy you know Bon Jovi haircut and oh it's Adam Curry I remember watching it on my TV

01:35:39.601 --> 01:35:57.482
[SPEAKER_06]: um let's see um Randy says what were podcasts called before podcasts I don't think they really had a name it was audio via RSS but I've I know they tried to do blog cast like for a long time major Nelson would not call a show a podcast or there was Zune cast or you know because you know Xbox Microsoft didn't want to give into the Apple thing

01:35:59.002 --> 01:35:59.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:36:01.663 --> 01:36:04.904
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, it's the Humble Indie Podcast Bundle segment.

01:36:05.004 --> 01:36:05.904
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that idea.

01:36:06.565 --> 01:36:09.245
[SPEAKER_06]: They should do something like that, the Humble Indie Podcast Bundle.

01:36:10.346 --> 01:36:11.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise $30,000 for charity.

01:36:11.846 --> 01:36:12.446
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that idea.

01:36:14.347 --> 01:36:17.668
[SPEAKER_06]: And SSJ100Matt says, I remember getting the show off Podcast Alley.

01:36:17.948 --> 01:36:19.568
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Podcast Alley still exists.

01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:23.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Go vote for Orange Lounge Radio to go, which is still listed in Podcast Alley.

01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:24.430
[SPEAKER_06]: We need your votes.

01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Lord.

01:36:26.652 --> 01:36:27.953
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't smell his fart.

01:36:28.534 --> 01:36:29.495
[SPEAKER_11]: Acidic vampire.

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:30.696
[SPEAKER_11]: You chatters are weird.

01:36:31.277 --> 01:36:32.919
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was so sick.

01:36:33.019 --> 01:36:35.081
[SPEAKER_11]: And after we got the award, I'm like, I'm leaving.

01:36:35.141 --> 01:36:36.923
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel so sick.

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:40.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I want to say quickly...

01:36:41.966 --> 01:37:01.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just realized I left shows out of my how long video game I think if there is a show that's been around as long as we have it's video game news radio for real like I know they were on live to survive for a while too I don't know when exactly they started so they may be able to make the claim but they've also they went non video game for a while and then kind of went back but they're

01:37:01.801 --> 01:37:05.784
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so funny because we couldn't have more different makeup of shows.

01:37:06.305 --> 01:37:07.546
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also on All Games Network.

01:37:07.566 --> 01:37:08.006
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hear them.

01:37:08.026 --> 01:37:08.807
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're Monday nights.

01:37:09.968 --> 01:37:11.429
[SPEAKER_06]: But I respect them a lot.

01:37:11.589 --> 01:37:17.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they work very hard at what they do, and it takes a lot to focus on the show every week, and they bring it.

01:37:18.234 --> 01:37:26.720
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, speaking, though, of our 10th anniversary coming up, I would like to repeat what I said last week, that I want people to email the mailbag.

01:37:27.721 --> 01:37:28.001
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:37:28.122 --> 01:37:28.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I have to...

01:37:51.619 --> 01:37:53.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to do too much of this reflection.

01:37:53.221 --> 01:37:55.023
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last comment on it and then I'm done.

01:37:55.263 --> 01:37:59.849
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not sick from smelling his butt.

01:38:00.349 --> 01:38:06.036
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when you guys went to the award show and where they didn't announce your nomination and you guys yelled at them in the back.

01:38:07.177 --> 01:38:08.498
[SPEAKER_06]: I won speakers that day.

01:38:08.798 --> 01:38:18.742
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is any moment that better defines our legacy, I mean for real, that is the moment that defined Orange Lounge Radio and I'll tell you exactly when it was.

01:38:18.782 --> 01:38:22.663
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the Live 365, Best of Live 365 Awards, I want to say 2004.

01:38:23.003 --> 01:38:28.306
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we went to that airport hotel out by SFO and we were sitting in the back.

01:38:28.346 --> 01:38:29.106
[SPEAKER_11]: Had the big atrium.

01:38:29.426 --> 01:38:57.257
[SPEAKER_06]: and we were nominated for station of the year which was amazing but they're reading the nominees for station of the year and the station of the year nominees are Rockland USA and you know all these other stations and then she starts to open the envelope and when you hear the audio recording of it and I wish to god I still had that clip you can hear in the background Loki going hey hey and she goes oh oh yeah yeah and Orange Launch Radio and we all sat there going well we know we didn't fucking win drink

01:38:58.777 --> 01:39:00.138
[SPEAKER_11]: I was quite drunk that night.

01:39:00.578 --> 01:39:04.460
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was when they did the bingo thing and I won speakers.

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.060
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.402
[SPEAKER_06]: So we may not have walked out of there with a plastic award, but we did walk out of there with speakers.

01:39:09.442 --> 01:39:10.423
[SPEAKER_06]: You walked out of there with speakers.

01:39:10.463 --> 01:39:11.203
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get shit.

01:39:12.064 --> 01:39:13.665
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some cool pictures out on the patio.

01:39:13.705 --> 01:39:14.165
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I got.

01:39:14.185 --> 01:39:15.686
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a bunch of sampler CDs.

01:39:16.106 --> 01:39:16.366
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:39:16.946 --> 01:39:17.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

01:39:17.707 --> 01:39:19.808
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one other topic I want to talk about before Rapid Fire News.

01:39:19.848 --> 01:39:22.169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game I left out of my gaming week, but it's worth mentioning.

01:39:23.476 --> 01:39:24.616
[SPEAKER_06]: iPhone game, believe it or not.

01:39:25.857 --> 01:39:27.517
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a pretty damn good iPhone game.

01:39:27.577 --> 01:39:33.198
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 99 cents right now on the marketplace, which is a really good deal for the Midway Arcade Classics Collection.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:36.519
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it's another one of those retro game collections on the iPhone.

01:39:36.559 --> 01:39:40.460
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got to say, though, they do a pretty damn good job of it, especially for 99 cents.

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:45.421
[SPEAKER_06]: It does a little bit of the, you know, hey, do you want to play Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2?

01:39:46.041 --> 01:39:48.882
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then you pay 99 cents for this pack, right?

01:39:48.982 --> 01:40:07.351
[SPEAKER_06]: but actually you can also unlock those machines if you play the others for a god awful long time you save up tickets and you can unlock the cabinets that way or you just pay 99 cents to unlock them right away which is kind of interesting they did it that way but what I really thought was interesting about it is that there's not just the classic arcade games in it but there's

01:40:08.712 --> 01:40:24.891
[SPEAKER_06]: air hockey and uh... skeeball and the basketball little games you find in an arcade like they really went kind of a step beyond in making it that whole arcade experience now don't get too excited it's an IOS game and I still cannot stand

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:28.134
[SPEAKER_06]: IOS controls, like trying to emulate the old school arcade games.

01:40:28.495 --> 01:40:31.257
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of them that have the limited mobility work pretty well.

01:40:31.317 --> 01:40:33.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in Joust, you could only go left or right.

01:40:33.999 --> 01:40:35.941
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hard to screw up with the touch controls.

01:40:36.001 --> 01:40:37.122
[SPEAKER_06]: So it controls alright.

01:40:37.522 --> 01:40:39.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Spy Hunter, they do this weird thing with the tilt controls.

01:40:39.684 --> 01:40:42.406
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I'm a fan, but it is what it is.

01:40:43.227 --> 01:40:43.547
[SPEAKER_06]: 99 cents.

01:40:44.128 --> 01:40:44.888
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was thinking...

01:40:45.769 --> 01:40:45.829
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:40:45.869 --> 01:40:46.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell no.

01:41:01.008 --> 01:41:02.049
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what's up with that?

01:41:02.429 --> 01:41:05.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it the games are only bargain cheap on iOS?

01:41:05.911 --> 01:41:12.414
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this really... Competition, because they allow them to price their games the way they are.

01:41:13.395 --> 01:41:14.856
[SPEAKER_14]: These other platforms have minimums.

01:41:14.916 --> 01:41:17.217
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you can't price your game lower than such.

01:41:17.797 --> 01:41:24.421
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of that, that's why you don't get a lot of 99... Well, that's why you don't get any 99 cent games on these marketplaces.

01:41:24.841 --> 01:41:28.643
[SPEAKER_14]: If it was more open and allowed them to do that kind of thing, then yeah, you would have a lot more of those.

01:41:28.863 --> 01:41:49.598
[SPEAKER_06]: I still even think for like $4.99 on the 3DS shop this would be a hell of a download with all the stuff that it includes but I just I don't see it happening and it's so odd like this game would be so much better with the tangible controls but like they'll probably put it on a cartridge for $19.99 if they even do that you know I don't know they'll say the 3D costs money

01:41:49.818 --> 01:42:16.463
[SPEAKER_06]: it's old arcade games I don't know again I'm hypothesizing but I just I really wish when I play some of these really good iOS games I'm always like damn it why can't this be on the Vita or the Vita would be amazing really with that crisp screen and it's already kind of the oh man it would look great some of those games but I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna hold my breath because I know it ain't gonna happen but I just imagine imagine I could tilt my Vita sideways and use the analog stick to control Spy Hunter it would be great

01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:25.469
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it's not going to happen I'm sorry, I was distracted by everyone telling me that Capcom should hire me

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:28.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Waited to derail.

01:42:29.382 --> 01:42:29.662
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:42:30.803 --> 01:42:31.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten years of derailment.

01:42:32.225 --> 01:42:34.467
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a promise, though.

01:42:35.188 --> 01:42:43.338
[SPEAKER_11]: If Capcom hires me, I will make manuals that are available for print and PDF, web-friendly PDF, that have working links.

01:42:44.319 --> 01:42:44.860
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for Bobby.

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:45.681
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be spelled right.

01:42:45.981 --> 01:42:46.942
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will be spelled right.

01:42:47.062 --> 01:42:47.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:42:47.723 --> 01:42:48.003
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:42:48.684 --> 01:42:49.925
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about some rapid-fire news.

01:42:50.005 --> 01:42:54.148
[SPEAKER_06]: I've babbled long enough about various side topics, so let's get to some rapid-fire news.

01:42:54.848 --> 01:43:00.112
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's talk a little bit about Ridge Racer.

01:43:00.833 --> 01:43:05.376
[SPEAKER_14]: Ridge Racer, a game that was supposed to be launching with the Vita, kind of didn't.

01:43:05.576 --> 01:43:14.082
[SPEAKER_14]: It got delayed a little bit, and I had hoped, hey, maybe they'll put out a full game instead of five cars and three tracks.

01:43:17.384 --> 01:43:17.825
[SPEAKER_14]: Not so much.

01:43:18.145 --> 01:43:21.286
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, Ridge Racer is coming to the Vita March 19th.

01:43:21.386 --> 01:43:42.717
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be some DLC, free DLC, included with, I guess, if you purchase the initial retail copies will include the Ridge Racer Gold Pass, which allows you to get five additional cars and three bonus tracks and two new songs and an extended remix of an existing song.

01:43:43.858 --> 01:43:43.938
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

01:43:46.062 --> 01:43:54.669
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently, also, I guess you can purchase the game on the PlayStation Network store for, you know, the 10% cheaper, $24.99 as well.

01:43:55.469 --> 01:43:57.231
[SPEAKER_14]: And it also includes the Gold Pass stuff.

01:43:57.611 --> 01:44:07.218
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, I guess, if you purchase before April 30th, an additional Silver Pass DLC pack will be available as well.

01:44:07.358 --> 01:44:09.080
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't announced the price for it yet.

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:20.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, aside from DLC, they're going to have, I guess, a system update which includes better frame rate, better graphics, and that's about it.

01:44:21.452 --> 01:44:24.274
[SPEAKER_14]: But, I mean, come on.

01:44:24.535 --> 01:44:24.975
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

01:44:25.556 --> 01:44:25.956
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

01:44:26.156 --> 01:44:30.280
[SPEAKER_14]: Your free DLC is three more or five more cars?

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.743
[SPEAKER_14]: You're literally doubling the cars and tracks in the game?

01:44:33.563 --> 01:44:59.377
[SPEAKER_14]: and you were you know that would be a pretty awesome deal in any air racing game 10 cars and six tracks I mean come on I remember back with Ridge Racer 4 where it was fucking like 200 cars in the goddamn game and tracks I don't even know I mean a lot of them were just you know deviations of one another but I mean come on that few tracks for if you were putting the game out for free

01:45:00.003 --> 01:45:00.644
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, fine.

01:45:01.085 --> 01:45:01.525
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

01:45:01.545 --> 01:45:04.950
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good starter pack, and I'll buy DLC for it and get some additional cars.

01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.170
[SPEAKER_14]: But $30?

01:45:05.771 --> 01:45:08.294
[SPEAKER_14]: That's ridiculous.

01:45:08.795 --> 01:45:11.538
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not impressed with Namco's approach to this stuff.

01:45:12.059 --> 01:45:14.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's the whole IOS.

01:45:14.542 --> 01:45:17.065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taking the IOS mentality now and putting it on the Vita.

01:45:17.766 --> 01:45:18.466
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just weird.

01:45:19.546 --> 01:45:21.607
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope people educate themselves.

01:45:22.247 --> 01:45:24.428
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be a big fucking Ridge Racer fan to want to buy this.

01:45:24.908 --> 01:45:26.788
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's something to educate yourselves on.

01:45:27.468 --> 01:45:29.349
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wait for the price to drop.

01:45:29.809 --> 01:45:39.351
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if it's something like this, people are going to bring in new copies, and they're not going to sell, and they're going to be sitting on shelves, and it'll drop in price, and then you get that DLC on top of it.

01:45:39.571 --> 01:45:41.151
[SPEAKER_06]: A comment from Derek H in our chatroom.

01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:43.732
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're admitting the graphics are crapped in the first version.

01:45:44.132 --> 01:45:47.593
[SPEAKER_06]: That is kind of a weird thing for them to say this in advance.

01:45:47.613 --> 01:45:49.233
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, crisper graphics.

01:45:50.654 --> 01:45:53.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of one of those things they should have kept a secret until it comes out, you know?

01:45:54.355 --> 01:45:55.255
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:45:55.595 --> 01:46:02.757
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe it's some depth of field adjustments or something like that, but... Ahamkara in our chatroom says, Ridge failure!

01:46:04.164 --> 01:46:06.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Outlook Not Good Yeah, it's unfortunate

01:46:25.765 --> 01:46:26.966
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

01:46:43.699 --> 01:46:45.000
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't think that's the case in this.

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:48.963
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's just like, hey, we're just going to sell a bunch of DLC.

01:46:49.043 --> 01:46:49.923
[SPEAKER_14]: Cha-ching!

01:46:49.943 --> 01:46:52.385
[SPEAKER_14]: That's... I don't know.

01:46:52.765 --> 01:46:53.506
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to happen.

01:46:53.806 --> 01:46:58.349
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and of course, are they going to advertise to their fans that this game is going to be that gimped?

01:46:58.469 --> 01:46:58.929
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not.

01:46:59.049 --> 01:47:01.551
[SPEAKER_14]: It's up for the blogs to let people know about that.

01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:03.172
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, anyways, enough of that.

01:47:03.592 --> 01:47:07.595
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's talk a little bit about a rumored sequel to a franchise.

01:47:07.815 --> 01:47:10.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Army of Four has apparently been outed by a...

01:47:13.439 --> 01:47:32.598
[SPEAKER_14]: I love this Twitter post actually apparently there is a guy who was I believe one of the actors on Stargate Atlantis John Shepard or Joe Flanagan he plays a guy named John Shepard on Stargate Atlantis

01:47:33.319 --> 01:47:42.288
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently he's been asked to do some, I guess, voice work on the, well, it says AO4 video game for electronic cars.

01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:44.551
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, duh, it's going to be Army of Four.

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:47.955
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's, it only makes sense that that's what it's going to be.

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:50.638
[SPEAKER_14]: So, kind of neat.

01:47:51.318 --> 01:47:53.481
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe something we'll see announced at E3.

01:47:55.322 --> 01:48:00.785
[SPEAKER_14]: And last but not least, there was tons and tons and tons of leaks before finally it being officially announced.

01:48:00.825 --> 01:48:08.348
[SPEAKER_14]: Assassin's Creed 3 will be coming to consoles and PC this October on the 30th.

01:48:08.488 --> 01:48:11.790
[SPEAKER_14]: The new game is going to take place during the American Revolution.

01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:19.253
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to play a guy who looks to be Native American and of course having tomahawks and all sorts of cool stuff.

01:48:20.133 --> 01:48:20.294
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

01:48:22.256 --> 01:48:31.393
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess there's going to be some more info coming in the new Game Informer it's the April cover game but definitely a big franchise

01:48:32.236 --> 01:48:34.218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was hearing a lot of rumblings about that.

01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:40.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like some of the Assassin's Creed fans aren't really... I mean, I don't... Like Uncharted, it's a series I haven't really had time to play.

01:48:41.946 --> 01:48:44.969
[SPEAKER_06]: But about five years after the first game, I'll finally get around to it.

01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:49.613
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like a lot of fans I know on Facebook are kind of cautious about the direction this game is taking.

01:48:49.954 --> 01:48:53.077
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some people are like, yeah, I knew it would be like a Revolutionary War type of game.

01:48:53.117 --> 01:48:56.100
[SPEAKER_06]: And some are like, I'm not sure how I feel about this direction.

01:48:58.194 --> 01:48:58.514
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:48:58.795 --> 01:48:59.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see.

01:48:59.536 --> 01:49:01.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess at the end of the day, how good is the game?

01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:02.843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the important thing, right?

01:49:02.863 --> 01:49:03.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

01:49:03.704 --> 01:49:06.009
[SPEAKER_06]: He could be in space as long as the game is good.

01:49:06.049 --> 01:49:07.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed in space!

01:49:09.744 --> 01:49:13.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassins in Space Connect Enabled Shopping Carts Connect Enabled Shopping Carts

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the cart can see your membership card.

01:49:33.041 --> 01:49:34.301
[SPEAKER_06]: It will pull up your shopping list.

01:49:34.341 --> 01:49:36.782
[SPEAKER_06]: It will scan objects as you place them in the cart.

01:49:37.202 --> 01:49:40.503
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess the cart will actually follow you around the store.

01:49:41.304 --> 01:49:43.104
[SPEAKER_06]: So like while you're walking, it will follow you.

01:49:43.164 --> 01:49:44.305
[SPEAKER_06]: This is fucking Skynet right here.

01:49:44.325 --> 01:49:45.585
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to go to the bathroom.

01:49:47.366 --> 01:49:51.467
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not going to fit in the stall.

01:49:52.747 --> 01:49:54.188
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop writing it to me, damn it.

01:49:58.615 --> 01:49:59.735
[SPEAKER_06]: The Old Homeless Ladies

01:50:23.067 --> 01:50:27.229
[SPEAKER_11]: My farts are organic and smell... What?

01:50:27.369 --> 01:50:38.953
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right along those lines, actually, apparently in the video it talks about the spokesperson puts the wrong type of spaghetti in the cart and the cart warns him, you're trying to go gluten-free.

01:50:40.583 --> 01:50:42.185
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, you're a pansy.

01:50:43.927 --> 01:50:44.748
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't not look.

01:50:44.808 --> 01:50:46.430
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't not diet.

01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:52.196
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have friends who have celiac disease, and it's serious business.

01:50:52.216 --> 01:50:53.137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a serious, I know, I know.

01:50:53.157 --> 01:50:54.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but I don't think that guy does.

01:50:54.258 --> 01:50:54.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

01:50:54.799 --> 01:50:56.120
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people do it to be trendy.

01:50:56.621 --> 01:51:02.107
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, to be honest, a guy that's walking around with a Kinect-enabled shopping cart is probably doing it to be trendy.

01:51:04.255 --> 01:51:05.056
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:51:22.731 --> 01:51:23.932
[SPEAKER_06]: and you could actually look up items.

01:51:23.952 --> 01:51:25.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was kind of ahead of its time.

01:51:25.152 --> 01:51:29.074
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool and doesn't look ridiculous like having a Kinect camera strapped to a shopping cart.

01:51:29.094 --> 01:51:30.895
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it's following you around the store.

01:51:30.915 --> 01:51:31.835
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

01:51:32.775 --> 01:51:36.637
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the setup for like a really bad 3D horror movie.

01:51:36.717 --> 01:51:38.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, which by the way, Piranha 3DD.

01:51:39.458 --> 01:51:41.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my fucking God, that looks amazing.

01:51:41.559 --> 01:51:46.061
[SPEAKER_06]: But this could be like a great shopping cart 3D horror movie.

01:51:46.381 --> 01:51:49.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the day the shopping carts took over with Christopher Lloyd and...

01:51:50.191 --> 01:51:52.540
[SPEAKER_14]: All I gotta say is hobos are gonna go high tech now.

01:51:54.594 --> 01:51:58.575
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the homeless is like, fuck, I got Kinect and a TV.

01:51:59.075 --> 01:52:02.596
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Kid Icarus Uprising, of course, a big game coming out on the 3DS soon.

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:06.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Your copy will come with six AR cards, but here's the thing.

01:52:06.457 --> 01:52:09.818
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually going to be hundreds of AR cards available.

01:52:10.158 --> 01:52:14.359
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be events where you can kind of trade and get new cards and this whole thing.

01:52:14.419 --> 01:52:22.181
[SPEAKER_06]: So an interesting kind of real-life card Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh magic type of eye of judgment.

01:52:22.541 --> 01:52:22.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh!

01:52:24.338 --> 01:52:25.038
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, what?

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:26.499
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:52:27.179 --> 01:52:30.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what it adds to the game or if it's just something stupid.

01:52:31.021 --> 01:52:36.623
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently the cards can face each other and the AR figures will battle.

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:39.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the fuck did I hear this before?

01:52:39.264 --> 01:52:42.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did we raz this a million times over?

01:52:42.405 --> 01:52:44.026
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds so familiar.

01:52:44.126 --> 01:52:46.587
[SPEAKER_06]: The cards come to life.

01:52:47.087 --> 01:52:48.308
[SPEAKER_06]: And they battle.

01:52:48.908 --> 01:52:53.310
[SPEAKER_06]: And they do things that you can't just do with the cards on the table.

01:52:53.610 --> 01:52:54.171
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:53:11.723 --> 01:53:16.086
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, SSJ100Matt says he's still waiting for Supermarket Sweep the game.

01:53:16.626 --> 01:53:22.390
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I have a bad feeling that that Kid Icarus game is just gonna tank.

01:53:23.191 --> 01:53:24.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Gonna tank so bad.

01:53:25.392 --> 01:53:26.193
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know why?

01:53:26.473 --> 01:53:30.015
[SPEAKER_14]: Because no one gives a damn about Kid Icarus.

01:53:30.235 --> 01:53:30.976
[SPEAKER_06]: You shut your mouth.

01:53:31.016 --> 01:53:31.636
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, hey, hey.

01:53:32.236 --> 01:53:36.739
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I know that the hardcore gamer cares about Kid Icarus, but that's not who they're targeting.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.101
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Kid Icarus is basically...

01:53:41.363 --> 01:53:45.266
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's fucking... Oh, I don't know.

01:53:46.547 --> 01:53:49.229
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a hardcore shmup game and no one's going to give a damn.

01:53:49.649 --> 01:53:51.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you imagine a Kid Icarus bullet hell game?

01:53:52.031 --> 01:53:56.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we now know their similarities, would you care to make a wager on if Kid Icarus will sell a million copies?

01:53:57.235 --> 01:53:59.016
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I do not care to wager that.

01:54:00.237 --> 01:54:00.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I tried.

01:54:00.918 --> 01:54:02.859
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that doesn't have any additional peripherals.

01:54:02.979 --> 01:54:06.983
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not going to bet whether the cards are going to sell a million copies because there's no way to track that.

01:54:08.924 --> 01:54:09.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still buying it.

01:54:11.291 --> 01:54:12.712
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta, look, there's a little bit of a delay.

01:54:12.952 --> 01:54:14.112
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, and here's the thing too.

01:54:15.112 --> 01:54:21.775
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would I go buy cards when I can simply download the images of cards and print them out for free?

01:54:22.075 --> 01:54:26.776
[SPEAKER_14]: So fuck you, I ain't buying no fucking cards for your stupid game.

01:54:27.677 --> 01:54:29.197
[SPEAKER_14]: And also not your game because I don't have a 3DS anymore.

01:54:29.217 --> 01:54:34.479
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if there's like a rare one in a glass case at the Nintendo World Store and it's the only place where you can get the Eggplant Wizard...

01:54:34.739 --> 01:54:36.941
[SPEAKER_14]: If only we had a camera with us.

01:54:37.301 --> 01:54:41.144
[SPEAKER_14]: If only some sort of device that I was carrying had a camera on it.

01:54:41.544 --> 01:54:48.870
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, maybe a phone or an MP3 player or perhaps a game console, a portable game console.

01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.112
[SPEAKER_14]: If only one of those had a camera on it.

01:54:51.312 --> 01:54:58.757
[SPEAKER_14]: But goddammit, I live in an age where cameras are only available in camera form and not in any other peripheral whatsoever.

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:00.619
[SPEAKER_11]: I see DDR Dollar Bill liked my idea.

01:55:02.605 --> 01:55:17.694
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta read this comment, it's on the last story, but it's too good Actdeft in our chatroom says, chopping cart, grocery shopping will never be the same As long as it's in 3D with titties Have you seen the Piranha 3DD trailer?

01:55:17.894 --> 01:55:22.097
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, come on, it's Piranha 3DD Have you seen it?

01:55:22.737 --> 01:55:25.359
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen it DarkSakura, have you seen it?

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:26.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I care?

01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.341
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm derailing the fucking show, I don't even care

01:55:28.761 --> 01:55:29.021
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:55:29.441 --> 01:55:29.581
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:30.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I care.

01:55:30.142 --> 01:55:30.702
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to see this.

01:55:30.742 --> 01:55:31.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember.

01:55:31.562 --> 01:55:32.742
[SPEAKER_06]: I have temporary amnesia.

01:55:32.762 --> 01:55:37.704
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the most amazing fucking movie trailer I have ever seen in my entire life and it is worth derailing the show.

01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:40.065
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the only movie I give a crap about is The Avengers.

01:55:41.065 --> 01:55:41.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Hawkeye.

01:55:41.866 --> 01:55:42.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

01:55:42.426 --> 01:55:43.386
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DD official trailer.

01:55:43.406 --> 01:55:44.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Hawkeye.

01:55:44.086 --> 01:55:45.527
[SPEAKER_06]: This movie looks fucking amazing.

01:55:46.707 --> 01:55:49.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they should make a video game out of it.

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:50.509
[SPEAKER_06]: There, I've tied it back to the show.

01:55:51.269 --> 01:55:55.810
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world's wildest water park, the party has never been hotter.

01:55:56.791 --> 01:55:57.431
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.

01:55:58.312 --> 01:56:01.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me you did not replace our old life cards with strippers.

01:56:01.395 --> 01:56:02.817
[SPEAKER_00]: Water certified strippers.

01:56:05.099 --> 01:56:05.400
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

01:56:06.041 --> 01:56:11.046
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guests have never been hungrier.

01:56:12.167 --> 01:56:13.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Mommy, I got bit.

01:56:13.889 --> 01:56:14.590
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a prince.

01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:15.792
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not a piranha.

01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:24.100
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Christopher Lloyd?

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.581
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yes, it's Christopher Lloyd.

01:56:25.741 --> 01:56:26.781
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have to see this now.

01:56:27.141 --> 01:56:28.181
[SPEAKER_00]: How the mighty have fallen.

01:56:28.441 --> 01:56:28.801
Ow!

01:56:28.921 --> 01:56:29.862
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, I don't like it.

01:56:29.942 --> 01:56:31.562
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, the most famous

01:56:48.347 --> 01:56:54.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when you thought it was safe to put your 3D glasses back on.

01:56:54.272 --> 01:56:58.136
First of all, I'm not a lifeguard.

01:56:58.156 --> 01:56:58.616
Never was.

01:57:12.452 --> 01:57:15.113
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, that is what natural selection is all about.

01:57:16.393 --> 01:57:18.113
[SPEAKER_00]: It's double the action.

01:57:18.173 --> 01:57:21.874
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do to them?

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:22.934
[SPEAKER_00]: Double the terror.

01:57:26.095 --> 01:57:27.595
[SPEAKER_00]: And double the D's.

01:57:28.315 --> 01:57:28.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh lord.

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:31.956
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring me my legs.

01:57:32.976 --> 01:57:34.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

01:57:34.636 --> 01:57:35.857
[SPEAKER_06]: With shotgun legs.

01:57:39.277 --> 01:57:40.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, yeah, that's right.

01:57:40.558 --> 01:57:41.158
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why.

01:57:41.398 --> 01:57:42.298
[SPEAKER_14]: That trailer's sicker.

01:57:45.165 --> 01:57:49.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Piranha in the tub How stupid does that look?

01:57:49.988 --> 01:58:11.080
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait I don't even like gory movies and I'll see that just because it looks so horribly stupid Bring me my legs I'm sorry, Christopher Lloyd can't even redeem that to me Orange Launch Radio Road Trip Hawkeye Avengers Hawkeye I hope that opens up against Avengers I'll camp out 48 hours in advance for that

01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:14.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not hating on Avengers, I swear.

01:58:14.544 --> 01:58:14.944
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know.

01:58:15.884 --> 01:58:16.144
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:58:17.425 --> 01:58:18.905
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to root for the underdog.

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:19.646
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

01:58:20.246 --> 01:58:20.446
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:21.046
[SPEAKER_14]: Underfish.

01:58:22.166 --> 01:58:22.707
[SPEAKER_06]: Ving Rhames.

01:58:23.007 --> 01:58:29.149
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I remember when Rose McGowan had the shotgun leg, but Ving Rhames, I think, is a much sexier babe with that shotgun leg.

01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.669
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:30.710
[SPEAKER_10]: Get me my legs.

01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.991
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:35.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to rapid fire news.

01:58:39.431 --> 01:58:57.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Bioshock Infinite has a release date hey it's October 16th in North America and 19th internationally I know a lot of you Bioshock fans are looking forward to Bioshock Infinite not to hate on Bioshock 2 it was a good game in its own merits but this is in some ways kind of the the true sequel to Bioshock it's just kind of a different little spinoff there

01:58:57.908 --> 01:59:15.585
[SPEAKER_06]: games coming out on 360 PC and PS3 the PS3 will have move support and come with the original Bioshock included you know just in case you missed assuming that they stick to the word unlike they did with some of the other games we'll see we'll see all right so there you go that's what I've got for rapid fire news how about you DarkSakura

01:59:16.984 --> 01:59:17.445
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:59:17.926 --> 01:59:20.550
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a rumor that I've mentioned before.

01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:27.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Darkstalkers 4 may potentially be happening and the theory is that Yoshinori Ono is behind it.

01:59:27.842 --> 01:59:28.082
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:59:30.806 --> 01:59:31.607
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:59:55.403 --> 02:00:22.867
[SPEAKER_11]: also Jet Set Radio is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade PSN and PC this summer and Sega's going to have a graffiti contest so they didn't really say if you're going to be able to import your own graffiti images but they're having a contest that is available at Sega.com slash JSR contest where you can put in your designs and last but never least Street Fighter they're doing a Street Fighter Monopoly game the end

02:00:25.054 --> 02:00:27.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the fighters the pieces or the properties?

02:00:28.877 --> 02:00:34.822
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that they're the pieces and that, like, you fight for India or Japan or USA.

02:00:34.862 --> 02:00:39.886
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess I shouldn't say properties because you don't really buy and sell people, but maybe, like, buy your team.

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:44.370
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're contracting them to join your super fighting squad or whatever.

02:00:46.712 --> 02:00:47.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Kylie Minowas Cammy?

02:00:48.594 --> 02:00:49.214
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hot.

02:00:49.755 --> 02:00:50.115
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

02:00:50.355 --> 02:00:51.276
[SPEAKER_11]: She didn't make a good Cammy.

02:00:52.702 --> 02:00:56.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I see Cammy, her voice is Kylie Minogue.

02:00:56.603 --> 02:00:56.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:00:57.143 --> 02:00:58.483
[SPEAKER_06]: Right after Covert Action.

02:00:58.543 --> 02:00:59.383
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that bad.

02:00:59.423 --> 02:01:00.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Will be Street Fighter 2, the movie.

02:01:00.944 --> 02:01:01.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of underrated.

02:01:02.664 --> 02:01:04.064
[SPEAKER_11]: You know Dan went and bought that on Blu-ray.

02:01:04.665 --> 02:01:04.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

02:01:04.985 --> 02:01:06.025
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it for Alan.

02:01:06.405 --> 02:01:08.165
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first gift I ever bought him.

02:01:08.205 --> 02:01:09.606
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I saw that twice in the theater.

02:01:10.126 --> 02:01:10.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you really?

02:01:10.706 --> 02:01:11.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

02:01:11.086 --> 02:01:11.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it once.

02:01:11.846 --> 02:01:12.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, is it the cheapo theater?

02:01:12.826 --> 02:01:13.246
[SPEAKER_06]: It was enough.

02:01:13.546 --> 02:01:17.547
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad took me to see it because I was only like 11 or 12 when it came out.

02:01:17.567 --> 02:01:19.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I saw it the second time at the cheapo theater or something.

02:01:19.808 --> 02:01:20.488
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:01:21.704 --> 02:01:23.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, new segment on OLR.

02:01:23.367 --> 02:01:24.008
[SPEAKER_06]: How exciting.

02:01:24.028 --> 02:01:25.049
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for a new segment?

02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:26.251
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try something new here.

02:01:26.311 --> 02:01:28.955
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a segment ripped off of Horde House a little bit.

02:01:29.015 --> 02:01:29.797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worked well over there.

02:01:29.837 --> 02:01:30.658
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're bringing it over here.

02:01:30.698 --> 02:01:33.002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new segment called the Fugle Question of the Week.

02:01:40.356 --> 02:01:43.998
[SPEAKER_06]: A little song to sashay to as we go to Facebook and Google+.

02:01:44.018 --> 02:01:46.040
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of my favorite songs to play in Beatmania.

02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:46.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Fugle.

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.841
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I made a good theme music here.

02:01:48.862 --> 02:01:49.382
[SPEAKER_06]: So Fugle.

02:01:49.422 --> 02:01:51.443
[SPEAKER_06]: You put Facebook and Google together, you get Fugle.

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:53.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our Fugle question of the week.

02:01:53.545 --> 02:01:54.105
[SPEAKER_11]: A portmanteau.

02:01:55.186 --> 02:01:55.366
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:01:55.546 --> 02:01:57.447
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what a combination of two words is called, a portmanteau.

02:01:57.687 --> 02:01:58.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

02:01:58.248 --> 02:01:59.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Fugle portmanteau.

02:01:59.709 --> 02:02:00.429
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like a wine thing.

02:02:00.529 --> 02:02:03.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, our Facebook and Google Plus question of the week.

02:02:03.652 --> 02:02:06.055
[SPEAKER_06]: We post these the day of the show and get your questions.

02:02:06.495 --> 02:02:09.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google Plus.

02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:13.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio because there's no custom URLs on Google Plus yet.

02:02:13.964 --> 02:02:19.610
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll post the question in both places and look for your answers or read some of our favorites on the show and talk about this topic.

02:02:20.591 --> 02:02:22.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our very first Fugle question of the week.

02:02:23.735 --> 02:02:24.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:42.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Massive hype behind Mass Effect 3.

02:02:42.431 --> 02:02:44.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs?

02:02:45.032 --> 02:02:48.334
[SPEAKER_06]: The way they do storytelling and how they use conversation trees in their games.

02:02:48.374 --> 02:02:51.855
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest, I haven't played many of them.

02:02:51.935 --> 02:02:52.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon Age, right?

02:02:52.956 --> 02:02:54.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I played some of Dragon Age.

02:02:54.676 --> 02:02:55.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon Age 2.

02:02:56.417 --> 02:03:01.419
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was interesting for leading to a different game experience each time.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.300
[SPEAKER_11]: But really...

02:03:06.337 --> 02:03:08.038
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I can't say I dislike it.

02:03:08.698 --> 02:03:09.859
[SPEAKER_11]: I really can't say I dislike it.

02:03:10.199 --> 02:03:10.839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just different.

02:03:11.739 --> 02:03:12.440
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Loki?

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.641
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I kind of stopped playing Mass Effect.

02:03:17.582 --> 02:03:19.663
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even really get very far in the first game.

02:03:19.723 --> 02:03:20.903
[SPEAKER_14]: It just wasn't for me.

02:03:21.403 --> 02:03:27.886
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that the whole dialogue trees or anything were... I wasn't against that because I like adventure games and they had dialogue trees.

02:03:27.986 --> 02:03:29.507
[SPEAKER_14]: So, why wouldn't I?

02:03:31.047 --> 02:03:31.227
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

02:03:32.924 --> 02:03:33.305
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:03:33.466 --> 02:03:35.591
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I mean, the style's fine.

02:03:35.691 --> 02:03:37.335
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that's really anything holding me back.

02:03:37.435 --> 02:03:38.237
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just time.

02:03:39.827 --> 02:03:46.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for me, those games are huge time sinks, and when you're trying to juggle MMOs and other games, it's a big investment to get into those games.

02:03:47.233 --> 02:03:57.680
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play a little bit of Dragon Age, and especially, I will say this, SWTOR was really one that I invested a lot of time in, and I gotta say, the whole conversation tree aspect of the game kept me engaged in a way that WoW doesn't.

02:03:58.021 --> 02:04:03.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I love WoW, but I'm not really a lore fiend, and it's not that it's a bad story, it's just one that I tend to skip...

02:04:04.045 --> 02:04:04.805
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:28.914
[SPEAKER_06]: The way the story was told was great, and I can see why people get so into Mass Effect and stuff.

02:04:29.614 --> 02:04:33.797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a series I've got to get into at some point, but again, it's a huge time sink.

02:04:33.817 --> 02:04:35.258
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I make it sound like I play nothing.

02:04:35.318 --> 02:04:36.339
[SPEAKER_06]: I've missed all these big games.

02:04:36.359 --> 02:04:37.619
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear I play a lot of the big games.

02:04:37.639 --> 02:04:40.762
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just somehow I missed all the ones we're talking about tonight.

02:04:41.142 --> 02:04:47.266
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of like how you have set lore for a while, even though they've been trying to retcon it, but...

02:04:50.339 --> 02:04:50.879
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.842
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always like, what?

02:04:53.022 --> 02:04:53.903
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a story.

02:04:54.484 --> 02:05:00.332
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if I want a game that's going to give me the option, then I will play it specifically for that.

02:05:00.792 --> 02:05:05.559
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the most part, I like it when they've given me a story and playing it is like reading a book.

02:05:06.479 --> 02:05:12.343
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's read some of the answers from our Facebook and Google, or our foogle, because it is a show where every gamer has a voice.

02:05:12.363 --> 02:05:13.064
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with Zether.

02:05:26.494 --> 02:05:37.259
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love the environment and gameplay in the first Mass Effect game, knowing that the third game, which I may never play because of Origin, may be terrible story-wise is pushing me towards the not-sure-if-like side.

02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:38.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.081
[SPEAKER_06]: That Origin enhancement really turning people off.

02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:52.727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be curious for Zether why he wouldn't just pick it up on a console then where he doesn't have to worry about Origin, but maybe the quality thing is... Well, yeah, with consoles you still have to do the EA server thing.

02:05:53.087 --> 02:05:53.967
[SPEAKER_14]: Derek H responds, I'm not.

02:05:54.467 --> 02:05:59.669
[SPEAKER_14]: Because one, if I'm trying to save the universe, why can I only take two people with me when I have a ship full of marines?

02:05:59.689 --> 02:06:03.830
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, it's become a glorified virtual girlfriend simulation.

02:06:03.850 --> 02:06:04.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And three, I just don't like RPGs.

02:06:22.515 --> 02:06:33.103
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting that Derek kind of brings up that the whole lovemaking scenes have kind of taken over what the rest of the game is really supposed to be about because it does seem like whenever one of these games come out it's all about who can you fuck?

02:06:34.885 --> 02:06:35.805
[SPEAKER_14]: Now it's male-male.

02:06:35.885 --> 02:06:38.928
[SPEAKER_06]: It is male-male and apparently the scene is only so-so.

02:06:39.208 --> 02:06:39.868
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really boring.

02:06:40.889 --> 02:06:45.213
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some pretty hot chick stuff in Dragon Age.

02:06:45.893 --> 02:06:48.055
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want the boobies it's all about The Witcher 2, okay?

02:06:48.415 --> 02:06:49.296
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be out in April.

02:06:50.096 --> 02:06:52.218
[SPEAKER_14]: That's got some hardcore stuff in there.

02:06:52.358 --> 02:06:57.360
[SPEAKER_06]: And Derek does bring up an interesting point where, you know, for being such an open-ended game, it's not that open-ended.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.761
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's kind of what I read between the lines on the first bullet point.

02:07:00.781 --> 02:07:02.042
[SPEAKER_06]: So interesting thoughts there.

02:07:02.822 --> 02:07:03.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:07.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to Thomas B. Bioware games are pretty good, especially the Mass Effect series.

02:07:07.644 --> 02:07:11.185
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that there generally are at least three paths to take in conversation.

02:07:11.465 --> 02:07:13.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Paragon, Renegade, and Paragate.

02:07:13.466 --> 02:07:18.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of RPGs are so linear that you may as well have the dialogues automatic or just show cut scenes between the fighting.

02:07:20.168 --> 02:07:32.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert W says, Mass Effect 1 was amazing, Dragon Age was great as well, then the sequels to both were hugely disappointing to me when it seemed that they had an identity crisis when it tried to appeal to everyone and forgot what the originals were.

02:07:32.534 --> 02:07:36.015
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've heard that a lot, especially about Dragon Age 2, except from DarkSakura.

02:07:36.896 --> 02:07:38.756
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, keep in mind, I didn't play the first one.

02:07:39.217 --> 02:07:39.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, okay.

02:07:40.157 --> 02:07:40.717
[SPEAKER_06]: You should go back.

02:07:40.737 --> 02:07:49.081
[SPEAKER_14]: But see, I heard Mass Effect 2 would be more appealing to me, whereas I thought the first game was a little slow and cumbersome, whereas the second one's more, I guess, like a shooter.

02:07:49.775 --> 02:07:50.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let me read two more here.

02:07:51.276 --> 02:07:54.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently this third one is like, pick your combination.

02:07:54.298 --> 02:07:54.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want more story?

02:07:54.978 --> 02:07:55.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want more shooter?

02:07:56.199 --> 02:07:58.000
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what sounds really interesting about the third one.

02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:00.421
[SPEAKER_14]: I will take shooting and boobies.

02:08:02.002 --> 02:08:03.183
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to shoot the boobies!

02:08:03.443 --> 02:08:03.783
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

02:08:03.963 --> 02:08:04.904
[SPEAKER_14]: Shooting and boobies.

02:08:05.184 --> 02:08:06.285
[SPEAKER_13]: Not combined together.

02:08:06.625 --> 02:08:09.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, topless chick shooting, I'd be fine with that.

02:08:09.747 --> 02:08:10.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't that a game?

02:08:10.727 --> 02:08:11.788
[SPEAKER_06]: Topless chick shooting.

02:08:15.384 --> 02:08:17.448
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think if that is a game.

02:08:18.029 --> 02:08:18.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, look.

02:08:19.472 --> 02:08:20.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Two more answers here.

02:08:21.155 --> 02:08:21.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Sill N.

02:08:23.671 --> 02:08:27.893
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the way that Bioware tells the stories and how I can interact with NPCs.

02:08:28.173 --> 02:08:33.635
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played Dragon Age and felt really connected to my character and her companions because of that way of conversation.

02:08:34.015 --> 02:08:37.276
[SPEAKER_06]: I skipped the Mass Effect series because I thought that sci-fi games wouldn't be for me.

02:08:37.657 --> 02:08:48.801
[SPEAKER_06]: However, after playing SWTOR and actually really loving the relationships I can get with my companions and being dragged into my character's story, I actually am tempted to pick up Mass Effect 1 and 2 secondhand for my PlayStation 3 and

02:08:49.301 --> 02:08:50.504
[SPEAKER_06]: and start playing the series.

02:08:50.845 --> 02:08:53.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it bad that I'm already pondering who to romance?

02:08:55.729 --> 02:08:59.473
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Shane from Horde House, funny enough, replies and says...

02:09:20.532 --> 02:09:49.871
[SPEAKER_06]: but in terms of storytelling and use of conversation trees Mass Effect has been spot on for two games I'm looking forward to Tuesday's release of Mass Effect 3 hardcore because of the love they put into developing their characters and world definitely not because of the way the game plays sounds to me like Shane might be more in it for the story mode as opposed to the boobies and gun mode so there you go that's our Fugle question of the week thanks you guys for applying we'll catch you next Sunday with our next Fugle question of the week meanwhile let's get back to some more news Loki

02:09:50.714 --> 02:09:57.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, let's talk a little bit about Capcom and about a game being released this week.

02:09:58.458 --> 02:09:59.598
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter X Tekken.

02:10:00.939 --> 02:10:13.825
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, there's been a lot of discussion with DLC, including, first off, that the PlayStation versions are going to have some exclusive characters with crappy box art Mega Man and Pac-Man.

02:10:14.345 --> 02:10:19.268
[SPEAKER_14]: And then on top of that, the Vita is supposed to be getting 12 characters that are exclusive to it.

02:10:20.929 --> 02:10:34.739
[SPEAKER_14]: with those characters being Alina, Guy, Cody, Sakura, Dudley, Blanca, and I guess Alisa, Christy, Jack, Brian, Lars, and Leigh.

02:10:36.581 --> 02:10:43.285
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are all, I guess, supposed to be in the Vita version in the fall.

02:10:44.707 --> 02:10:45.147
[SPEAKER_14]: However...

02:10:46.397 --> 02:10:53.659
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, they're already available on the disc as DLC.

02:10:54.259 --> 02:10:55.499
[SPEAKER_14]: They're already on the disc.

02:10:55.819 --> 02:11:03.861
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, the Pac-Man and Bad Box Art Mega Man, that's going to be released on the 13th, I believe.

02:11:05.362 --> 02:11:06.882
[SPEAKER_14]: Released next week.

02:11:09.023 --> 02:11:13.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are going to be free DLC if you have the PS3 version available.

02:11:14.444 --> 02:11:29.035
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny enough, though, those are also on the Xbox 360 disc, as some people already have those discs and have dug through and actually dumped some of the videos, the intro and ending videos from those characters, and they're on both discs.

02:11:29.816 --> 02:11:31.157
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it comes down to...

02:11:33.358 --> 02:11:33.879
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?

02:11:34.219 --> 02:11:35.560
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all paid unlock content.

02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:38.883
[SPEAKER_14]: All this shit was done way before you released the game.

02:11:39.443 --> 02:11:42.346
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually in games like this, it would be unlock characters.

02:11:42.386 --> 02:11:44.687
[SPEAKER_14]: You play well and you get some new characters.

02:11:45.148 --> 02:11:53.214
[SPEAKER_14]: But because we're in a day and age where it's fun to charge money for shit that would normally be free, then that's what they did.

02:11:53.334 --> 02:11:54.415
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the actual disc.

02:11:54.575 --> 02:11:55.896
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the best part about it, too.

02:11:56.217 --> 02:12:00.080
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually the Xbox 360 version, I believe.

02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:00.600
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

02:12:01.721 --> 02:12:03.042
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait, the one from Street Fighter 3?

02:12:21.198 --> 02:12:21.398
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

02:12:21.598 --> 02:12:22.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved her.

02:12:40.626 --> 02:12:42.048
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:13:05.511 --> 02:13:22.612
[SPEAKER_14]: and this is one of those things before it's just the perception of it it doesn't seem like it's something that was added later on but if it's something on the disc that you're under unlocking people feel entitled because they own the disc well they think they own the disc you're really licensing the disc but fuck that you own the disc

02:13:23.052 --> 02:13:26.593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and you have the data on the disc already.

02:13:27.734 --> 02:13:31.075
[SPEAKER_14]: Why aren't you being, you know, why is it being locked out?

02:13:31.175 --> 02:13:36.337
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be like if you bought a house and there's a room that's locked that you have to pay money to get the key to.

02:13:37.397 --> 02:13:38.198
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's your house.

02:13:38.318 --> 02:13:41.799
[SPEAKER_14]: You own it, but you can't access that room because too bad it's locked.

02:13:41.839 --> 02:13:46.961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic example of pay to unlock content, which Namco especially has been guilty of a lot in the past.

02:13:47.301 --> 02:13:51.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I realize that Street Fighter X Tekken is the Capcom version of the game, but they've done some of this too.

02:13:52.503 --> 02:13:53.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, yeah.

02:13:53.824 --> 02:13:54.664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's disappointing.

02:13:55.425 --> 02:13:55.925
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is.

02:13:56.165 --> 02:13:57.626
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's disappointing.

02:13:57.686 --> 02:14:06.632
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, it doesn't really... First off, the extra 12 characters that they're talking about, once I found out who they were, I was like, eh, the Vita version doesn't seem that great.

02:14:06.712 --> 02:14:09.753
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's something that, you know, that, well, they're not really exclusive.

02:14:09.794 --> 02:14:12.055
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just going to be available to everybody eventually for a price.

02:14:12.775 --> 02:14:13.956
[SPEAKER_14]: So, who knows?

02:14:14.396 --> 02:14:17.678
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the even sadder part, if you really want to look at it that way.

02:14:18.439 --> 02:14:20.300
[SPEAKER_14]: You know this is going to be up on, you know,

02:14:25.121 --> 02:14:32.323
[SPEAKER_14]: All those characters are going to be unlocked on the pirated copies the first week.

02:14:33.403 --> 02:14:36.604
[SPEAKER_06]: This just confirms for me I'm not going to buy the game when it comes out.

02:14:36.804 --> 02:14:41.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was considering getting it, even though I knew this in the back of my mind.

02:14:41.865 --> 02:14:45.966
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a year edition, best of the year edition or whatever, inevitably.

02:14:46.446 --> 02:14:56.713
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think now that the discs are already practically made that way, there's for sure going to be a year-end edition at the end of the year once all these characters are released that will include everything.

02:14:56.813 --> 02:14:58.594
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be the same disc with the key in there.

02:14:58.634 --> 02:14:59.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly right.

02:14:59.775 --> 02:15:03.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's how they don't have to press it twice and they can reuse the old copies.

02:15:04.218 --> 02:15:08.401
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's exactly the grand scheme of what's going on here and it just confirms for me, you know what, Rob, you need to wait.

02:15:09.502 --> 02:15:16.086
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wonder if there's going to be other people that are where I'm at that'll send a clear message when we don't buy this game.

02:15:16.366 --> 02:15:23.052
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that, you know, the developers will come out and they will say, well, listen, we plan to have DLC.

02:15:24.193 --> 02:15:26.315
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a problem when they always say they plan to have DLC.

02:15:26.375 --> 02:15:30.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I, you know, I understand like Bethesda, we plan to have expansions to Skyrim.

02:15:30.518 --> 02:15:33.221
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, okay, that makes sense that you're going to plan to have expansions.

02:15:33.721 --> 02:15:36.284
[SPEAKER_14]: But that fucking content was not already on the disc.

02:15:36.544 --> 02:15:37.545
[SPEAKER_14]: It was not on the disc.

02:15:37.625 --> 02:15:39.867
[SPEAKER_14]: It's stuff that's added after the fact.

02:15:40.267 --> 02:15:41.809
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be like, hey, you know what we thought?

02:15:42.369 --> 02:15:43.871
[SPEAKER_14]: These characters would be cool to have in the game.

02:15:43.891 --> 02:15:45.072
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't have time to put them in there.

02:15:45.092 --> 02:15:48.295
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to go ahead and create those characters and we're going to sell them as DLC.

02:15:48.595 --> 02:15:53.920
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember what fucking happened with, was it Jill Valentine and Shima Gareth or whatever?

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Where that was already on the disc as well with Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

02:15:57.363 --> 02:15:57.623
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:15:58.664 --> 02:16:01.286
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were like, five bucks for each fucking character?

02:16:01.766 --> 02:16:04.608
[SPEAKER_14]: Five dollars per character.

02:16:05.048 --> 02:16:10.612
[SPEAKER_14]: Capcom, never forget that they charge five dollars for those fucking characters.

02:16:10.672 --> 02:16:12.653
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that this is going to be any different?

02:16:13.053 --> 02:16:15.374
[SPEAKER_14]: Five dollars per character.

02:16:15.414 --> 02:16:15.975
[SPEAKER_14]: How much was it?

02:16:16.175 --> 02:16:17.516
[SPEAKER_14]: Five dollars per character.

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:17.516
$4.99?

02:16:17.996 --> 02:16:19.877
[SPEAKER_14]: $4.99 US dollars, $4.99 US dollars.

02:16:23.132 --> 02:16:29.535
[SPEAKER_14]: No, so I'm just saying, don't think that they won't try this shit, because they will.

02:16:29.795 --> 02:16:37.518
[SPEAKER_14]: And come on, I hope that you're smart enough to know that if this is a deal breaker for you, if these, and to be honest, they're older characters.

02:16:37.578 --> 02:16:41.779
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not like, oh my god, it's now Klonoa's in there and shit.

02:16:41.819 --> 02:16:47.441
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not anything, and that would really be the only thing that would kind of get me to be like, hey, a bunch of new characters.

02:16:47.461 --> 02:16:48.642
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on, Blanka, meh.

02:16:49.282 --> 02:16:54.105
[SPEAKER_14]: If I want to play as Blanca in a game like that, I could just play Street Fighter 4 or something like that.

02:16:55.386 --> 02:16:58.368
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to make something clear here before I get the nasty emails.

02:16:58.548 --> 02:17:02.731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, Rob, you bought Final Fantasy XIII too, and now they're putting out all this DLC for it.

02:17:03.531 --> 02:17:07.334
[SPEAKER_06]: It's inevitable that all that's going to be repackaged at the end of the year too.

02:17:07.774 --> 02:17:09.055
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two things I have to say to that.

02:17:09.335 --> 02:17:11.136
[SPEAKER_06]: One, it's actually DLC.

02:17:11.336 --> 02:17:15.139
[SPEAKER_06]: You are downloading this extra stuff, like the fights and the side content and all that.

02:17:15.539 --> 02:17:25.766
[SPEAKER_06]: and B, I have a much bigger love of role-playing games and I, unlike a lot of you, really liked Final Fantasy XIII and so I was really excited about Final Fantasy XIII too.

02:17:26.126 --> 02:17:30.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas with fighting games, I'm a little worn out on fighting games right now.

02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:36.813
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have a lot of Soul Calibur V I need to explore and some of these other fighting games I've got that I haven't played enough of.

02:17:36.853 --> 02:17:42.837
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, do I need to be the first one to own Street Fighter X Tekken when I realize that there's going to be more to come later on?

02:17:43.118 --> 02:17:44.719
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think I need to be the first to own it.

02:17:45.899 --> 02:18:13.843
[SPEAKER_14]: and so maybe it's a double standard but I think it's a question a lot of people are asking themselves and you know and you have to you can't go into this not knowing what their their MO is nowadays with these fighting games they release a fucking version of a game then they upgrade it slightly later on they'll be balancing tweaks or whatever I mean they fucking did that with Street Fighter 4 they had Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition then they had you know Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and

02:18:14.563 --> 02:18:16.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

02:18:36.599 --> 02:18:39.261
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, are you going to be missing out on the game for a while?

02:18:39.421 --> 02:18:40.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but you know what?

02:18:41.623 --> 02:18:46.127
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's such a big deal, then you need to get over the fact that you need to have stuff day one.

02:18:46.387 --> 02:18:52.452
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as you get over the fact that you need to have games day one, oh my god, your options get so much cheaper and so much better.

02:18:52.492 --> 02:18:56.595
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you're looking at games that are released like, for example, Mortal Kombat.

02:18:56.615 --> 02:19:00.298
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to get in on Mortal Kombat right now, yeah, it came out about a year ago.

02:19:00.598 --> 02:19:06.702
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can get it now for the same price, maybe even less now, with all the DLC thrown in.

02:19:06.822 --> 02:19:08.363
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saving yourself some money.

02:19:10.384 --> 02:19:13.826
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead of having to buy season passes for games.

02:19:14.026 --> 02:19:16.107
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, pre-order download content.

02:19:16.127 --> 02:19:17.828
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what a fucking season pass is.

02:19:18.448 --> 02:19:21.130
[SPEAKER_14]: They did that with Saints Row III, Gears of War.

02:19:21.170 --> 02:19:25.392
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, there's a little difference, though, between Gears of War and, like, Call of Duty Elite Service.

02:19:25.412 --> 02:19:27.093
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that, you kind of know what you're getting.

02:19:27.173 --> 02:19:27.594
[SPEAKER_14]: But Gears, or...

02:19:28.314 --> 02:19:29.195
[SPEAKER_14]: Saints Row the Third.

02:19:29.335 --> 02:19:35.539
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been cheap-ass DLC expansions with like 30 minutes of content for $7 each.

02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:36.640
[SPEAKER_14]: No thanks.

02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:37.781
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's interesting?

02:19:38.061 --> 02:19:42.644
[SPEAKER_06]: If I've counted this up correctly, there's 38 characters in Street Fighter X Tekken by default.

02:19:43.165 --> 02:19:47.508
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's an additional, what, we have 12 characters on the Vita and then five...

02:19:48.328 --> 02:19:49.770
[SPEAKER_06]: And three months from now, Ultimate Edition.

02:20:09.947 --> 02:20:17.592
[SPEAKER_06]: For real, a quarter of the game is on the disc and you're going to have to pay possibly, possibly $5 per character.

02:20:17.852 --> 02:20:19.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly, if track record is to be followed.

02:20:21.234 --> 02:20:26.318
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, let's just say that they're going to be reasonable and do two character packs, five bucks each.

02:20:27.389 --> 02:20:36.094
[SPEAKER_14]: That's still, I mean, buying all the DLC will be the price of the full re-release of the game when it comes out in the year.

02:20:37.035 --> 02:20:41.357
[SPEAKER_14]: Or less because, you know, look at Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom.

02:20:41.658 --> 02:20:43.559
[SPEAKER_14]: That only came out about nine months later.

02:20:44.119 --> 02:20:48.442
[SPEAKER_14]: February was, or I believe it was February that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was released.

02:20:48.502 --> 02:20:52.104
[SPEAKER_14]: November was when the sequel came out, or the upgrade came out.

02:20:52.384 --> 02:20:53.004
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:57.186
[SPEAKER_14]: To be fair, with Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, at least they added something to that.

02:20:57.666 --> 02:21:00.547
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the DLC characters were thrown in, and a whole lot more.

02:21:00.827 --> 02:21:04.828
[SPEAKER_14]: Which made it kind of sting even more for the people who bought the original Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

02:21:06.589 --> 02:21:15.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, to be fair, there could be another element that is included with the unlock that is actually downloaded.

02:21:15.132 --> 02:21:15.812
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.

02:21:16.432 --> 02:21:20.034
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know it's Snowball's chance in hell, but we don't know.

02:21:20.234 --> 02:21:20.914
[SPEAKER_06]: It could happen.

02:21:21.394 --> 02:21:40.431
[SPEAKER_14]: That could enrich what we're assuming is the straight up unlock And that's not where it ends If you think about it, remember they have this whole gem system now And they're going to be selling those gem cards or whatever That's Cha-ching, show me the money I hate that our console games are turning into

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:42.914
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

02:22:08.268 --> 02:22:08.708
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:22:25.279 --> 02:22:26.140
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

02:22:42.165 --> 02:22:46.447
[SPEAKER_14]: But unfortunately, this is the way things are going, and that's it.

02:22:46.527 --> 02:22:47.748
[SPEAKER_14]: So you just got to play smart.

02:22:48.148 --> 02:22:59.294
[SPEAKER_14]: You buy the game, you know, either buy it used later on, buy it for cheap, buy it later when the Game of the Year edition comes out, and just give it some time.

02:22:59.995 --> 02:23:03.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chat room, SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you're talking me out of my pre-order.

02:23:03.837 --> 02:23:04.357
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not...

02:23:06.871 --> 02:23:10.953
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I talked myself out of it earlier this week, so I'm just trying to be honest.

02:23:11.113 --> 02:23:14.014
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying if you buy this, you're dumb or anything like that.

02:23:14.114 --> 02:23:17.495
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think you just have to ask yourself, how much is this game worth to you?

02:23:17.555 --> 02:23:20.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Capcom's about to try and charge you double for it, basically.

02:23:20.776 --> 02:23:21.797
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some people...

02:23:23.497 --> 02:23:25.158
[SPEAKER_06]: That is worth it to them.

02:23:25.398 --> 02:23:29.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And some passionate fighting game fans are going to be lined up day one.

02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:30.961
[SPEAKER_06]: There is nothing wrong with that.

02:23:31.301 --> 02:23:34.422
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, I don't consider it to be a worthy investment.

02:23:34.822 --> 02:23:40.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people would side-eye me going, what are you doing ordering this collector's edition of Final Fantasy XIII too?

02:23:40.104 --> 02:23:41.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you play the first game or wasn't that good?

02:23:41.785 --> 02:23:42.665
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, you know what?

02:23:42.825 --> 02:23:43.586
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed it enough.

02:23:43.606 --> 02:23:45.687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a risk on it.

02:23:45.827 --> 02:23:48.608
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really just have to value for you

02:23:50.009 --> 02:23:50.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it worth it?

02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:52.471
[SPEAKER_06]: When you know this is coming.

02:23:55.173 --> 02:23:56.094
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's really about.

02:23:57.495 --> 02:23:58.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it worth it?

02:23:59.216 --> 02:24:00.657
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, but that's me.

02:24:02.478 --> 02:24:03.379
[SPEAKER_06]: Every gamer gets a voice.

02:24:03.399 --> 02:24:07.442
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it looks like a neat game, but maybe we should just wait.

02:24:08.183 --> 02:24:09.143
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait and pick it up at Christmas.

02:24:09.244 --> 02:24:13.767
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have time to play it right now anyways, so... I don't know.

02:24:13.867 --> 02:24:15.989
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, I'll get it when the year-end edition comes out.

02:24:16.609 --> 02:24:17.009
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll...

02:24:19.031 --> 02:24:22.512
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what series, if fighting games, I'm willing to buy day one anymore.

02:24:23.172 --> 02:24:26.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Soul Calibur, and that's about it, but I really like Soul Calibur.

02:24:26.273 --> 02:24:33.155
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's a lot of games, I know a lot of series of games that are going to come out, they're going to have Game of the Year editions.

02:24:34.055 --> 02:24:38.596
[SPEAKER_14]: Borderlands 2, I know, is going to have a Game of the Year edition at some point, but you know what?

02:24:38.857 --> 02:24:41.017
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a game where the DLC was worth it.

02:24:41.377 --> 02:24:45.498
[SPEAKER_14]: That was something that wasn't on the disc already, and they put some effort into that shit.

02:24:45.518 --> 02:24:46.859
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Skyrim is going to be...

02:24:47.959 --> 02:24:50.461
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, you look like you want to comment on this or jump in here?

02:25:13.257 --> 02:25:16.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it was something that I wanted to mention speaking of Skyrim.

02:25:16.579 --> 02:25:16.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

02:25:16.799 --> 02:25:18.000
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just before I forget it.

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:24.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone's done a Berserk patch for Skyrim for PC where you can play as Gatsu from Berserk.

02:25:24.303 --> 02:25:24.583
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

02:25:24.643 --> 02:25:25.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

02:25:25.444 --> 02:25:29.526
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to go look at... Alan, by the way, is almost 200 hours in Skyrim.

02:25:29.566 --> 02:25:30.227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty awesome.

02:25:31.107 --> 02:25:34.989
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to go see the portal thingy he downloaded, the Valve mod official thing.

02:25:35.189 --> 02:25:36.690
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got Wheatley in his bag.

02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.671
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

02:25:37.691 --> 02:25:37.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:25:38.411 --> 02:25:42.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, all right, we need to move on in the interest of time to cover some other stories.

02:25:42.675 --> 02:25:45.317
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us a mailbag on this topic, I'm sure a lot of you have something to say.

02:25:45.397 --> 02:25:46.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

02:25:46.938 --> 02:25:47.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you stand?

02:25:47.439 --> 02:25:49.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that'll be the question of the week next week, the Fugle thing.

02:25:49.761 --> 02:25:50.021
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:50.321
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

02:25:50.922 --> 02:25:52.323
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

02:25:53.484 --> 02:25:54.045
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

02:26:15.825 --> 02:26:20.932
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 winners will get prize money and you'll actually get to publish your games on the iOS Apple Store.

02:26:50.106 --> 02:26:50.266
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

02:27:09.623 --> 02:27:10.203
[SPEAKER_14]: and Atari.

02:27:11.044 --> 02:27:12.044
[SPEAKER_14]: Atari's not doing too well.

02:27:12.785 --> 02:27:14.786
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if anybody's noticed.

02:27:15.266 --> 02:27:28.173
[SPEAKER_14]: All that Atari has right now going for it is The Witcher 2, which is coming to consoles as well now, well, Xbox 360, and Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends, which...

02:27:29.171 --> 02:27:30.673
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not exactly a strong title.

02:27:31.074 --> 02:27:31.735
[SPEAKER_14]: That is it.

02:27:32.055 --> 02:27:35.920
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, so... Maybe they're going to relaunch Pong?

02:27:35.961 --> 02:27:41.308
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they tried it with Centipede and that bombed, so... I always think of that Pong on the PlayStation years and years ago.

02:27:41.728 --> 02:27:42.049
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

02:27:44.705 --> 02:27:45.085
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:27:45.885 --> 02:27:52.308
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, you could probably get away with putting a long version out there on the iOS platform and they probably wouldn't even notice.

02:27:52.588 --> 02:27:54.128
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this all sounds like to me?

02:27:54.308 --> 02:27:57.109
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like American Idol.

02:27:57.850 --> 02:28:08.393
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how on American Idol, if you're in the top 50, you have to sign some type of contract that Fox owns your ass for a year and then all those people don't get through and they're fucked.

02:28:08.413 --> 02:28:09.694
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't do anything.

02:28:10.154 --> 02:28:14.055
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't put out their own because they've had the limited exposure on the show, but they weren't in the top 12.

02:28:14.856 --> 02:28:19.017
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know that's a fucking weird comparison, but it's kind of the same thing.

02:28:19.457 --> 02:28:25.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you're the runner up in this contest, Atari's going to own your game and you don't get much out of it.

02:28:27.421 --> 02:28:28.121
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's be fair.

02:28:28.362 --> 02:28:32.584
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't think coding a Pong game is going to be too much of a challenge.

02:28:32.604 --> 02:28:33.485
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Boob Pong?

02:28:33.785 --> 02:28:41.229
[SPEAKER_06]: For the person who's going to reinvent it, which by the way, whoever made Pong Combat in the 1990s just needs to revive that idea.

02:28:41.329 --> 02:28:42.890
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Pong Combat on the PC?

02:28:43.210 --> 02:28:43.390
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:44.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.

02:28:44.571 --> 02:28:46.812
[SPEAKER_06]: It had Pong paddle fatalities and everything.

02:28:48.153 --> 02:28:49.134
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hilarious.

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:50.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.

02:28:50.314 --> 02:28:52.896
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, oh God, I was in like junior high or high school.

02:28:52.976 --> 02:28:55.157
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like 94, 95 when this game was out.

02:28:55.297 --> 02:28:56.558
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pong Combat was great.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:03.783
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, somebody in our chat room must know what I'm talking about.

02:29:04.624 --> 02:29:07.086
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

02:29:07.126 --> 02:29:08.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have emails tonight?

02:29:08.307 --> 02:29:10.469
[SPEAKER_11]: We got one, but it's from Bobby.

02:29:12.011 --> 02:29:13.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well a Bobby email we'll have to do tonight.

02:29:13.992 --> 02:29:18.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you guys send us emails every week.

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:19.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

02:29:19.989 --> 02:29:29.495
[SPEAKER_11]: Since Rob won't read my chat comments because Loki already started another story, the reason you don't see many 99 cent games on 3DS Vita but do on iOS is because of licensing fees.

02:29:29.956 --> 02:29:33.898
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs $99 a year to get as many apps as you want on the App Store.

02:29:34.238 --> 02:29:37.901
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to pay more than that per title to be on the 3DS Vita.

02:29:38.341 --> 02:29:41.243
[SPEAKER_11]: So the prices have to be higher to recoup licensing fees.

02:29:41.363 --> 02:29:43.765
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Rob, I need your help on something to circumvent something.

02:29:44.265 --> 02:29:45.486
[SPEAKER_11]: So read the last paragraph please.

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:50.961
[SPEAKER_06]: You know he's trolling you with this.

02:29:51.501 --> 02:29:52.182
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

02:29:52.382 --> 02:29:52.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll read this.

02:29:52.822 --> 02:29:54.124
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I'm having you read it.

02:29:55.765 --> 02:29:56.906
[SPEAKER_06]: This is total troll bait.

02:29:56.926 --> 02:29:57.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure you want to go here?

02:29:57.887 --> 02:29:59.027
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I'm having you read it.

02:29:59.148 --> 02:29:59.568
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:29:59.888 --> 02:30:01.609
[SPEAKER_10]: So that it completely negates a statement.

02:30:01.649 --> 02:30:03.291
[SPEAKER_06]: You know they say don't feed the trolls.

02:30:03.991 --> 02:30:05.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm negating a statement by having you read it.

02:30:05.673 --> 02:30:08.355
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here's the last paragraph of Bobby Blackwolf.

02:30:09.947 --> 02:30:20.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and the US soundtrack to Sonic CD is far, far, far superior to the Japanese soundtrack.

02:30:20.457 --> 02:30:25.221
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a verifiable fact, and since DarkSakura just said this in her voice, it is doubly true.

02:30:26.417 --> 02:30:26.857
[SPEAKER_11]: Haha!

02:30:28.479 --> 02:30:29.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Counter-troll!

02:30:30.781 --> 02:30:31.522
[SPEAKER_11]: Counter-troll!

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:34.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Well played, DarkSakura.

02:30:34.185 --> 02:30:34.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Lies!

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:36.827
[SPEAKER_06]: So, wait, my voice doesn't mean anything?

02:30:37.648 --> 02:30:38.669
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm the Sega nerd.

02:30:38.689 --> 02:30:38.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh...

02:30:45.175 --> 02:30:45.795
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a trap.

02:30:45.895 --> 02:30:48.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet, sweet vengeance.

02:30:48.876 --> 02:30:51.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf is protesting live in our chat room.

02:30:51.057 --> 02:30:56.899
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to start a protest here at Orange Lounge Radio, Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio is the place to send your angst.

02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:00.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not try to outsmart the DarkSakura.

02:31:01.321 --> 02:31:04.282
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of angst... I have been trolling since I was born.

02:31:05.502 --> 02:31:06.883
[SPEAKER_11]: True, I pooped on my granny once.

02:31:08.837 --> 02:31:10.481
[SPEAKER_05]: You really want to share that on this program?

02:31:10.522 --> 02:31:11.985
[SPEAKER_11]: My mom already did on this program.

02:31:12.006 --> 02:31:12.366
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

02:31:12.607 --> 02:31:13.409
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long 10 years.

02:31:13.469 --> 02:31:13.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:31:15.234 --> 02:31:16.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of angst...

02:31:33.075 --> 02:31:36.396
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the potential of having to take a job in customer service again.

02:31:36.536 --> 02:31:38.157
[SPEAKER_11]: I really... I mean, okay.

02:31:39.037 --> 02:31:39.717
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good at it.

02:31:39.897 --> 02:31:43.919
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good at dealing with people, all appearances on the show to the contrary.

02:31:45.439 --> 02:31:47.640
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really freaking good at customer service.

02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:53.342
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've done it for a long time and I don't want to keep doing it.

02:31:53.422 --> 02:31:54.823
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to work in design.

02:31:55.643 --> 02:31:58.104
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell Capcom or whoever...

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:07.725
[SPEAKER_11]: I have amazing grammatical skills, know how to use my spell checker, and know how to use a dictionary and a thesaurus.

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:13.528
[SPEAKER_06]: You may be screwed by association for Capcom based on earlier rants on this program.

02:32:14.849 --> 02:32:15.870
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't say anything.

02:32:15.890 --> 02:32:17.331
[SPEAKER_11]: The views and opinions expressed.

02:32:20.372 --> 02:32:26.296
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, I have probably every fighting game Capcom's ever made, including Cyberbots, Capcom's number one game.

02:32:28.789 --> 02:32:29.730
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the deluxe version, too.

02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:30.490
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two copies of it.

02:32:30.991 --> 02:32:31.231
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

02:32:32.431 --> 02:32:34.393
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um... You should go to GDC.

02:32:34.873 --> 02:32:35.333
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish.

02:32:36.694 --> 02:32:42.678
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um... It's just really difficult because I have experience in my field.

02:32:43.419 --> 02:32:51.584
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got clients who will vouch for me, but they want that extra piece of paper that says that I've basically taken classes and stuff I know how to do.

02:32:52.785 --> 02:32:53.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Gee!

02:32:53.486 --> 02:32:56.147
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've done a bunch of classes and stuff I already know how to do.

02:32:56.207 --> 02:32:58.189
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have to do more classes and stuff I know how to do?

02:32:59.008 --> 02:33:02.611
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and, you know, I have nothing against going to school.

02:33:02.931 --> 02:33:11.177
[SPEAKER_11]: I love going to school, and I love taking classes, and I like learning from not just my teachers, but from the other people in my classes, the people around me, you know, my peers.

02:33:11.998 --> 02:33:19.043
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, I really, really would like to have the stuff that I can do be recognized.

02:33:19.204 --> 02:33:19.564
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

02:33:21.445 --> 02:33:21.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Loki?

02:33:21.686 --> 02:33:21.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

02:33:34.926 --> 02:33:36.346
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, because we don't have room in our fridge for it.

02:34:03.473 --> 02:34:04.093
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna toss?

02:34:04.274 --> 02:34:05.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Alan will eat it for lunch tomorrow.

02:34:05.895 --> 02:34:07.076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can have the rest.

02:34:07.176 --> 02:34:09.277
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's just, I don't have room for the fridge.

02:34:09.297 --> 02:34:10.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Got any crazy bread left?

02:34:10.378 --> 02:34:10.939
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the credit.

02:34:10.959 --> 02:34:11.819
[SPEAKER_14]: I have almost a full bag.

02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:13.560
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the credit music starting early.

02:34:14.081 --> 02:34:14.801
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's really it.

02:34:15.302 --> 02:34:20.506
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to pizza, but bless you to that amazing crazy bread, which I will also have another piece of.

02:34:20.526 --> 02:34:22.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, awesome.

02:34:23.808 --> 02:34:24.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:34:25.556 --> 02:34:27.417
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, Crazy Bread.

02:34:27.977 --> 02:34:31.579
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy Bread is good hot, cold, lukewarm, wet.

02:34:31.999 --> 02:34:36.421
[SPEAKER_14]: If you love Crazy Bread, I'm telling you, you gotta try their new breadsticks that they have.

02:34:37.316 --> 02:34:38.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Less food, more games.

02:34:38.597 --> 02:34:39.218
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, no.

02:34:40.059 --> 02:34:40.499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's epic.

02:34:40.579 --> 02:34:41.540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got pepperoni in it.

02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:43.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's paying you guys off tonight?

02:34:43.582 --> 02:34:44.963
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to.

02:34:44.983 --> 02:34:45.764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's delicious.

02:34:46.004 --> 02:34:46.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

02:34:46.784 --> 02:34:47.245
[SPEAKER_06]: Hormones.

02:34:48.326 --> 02:34:48.646
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:34:48.686 --> 02:34:49.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Hormones have been paying you off.

02:34:49.907 --> 02:34:50.147
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:54.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Five stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line.

02:34:54.992 --> 02:34:56.433
[SPEAKER_06]: The 800 number is busted tonight.

02:34:56.573 --> 02:34:57.654
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a standby number.

02:34:57.714 --> 02:35:02.058
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give it to you when it gets closer to the Skype line or hurry up and add us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:02.578 --> 02:35:03.199
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get there in a minute.

02:35:03.759 --> 02:35:19.771
[SPEAKER_14]: for now, Loki I don't want to talk about this but Justin Bieber is being sued by a game company that put out a game called Joustin' Beaver it's a beaver that's jousting things with a pole

02:35:21.352 --> 02:35:44.499
[SPEAKER_14]: and uh yes obviously it's parody and it's cheap and a ripoff of the Justin Bieber name but um anyway so what ended up happening is Justin Bieber or his lawyers I should say um feels that the game is infringing on his trademark and publicity oh wait so it's the other way around

02:35:44.659 --> 02:35:46.521
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Bieber is suing Justin Bieber

02:35:59.856 --> 02:36:17.673
[SPEAKER_14]: and they say of course the parody app portrays a beaver floating down a log on a river and the beaver presents um or is presented with bangs and a lance and a purple sweater and the beaver knocks off uh fought hogs and attempts to uh or to take his uh

02:36:17.893 --> 02:36:18.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

02:36:37.134 --> 02:36:45.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so just to be clear, just because I thought when you originally said this, you said that the Joust and Beaver folks were suing Justin Bieber, which I thought was ridiculous because that's his name.

02:36:46.037 --> 02:36:46.897
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that is what they're doing.

02:36:46.917 --> 02:36:48.898
[SPEAKER_14]: They're suing him because— What?

02:36:48.938 --> 02:36:50.279
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, but they're suing each other.

02:36:50.659 --> 02:36:59.702
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because the fact that they're trying to cease and desist this, and they're saying, well, we're protected by the First Amendment rights, and so we're out to—

02:37:00.882 --> 02:37:06.467
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Justin Bieber's company sued these guys, and now it's a countersuit saying you're full of shit.

02:37:06.507 --> 02:37:08.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, they should be sued by the people who made Tubin.

02:37:10.431 --> 02:37:10.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

02:37:10.671 --> 02:37:11.192
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, yeah.

02:37:11.212 --> 02:37:12.473
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Tubin.

02:37:14.415 --> 02:37:14.935
[SPEAKER_14]: And really...

02:37:16.912 --> 02:37:20.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Justin Bieber, his teeth aren't that bad.

02:37:20.654 --> 02:37:21.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

02:37:21.394 --> 02:37:23.755
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can't believe I'm fucking defending Tron.

02:37:23.855 --> 02:37:26.437
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, the Bieber's teeth are not as bad as the real thing.

02:37:26.457 --> 02:37:27.857
[SPEAKER_14]: Why does this picture exist?

02:37:28.718 --> 02:37:34.780
[SPEAKER_14]: This picture of Justin Bieber dressed up like he's going to Tron with fucking Ozzy Osbourne like...

02:37:37.182 --> 02:37:39.945
[SPEAKER_14]: Like some creepy devil guy that's in Tron or something.

02:37:39.966 --> 02:37:48.136
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who should be suing Joustin' Beaver is Sue Sylvester from Glee because that looks more like Sue Sylvester than Justin Bieber.

02:37:48.877 --> 02:37:49.839
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's be real.

02:37:50.159 --> 02:37:50.439
[SPEAKER_14]: You know...

02:37:51.841 --> 02:37:56.343
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's fun to hate on the popular singer and yeah, whatever.

02:37:57.303 --> 02:38:01.344
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not music that's our demographic at all, so that's fine.

02:38:01.604 --> 02:38:02.044
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

02:38:03.965 --> 02:38:06.626
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, come on, man.

02:38:07.046 --> 02:38:10.207
[SPEAKER_14]: You released an app that's just different enough.

02:38:10.227 --> 02:38:12.768
[SPEAKER_14]: You're just cashing in on the, ha ha, it's Justin Bieber.

02:38:12.868 --> 02:38:15.169
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to download this because it's a beaver.

02:38:15.669 --> 02:38:17.731
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not really Justin Bieber.

02:38:17.831 --> 02:38:18.432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

02:38:18.952 --> 02:38:19.573
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

02:38:19.693 --> 02:38:24.177
[SPEAKER_14]: It just appeals to those people that are that fucking dumb that will buy any of this stupid bullshit.

02:38:24.197 --> 02:38:29.262
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the people that are... Pokemon Yellow thing.

02:38:29.463 --> 02:38:36.149
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the people that are also dumb enough to buy on-disc download content for Street Fighter Crosstek.

02:38:36.169 --> 02:38:36.229
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

02:38:38.171 --> 02:38:40.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Comedy gold from our chat room tonight.

02:38:40.133 --> 02:38:42.074
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a two-drink minimum in chat tonight.

02:38:42.114 --> 02:38:43.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait for this stuff.

02:38:43.836 --> 02:38:44.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:38:44.176 --> 02:38:46.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:38:47.319 --> 02:38:49.441
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, 12-year-old beavers.

02:38:49.741 --> 02:38:51.403
[SPEAKER_06]: This show has gone down a dark path.

02:38:51.603 --> 02:38:52.444
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I meant.

02:38:53.645 --> 02:38:53.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerk.

02:38:55.246 --> 02:38:55.647
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:38:55.867 --> 02:38:58.289
[SPEAKER_06]: DDRDollarBill says, I sue you.

02:38:58.649 --> 02:38:59.490
[SPEAKER_06]: You sue me.

02:38:59.850 --> 02:39:01.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go and sue everybody.

02:39:02.458 --> 02:39:03.839
[SPEAKER_06]: I really did just sing that on the show.

02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:08.321
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, I want to sue both of them for wasting my time.

02:39:08.422 --> 02:39:08.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well said.

02:39:09.422 --> 02:39:11.884
[SPEAKER_06]: And Blackwolf says, Rob likes Glee, LOL.

02:39:11.984 --> 02:39:12.624
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do not.

02:39:13.585 --> 02:39:15.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the first half of the first season.

02:39:15.025 --> 02:39:15.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Glee is hideous.

02:39:15.686 --> 02:39:18.487
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the first half of the first season, and then I'm like, this joke is done.

02:39:19.048 --> 02:39:19.848
[SPEAKER_06]: This joke is over.

02:39:20.349 --> 02:39:22.590
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the guy that won't leave the party.

02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:22.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:39:23.752 --> 02:39:25.715
[SPEAKER_14]: and Justin Bieber's company hasn't sued them yet.

02:39:25.815 --> 02:39:35.170
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that they received a cease and desist letter and so now that company is filing a countersuit or a suit before the other suits.

02:39:36.712 --> 02:39:37.454
[SPEAKER_14]: Eh, whatever.

02:39:39.699 --> 02:39:54.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to something less... And I feel bad that we even talked about that game because now there's like, oh hey, we got our game talked about, people are going to be interested in it, and really it should just die with all those other really crappy knockoff games.

02:39:54.347 --> 02:39:56.228
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it.

02:39:56.788 --> 02:39:57.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it.

02:39:57.769 --> 02:39:59.350
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't knock on a game until I've played it.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:00.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Pac-Man

02:40:17.179 --> 02:40:21.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man is getting a new 3D animated series.

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.020
[SPEAKER_06]: It is produced by a former Marvel executive.

02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:27.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Avi Arad is doing this.

02:40:27.921 --> 02:40:30.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco Bandai actually announced that it is going to be shown.

02:40:31.421 --> 02:40:33.422
[SPEAKER_06]: The pilot has been picked up for a full series.

02:40:33.742 --> 02:40:36.322
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on Disney XD in fall 2013.

02:40:37.863 --> 02:40:40.603
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Disney XD because it makes me think of the face, XD.

02:40:41.003 --> 02:40:43.523
[SPEAKER_06]: But Disney XD is also where the Tron anime thing is going to be.

02:40:43.583 --> 02:40:45.264
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're picking up some newer cartoons.

02:40:45.284 --> 02:40:46.244
[SPEAKER_06]: And Phineas and Ferb.

02:40:47.064 --> 02:40:49.665
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called Pac... Where does Adventure Time show?

02:40:49.685 --> 02:40:50.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I like that show.

02:40:50.786 --> 02:40:51.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartoon Network.

02:40:51.526 --> 02:40:54.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I only ever watch it on Netflix and stuff, but that show's pretty good.

02:40:54.607 --> 02:40:57.569
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did watch Phineas and Ferb one day, and it actually was pretty good.

02:40:57.669 --> 02:40:58.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Phineas and Ferb is awesome.

02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:00.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, back to Pac-Man.

02:41:01.290 --> 02:41:04.372
[SPEAKER_06]: This new series is called Pac-Man The Adventure Begins.

02:41:05.332 --> 02:41:10.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it has anything to do with the old 80s cartoon, but it should be noted, you know, Pac-Man has been a cartoon once before.

02:41:11.535 --> 02:41:12.916
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is going that whole...

02:41:14.016 --> 02:41:39.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Pixar route although I don't know if this will be it's just because that shit's cheaper to produce nowadays than actually hand drawing anything that's why it's all CG animated it's kind of sad but true it doesn't make or it doesn't not make sense okay Ranma you saying Avi Arad left Marvel Disney owns Marvel remember Disney owns Marvel

02:41:41.348 --> 02:41:41.688
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

02:42:08.188 --> 02:42:08.749
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you're next.

02:42:36.471 --> 02:42:37.993
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I'm wondering where Perry is.

02:42:38.554 --> 02:42:42.139
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is a sad chapter in gaming.

02:42:43.641 --> 02:42:45.684
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, and I can never pronounce this.

02:42:46.185 --> 02:42:48.228
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how to pronounce this guy's name right.

02:42:48.348 --> 02:42:52.414
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Eris Bactanians, I guess.

02:42:54.042 --> 02:43:02.025
[SPEAKER_11]: He was interviewed as part of a fighting game thing going on, the cross-assault reality show that Capcom does.

02:43:02.726 --> 02:43:05.347
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were doing a promotion for Street Fighter X Tekken.

02:43:05.407 --> 02:43:05.507
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

02:43:09.068 --> 02:43:09.649
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:43:25.623 --> 02:43:46.046
[SPEAKER_11]: and so finally a Capcom person basically said the views and opinions expressed by cast members in the live segment of Cross Assault do not reflect those of Capcom as a company Capcom believes that everyone should be treated with respect and basically they said we're sorry if anyone got offended on our show we are completely distancing ourselves from this guy.

02:43:46.618 --> 02:44:03.633
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what this reminds me of speaking of like crazy analogies since I compared something to American Idol earlier this really reminds me of things that have happened on the CBS show Big Brother where contested because you know the cameras are always on on Big Brother my understanding about this reality show is it's not like the tester it's something that's always live

02:44:04.413 --> 02:44:19.598
[SPEAKER_06]: and some people on Big Brother have said some really dumb things like one gal in one season said these really ignorant things about Jewish people and just got you know and the clip was on YouTube and she got taken to the cleaners I mean this poor gal probably didn't find work oh I shouldn't say this poor gal because she said it and it was a dumb thing to say

02:44:20.278 --> 02:44:45.636
[SPEAKER_06]: and she couldn't find work after the show and then some some other guy in another season said like Dumbledore was a bad influence and shouldn't be in a kid's book because he's gay I am paraphrasing I'm not giving you that quote but guys people in these reality shows have put their foot in their mouth before and the networks have to say hey this isn't our opinion this is just you know some people were throwing money at to you know make fools of themselves on television

02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.731
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:45:07.649 --> 02:45:10.531
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I never experienced any of that.

02:45:10.652 --> 02:45:18.358
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had a perfectly wonderful experience in the fighting game community for as long as I've been in it because the people that I hung out with were not assholes like you.

02:45:20.599 --> 02:45:21.020
[SPEAKER_11]: End of story.

02:45:22.981 --> 02:45:23.782
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just an asshole.

02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:28.921
[SPEAKER_11]: He is a misogynistic, head-up-his-ass asshole.

02:45:29.341 --> 02:45:33.562
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, he could probably smell his own, you know, shit really, really well.

02:45:33.582 --> 02:45:35.862
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, he probably thinks it doesn't stink.

02:45:36.682 --> 02:45:49.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, part of me, you know, part of me wants to be that whole hippie angle, like, oh, well, maybe the guy was just under a lot of pressure, and, you know, being on a reality show has got to be a lot of pressure, and maybe some dumb stuff leaves your mouth and all this stuff.

02:45:49.845 --> 02:45:52.086
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the more I think about it, I'm like, nah, because...

02:45:52.626 --> 02:45:53.287
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

02:46:14.483 --> 02:46:15.464
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:46:30.855 --> 02:46:34.596
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's also kind of ignorant to think that this is only part of the fighting game community.

02:46:34.936 --> 02:46:36.957
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, have you ever signed into Xbox Live?

02:46:37.797 --> 02:46:39.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever played a game on Xbox Live?

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:52.801
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just people complaining that it's people that end up getting their asses kicked in games or whatever because... And so they talk up a big storm and then they get their ass handed to them.

02:46:53.141 --> 02:46:54.261
[SPEAKER_14]: I've dealt with them...

02:46:59.605 --> 02:47:18.819
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says but apparently plenty of people in the fighting game community agreed with him, many professional players too well it's interesting what people will say behind the monitor but as far as the professional players go you know

02:47:20.789 --> 02:47:33.759
[SPEAKER_06]: The silver lining to this story if you can find one is that it does seem like the gaming community as a whole is largely rejecting this and saying we don't fucking tolerate this.

02:47:34.419 --> 02:47:37.402
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's exactly what needs to happen in all communities.

02:47:37.442 --> 02:47:41.685
[SPEAKER_14]: And those professional gamers out there might want to watch what they say.

02:47:41.725 --> 02:47:47.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you shouldn't lend your comment to a story like this considering that you have people sponsoring you and

02:47:48.210 --> 02:47:55.616
[SPEAKER_14]: Some companies, maybe like MadCatz or whatever, might not want to sponsor someone that says, oh, I think women should go get raped or something like that.

02:47:57.698 --> 02:47:58.478
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, I don't know.

02:47:58.899 --> 02:48:03.662
[SPEAKER_11]: Making, like how they basically say that whenever anyone uses Phoenix in NBC3.

02:48:06.024 --> 02:48:13.886
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to put an ironic spin of sorts on this, this isn't restricted to the fighting game community.

02:48:13.966 --> 02:48:16.367
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember this show was about the DDR community.

02:48:17.187 --> 02:48:19.828
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's been a lot of great things in the DDR community.

02:48:19.908 --> 02:48:23.069
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met a lot of wonderful people, such as my co-host here on this show.

02:48:23.529 --> 02:48:26.390
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met some awesome friends for life from playing that game.

02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:29.891
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've also met people who will call me fat and ugly.

02:48:31.465 --> 02:48:36.173
[SPEAKER_06]: just based on things that they may or may not know about me.

02:48:36.333 --> 02:48:42.283
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just really interesting how some of that comes back up all this time later.

02:48:45.123 --> 02:48:45.403
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:48:46.625 --> 02:48:53.953
[SPEAKER_11]: I was reading a little bit further into this, and apparently to basically get out of the match, she just started losing on purpose.

02:48:54.554 --> 02:48:59.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was really the girl that he made all those comments about.

02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:03.444
[SPEAKER_11]: She eventually started losing on purpose, and the winner handed over all of his prizes to her.

02:49:05.038 --> 02:49:08.523
[SPEAKER_11]: and I thought that was pretty... At the same time, you know what?

02:49:09.004 --> 02:49:12.628
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that she felt offended by all this name-calling stuff.

02:49:12.668 --> 02:49:13.930
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking... Well, on TV.

02:49:14.391 --> 02:49:18.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I don't care if it's on... Someone marginalizing her where the public can see it.

02:49:18.196 --> 02:49:19.638
[SPEAKER_11]: That's national embarrassment.

02:49:19.878 --> 02:49:20.839
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:49:46.018 --> 02:49:47.139
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then he's just an asshole.

02:49:47.219 --> 02:49:50.201
[SPEAKER_11]: So he was an asshole embarrassing a teammate.

02:49:52.062 --> 02:49:54.063
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's an idiot then.

02:49:54.083 --> 02:49:55.224
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no room for it.

02:49:56.024 --> 02:50:02.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Even while playing the game and you're trying to psych somebody out, there's just a line that has to be drawn, and this guy's crossing it.

02:50:02.949 --> 02:50:10.894
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm all for playful ribbing, but dear God, some of the stuff you hear on Xbox Live is just repulsive.

02:50:13.095 --> 02:50:14.775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not somebody trying to get in your head.

02:50:14.915 --> 02:50:19.957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just somebody trolling and saying things that they know are unacceptable in culture.

02:50:21.417 --> 02:50:31.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that they say because they're cowards and they're hiding behind their headset and their little monitors and saying these ridiculous things that would get their ass kicked in any public setting.

02:50:32.901 --> 02:50:34.042
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you an example.

02:50:34.923 --> 02:50:41.288
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'd play, because I told you my first experience playing a LAN game was playing Duke Nukem 3D.

02:50:42.269 --> 02:50:46.712
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we were in there playing, it was quiet except for the voice macros.

02:50:47.113 --> 02:50:54.959
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I went later on and they had a private room LAN and you just got people talking shit through the mic the whole time.

02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:58.962
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, and it was some of the same people that I'd played with before.

02:50:59.482 --> 02:51:03.325
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just when you get them, it's like a different reality.

02:51:04.225 --> 02:51:09.929
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really, but to have this done to your face and in front of all these people, that's even worse.

02:51:09.969 --> 02:51:11.750
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like the worst kind of marginalization.

02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:18.714
[SPEAKER_11]: And this guy, honestly, if I were a more violent person, I would just cut his tongue out.

02:51:20.506 --> 02:51:21.506
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bit extreme.

02:51:21.526 --> 02:51:22.467
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd cut his tongue out in uterum.

02:51:22.747 --> 02:51:23.107
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

02:51:23.967 --> 02:51:24.867
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little crazy.

02:51:25.008 --> 02:51:25.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

02:51:25.488 --> 02:51:28.589
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I said if I was more violent, I would cut his tongue out in uterum.

02:51:29.509 --> 02:51:31.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, I think this is important to say.

02:51:32.130 --> 02:51:34.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, the main thing that needs attention here is the following.

02:51:34.691 --> 02:51:35.591
[SPEAKER_06]: One, and this is from our chat room.

02:51:36.091 --> 02:51:40.313
[SPEAKER_06]: One, the person at fault here was the team coach, someone in a supervisory position.

02:51:40.353 --> 02:51:41.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, I didn't know that.

02:51:42.073 --> 02:51:44.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, he was still there after the occurrence.

02:51:44.655 --> 02:51:51.099
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that an entity will not remove someone that is acting appropriately should not be tolerated in a professional position.

02:51:52.239 --> 02:51:53.560
[SPEAKER_06]: I will just throw this out there.

02:51:53.580 --> 02:52:03.746
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say I agree or disagree, but in that crazy CBS comparison I made a minute ago, those house guests who said the anti-Jewish and the anti-gay things were not thrown out of the house.

02:52:04.006 --> 02:52:07.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not saying that's right or wrong, just that... It makes for better TV.

02:52:07.929 --> 02:52:08.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

02:52:13.847 --> 02:52:14.487
[SPEAKER_06]: Change the channel.

02:52:15.527 --> 02:52:17.488
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why do you think I don't play online, honestly?

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:20.169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play online either unless I know the people.

02:52:20.509 --> 02:52:21.810
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just gotten to that point.

02:52:22.170 --> 02:52:22.850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gross.

02:52:23.931 --> 02:52:29.433
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are certain communities of games I will... That's one thing I do kind of agree with.

02:52:29.893 --> 02:52:32.414
[SPEAKER_11]: That in some communities you don't get it as much as in others.

02:52:33.295 --> 02:52:33.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Like...

02:52:35.516 --> 02:52:40.941
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, when I played PSU, for the most part, I knew the kind of players I was playing with.

02:52:41.502 --> 02:52:43.984
[SPEAKER_11]: There were people who were in the same kind of games that I was.

02:52:44.585 --> 02:52:47.208
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we had somebody like that, we would block them.

02:52:47.348 --> 02:52:49.310
[SPEAKER_11]: I do that on WoW.

02:52:49.650 --> 02:52:56.697
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll even find people in trade chat that are just being complete assholes and block them just because I don't want them to remotely message me or anything.

02:52:56.717 --> 02:52:57.778
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be around these people.

02:52:59.198 --> 02:53:00.819
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to a situation where that was going to happen.

02:53:22.146 --> 02:53:29.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, I do have to say in myself when I have been in those situations, I have stuck up for myself and have pretty much torn people apart.

02:53:30.430 --> 02:53:31.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't take shit.

02:53:31.771 --> 02:53:32.271
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't.

02:53:32.371 --> 02:53:33.491
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't take crap.

02:53:33.851 --> 02:53:34.712
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care where I am.

02:53:34.792 --> 02:53:35.332
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't take it.

02:53:36.372 --> 02:53:43.936
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, when you've got a larger guy going off on you, it's really hard to kind of stand up.

02:53:45.016 --> 02:53:45.316
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

02:53:46.537 --> 02:53:49.178
[SPEAKER_11]: She really either needed an advocate or he needed to be thrown out.

02:53:49.730 --> 02:53:52.671
[SPEAKER_14]: And he sort of does look like Hagrid from Harry Potter.

02:53:53.131 --> 02:53:53.652
[SPEAKER_14]: Just saying.

02:53:53.792 --> 02:53:54.772
[SPEAKER_14]: Or the guy from Lost.

02:53:55.092 --> 02:53:55.892
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, knock it off.

02:53:55.952 --> 02:53:56.273
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:53:57.453 --> 02:54:01.275
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very polarizing variety of opinions out there in the community.

02:54:01.315 --> 02:54:02.775
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure a lot of you have something to say.

02:54:02.815 --> 02:54:04.336
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:54:04.796 --> 02:54:07.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to have your say.

02:54:07.857 --> 02:54:09.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we'll be opening up the Skype line in just a minute.

02:54:10.198 --> 02:54:14.599
[SPEAKER_06]: at username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or our not toll-free number.

02:54:14.659 --> 02:54:19.760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our sub-number tonight because the toll-free is down.

02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:21.141
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067 is the phone number.

02:54:21.221 --> 02:54:23.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that is not toll-free.

02:54:23.381 --> 02:54:26.782
[SPEAKER_06]: However, many of you with cell phones probably have nationwide long distance.

02:54:26.882 --> 02:54:30.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, please look up the rules of your carrier before you give us a call.

02:54:30.583 --> 02:54:31.003
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067.

02:54:31.543 --> 02:54:34.704
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two more stories before we get there.

02:54:34.784 --> 02:54:35.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:54:35.544 --> 02:54:42.305
[SPEAKER_14]: So Zynga is trying to get away from being supported purely by Facebook, or at least majorly by Facebook.

02:54:43.106 --> 02:54:45.486
[SPEAKER_14]: They are coming out with the Zynga platform.

02:54:45.706 --> 02:54:58.349
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically like a website, like a portal that you'll be able to kind of interact socially with other people and be able to play games, you know, like wards with friends and stuff like that.

02:54:58.969 --> 02:55:25.671
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll feature a live social stream where you'll be able to see your friends activities, player profiles also selection of games from other companies as well and I'll be launching at Zynga.com and probably in no way will copy Facebook because Zynga is a company that puts out completely original games they would in no way rip off a social media website or anything that's very successful

02:55:26.523 --> 02:55:27.484
[SPEAKER_14]: Not in least.

02:55:28.204 --> 02:55:29.125
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, not even.

02:55:29.265 --> 02:55:31.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Zynga Minus will be the name of it.

02:55:32.687 --> 02:55:33.847
[SPEAKER_06]: Face Zynga Minus.

02:55:33.887 --> 02:55:38.470
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll have a thing that's called the Timestream instead of the Timeline.

02:55:40.471 --> 02:55:40.792
[SPEAKER_14]: You know.

02:55:42.473 --> 02:55:44.954
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll have approves instead of likes.

02:55:46.715 --> 02:55:47.736
[SPEAKER_14]: Thumbs up.

02:55:47.936 --> 02:55:48.456
[SPEAKER_14]: Smiles.

02:55:48.476 --> 02:55:50.998
[SPEAKER_14]: And frowny faces.

02:55:53.859 --> 02:55:53.879
[SPEAKER_14]: I

02:55:56.333 --> 02:55:57.174
[SPEAKER_14]: Good riddance, bye.

02:55:57.895 --> 02:56:00.938
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know anyone who would go off to Zynga to do this.

02:56:01.638 --> 02:56:07.204
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think part of why Google Plus is struggling is because Facebook has its foot so damn jammed in the door.

02:56:07.324 --> 02:56:10.487
[SPEAKER_14]: And why would you, like, are they going to pull their games from Facebook?

02:56:10.547 --> 02:56:11.628
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what they're planning on doing?

02:56:11.648 --> 02:56:15.852
[SPEAKER_14]: Because why would I go somewhere, assuming I'd play these games, which I'm not...

02:56:17.173 --> 02:56:20.715
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would I go somewhere other than Facebook or Google Plus?

02:56:20.735 --> 02:56:25.678
[SPEAKER_06]: First five levels on Facebook, next 20 levels on Zynga Minus or whatever it's called.

02:56:26.159 --> 02:56:27.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Fazinga Minus.

02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:31.202
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't think that Facebook would let them do that.

02:56:32.856 --> 02:56:33.196
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:56:34.517 --> 02:56:35.918
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys tonight.

02:56:35.978 --> 02:56:37.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is kind of fun.

02:56:37.679 --> 02:56:38.860
[SPEAKER_06]: I like these types of hacks.

02:56:39.401 --> 02:56:41.402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mario meets Portal.

02:56:41.582 --> 02:56:45.645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mari Zero, Mario, or Mario and LeetSpeak.

02:56:46.085 --> 02:56:49.207
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game of Super Mario Brothers played with the Portal gun.

02:56:51.489 --> 02:56:53.410
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how I feel about the makers of this game.

02:56:53.450 --> 02:56:56.152
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called StabYourself.net made this game.

02:56:57.413 --> 02:56:59.514
[SPEAKER_06]: What a family-friendly vibe I get from that.

02:57:00.515 --> 02:57:02.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the same guy that made Nesticle in Genesis?

02:57:02.956 --> 02:57:03.356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:57:03.877 --> 02:57:06.058
[SPEAKER_06]: StabYourself.net released Mario.

02:57:07.218 --> 02:57:10.960
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can actually, there's this whole little YouTube-y trailer that shows you how it works.

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:14.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is weird because they replace scenes from The Wizard.

02:57:14.822 --> 02:57:15.462
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, whatever.

02:57:16.603 --> 02:57:20.725
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's fun because it's Portal and the little Cheep Cheeps go flying in and out of portals.

02:57:20.965 --> 02:57:26.107
[SPEAKER_14]: They have all sorts of cool stuff with that.

02:57:26.507 --> 02:57:27.848
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a neat idea.

02:57:27.868 --> 02:57:28.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:57:28.929 --> 02:57:31.230
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's like level editors and stuff like that.

02:57:31.310 --> 02:57:32.870
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, they show all that stuff.

02:57:33.391 --> 02:57:37.532
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it keeps scrolling to the end of the... All right, let me go to the end of this little trailer here.

02:57:39.192 --> 02:57:39.893
[SPEAKER_14]: Level editor.

02:57:39.913 --> 02:57:42.634
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, look at that.

02:57:42.654 --> 02:57:45.515
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how little Mario kind of moves his hand as the guy's painting.

02:57:45.575 --> 02:57:46.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Different shaders.

02:57:46.235 --> 02:57:47.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, hats.

02:57:48.756 --> 02:57:49.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

02:57:49.276 --> 02:57:51.597
[SPEAKER_06]: A little super, like literally Super Mario.

02:57:51.957 --> 02:57:53.357
[SPEAKER_06]: And four-player co-op.

02:57:54.057 --> 02:57:54.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

02:57:55.158 --> 02:57:55.758
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of fun.

02:57:57.916 --> 02:58:00.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Slow Mario All for free.

02:58:01.619 --> 02:58:03.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it before Nintendo shuts it down.

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:05.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Run, don't walk.

02:58:07.603 --> 02:58:12.406
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, it has hit the internet now, so once it's on the internet, it's on the internet.

02:58:13.747 --> 02:58:16.789
[SPEAKER_06]: How long before a cease and desist goes out?

02:58:16.809 --> 02:58:23.233
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no leaving the internet, except in the case of being Bobby Brown, which all episodes have vanished from the internet.

02:58:24.670 --> 02:58:26.672
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:58:51.530 --> 02:58:55.272
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067 or, of course, always free via Skype.

02:58:55.652 --> 02:58:57.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Username is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:57.333 --> 02:58:58.073
[SPEAKER_06]: All one word.

02:58:58.374 --> 02:59:01.215
[SPEAKER_06]: The Skype line is open now for your calls.

02:59:01.295 --> 02:59:07.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm only going to give that number one more time and I'll post it in chat too.

02:59:07.118 --> 02:59:07.398
[SPEAKER_06]: 916-226-9067.

02:59:07.938 --> 02:59:08.198
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:59:09.139 --> 02:59:11.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to some tweets.

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:14.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:59:15.422 --> 02:59:15.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:59:16.162 --> 02:59:16.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

02:59:17.623 --> 02:59:19.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading some chatroom comments here.

02:59:21.164 --> 02:59:24.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment tweeted us, kind of talking about something we were talking about earlier.

02:59:24.766 --> 02:59:27.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumor has it that Valve is working on a console called the Steam.

02:59:28.567 --> 02:59:32.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Walmart is working on a console called the Stoner Employee.

02:59:35.109 --> 02:59:36.590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Redertainment live in our chatroom.

02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:37.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we got calls coming in.

02:59:37.650 --> 02:59:38.650
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:38.671 --> 02:59:39.011
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

02:59:40.331 --> 02:59:40.991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Shane.

02:59:41.471 --> 02:59:42.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Shane.

02:59:42.032 --> 02:59:42.712
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:59:43.982 --> 02:59:47.105
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3.

02:59:47.345 --> 02:59:48.566
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

02:59:48.686 --> 02:59:59.154
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking about how, you know, Tuesday I'm going to spend all day trying to romance Caden.

02:59:59.474 --> 03:00:00.015
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

03:00:00.535 --> 03:00:02.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't even care about the story that day.

03:00:02.096 --> 03:00:03.978
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just trying to get my...

03:00:04.755 --> 03:00:05.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

03:00:05.095 --> 03:00:09.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not for the same ones because this will be the first time my male shepherd can actually get with any guys.

03:00:34.057 --> 03:00:38.118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but couldn't... Wasn't there, like, female-on-female romance in the first game?

03:00:38.138 --> 03:00:39.038
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all over everywhere.

03:00:39.058 --> 03:00:40.599
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's disgusting.

03:00:40.619 --> 03:00:41.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would I play that?

03:00:42.499 --> 03:00:45.060
[SPEAKER_06]: To you, maybe, but to other people, it's kind of hot.

03:00:46.260 --> 03:00:56.843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was... I guess you could, like, romance the sorry chick, Liara, but she's, like, kind of a female, but kind of not.

03:00:56.923 --> 03:01:02.724
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the second one, there is a girl named Kelly who is worthless.

03:01:03.206 --> 03:01:06.027
[SPEAKER_08]: that you can also let die, that you can have a fling with, I guess.

03:01:06.087 --> 03:01:12.869
[SPEAKER_08]: But nobody cares about that, because Kaden can be romanced in three, and that's the most important development in this entire series.

03:01:12.889 --> 03:01:17.710
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is confirmed, absolutely confirmed, you can have hot, gay, sexy times with Kaden.

03:01:19.310 --> 03:01:26.132
[SPEAKER_08]: From everything I'm reading, the official strategy guide says no, but those aren't always the final versions they get.

03:01:26.512 --> 03:01:31.874
[SPEAKER_08]: But people are finding sound files, there's been pictures posted, I guess, and then somebody unlocked an achievement.

03:01:32.526 --> 03:01:34.266
[SPEAKER_08]: and Romancing Him with the Male Shepherd.

03:01:34.326 --> 03:01:40.188
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes, this is what I've been looking forward to for weeks now because that's as long as I've been into the series.

03:01:40.488 --> 03:01:42.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it limited to only certain characters?

03:01:43.129 --> 03:01:47.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's just kind of like an assets thing because there's so much voice acting that goes into it and all this stuff?

03:01:49.410 --> 03:02:00.113
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be that, but honestly, they're trying to build a world there and as they probably saw with Dragon Age 2, if you make everybody bisexual, it really takes away from

03:02:00.825 --> 03:02:05.907
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to assume that Gay Lovins isn't the only reason you play Mass Effect, although maybe it is.

03:02:06.247 --> 03:02:09.688
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's like the best sci-fi story I have experienced since probably Battlestar Galactica.

03:02:09.708 --> 03:02:10.848
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really into the characters and

03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:32.801
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question.

03:02:33.061 --> 03:02:35.543
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, have kind of missed the boat on Mass Effect.

03:02:36.764 --> 03:02:39.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Convince me I should play Mass Effect, and what game should I start with?

03:02:39.967 --> 03:02:43.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I go back and start with one, or should I just jump right into three?

03:02:44.051 --> 03:02:53.439
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you should not just jump right into three, because every game carries information over from the previous one, with the exception of one, obviously.

03:02:53.899 --> 03:02:54.700
[SPEAKER_08]: And three...

03:02:55.436 --> 03:03:06.443
[SPEAKER_08]: and that one will give you default choices that you could have made in the previous games and you will come off like such an evil, terrible person if you start with the default choices from what I've read.

03:03:06.523 --> 03:03:12.746
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you let some of your team members die, you don't care about a lot of things, you're pretty much just a complete jerk.

03:03:14.207 --> 03:03:15.628
[SPEAKER_08]: But, what would you be playing it on?

03:03:15.648 --> 03:03:17.089
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I'll tell you what to start with.

03:03:17.109 --> 03:03:23.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because I was going to say I want to play it on PlayStation 3 because that's kind of my console right now but they don't have Mass Effect 1 on it.

03:03:25.111 --> 03:03:34.314
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but if you pick up 2, it has this thing called Mass Effect Genesis where you play an interactive graphic novel of the first game.

03:03:34.374 --> 03:03:41.216
[SPEAKER_08]: So you make choices that are important in the first game through that graphic novel that will carry into the second one.

03:03:41.336 --> 03:03:44.577
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say play it on PC.

03:03:44.997 --> 03:03:45.957
[SPEAKER_06]: But play it on PC.

03:03:45.977 --> 03:03:47.297
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think about it.

03:03:47.357 --> 03:03:49.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can usually get them pretty cheap.

03:03:49.198 --> 03:03:51.558
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a lot of $5 sales for both 1 and 2.

03:03:51.959 --> 03:03:53.159
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I don't get trophies!

03:03:55.053 --> 03:03:56.174
[SPEAKER_06]: They have achievements, though.

03:03:57.495 --> 03:03:58.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really need trophies?

03:03:58.936 --> 03:04:00.297
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to increase my trophy level.

03:04:00.997 --> 03:04:02.578
[SPEAKER_06]: My trophy level's pathetic, Shane.

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:05.620
[SPEAKER_06]: I think mine is, too, but I don't care.

03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:08.042
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's trophies are atrophied.

03:04:08.142 --> 03:04:09.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, started beyond one trophy.

03:04:10.623 --> 03:04:14.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitstun in our chatroom says, so there's actually an achievement for the gay option now?

03:04:14.426 --> 03:04:16.547
[SPEAKER_06]: Now all the completionists will see it too.

03:04:16.607 --> 03:04:17.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that true?

03:04:18.088 --> 03:04:18.528
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

03:04:18.568 --> 03:04:22.571
[SPEAKER_08]: The Paramore, it's just the Paramore achievement, from what I understand, which is

03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:48.955
[SPEAKER_08]: when you romance any character as any shepherd so I could have got that with stupid that Chobot chick from IGN her character oh no, it won't be but it'll have some important decisions that you actually get to make decisions on now remember, I'm terrible Shane, I am terrible at shooters well the first one

03:04:51.055 --> 03:04:52.616
[SPEAKER_08]: barely qualifies as a shooter.

03:04:52.776 --> 03:04:55.518
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you got that on PC, you would be fine.

03:04:55.538 --> 03:04:57.300
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even have to worry about ammo.

03:04:57.340 --> 03:04:58.841
[SPEAKER_08]: You worry about overheating your gun.

03:04:59.041 --> 03:05:04.425
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are classes that play like mages or kind of play like rogues and stuff like that.

03:05:04.485 --> 03:05:06.006
[SPEAKER_08]: So that you can handle.

03:05:06.066 --> 03:05:12.931
[SPEAKER_08]: Two is more shooty than the first game, but it also goes a lot quicker.

03:05:13.499 --> 03:05:22.501
[SPEAKER_08]: like the combat so it's not so bad 3 is just pretty much a shooter from what I can tell from the demo but it's still really fun but you can also disable the shooter right?

03:05:23.641 --> 03:05:23.861
[SPEAKER_06]: what?

03:05:24.021 --> 03:05:43.244
[SPEAKER_08]: you can also disable the shooter from what I hear like there's like story only mode or shooting mode you can and it's funny because they give you that option in the demo but I haven't even tried the story only or the shooting only I just go back to the default Mass Effect experience I should probably do that at some point

03:05:43.995 --> 03:05:51.460
[SPEAKER_08]: I made one decision in the first game that is haunting me now, and I kind of want to start the entire series over, but I only have tomorrow.

03:05:51.480 --> 03:05:52.561
[SPEAKER_08]: That's such a you thing.

03:05:52.621 --> 03:05:53.422
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't do it.

03:05:53.802 --> 03:05:54.042
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:05:54.302 --> 03:06:00.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I will give it some thought if I can tear myself away from WoW.

03:06:01.067 --> 03:06:03.129
[SPEAKER_08]: And you saw those pictures of Caden, so...

03:06:03.891 --> 03:06:11.501
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what you're missing out on send me more, I think I might need more when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy when what?

03:06:11.741 --> 03:06:14.064
[SPEAKER_06]: when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy

03:06:15.020 --> 03:06:16.700
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take Fraps pictures with it.

03:06:16.900 --> 03:06:17.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sounds exciting.

03:06:18.041 --> 03:06:18.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:06:18.321 --> 03:06:19.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:06:19.701 --> 03:06:19.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

03:06:19.981 --> 03:06:21.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

03:06:22.061 --> 03:06:25.362
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought at first he said Faps pictures, and I'm like, oh, that's kind of awkward.

03:06:25.402 --> 03:06:27.062
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to, I don't, we're friends.

03:06:27.143 --> 03:06:28.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Fap, fap, fap.

03:06:28.523 --> 03:06:29.303
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Fraps.

03:06:29.823 --> 03:06:29.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

03:06:30.103 --> 03:06:30.503
[SPEAKER_06]: Fraps.

03:06:30.763 --> 03:06:31.883
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he said, Fraps.

03:06:33.044 --> 03:06:33.644
[SPEAKER_06]: More calls.

03:06:33.964 --> 03:06:35.484
[SPEAKER_06]: The Skype lines lighten up tonight.

03:06:35.524 --> 03:06:36.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:06:36.384 --> 03:06:36.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

03:06:37.645 --> 03:06:39.285
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, guys, it's Preston from OKC.

03:06:39.305 --> 03:06:39.705
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

03:06:39.745 --> 03:06:40.285
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how you doing?

03:06:40.325 --> 03:06:40.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Better known as Xenocore.

03:06:41.005 --> 03:06:43.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Xenocore from Oklahoma City.

03:06:43.346 --> 03:06:44.006
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind tonight?

03:06:44.813 --> 03:06:45.514
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

03:07:05.839 --> 03:07:06.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played that in ages.

03:07:06.879 --> 03:07:07.819
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really good game, though.

03:07:32.432 --> 03:07:35.754
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much the first RTS that was created on a console.

03:07:36.094 --> 03:07:37.755
[SPEAKER_07]: At least on the 16-bit consoles, anyway.

03:07:38.255 --> 03:07:40.557
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was on Genesis.

03:07:41.157 --> 03:07:41.457
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

03:07:41.577 --> 03:07:41.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

03:07:42.618 --> 03:07:43.298
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I have it.

03:07:44.159 --> 03:07:45.780
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't touched it in ages.

03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:48.021
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's pretty good.

03:07:48.441 --> 03:07:49.982
[SPEAKER_11]: I should lend you my Genesis so you can play it.

03:07:50.923 --> 03:07:54.605
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have this thing called an emulator, and I know it's questionably legal, but let's be real.

03:07:54.785 --> 03:07:56.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, how many Geneses do I have?

03:07:56.746 --> 03:07:57.187
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

03:07:57.227 --> 03:07:57.767
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a lot.

03:07:58.934 --> 03:08:06.138
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but because they actually have it in the browser, I thought it was actually going to come out on marketplaces for the different systems.

03:08:06.158 --> 03:08:11.281
[SPEAKER_07]: I was browsing around to find out for now it's beta so you can play it for free, which is kind of awesome.

03:08:12.161 --> 03:08:12.862
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

03:08:12.942 --> 03:08:14.643
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the website where I can play this at?

03:08:15.499 --> 03:08:21.689
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, you open up your Chrome browser and type in Airmech Chrome and it takes you right to the link in the marketplace to get it.

03:08:22.169 --> 03:08:27.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because it's one of those, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's one of those like Chrome store things, like they're kind of version iOS.

03:08:27.077 --> 03:08:27.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

03:08:27.938 --> 03:08:29.240
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll check that out.

03:08:30.367 --> 03:08:31.408
[SPEAKER_07]: It plays really simple.

03:08:31.468 --> 03:08:32.569
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too complicated.

03:08:33.369 --> 03:08:35.771
[SPEAKER_07]: And its speed is really quick, too.

03:08:36.331 --> 03:08:41.355
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had a chance to play with too many other people since it is in beta, and I'm guessing they're not usually playing when I am.

03:08:41.415 --> 03:08:43.836
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, it really feels good.

03:08:43.876 --> 03:08:44.957
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like the old school game.

03:08:45.017 --> 03:08:47.519
[SPEAKER_07]: All I'm missing is the soundtrack, pretty much, and it'd be awesome.

03:08:47.939 --> 03:08:48.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:50.461
[SPEAKER_06]: What else have you been playing this week?

03:08:50.501 --> 03:08:52.402
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on the Mass Effect 3 hype train, or...?

03:08:53.246 --> 03:08:55.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, because my roommate's gonna ruin it for me.

03:08:55.727 --> 03:09:00.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's been posting all over, just, two more days, man!

03:09:00.288 --> 03:09:01.468
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like he's partying already.

03:09:02.728 --> 03:09:07.050
[SPEAKER_07]: But he plays through it non-stop, and we all get sucked in because we know it's a solid story.

03:09:08.090 --> 03:09:20.013
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're all... Because me and our roomies are all ex-military guys, half the stuff that happens in the action and half the words, we just giggle and laugh all day long because we heard it elsewhere, too.

03:09:20.073 --> 03:09:20.193
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

03:09:21.387 --> 03:09:25.168
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hide in my room until they come out with a Game of the Year edition and maybe I'll pick it up then.

03:09:25.348 --> 03:09:27.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of what we were saying earlier about Street Fighter X Tekken.

03:09:27.609 --> 03:09:29.830
[SPEAKER_06]: You're taking that approach to the Game of the Year edition.

03:09:30.270 --> 03:09:35.232
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't really see any difference between on-disc content and content that's downloaded later.

03:09:35.312 --> 03:09:36.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, they're screwing you.

03:09:36.772 --> 03:09:42.434
[SPEAKER_07]: It really doesn't matter what medium you happen to, whether it comes early on the disc or later through a download.

03:09:43.616 --> 03:09:48.357
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stuff they're holding back and it's nowhere near what they used to do with expansion packs back in the day.

03:09:48.397 --> 03:09:50.138
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as I'm concerned, I can wait for it all.

03:10:03.741 --> 03:10:07.564
[SPEAKER_06]: is that content worth the $50, $60 I'm being asked to pay for it?

03:10:07.864 --> 03:10:16.229
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, for example, Mass Effect 3 has been very controversial for this very thing about the whole, they have the day one DLC and some people are like, that's a rip off and it should be free and dah, dah, dah.

03:10:16.549 --> 03:10:17.590
[SPEAKER_06]: You really just have to weigh.

03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:20.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, throwing that aside, it's not pay to unlock content.

03:10:21.072 --> 03:10:22.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the content on the disc worth $60?

03:10:23.034 --> 03:10:28.917
[SPEAKER_06]: And for example, Shane, our last caller, I'm sure would say yes, but other people might look at that and go, you know what?

03:10:28.997 --> 03:10:29.798
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not so much.

03:10:29.878 --> 03:10:31.179
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to wait for the game of the year edition.

03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:43.286
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember hearing, I was listening to the early coverage of the beta that TotalBiscuit was doing online, and he was ratting and raving about the content on the disc being unlockable.

03:10:43.406 --> 03:10:46.007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, dude, the game was finished three months ago.

03:10:46.027 --> 03:10:48.389
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's more project space to fill, they're going to fill it.

03:10:51.948 --> 03:10:57.192
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to mention the fact that one of the characters is a character essential.

03:10:57.292 --> 03:10:59.013
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even essential to the storyline.

03:10:59.353 --> 03:11:06.137
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a character they threw in as DLC that happened to be finished before the release date, so they put it on the master disc.

03:11:06.997 --> 03:11:32.166
[SPEAKER_07]: so half the people that are bitching because of what what i'm trying not to be too spoilery about it but half the people that are you know whining and moaning it's like what it's it's this guy it should be in the main game no it doesn't have to be in the main game it was made after the fact when the main game was finished so deal i mean if you if you want it buy it if you don't you know hold on to your money and wait for them to package it all together the game of the year edition like i did with batman arkham asylum

03:11:33.516 --> 03:11:35.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's another one that's had a lot of DLC.

03:11:36.241 --> 03:11:37.944
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Arkham City.

03:11:38.004 --> 03:11:42.291
[SPEAKER_06]: The base game was worth it to me, but I can see where some people get turned off by all that DLC.

03:11:42.672 --> 03:11:43.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots and lots of it.

03:11:43.632 --> 03:11:45.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I might end up buying Arkham City 2.

03:11:45.854 --> 03:11:48.077
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really waiting on any DLC or anything.

03:11:50.279 --> 03:11:52.161
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a solid game without all the DLC.

03:11:52.561 --> 03:11:57.847
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the Catwoman stuff, I like it a lot, and I think it's kind of worth the new price.

03:11:57.967 --> 03:12:01.411
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think even if you took it all out, I still think you'd have a solid game.

03:12:01.871 --> 03:12:04.334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought she was still playable a bit in the main game.

03:12:04.914 --> 03:12:22.484
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's cut out completely see the thing is if you have her DLC they integrate her very slickly into the main story but if you don't have her DLC all her little stuff is kind of cut out just skipped over so I think you see her and you interact with her but you never do the stuff where you play as her and see Poison Ivy and all that

03:12:23.004 --> 03:12:29.005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because, yeah, when I saw her combat mechanics, like, you know what, that's an interesting way to rework the way this mechanic works.

03:12:29.025 --> 03:12:31.566
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of cool, so I was kind of curious to see that.

03:12:31.886 --> 03:12:39.368
[SPEAKER_14]: So, remember what I was saying earlier about how, oh, yeah, it's going to take them, you know, a couple, you know, about a week to have it on?

03:12:39.508 --> 03:12:40.608
[SPEAKER_14]: But they already have it all unlocked.

03:12:41.108 --> 03:12:41.848
[SPEAKER_14]: Hackers already got it.

03:12:42.348 --> 03:12:42.629
[SPEAKER_14]: All done.

03:12:42.649 --> 03:12:43.509
[SPEAKER_14]: Street Fighter X Tekken?

03:12:43.629 --> 03:12:45.709
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, and there's, oh, by the way, they're selling costumes, too.

03:12:45.729 --> 03:12:46.829
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always a way with code.

03:12:47.050 --> 03:12:48.410
[SPEAKER_07]: There is always a way with code.

03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:48.950
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

03:12:49.450 --> 03:12:51.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

03:12:51.831 --> 03:12:53.272
[SPEAKER_06]: Any quick final thoughts you want to get out?

03:12:54.472 --> 03:12:56.133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just hold on to your money, people.

03:12:56.173 --> 03:12:57.174
[SPEAKER_07]: Go buy food and stuff.

03:12:57.194 --> 03:12:58.754
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's stop getting more expensive every day.

03:12:59.315 --> 03:13:00.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the rising cost of gas.

03:13:00.655 --> 03:13:02.956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost more to drive to the game store than to buy the game.

03:13:03.396 --> 03:13:03.677
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:13:04.197 --> 03:13:05.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, take care, buddy.

03:13:05.097 --> 03:13:05.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

03:13:06.138 --> 03:13:06.638
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, later.

03:13:06.838 --> 03:13:07.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

03:13:08.479 --> 03:13:09.639
[SPEAKER_06]: We can squeeze in one more call.

03:13:10.139 --> 03:13:11.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 916-226-9067.

03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:13.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Not toll-free.

03:13:13.401 --> 03:13:17.243
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's even funnier, too, is the fact that...

03:13:19.989 --> 03:13:20.870
[SPEAKER_14]: I just lost my train of thought.

03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:21.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

03:13:22.231 --> 03:13:23.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty then, I'll go back to Twitter.

03:13:23.592 --> 03:13:25.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:13:25.454 --> 03:13:29.797
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a tweet here from Tony Texture saying, Hey guys, just listening live for the first time.

03:13:30.138 --> 03:13:31.499
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully I can get in on Skype.

03:13:31.559 --> 03:13:32.940
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I mention I'm an Aussie?

03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:34.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope you do get through.

03:13:34.201 --> 03:13:34.922
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear the accent.

03:13:36.445 --> 03:13:38.446
[SPEAKER_06]: because you know Americans love the Aussie accents.

03:13:38.526 --> 03:13:38.946
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

03:13:39.026 --> 03:13:49.189
[SPEAKER_14]: The DLC, the codes or whatever, the actual hashes or whatever for all the DLC characters was in a CSV file in the main directory of the game.

03:13:49.289 --> 03:13:50.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you've got to be kidding.

03:13:50.409 --> 03:13:51.530
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems so lazy.

03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:53.190
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:13:53.871 --> 03:13:56.972
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones and take one more call here tonight.

03:13:57.072 --> 03:13:58.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:13:58.112 --> 03:13:58.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

03:14:01.233 --> 03:14:01.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Soulthrow.

03:14:03.374 --> 03:14:03.674
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

03:14:03.734 --> 03:14:04.114
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

03:14:05.091 --> 03:14:11.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Throw Soul Throw, what's on your mind buddy?

03:14:12.077 --> 03:14:13.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the guy that I just read his tweet?

03:14:13.679 --> 03:14:16.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes Are you Tony Texture on Twitter?

03:14:17.402 --> 03:14:19.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes I am Hi!

03:14:19.704 --> 03:14:26.791
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about timing, good lord Well, there must be a hideous delay going across the pond, but that's alright What's on your mind?

03:14:27.291 --> 03:14:28.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the show, how you doing?

03:14:29.189 --> 03:14:29.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:32.791
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say I'm a big fan.

03:14:32.971 --> 03:14:37.134
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been listening since episode 250, so it's been a while.

03:14:37.334 --> 03:14:39.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it took you this long to call us?

03:14:40.196 --> 03:14:41.357
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, I know.

03:14:42.117 --> 03:14:44.559
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought I'd just, you know, call.

03:14:44.699 --> 03:14:48.682
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually, this is the second call I've ever used on Skype, so yeah.

03:14:48.982 --> 03:14:49.702
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it works.

03:14:49.903 --> 03:14:55.306
[SPEAKER_06]: If the first call was to the Echo123 lady and the second call was to us, we can let you know it worked.

03:14:56.127 --> 03:14:58.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what kind of games are you playing lately?

03:14:59.677 --> 03:15:03.039
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing Gears 3, so I'm just going through the Horde mode with some buddies.

03:15:05.061 --> 03:15:07.203
[SPEAKER_01]: Saints Row, I'm about a quarter way into that.

03:15:07.603 --> 03:15:08.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Saints Row the 3rd.

03:15:08.724 --> 03:15:09.345
[SPEAKER_02]: So amazing.

03:15:11.166 --> 03:15:15.370
[SPEAKER_01]: And just going through Street Fighter, Super Street Fighter.

03:15:16.650 --> 03:15:17.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic.

03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:22.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you about this, since you are from Aussie land.

03:15:22.752 --> 03:15:27.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Australia's been in the news even up here a lot lately with this whole ratings board stuff that's going on.

03:15:28.393 --> 03:15:29.993
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, good times, good times.

03:15:30.013 --> 03:15:30.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

03:15:30.694 --> 03:15:35.755
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that some games, you guys, now it's true, you guys have not been able to buy Mortal Kombat yet, right?

03:15:36.263 --> 03:15:37.184
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

03:15:37.584 --> 03:15:39.906
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many other ways to get to it.

03:15:40.286 --> 03:15:42.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the ways that Loki was talking about with unlock content, yes.

03:15:43.729 --> 03:15:52.356
[SPEAKER_06]: But now apparently it seems like the motion has started to create a new rating there so that you can get some of the more adult games.

03:15:52.917 --> 03:15:55.819
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you kind of feel about how your country's been handling a lot of that?

03:15:56.823 --> 03:15:57.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:37.042
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them yeah I've already played Mortal Kombat if that's what you're asking I was gonna say if you're playing Saints Row the third I wonder how that one got through because that one's pretty bad but yeah Mortal Kombat I guess is even more extreme yeah I don't know I think it's sort of like you know a bit more stylized where Mortal Kombat's got a lot of blood you know

03:16:38.604 --> 03:16:38.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

03:16:39.624 --> 03:16:39.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

03:16:40.385 --> 03:16:44.666
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of folks in the chat room are commenting, loving the fact that somebody from Australia is on the line.

03:16:44.806 --> 03:16:45.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Australia in the house.

03:16:46.226 --> 03:16:50.907
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks in chat, Frisbee says, I'm so glad the internet is fast as it is.

03:16:51.228 --> 03:16:51.928
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think about it.

03:16:51.968 --> 03:16:54.588
[SPEAKER_06]: From Australia to California in only a few seconds of delay.

03:16:54.949 --> 03:16:57.569
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's one of the really humbling things about doing this show, I gotta say.

03:16:57.649 --> 03:17:06.672
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we went from doing a show or, you know, being friends, playing at one arcade in one little city in one state, you know, to having this worldwide...

03:17:07.572 --> 03:17:08.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit Talkin' Fest.

03:17:09.633 --> 03:17:11.173
[SPEAKER_06]: We've drawn people in from Australia.

03:17:11.193 --> 03:17:13.134
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually worried about the lag.

03:17:15.555 --> 03:17:17.775
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a question for you three.

03:17:18.136 --> 03:17:18.516
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.

03:17:20.236 --> 03:17:23.097
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the game you love but everyone else hates?

03:17:24.998 --> 03:17:28.159
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's Alone in the Dark for 360.

03:17:28.719 --> 03:17:31.580
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone else hates it, but I loved it, so I don't know.

03:17:32.200 --> 03:17:33.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you love Alone in the Dark?

03:17:35.214 --> 03:17:35.515
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

03:17:35.555 --> 03:17:36.875
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a big fan of the original one.

03:17:37.095 --> 03:17:40.838
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that was actually 3D, but it was terrible 3D, but I liked it.

03:17:40.858 --> 03:17:44.500
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty scary at the time, so I just thought I'd buy it.

03:17:44.700 --> 03:17:47.681
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it cheap, but everyone was telling me, don't buy it.

03:17:47.921 --> 03:17:51.804
[SPEAKER_01]: I only bought it for about $12 Aussie, so I'm not sure what that is in the US.

03:17:52.484 --> 03:17:54.365
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably like $15 or something.

03:17:55.225 --> 03:17:55.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds about right.

03:17:57.028 --> 03:18:05.960
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah so what games do you love and everyone else hates good damn question what game do you love that everybody else hates anyone want to take a stab at it

03:18:07.435 --> 03:18:13.697
[SPEAKER_11]: I have had some people give me crap for liking Fantasy Zone because honestly, I love Fantasy Zone.

03:18:14.017 --> 03:18:16.257
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used to have that on the Master System.

03:18:16.397 --> 03:18:18.438
[SPEAKER_11]: People are like, that game's kind of derpy.

03:18:18.598 --> 03:18:23.859
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually like the Tengen version for the NES even though it's probably not one of the greatest versions.

03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:27.960
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll answer this for you, Blue Dragon.

03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:29.181
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Blue Dragon.

03:18:29.961 --> 03:18:30.061
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

03:18:31.661 --> 03:18:31.921
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

03:18:31.981 --> 03:18:32.542
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd I tell you?

03:18:32.562 --> 03:18:33.022
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd I tell you?

03:18:33.223 --> 03:18:34.163
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one, mate.

03:18:34.304 --> 03:18:35.925
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves it, and everyone else is like, nah.

03:18:36.386 --> 03:18:36.946
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't touch it.

03:18:37.607 --> 03:18:40.590
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked the Evolution games that were on Dreamcast.

03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.751
[SPEAKER_11]: They were pretty good.

03:18:42.952 --> 03:18:43.953
[SPEAKER_11]: And I liked...

03:18:46.839 --> 03:18:50.943
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a number of games that every time I bring them up, my husband goes, oh, that's so bad.

03:18:51.644 --> 03:18:52.705
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, you suck.

03:18:54.767 --> 03:18:55.307
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think.

03:18:55.347 --> 03:18:59.271
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one that I mentioned earlier that I absolutely love, and he was just going off on it.

03:19:00.412 --> 03:19:01.794
[SPEAKER_11]: For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

03:19:03.215 --> 03:19:06.338
[SPEAKER_11]: The usual way conversations go in my house is I love games that he hates.

03:19:07.740 --> 03:19:08.380
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:08.921
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to go.

03:19:10.231 --> 03:19:12.132
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I guess I have a couple answers.

03:19:12.553 --> 03:19:14.674
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of them would honestly be Final Fantasy XIII.

03:19:14.994 --> 03:19:19.576
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I really loved Final Fantasy XIII, and there were so many people that just despised it.

03:19:20.316 --> 03:19:22.037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you defend that with the sword and shield.

03:19:22.237 --> 03:19:23.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

03:19:24.879 --> 03:19:25.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

03:19:25.519 --> 03:19:28.781
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I defend the game, I get why it has haters.

03:19:29.301 --> 03:19:29.361
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR

03:19:50.862 --> 03:19:51.903
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:20:16.604 --> 03:20:17.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have an answer?

03:20:17.725 --> 03:20:18.846
[SPEAKER_06]: A game that you love that everybody hates?

03:20:18.906 --> 03:20:22.929
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say it's either going to be Earth Defense Force or... I love that.

03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:25.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Excite Truck.

03:20:26.032 --> 03:20:27.713
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of people liked Excite Truck.

03:20:27.753 --> 03:20:31.116
[SPEAKER_14]: Excite Truck would be one that was definitely...

03:20:32.496 --> 03:20:32.797
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

03:20:32.837 --> 03:20:34.457
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought a lot of people liked Excite Truck.

03:20:34.737 --> 03:20:35.158
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to say.

03:20:35.178 --> 03:20:36.238
[SPEAKER_14]: It just didn't sell well.

03:20:36.878 --> 03:20:39.300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to pick a game that people don't like.

03:20:39.760 --> 03:20:40.720
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Gal's Panic.

03:20:41.060 --> 03:20:42.321
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a lot of people like Gal's Panic.

03:20:43.021 --> 03:20:43.542
[SPEAKER_14]: Gal Gun.

03:20:44.882 --> 03:20:46.163
[SPEAKER_14]: Gal Gun, it's not bad.

03:20:46.363 --> 03:20:48.104
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I liked that game.

03:20:48.184 --> 03:20:48.784
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fun.

03:20:52.087 --> 03:20:52.748
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:55.132
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading some of the comments in chat.

03:20:55.192 --> 03:20:55.854
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love this.

03:20:56.575 --> 03:21:02.565
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Dollar Bill says, I love Tony Hawk Underground 2, Infinell, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

03:21:03.246 --> 03:21:04.328
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.

03:21:05.103 --> 03:21:06.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I remember.

03:21:06.123 --> 03:21:09.804
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't there a time that you were playing the crap out of that game?

03:21:09.944 --> 03:21:10.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was.

03:21:11.385 --> 03:21:12.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is awesome.

03:21:13.405 --> 03:21:13.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

03:21:14.525 --> 03:21:16.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says Duke Nukem Forever for me.

03:21:17.946 --> 03:21:19.947
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Dollabill says Robocop on the NES.

03:21:20.367 --> 03:21:23.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Chiggers says EVO on Super Nintendo.

03:21:23.868 --> 03:21:26.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of comments in the chatroom on that.

03:21:27.608 --> 03:21:27.888
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

03:21:28.209 --> 03:21:29.149
[SPEAKER_01]: Street Fighter EX3?

03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:31.009
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was pretty cool.

03:21:31.049 --> 03:21:34.730
[SPEAKER_11]: EX3 was pretty good, but a lot of people gave it a lot of trouble.

03:21:35.130 --> 03:21:37.251
[SPEAKER_11]: I really liked that it integrated.

03:21:37.651 --> 03:21:41.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't it start sharing the engine that Rival Schools was using?

03:21:42.332 --> 03:21:46.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when they did, was it Project something or other for Dreamcast?

03:21:46.373 --> 03:21:47.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Project Justice.

03:21:47.433 --> 03:21:48.593
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're talking about?

03:21:50.113 --> 03:21:57.735
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because I think that EX3 started using the same fighting engine that Project Justice was using.

03:21:59.312 --> 03:22:06.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was hoping that one of those characters would pop over to Street Fighter Tekken or maybe Marvel vs. Capcom.

03:22:06.853 --> 03:22:14.895
[SPEAKER_01]: But they might be owned by the other developer or whatever that helped do the EX3s.

03:22:15.195 --> 03:22:17.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, who was your main character in that series?

03:22:17.895 --> 03:22:19.095
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I used Hokuto a lot.

03:22:19.175 --> 03:22:20.096
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the names.

03:22:21.196 --> 03:22:22.956
[SPEAKER_11]: I used the Kendo girl.

03:22:24.916 --> 03:22:25.196
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes.

03:22:25.776 --> 03:22:26.597
[SPEAKER_11]: She was pretty awesome.

03:22:27.177 --> 03:22:28.417
[SPEAKER_01]: The chick with the bow?

03:22:29.738 --> 03:22:32.585
[SPEAKER_01]: had amazing super specials.

03:22:32.845 --> 03:22:37.036
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that you like sort of joust them into the air and then you...

03:22:38.035 --> 03:22:39.675
[SPEAKER_01]: Punch Em Down From Earth or something like that.

03:22:39.695 --> 03:22:40.236
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Moon.

03:22:41.056 --> 03:22:41.616
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.

03:22:41.856 --> 03:22:43.817
[SPEAKER_11]: That game was just so underappreciated.

03:22:43.977 --> 03:22:45.937
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to find somebody else who likes that series.

03:22:46.557 --> 03:22:46.797
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:22:47.318 --> 03:22:50.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we could nostalgia all night long, but unfortunately we've got to wrap up the show here.

03:22:50.979 --> 03:22:54.119
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Tony, I'm so glad you were able to get through, and thank you for calling.

03:22:54.199 --> 03:22:55.120
[SPEAKER_06]: What time is it over there?

03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:56.860
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Monday over there, right?

03:22:58.221 --> 03:22:58.981
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is Monday.

03:22:59.161 --> 03:23:00.821
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have work today, so that was pretty good.

03:23:01.601 --> 03:23:04.702
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 4 o'clock p.m., so it's pretty easy.

03:23:04.982 --> 03:23:05.883
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's not too bad.

03:23:05.963 --> 03:23:06.843
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's almost dinner time.

03:23:06.863 --> 03:23:07.283
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not too bad.

03:23:07.443 --> 03:23:11.245
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gotta say, we do have another Australian that's very close to OLR.

03:23:11.365 --> 03:23:13.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Deke Mann was originally from Australia.

03:23:13.546 --> 03:23:15.107
[SPEAKER_06]: He's moved to Canada since.

03:23:15.187 --> 03:23:18.309
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an Aussie in Canada, but he's the guy who built our website.

03:23:19.569 --> 03:23:21.930
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a lot of great contributions from Australia.

03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Now your phone call tonight.

03:23:23.291 --> 03:23:27.413
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tony, have a great one and thanks so much for the call and I hope you're able to listen again sometime.

03:23:28.394 --> 03:23:28.914
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.

03:23:29.094 --> 03:23:29.854
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, anytime.

03:23:30.595 --> 03:23:30.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

03:23:32.665 --> 03:23:42.997
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the worldly calls it leaves me on warm fuzzies that oh my god this show is like really out there it's crazy I have always wanted to go to Australia I really have

03:23:45.455 --> 03:23:45.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

03:23:46.356 --> 03:23:48.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let me finish up a few of these tweets.

03:23:48.618 --> 03:23:50.259
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a few more tweets I gotta read here.

03:23:50.919 --> 03:23:52.060
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sends us a tweet.

03:23:52.180 --> 03:23:54.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Dust514 goes free to play.

03:23:54.702 --> 03:23:56.943
[SPEAKER_06]: The Vita version is a companion app.

03:23:57.364 --> 03:23:58.605
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember Dust514.

03:23:58.965 --> 03:24:01.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is the EVE Online tie-in game.

03:24:01.627 --> 03:24:02.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's gonna be free.

03:24:02.968 --> 03:24:03.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

03:24:04.028 --> 03:24:06.970
[SPEAKER_06]: The game was originally gonna be $20, but now it is going to be free.

03:24:07.050 --> 03:24:11.994
[SPEAKER_06]: It will still have microtransactions, but it's not a pay-to-win game, meaning it's not a Facebook game.

03:24:12.374 --> 03:24:13.315
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see what that...

03:24:13.735 --> 03:24:15.276
[SPEAKER_06]: really adds up being in the future.

03:24:15.616 --> 03:24:16.236
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the tweet.

03:24:16.276 --> 03:24:18.417
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea about that, and I was curious about that game.

03:24:19.918 --> 03:24:21.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft sends us a couple tweets here.

03:24:21.639 --> 03:24:24.080
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is on Darkstalkers 4, which we already talked about.

03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:25.480
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wrap up the show here quickly.

03:24:26.061 --> 03:24:29.962
[SPEAKER_06]: He also sends us a trailer for Forza Horizon.

03:24:30.423 --> 03:24:31.163
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you watch it already?

03:24:31.463 --> 03:24:54.650
[SPEAKER_14]: yeah I mean here's the thing it's like I don't know if that's it doesn't look real to me I mean really it's it's all like stock footage and then like the title Forza uh Forza Horizon and it's just like someone typed it out so I mean yeah yeah well the new Forza game coming sure I'll buy that but I don't know I don't even know if that's a legit trailer or not

03:24:54.890 --> 03:24:57.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and since I didn't mention it before, I did close the skyline, guys.

03:24:57.631 --> 03:24:58.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

03:24:58.731 --> 03:24:59.291
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very sorry.

03:24:59.311 --> 03:25:00.632
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, we have worldly calls tonight.

03:25:01.252 --> 03:25:02.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Please send us an email with your thoughts.

03:25:02.612 --> 03:25:05.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at Orangelandradio.com or a tweet for next week.

03:25:06.433 --> 03:25:07.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Other quick thoughts here.

03:25:07.454 --> 03:25:15.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya says, for those going to Game Developers Conference, the glorious Trainwrecks kiosk, I remember him plugging this on an earlier show, will be at Play Kiosk 23.

03:25:16.396 --> 03:25:18.597
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm most proud of Ball Buster Invasion.

03:25:19.017 --> 03:25:20.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Think Breakout meets Space Invaders.

03:25:21.197 --> 03:25:21.998
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be interesting.

03:25:22.138 --> 03:25:22.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

03:25:23.258 --> 03:25:25.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was going to GDC, unfortunately I'm not.

03:25:25.739 --> 03:25:28.720
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft sends us the Jet Set Radio HD trailer.

03:25:28.780 --> 03:25:30.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this different from that teaser we saw earlier in the week?

03:25:30.940 --> 03:25:32.021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's actual game footage.

03:25:32.121 --> 03:25:32.661
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not see it.

03:25:32.681 --> 03:25:33.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look at this real quick here.

03:25:33.761 --> 03:25:35.702
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to peek at this.

03:25:35.782 --> 03:25:41.624
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to know if they're going to have the music.

03:25:43.359 --> 03:25:43.979
[SPEAKER_06]: This was from it.

03:25:45.540 --> 03:25:54.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, somebody brought up a good point last week, and that is, you know, there were licenses, yes, but there was a lot of Sega in-house music done for it that was still really good.

03:25:54.325 --> 03:25:57.107
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody brought that up in chat last week, and I think that's important to remember.

03:25:57.447 --> 03:25:59.028
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will get the Sega stuff for sure.

03:26:03.331 --> 03:26:04.251
[SPEAKER_11]: That game was so awesome.

03:26:14.776 --> 03:26:16.077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to play this again.

03:26:25.408 --> 03:26:26.870
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the cel-shaded style.

03:26:27.350 --> 03:26:28.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a great art style.

03:26:28.692 --> 03:26:29.112
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.

03:26:29.172 --> 03:26:30.314
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer 2012 for that.

03:26:30.354 --> 03:26:31.915
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that'll be part of Summer of Arcade.

03:26:32.596 --> 03:26:33.057
[SPEAKER_14]: You think?

03:26:33.925 --> 03:26:34.125
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

03:26:34.806 --> 03:26:35.226
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

03:26:36.266 --> 03:26:36.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

03:26:37.967 --> 03:26:39.808
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the Twitter topics tonight.

03:26:39.868 --> 03:26:41.429
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go to last minute stories.

03:26:41.449 --> 03:26:42.270
[SPEAKER_06]: We've covered a lot tonight.

03:26:42.330 --> 03:26:43.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything to add?

03:26:43.511 --> 03:26:44.131
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, real quick.

03:26:44.471 --> 03:26:50.415
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently it was outed by the Xbox Live Marketplace that a new Fable game is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

03:26:50.875 --> 03:26:52.176
[SPEAKER_14]: That being Fable Heroes.

03:26:52.236 --> 03:26:56.338
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a Mario Party type game that's a beat-em-up also.

03:26:57.078 --> 03:27:02.101
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe expecting an announcement that it's going to be coming maybe during GDC.

03:27:02.241 --> 03:27:03.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it be on Reels?

03:27:04.694 --> 03:27:08.098
[SPEAKER_14]: It probably is because it's a board game, so yes.

03:27:08.319 --> 03:27:09.360
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to go there, sorry.

03:27:11.940 --> 03:27:12.260
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it?

03:27:13.021 --> 03:27:24.186
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, it says players will be earning gold coins that can be spent to upgrade characters and items in both that game and Fable the Journey, which will be coming for Kinect sometime later this year.

03:27:25.246 --> 03:27:25.727
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that's it.

03:27:26.027 --> 03:27:26.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

03:27:26.927 --> 03:27:27.527
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it.

03:27:28.068 --> 03:27:29.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Two hours for Part B alone.

03:27:29.669 --> 03:27:31.169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long ass show tonight, but you know what?

03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:35.411
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some big stories to talk about tonight, so thank you guys for staying up late with us.

03:27:36.592 --> 03:27:38.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God we don't have the afterbirth anymore, huh?

03:27:39.173 --> 03:27:40.775
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and start to wrap up the show.

03:27:40.835 --> 03:27:41.796
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to go around.

03:27:42.117 --> 03:27:47.363
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, and thank you guys for listening to the show and spending, what, three and a half hours or however long it's been with us tonight.

03:27:47.803 --> 03:27:49.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for listening to our show.

03:27:49.425 --> 03:27:50.787
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we do our thing for free.

03:27:50.907 --> 03:27:54.451
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like what you heard, all we ask, help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

03:27:54.491 --> 03:27:55.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

03:27:56.073 --> 03:27:58.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Word of mouth is all we got because we don't have...

03:27:59.196 --> 03:28:05.901
[SPEAKER_06]: A website with, you know, things that people want to visit every single day and read about cheap deals and stuff I was talking about earlier.

03:28:06.682 --> 03:28:09.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even just magazines that tie in and all that.

03:28:10.224 --> 03:28:11.165
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any of that.

03:28:11.225 --> 03:28:12.406
[SPEAKER_06]: So word of mouth's all we got.

03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:13.907
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all we've had for the past 10 years.

03:28:13.927 --> 03:28:16.649
[SPEAKER_06]: And just really appreciate you guys who tell people about the show.

03:28:16.709 --> 03:28:23.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's grow the OLR Army family with, as unfortunately has been kind of a theme tonight, people that aren't jerks.

03:28:24.095 --> 03:28:25.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we've heard about some real jerks tonight.

03:28:26.294 --> 03:28:28.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for tonight's program.

03:28:29.199 --> 03:28:30.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I see you packing up over there.

03:28:30.621 --> 03:28:31.482
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your final thought?

03:28:31.562 --> 03:28:33.305
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is it's hot in here.

03:28:33.726 --> 03:28:34.226
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

03:28:34.667 --> 03:28:35.328
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the fan on.

03:28:35.348 --> 03:28:37.191
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying.

03:28:37.251 --> 03:28:38.713
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:28:39.054 --> 03:28:40.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Corporations are not people.

03:28:41.583 --> 03:28:48.190
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is Final Fantasy XII was also pretty underrated because Balthier and Fran were awesome!

[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

03:28:58.740 --> 03:28:59.501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a game.

03:28:59.801 --> 03:29:00.562
