00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Tonight, March 18th, 2012, a new handheld will let you experience an old system all

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,520
over again.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,760
Diablo 3 finally gets a release date, and one fan goes to the feds over a controversial

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,760
video game ending.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,160
It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but I'll be guiding you over the next few

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,840
hours with my co-hosts.

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
First off, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
How are you?

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Hi Rob.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
What?

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Hi.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,200
I see you're wearing a red shirt tonight.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Yes I am.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
With a Star Trek logo.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Yes I am.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
So you're just waiting to get shot.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
No, it's engineering.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I see.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
So you're safe.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,920
No falling objects on Jamie tonight.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,240
No, usually just, you know, the core will overheat and they'll have to close down engineering

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,520
and someone will fall into the antimatter.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
So that won't be me.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,440
But you can't mix the matter with antimatter.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,120
No, you kind of do that.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,520
Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki, joining us every week.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Hello.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
How are you, Loki?

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm fine.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
You've got your Vita out.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Yes.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Playing Vita.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
Well, I'm trying to have my Vita see my phone so it can tether to it.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
So I can download some, actually no, downloading over 3G would be really fucking slow.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
Yeah, it would be very slow.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Yep.

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
Never mind.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Skip that.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
That's what I thought.

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Alright.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
We have a guest tonight.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
You know, a lot of folks were asking, how are you going to celebrate episode number

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
450?

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,520
And I was like, I didn't realize that was a landmark number, but okay, 450.

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,060
But things worked out just really ironically and just, you know, funny things happen sometimes.

49
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,980
Where we have a guest tonight who's joining us on the program for the first time since

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,480
2004, but he's a name that should be familiar to all you guys.

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,800
It's our webmaster VX Jason XV is here tonight.

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Hi, Jason.

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Hi, Olarme.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
How are you?

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm exhausted.

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,420
Buses are doing nothing for upwards of a day is very tiring.

57
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Go figure.

58
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
You're not much of a flyer.

59
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,420
You're a, you're a busser.

60
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,540
Not anymore, unfortunately.

61
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,840
So I get to deal with the day or multi day trips.

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,480
Well, I, now that they take nudies of you at the airport, I can understand another,

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,200
another very good reason why I decided to stop going to the airport.

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,280
Where your hesitation comes from, like, you know, some people want to charge for those.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,960
Uh, so let's see.

66
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
It's been about eight years.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
How have you been?

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,320
Um, I've been older, I guess, since you put it in those wonderful terms.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,080
I've lived in three different States since the last time I was on the show.

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,960
I moved out of New Mexico to Arizona around the middle of 2000.

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,680
And then a couple of years later, moved out to Colorado where I've been for about the

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,760
last five, bought a house and things are, you know, things are progressing in the life

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
kind of way.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,120
When a dark Tetsuya interviewed me, I mentioned that in the last year I've actually been a

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,400
part of a podcast of my own called the Ask Different Podcast, plenty of a Apple nerdiness

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
and whatnot.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Probably kind of similar, same extent.

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,120
We just talk about what's interesting and any particular newsworthy items or if we really

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,700
want to delve into a specific topic, we'll, we'll spend some time and talk really detailed

80
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,040
about something in particular.

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,760
And you have an amazingly sexy radio voice.

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,880
So I, I, you know, and you know, I say that with all, you know, I, I love you, but not

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,760
like that, you know, but you do have an amazingly sexy radio voice.

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,120
And uh, you know, I'm, I would think that podcast would be great to listen to you guys

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
still doing it.

86
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Or did that stop?

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,520
We, we, we've been off for the past couple of weeks primarily because I've been on this

88
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,880
trip and then one of the other co-hosts have been sick.

89
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
So it hasn't been working out so well.

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,720
But the last episode was just posted, should have been the first week of the month or just

91
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
before that.

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,520
And it's been, it's been regular since, uh, the start of winter, at least we had a little

93
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,320
winter hiatus, but it's been regular since it's been taking its fiber.

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,120
I don't know if you heard, but there was a new iPad announced really San Francisco Apple

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
store was a zoo this weekend and surprisingly has nothing to do with St. Patrick's day.

96
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,960
Did they even have any left?

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I didn't ask.

98
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,000
I, I'm not, I'm not on a spending money trip, unfortunately.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's all right.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
I, uh, I did, I was commenting on your little iPad set up though, cause you had a little

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
Bluetooth keyboard and you, you are an Apple nerd.

102
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,000
I am absolutely an Apple nerd anymore.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,880
It's kind of a culture shock to come in here cause I'm surrounded with a bunch of things

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,000
that aren't white or silver or Chrome and slick.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,320
I refuse to conform.

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,960
This is, this is also temporary housing too.

107
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,480
So we don't plan to stay here forever, but anyway, um, let's see.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,320
So let's talk a little bit about kind of like your history here on OLR.

109
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,400
So you, the last time you were on this show, just put it in perspective, we were still

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,400
a show primarily about music, video games and like, you know, DDR, beat mania, Parappa,

111
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,520
all that stuff.

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,120
So you still play in music games?

113
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,940
Um, occasionally every once in a while, it's usually one of those things where if somebody

114
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,960
we know is over that has never heard of them before, we like to, uh, I have a homemade

115
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,180
pop and music controller, full size, you know, two, two ratio and whatnot.

116
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,040
And so we throw in one of the versions and play some hard songs and they get a kick out

117
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,520
of this loud, clacky game with an oversized controller.

118
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Um, I try to keep up on the two DX console releases.

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,220
Unfortunately, the arcade that did have a machine nearby, uh, went to Utah in the past

120
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
couple of months.

121
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,080
So some of the arcade avenues have disappeared for me, but, um, I, I try not so much DDR

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,820
as much as other things and it's, you know, it's still interesting cause I still adore

123
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,820
the music.

124
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,600
I still listen to it any chance I get.

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Even in the new two DXs, you forgive the music cause I, I'm, I'm kind of not a big fan of

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
where Bahmani music went.

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
It's not as good as it used to be in my opinion.

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
Video game music, music in general follows a flow with me.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,980
I have to have an association with it.

130
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,920
And as of Empress, I don't have an association with it anymore.

131
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,040
So no, it's not as interesting to me.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,080
There's a couple of gyms here and there, but if you ask me to pick a favorite, I would

133
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,280
probably go back to sixth, eighth style.

134
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,840
Back when it was the classics, uh, you were a moderator on DDR freak.

135
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
I was.

136
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,000
I think technically I might still be listed as one DDR free closed.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't know if you heard, I know I was still listed as one and I hadn't looked at the site

138
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
in years.

139
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,600
So highly active moderator as well.

140
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Well, I mean, I even, I told them, I think it was about three years ago when I was kind

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,480
of saying that I'm not going to be around the site as much anymore because I just don't

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
feel relevant anymore.

143
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,680
I don't feel that I'm relevant with it anymore.

144
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,580
Um, and I, I guess I heard that that was happening and maybe I did hear that it closed down,

145
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,680
but not going to the site anymore and seeing the page means that it doesn't really, you

146
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
know, it's not any different to me.

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I was going to be there to look at it.

148
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,880
I think it's still there, but the forums are all, it's cool.

149
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
And the forums were the last great hurrah.

150
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,800
I think that and the machine locations, which I think kind of got dusty.

151
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,180
So I don't think, you know, they're really doing pretty much all the hardcore Bemani

152
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,800
nerds as far as I know, unless there's other sites I'm not aware of are on Bemani style

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
at this point.

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Bemani style.

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,680
Aaron in Japan is still very prominent and zenisivanishur is the trendy name of the week.

156
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
I know that.

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
No, I know that.

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
So, but they've been around a couple of years.

159
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I know them.

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah.

161
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
So, okay.

162
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,800
Um, gosh, what else do I ask a man who hasn't been on the show in eight years?

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
Let's let's talk about eight years ago.

164
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
You and I went to E3 together and dear friends.

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
That's right.

166
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh gosh.

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Yes.

168
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
That first dear friends.

169
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Last time I was on the show.

170
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,680
Nobu was still part of square.

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,600
That was, that was the night.

172
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,560
And I know I've told this story on the show on many times, but that was the night where

173
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
we were surprised.

174
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Remember this case?

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,480
I don't even like you and I got tickets or I think I bought tickets and you bought one

176
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
or so.

177
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,120
I don't even remember how we did it, but we, you and I ended up going to this thing together

178
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,840
and we sat four and five seats down from Nobu who crossed by us multiple times to get to

179
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
the stage.

180
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,760
The punchline is we're sitting there in our seats where we're the very last row of the

181
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
orchestra section.

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Right?

183
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
So, I mean, we kind of walk in there.

184
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,480
We're like, okay, we might not be front and center, but from like an acoustical standpoint,

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
we're like right in the center of the room.

186
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
This is going to be the best place.

187
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,200
We're not the, we're about four seats away from the very, very center of the room, but

188
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,520
we're like really close.

189
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,520
But we do notice like four seats down, the seats are blocked off with caution tape.

190
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,840
And we're just kind of thinking like, oh, okay, well, you know, these seats, uh, maybe

191
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,880
they're broken or, you know, something happened, but they don't want people sitting there for

192
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
whatever reason.

193
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,520
The MC something for the, uh, for the actual venue, something like that, something like

194
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
that.

195
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,640
So finally Nobu Imatsu comes out and the only way we know this is that he kind of, you know,

196
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,240
he peaks out and he's, he's not really dressed in a suit and tie.

197
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,240
He's dressed like, you know, in a robe, he's pretty easy to spot and just everybody stands

198
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
and applauds him.

199
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
This is before the thing even starts.

200
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
They'll stand and they start applauding him and like, we're standing, we're applauding

201
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
too.

202
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
We're like, oh, he's, he's walking over this way.

203
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh, he's walking, he's walking closer to us.

204
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,880
Oh, oh my gosh, he's right in front of me and I need to move so he can get to his seat

205
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
that's blocked off.

206
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,960
And so that was like our, our brush with greatness right there.

207
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,240
Cause you know, obviously the man, I mean Final Fantasy was the music for so long.

208
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,820
So just kind of being able to have that as part of the experience of, oh, going to a

209
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,680
concert all about the music was amazing.

210
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Believe me, I've told that story my fair share of times to a nerd that would appreciate it

211
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
as well too.

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,700
And it's funny cause that wasn't even the section that you wanted to buy tickets for

213
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
in the first place.

214
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,280
You wanted to be one more section up and they were completely sold out.

215
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,800
So you're like, okay, let's, let's upgrade then and not downgrade and orchestra section.

216
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
Yeah, let's do it.

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,440
I was like, well, yeah, cause at that time, a, I was 20 year old with no responsibility

218
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
whatsoever.

219
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,560
B, it was kind of like, you know, why not?

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,700
Is like how many times are they going to do a concert like this?

221
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,120
We didn't know tour or anything like that.

222
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,600
Now you and I didn't go to more friends after that.

223
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
More friends was not as good.

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Sadly, they had a lot of problems with that venue, but anyway, we will, we won't dwell

225
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,640
on the negative, just the positive.

226
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
But that was that the only E3 you ended up going to?

227
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,720
I've only ever been to 04.

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,360
I don't think I've even been back in the state since 2004.

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,960
And again, to put it in perspective, the big thing they showed off that year was the Nintendo

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,000
DS, not the D, not the DSI, and Pokemon XD.

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
They had a very big corner of that.

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
I remember.

233
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
And how was E3?

234
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,920
Uh, Oh God, I don't even remember E3 to be completely honest that, I mean, that was one

235
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,260
of those things where I came out and it was, you know, finally putting faces to names of

236
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
so many people.

237
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,640
Cause it was the big, uh, the, the four of us in the room here now we're a part of it.

238
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
See, I flew out with DDR freaks.

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,920
So there was a whole bunch of people whose names I know and, uh, talked with, uh, frequently

240
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,880
I can finally be in person with, um, E3 was for, for a gamer.

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,960
It was fun because there was plenty of things to look at and get your hands on.

242
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,720
And G4 was still prominent back then.

243
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,960
They had the orange booth last that year, if you remember, and all the, all the college

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,140
kids running around interning for them and whatnot.

245
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm trying to think of one specific thing about the show that was exciting and minus

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,480
the Konami booth, which is kind of a given and the fact that square had a humongous final

247
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,240
fantasy, final fantasy 11 was prominent back then.

248
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Wow.

249
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Wasn't even the MMO of that.

250
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Wow.

251
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Did not exist at that point.

252
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,040
If you can believe it, they might've been showing the early stuff about it.

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I don't remember.

254
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
It was too long ago.

255
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,120
You even PVP'd at E3.

256
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,400
Oh, that was the year I won the computer.

257
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Yeah.

258
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,840
The old show computer was one in a final fantasy 11 event.

259
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Yes.

260
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I did.

261
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
I won.

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
I won the thank you square for the old computer.

263
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Although we don't use it anymore.

264
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Let's see what was in there.

265
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,440
The gizmondo I think was still being phantom.

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Yeah.

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Yeah.

268
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,960
The Phantom that they, they hadn't relegated themselves to a keyboard yet, but the Phantom

269
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,760
was still very prominent there right behind Konami as a matter of fact,

270
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,960
I will never forget the experience of walking in there the first time.

271
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,480
And the very first thing I saw at E3 was Konami's booth and the big game they were doing that

272
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,800
year was silent Hill for the room.

273
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,560
That was the coolest set up I'd ever seen.

274
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
That wasn't that awesome.

275
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,600
And it was just kind of like, wow, it's like I'm at the state fair, but it's all about

276
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
video games.

277
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,640
It was a silent Hill four and metal gear solid three.

278
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Wasn't it?

279
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Yeah.

280
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
They kind of had both going on.

281
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah.

282
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,240
But I just remember the big set up with all the little light in a room with eight or so

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:42,520
systems and it's a room and you're in it and you're playing the room, which I still, I

284
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,160
started and speaking of this, since we're talking about that game specifically, I had

285
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,840
a little silent Hill marathon week, uh, a while ago.

286
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,920
I replayed through the first three.

287
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
I replayed the first one.

288
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I've done that before.

289
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,420
I played two and three, started to get to four and um, I guess it worked that time cause

290
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
it kind of creeped me out.

291
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,900
I wasn't, uh, I couldn't actually make it through that game.

292
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,040
Just the, the pace and the ambience and whatnot got to me for some reason.

293
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,160
And I actually didn't wind up making it through that one.

294
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,740
I'll have to try again someday.

295
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,680
You know, funny we bring up silent Hill and all that.

296
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,720
Um, I don't know if you guys realized the new silent Hill game just came out this past

297
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
week.

298
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Really?

299
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,800
It told the silent Hill downpour.

300
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I did.

301
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,280
I was at fries the other day, just randomly spending time where we're walking up and down

302
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
looking at video games.

303
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I'm like, what's the silent Hill game?

304
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh shit.

305
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,320
They released a new silent Hill game.

306
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,960
I totally forgot about this.

307
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Yeah.

308
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,740
Silent Hill downpour came out and uh, Shane is sending me private messages here apparently.

309
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,680
And this is like a tiny spoiler, but not really.

310
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
It's not a story.

311
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Story spoiler.

312
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,960
It says that you totally get to visit Henry's room from silent Hill four as an Easter egg

313
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,880
and it's still locked from the inside.

314
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,440
So I guess they're throwing in little, little throwbacks to the other silent Hill games,

315
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,280
even though silent Hill four, the room was not supposed to be a silent Hill game when

316
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
it started.

317
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,340
That's why it feels so disconnected from the rest of them.

318
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,080
Silent Hill form was original silent Hill four was originally a game called the room.

319
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm confused.

320
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Not to be confused with the movie.

321
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Yeah.

322
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Cause that would have sucked.

323
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
Um, no, I'm confused with the fact that.

324
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,520
So was his room supposed to be in silent Hill, like the, like the actual room part.

325
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,760
I mean, cause I don't get it.

326
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,880
I mean, I remember there was the portals to silent Hill, but what's his room supposed

327
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
to be?

328
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,080
Do you know how many years it's been since I played silent Hill in the room?

329
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Would it be eight by chance?

330
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,400
I would have thought that this would have stuck with you.

331
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I mean, no.

332
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,480
Uh, anyhow, I'm just trying to figure out, it was all a dream.

333
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
It was all dream.

334
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
All right.

335
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,600
Uh, let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

336
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,760
You always talk a little bit about how is your gaming week and what video games you've

337
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,400
been playing, whether it be new or whether it be eight years old, um, dark soccer.

338
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,560
Hi, how are you?

339
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
How was your gaming week?

340
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,360
Uh, I have another 85 and she's a hoe bag dealer.

341
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,600
Um, she, she's a hoe bag.

342
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,420
I'm dressing her as slutty as possible.

343
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
So you're a blood elf.

344
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
Yeah.

345
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
And wow.

346
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,800
Um, uh, of course, I honestly thought we were talking about saints row or something like

347
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
that at first.

348
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
I, I kind of fell off that.

349
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,720
I should have known better, but I, I fell off some, you know, there's a, there's a big

350
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,840
reveal coming tonight about Mr. Pandaria because the, uh, which is the next expansion panda

351
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
people.

352
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I don't know if you've heard, but the next expansion deals with walking, talky pandas,

353
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,380
and there was a press event last week.

354
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,320
The embargo lifts at midnight tonight, so there's going to be huge information from

355
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
the new tomorrow.

356
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,260
We can only hope that the worlds of saints row and world of Warcraft have collided, especially

357
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,120
the fuzzy wuzzy panda bears, but there have been some early leaks.

358
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,760
Some of the, you know, when they have an NDA for a week, inevitably somebody is going to,

359
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
it's too hot for their hands.

360
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
They got to let it out.

361
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,740
So we've seen what the female pandas look like now.

362
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,240
They look like, like red pandas, although some are saying that could just be one coloring.

363
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
I think it's just a coloring.

364
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,980
And then, uh, some of the videos that show off, like some of the dungeons, I got to say

365
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,300
that temple, the Jade serpent looks amazing.

366
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,260
So can't wait to get in some of those new instances.

367
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
I looked at it.

368
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,560
I thought it was pretty cool, but, uh, I tried to play some more star mine, but I'm actually

369
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,840
stuck on the puzzle.

370
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,180
So that's really about it.

371
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,500
And I watched Scott Pilgrim again for the 50 millionth time on St Patrick's day.

372
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
What possessed that?

373
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
We were bored.

374
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
That's good.

375
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,600
I also learned, um, a new game is called how not to blow up the house with a pressure cooker.

376
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Good idea.

377
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,360
My first time using a pressure cooker made corned beef.

378
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Yeah.

379
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
It was epic.

380
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Under pressure.

381
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
All right.

382
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

383
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,240
Um, I played a few things.

384
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,080
I actually, it's kind of funny.

385
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,800
I'm thinking of going to, uh, just like dedicating a month to playing PlayStation games.

386
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,580
Cause I like realize I have all these games on my PS3 that I'm just not playing and not

387
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,520
enough trophies.

388
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,200
That is true trophy level is quite, quite small at this point.

389
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,120
Uh, but no, it's like a, you know, a little big planet too.

390
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,680
I have to play through that still.

391
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,920
I have infamous that I got from the whole fallout from the network being down, um, that

392
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,480
the play through, um, and I'm sure there's some other games I want to go back and play

393
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
through resistance one, two, and three actually, cause I played through one all the way and

394
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,360
I love resistance.

395
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,440
Resistance was to me when you compare resistance and halo three resistance by far way better

396
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
game.

397
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,680
Um, but I kinda, I want to go through two and three and play through those, but before

398
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,600
I get the beat of one, so anyways, so stuff I actually did play, I played, um, journey.

399
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,780
I bought that game.

400
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,280
It's amazing game, very short, but who cares?

401
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,920
You can play through it a bunch of times.

402
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,680
Um, and it's just, it's a beautiful game.

403
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,120
It's one of those games that like I had people over, I'm like, Hey, you got to see this game

404
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,760
cause it's really beautiful.

405
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,180
So and the big spoiler last week I was trying to hide, but it was brought to my attention

406
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,520
from Bobby that it's revealed in the trailer.

407
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,680
So oops, my bad, but it's a multiplayer game and you don't like I did, I knew nothing about

408
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,600
journey going into it, but when I say it's a multiplayer game, you can't talk to that.

409
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,440
There's no, it doesn't work like other online games.

410
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,280
You have one emote and that's the little chirp that you do.

411
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,640
You can't type, you can't talk.

412
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,080
You don't even know who it is that you're playing with and you might think, God, that

413
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
sounds basic.

414
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
You don't know until the end.

415
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,760
Well, yeah, yeah, I will show you their, their little, I keep wanting to say gamer tags,

416
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,960
but PSN IDs or whatever they're called at the very, very, very end of the game.

417
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Yeah.

418
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,520
But until that point you have no idea who it is and you can't really communicate and

419
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,680
you might think, God, that seems so basic, but at the same time it's brilliant in its

420
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
simplicity.

421
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Isn't it?

422
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Yeah.

423
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,280
Because even like, why do we hate to play games online these days?

424
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,960
Fag, fag, fag, stop being such a fag, you play with a fag, it's noob fag.

425
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,780
Like that's why I can't play games online.

426
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,040
Like it's just, I have to mute everybody.

427
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,960
But the fact that Journey kind of scales it back and you have this experience or whatever

428
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,560
with somebody else where you communicate through this like new method of communication, the

429
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
little chirping is neat.

430
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,200
Anyway, I didn't mean to dominate your conversation, but I had to get that out since last week.

431
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,500
It was pretty cool because you don't really know what's going on.

432
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,880
The game reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, just like even the art style with

433
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,160
some of the characters that you meet later on, not trying to spoil anything, but, um,

434
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
they just reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus.

435
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,200
But yeah, it's a really fun game.

436
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,520
Really beautiful game, it does a very good job of conveying emotion, I guess, through

437
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
the whole thing.

438
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,760
But yeah, it's definitely worth, I think, the 15 bucks to pick it up.

439
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,600
I played, let's see, aside from the PlayStation 3, I played some stuff on the Vita, mainly

440
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,840
just I went back and played a little bit more Motorstorm RC.

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,680
Little kind of frustrated, the controls and that, because I'll be doing a perfect lap

442
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,440
and then I'll run into the AI character or I'll run into a wall because I can't see it

443
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,160
well enough because of the camera sucking.

444
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,720
So that's a little annoying, but I did manage to top out all my friends on the leaderboards

445
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,160
there, at least for all the tracks that I've played, I still haven't played through the

446
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
whole game.

447
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,840
And I do like how it's like, oh, this track's not unlocked yet, and you can hit it and it

448
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,760
says buy, and you can buy the unlock to unlock all of them.

449
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,700
Why would I waste my time doing that, you know, seriously?

450
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,080
One thing I'm noticing about the Vita is that it is moving closer and closer to Facebook

451
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
games.

452
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,720
In some of the games I've played, I'd say I don't like that one bit.

453
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,760
Like it's really like, press this button to buy it right now.

454
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
You don't have to.

455
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Get your recharge right now.

456
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,320
You don't have to, and that's the best part about it.

457
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,000
Why would I unlock all the tracks in this game that would defeat the purpose of playing

458
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,160
the game if you did that?

459
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,560
It's like you're paying money and it's like, oh, I'm done with the game now.

460
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
So you know, whatever.

461
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,100
It doesn't take that long to unlock everything, you just play through the tracks.

462
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,240
So I did that, and you know, it's still, it's an alright game still.

463
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,200
Noticing that some of the tracks are starting to repeat, which is kind of okay I guess.

464
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
And now this is kind of funny.

465
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,160
I played the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita, except the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita

466
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,960
is their E3 2011 demo that they had, which isn't really a demo at all.

467
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:23,000
It's just a demo of a, the engine, the concept, I'm not really sure what the fuck it's supposed

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
to be.

469
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,800
It's basically, it's just shots of the car, like it's panning around the car.

470
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,600
And if you touch the screen and drag your finger across, it sort of tweaks the music

471
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,240
a little bit, and if you hold the L or R buttons, it'll kind of like remix the music a bit.

472
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
And that's it.

473
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,760
And then like, I was like, oh okay, this is kind of neat, you know, while they're talking

474
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
about the game.

475
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,720
It's all, you know, the end of demo, I'm like, where's the racing?

476
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,760
Where the fuck is the racing?

477
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,120
Ridge Racer 10, showroom.

478
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,400
It's just, there is no fucking-

479
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,360
Press X to unlock the racing for only 100-

480
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,280
No, seriously, they're like, buy the full game, I'm like, I'm not even sure what the

481
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,800
full game is.

482
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
There's nothing here.

483
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,480
Oh, that's funny because there's nothing in the real game either.

484
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,120
Hold on though, to be devil's advocate, Loki, it's Ridge Racer.

485
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
You fucking know what the game is.

486
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Like if you don't know by now, what is this, like the 10th or 11th Ridge Racer game?

487
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,960
If you don't know what Ridge Racer is by now, I can't fucking help you.

488
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,480
Well here's a spoiler, okay?

489
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,400
First off, the spoiler is that Ridge Racer for the Vita sucks.

490
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Now I know that it's going to be a shock to some people-

491
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
How dare you?

492
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
It sucks.

493
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,520
And here's the even funnier part.

494
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,640
There's no new tracks in it.

495
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,840
They're all from Ridge Racer 7 from the PlayStation 3.

496
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,600
All of them, all three of them that are included with the game.

497
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh, and you get another three if you purchase the game right away, you know, because you

498
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,400
need to have Ridge Racer, and you get another three tracks.

499
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Or you can pay another like $7 to unlock some more tracks and cars.

500
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,520
Now I've heard the argument that, well, you know, really a lot of the cars that are in

501
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,760
these games are just kind of reskins of other cars and stuff like that with different stats

502
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,920
and you know, whatever.

503
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,160
It's not really, you know, these three cars you can upgrade and keep unlocking stuff or

504
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
whatever.

505
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,920
Once again, you know, we kind of talked about this last week with on disc DLC and stuff

506
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
like that.

507
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,320
It's the illusion of it, okay?

508
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:26,080
Now a game that has three cars versus advertising game that has 200 cars, like I think Ridge

509
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,480
Racer was an R4 fucking amazing game.

510
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,560
I'd rather have that on my Vita because that was just awesome and there was tons of tracks

511
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
and cars.

512
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,920
And yeah, and I understand that, you know, you can race the tracks backwards from the

513
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
get go.

514
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,880
Yeah, it's a stupid way to, you know, say you have double the amount of tracks that

515
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
you do.

516
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,560
But since you can't really, you know, have one and a half tracks in the game, you know,

517
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,400
they're going to have to count three full tracks.

518
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Have you ever heard of a game that sounds so perfect for the rental market?

519
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,400
It's not perfect for the rental market.

520
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,720
It's perfect for a demo.

521
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,000
That's it.

522
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,920
That is a demo right there.

523
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,120
If they wanted, like, you know, to put that game out for free and then have the extra

524
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,000
cars, that would be, I don't think anyone would be really complaining about it, that

525
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,640
it has only three cars, but it's free and you get to play Ridge Racer.

526
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,760
And then if you want to buy additional cars, no one would balk at that.

527
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,880
They would, they would probably, I'd probably buy it.

528
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,280
I'd probably, well, I wouldn't buy it because it'd be free, but I would pay the extra, you

529
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,520
know, the extra money, you know, to maybe download some extra tracks and stuff like

530
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,040
that if it was free.

531
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
But it's not.

532
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,600
It costs $25, which they consider a discount.

533
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,000
It's not a fucking discount because there's plenty of games that are out there for $29.99,

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,360
and considering that a full game is only $10 more, or even, you know, kind of a not so

535
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,720
full game but it's Touch My Katamari was the same price, and I consider that a better experience,

536
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,200
although not by much, but at least there's actual content in there.

537
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,280
It's just, I don't understand.

538
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,520
And why was the game delayed?

539
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
It still sucks.

540
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,600
It still has like frame rate problems.

541
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Weren't they doing graph, oh okay.

542
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,920
They weren't, yeah, they were supposedly doing graphic updates and stuff like that, it was

543
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,400
supposed to run better, and it still sucks.

544
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,040
It's like, what were you doing?

545
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Womp womp.

546
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,400
You don't even have to like, I don't even know, they have all the geometry still for

547
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,760
the tracks because they were in Ridge Racer 7.

548
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
You didn't do anything.

549
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,880
Fuck, just upgrade the graphics from the PSP version, it would have been way better.

550
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,640
Alright, anything else you want to bitch about for your gaming week?

551
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,080
Uh, I played Call of Duty 4, and we're playing with some GPD mods now, which is fun, so we

552
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,840
have what we call Ninja Mode, or the, what is it, Ninja Games that I host because I have

553
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,480
the mod in my system, so when I host it, it allows us to run really fast and jump really

554
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,560
high and it's actually kind of fun with a few people, but then we still play legit games

555
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,480
and I still own all this.

556
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,960
Catching up on some of our comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, the

557
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,040
chat is talking about Journey a little bit.

558
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,780
Tigerclaw says, the only thing that would make Journey better would be music from Journey,

559
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
and Randy-

560
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,360
Wrong, you know, honestly I don't think it would.

561
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,540
Well hold on, because Randy piggybacks on that and says, if you play Journey while listening

562
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,960
to Don't Stop Believin' on loop, it totally syncs up.

563
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,780
Now as much as I love Journey and all Journey jokes aside, it should be noted that the soundtrack

564
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,740
for the game is pretty frickin' sweet, like it's a great, like, you know, ambience soundtrack.

565
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,240
But if you want to rock out while you play an ambient, artsy game, okay, sure, pick Journey.

566
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,280
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

567
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Ah, that's it.

568
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,320
Then let me go to Jason, since you're here tonight.

569
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,360
Jason, what kind of games have you been playing?

570
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,400
The ones where you serve customers and get money for it, by which I mean not really.

571
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,920
No, I've kind of been in a slump for the past month, gearing up for this trip and just kind

572
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,640
of working a lot.

573
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,000
Well now, I know you brought your 3DS with you, because our 3DS is mated when we weren't

574
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,920
looking and did the whole StreetPass thing.

575
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
What kind of DS game?

576
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,480
I don't know if you played any on the bus on the way here.

577
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,760
I surprisingly didn't do anything on the bus on the way here, except for sleep and occasional

578
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
music.

579
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,720
But for what it's worth, when I picked up my 3DS, I have the same set of games then

580
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
as I do now.

581
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,920
Those would be Bust A Move Universe, I think is the 3DS version.

582
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,760
Bust A Move, Star Fox 3D, On Green of Time 3D, and two more that I probably have never

583
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
touched because I don't...

584
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
Oh, Mario Land 3D, can't forget that one.

585
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,400
And at this point, probably a fifth game that I've...

586
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Mario Kart?

587
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Not yet.

588
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,440
Mario Kart, I've really wanted to, but that was right after I lost my job, so I didn't.

589
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,640
That's alright, don't worry about it.

590
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,160
I was gonna say, are you excited about the Kid Icarus game?

591
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,880
Let's say economy wasn't a factor.

592
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
I've never played the original Kid Icarus meaningfully.

593
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,120
Well, okay, here's the thing though.

594
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,600
When did the original Kid Icarus come out, 1984?

595
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,140
So it's been about 20-something years since that game came out, a damn near 30.

596
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,020
So you know, they're having to market this new Kid Icarus game at people who have never

597
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,380
played Kid Icarus, it's okay.

598
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,520
So does it look interesting?

599
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,840
I've not been looking at the news.

600
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,680
It's kind of funny because I haven't been nearly as connected in the last couple of

601
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,600
days as I have been, as I usually am when not traveling, and I've seen that everybody's

602
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,920
been posting links to trailers and all of the hype and whatnot surrounding it, but I

603
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,760
actually haven't watched the trailers.

604
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,000
It'll come out, I'll watch the media, right now gaming in general in the midst of all

605
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,120
this is kind of off my radar.

606
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,000
I guess there are three things that I can say I've been playing.

607
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,640
On the road to 200.6% in Castlevania Symphony of the Night, whenever I get completely frustrated

608
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,320
with grinding out those stupid little blocks that are underwater, above water in the upside

609
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,040
down castle, whenever I get frustrated with that, I go to Serious Sam 2 and then get frustrated

610
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,280
with that in about 10 minutes, if that, because all of my saves exist in the rooms where you

611
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,680
have to survive for as long as possible.

612
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,000
I got sucked into stupid YouTube today watching one of those Castlevania Symphony of the Night

613
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,520
long playthroughs because her classic game of the week had a long playthrough video and

614
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,720
you know how like when you go to, and I was looking at it on YouTube, and you know how

615
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,960
like when you do that, it's going to show you related videos on the side.

616
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,920
Well, I saw Castlevania Symphony of the Night and I was like, Ooh, I want to watch some

617
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
of that.

618
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,480
And I watching, watching, watching 30 minutes later.

619
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Shit.

620
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
I need to go to the grocery store.

621
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
That's how Dan puts himself to sleep is watching long playthroughs.

622
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,000
There's a ton of long playthrough videos out there.

623
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
My God.

624
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,880
And that's exactly why he has a new one for every night.

625
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah.

626
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
And there's like a huge community out there.

627
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,360
He and I will just watch those instead of movies.

628
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm serious.

629
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
No, that's, that's awesome.

630
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,240
I want to see the long playthroughs for Ridge Racer, Vita.

631
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm sure after that 30 seconds, I'll be ready for some more.

632
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Tiger Claw corrects me.

633
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
It was 1986.

634
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
All right.

635
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
My, my bad.

636
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,560
It's 26 years then.

637
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
It's been 86.

638
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
All right.

639
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,600
Uh, well, if that's all you want to share about your gaming week, then I will talk about

640
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
mine.

641
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,360
Although I got to admit mine isn't, I don't have a variety of games like I usually do.

642
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
I've been playing two games this week.

643
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Two.

644
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,480
Bass Effect and Journey.

645
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
You're pretty close.

646
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,040
I, I even put Journey aside.

647
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,160
I meant to play it more, but I can't stop playing Journey.

648
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,680
I play WoW of course, cause I have a rating group.

649
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,400
So I have to kind of play that at a set time every week.

650
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
But when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, I'm playing Mass Effect.

651
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,720
Not Mass Effect 3, mind you, Mass Effect 1.

652
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,920
Hopefully you heard last week's show.

653
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm five years late to the party and I said, I'm going to start from the very beginning.

654
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,580
And I just want to say, because I can do this, you know, on a podcast and you know, we don't

655
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,360
make any money off this show or whatever.

656
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,960
We don't answer to anybody but the listeners and ourselves, right?

657
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,360
I totally misjudged this game five years ago.

658
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,440
And it's something I'm sure we have all done.

659
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,700
You see a little bit, you, you hear a snippet of a song and, oh, that album sucks.

660
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,840
Or you go to a restaurant one time in the food, foods battle.

661
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,160
This place sucks.

662
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm pretty sure in retrospect, when I saw somebody playing Mass Effect for the first

663
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:19,280
time and I even, I remember playing it a little bit myself and kind of going, this is, I think

664
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,180
it was when I was on one of those planets, driving that stupid car up over mountains

665
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,840
and running into the buildings, not on easy combat mode and getting shot the hell up by

666
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,760
the aliens, which is like the two parts of the game that I hear are fixed in two, especially

667
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,640
the car parts and all that.

668
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,240
And you know, now that I play Mass Effect 1 and I'm not afraid to play it on casual

669
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
mode, it doesn't bother me at all.

670
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,760
Like I actually really enjoy the combat and like flinging, flinging things around like

671
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
they're, you know.

672
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,480
I thought you were going to say flinging poo, flinging poo and so forth.

673
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,600
And I got to say, I am really sucked into the story too.

674
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,120
The story is so fucking good.

675
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,320
Like it's just like, it's like I'm watching an episode of Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica,

676
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,400
but I am choosing the outcome I want.

677
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,920
And like, I'm seeing so much about like, oh God, I've got to play this again because I've

678
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,920
got to see how it plays again when I'm a bitch, because you know, you can be the nice guy

679
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,960
or you can be the bitch, right?

680
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,840
So there's so much I want to explore.

681
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,480
I have, I have to admit, you know, who I think would love Mass Effect that it hasn't been

682
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,640
playing it, Jamie, I really think you need to give this game a chance.

683
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
I do.

684
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I'll borrow it when you're done.

685
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
All right.

686
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,400
This, this, well, here's the, well, cause the whole, like, you know, I know you're not

687
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
big on controllers.

688
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,200
I would urge you to check out the PC one because I just think the depth of the story, cause

689
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,600
you like science fiction and all that stuff and I just think it's 1999, but I got it for

690
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,080
12 used at Dimple.

691
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm thinking PC though.

692
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Oh, PC?

693
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Just wait for steam sales.

694
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I'm sure.

695
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Yeah.

696
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
It's 1999.

697
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
If anybody still has any steam coupons or anything.

698
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,120
Um, yeah, you never know.

699
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
But anyway.

700
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Yeah.

701
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,760
But anyway, uh, I just got to say, I think you would be really into this cause I know

702
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,920
you like a good story and I just, just the whole fact that I think you would try to like

703
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,320
romance certain characters.

704
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,640
See what happens.

705
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
I don't know.

706
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,600
Just, you just, I could just see you like, I could see, like my minor Merrill obsession

707
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
for dragon age too.

708
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,960
Well, yeah, I could cause it was even even miles high.

709
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,440
I could see you talking to the guy and kind of romancing the guy, but then you'd be like,

710
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,360
I like this cool Darth Vader chick.

711
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,000
I want to romance her.

712
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,200
That would probably be me.

713
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
See?

714
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,280
So I, I, I have to say, I am surprised you're not, and Jamie, don't be afraid to set it

715
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
to casual.

716
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
You still get achievements and all that.

717
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,800
And then the combat isn't a big deal in the first person stuff.

718
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't care as long as I don't hurt myself playing.

719
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Yeah.

720
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,560
So, but anyway, uh, yeah, so I got to say that I, uh, I'm really enjoying it.

721
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,120
I've already bought mass effect two because I'm waiting for when I finished mass effect

722
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,800
one because I'm apparently not super, super, super far from the end.

723
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,440
I probably have about five more hours to go.

724
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,560
My character's level 33 or 34.

725
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,760
So yeah, that's, that's been my gaming week mass effect and lots of it.

726
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,600
Alan beat it on PC.

727
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,780
He just beat it today.

728
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,040
So I'm like dying to talk about it with him, but not until I beat it too.

729
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,440
So hopefully that'll come Monday or Tuesday.

730
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
We'll see.

731
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,440
How can you, how can you be in that close of proximity to someone and not have an ending

732
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
spoiled?

733
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,920
You know, what's funny cause he plays in the back room, the, the computer room.

734
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,560
Cause he's playing on PC and I play out here on the three 60 and so I kinda, I can see

735
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,840
what he's doing and I kind of look over his shoulder a little bit, but you know, I'm just

736
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,740
like, Oh, he's in a base or Oh, you know, he's, he's in the planet in the car or whatever.

737
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,280
And then, you know, he'll come out and he'll tell me, Oh, did you know if you do this,

738
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,440
you can do this and this and this, you know, you know, you know, in that cute way.

739
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,280
So all right.

740
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
So yeah, that was my gaming week, lots of mass effect.

741
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,920
Um, let's talk about housekeeping, visit our websites, www dot orange laundry.com of course

742
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,120
is our main website, which is graciously hosted by Jason.

743
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,520
And I should also say designed by Deke man.

744
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,720
He deserves a shout out to, he does great work.

745
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,680
Um, and in the upper right hand corner is the, uh, um, extended play box.

746
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,760
I almost said now playing extended play box flashback to PHP, new, right.

747
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,920
Hey, also what we were doing eight years ago.

748
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
And you can find the Facebook there.

749
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,760
You can find Google plus there.

750
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,720
You can find just the steam community.

751
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,080
If you are playing mass effect on PC and want to talk to others through steam, you can do

752
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
that.

753
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,560
And so a good times, all that stuff at orange launch radio.com.

754
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,360
All right, let's get into gaming news.

755
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,480
There's been been quite a bit of gaming news this week, so Loki's going to start us off

756
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
tonight.

757
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,220
Um, so, uh, good news.

758
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,880
If you're an achievement whore, they're going to raise the gamer score allotments for Xbox

759
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
live arcade titles.

760
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Now, right now it's currently 200, but that's going to double to 400, uh, with a maximum

761
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,200
of 30 achievements possible instead of 20 also, uh, downloadable content.

762
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,480
Um, they're going to allow, I guess, um, more, uh, gamer score to be added with, um, a hundred

763
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,360
or I guess a hundred with up to eight achievements allowed per quarter, um, with maximum of four

764
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
packs allowed over time.

765
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,400
So they're going to allow you to add a lot more gamer score to all that stuff.

766
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,120
And this will take a place, I guess, uh, it's going to start, uh, with titles coming out

767
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,520
between April 1st and May 31st.

768
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
I'm kind of surprised.

769
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,680
This is, uh, this is such a problem that there's so many restrictions for Microsoft's.

770
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,560
They're not retail partners, but you know, they're still, they're still going through

771
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
the entire Microsoft process.

772
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,800
And it's not like, it's not like indie games can throw in achievements or anything.

773
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,200
Just wait until indie games are allowed to throw in achievements.

774
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,020
I think that will always be off limits.

775
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,780
I think Microsoft has tried to kind of protect the achievement system a little bit, but they

776
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,000
do and they don't like in some ways they do, but in some ways they've been really lazy

777
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,040
about it because you know, there's some games like wasn't like the avatar, avatar, last

778
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
airbender.

779
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Yeah.

780
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,640
The last airbender, not the, um, uh, blue people movie, but the avatar last airbender

781
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,160
apparently had just easy achievements where it's like literally press X as fast as you

782
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,180
can get a thousand gamer score.

783
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,080
Like really, really.

784
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,760
So some of it seems to kind of slip by, but otherwise, you know, Microsoft's been very

785
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,340
much about like, they don't, you know, they've, they've bombed people's scores to zero when

786
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,720
they suspect that they're like cheating and all this stuff.

787
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Like they're very protective of it.

788
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,760
It's real easy to cheat if you want to, but it's, I mean, they're going to notice.

789
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,240
So you just don't do that.

790
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,720
Hey, look, I achieved all of my achievements in about five minutes.

791
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,800
And if it's not by avatar, then, uh, well, I mean, you can just, you just mod your, your,

792
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,080
uh, you know, actual, um, your user account on your system, and then you can add games

793
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,420
that you don't have never played and just give yourself a thousand achievement points.

794
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,880
But I mean, they're going to notice that, Oh, your, your gamer score jumped by a hundred

795
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
thousand.

796
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,440
That's a little odd.

797
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
I will never forget.

798
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Speaking of getting banned by, from Xbox live because of achievements and all this stuff,

799
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,400
I will never forget the time I was playing dance, dance revolution universe on Xbox 360

800
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,480
for the first time.

801
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,920
And I got the message from strip club DJ.

802
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,520
Does anybody remember that name on Xbox 360?

803
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,320
He was the guy that had like the most points ever.

804
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,800
And like, he sent me a message like, are the achievements in that game are hard to get?

805
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,240
Apparently I was, I had bought the game on release day and I was playing it so much that

806
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,720
I had more achievement points than anybody on that game at that point.

807
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,040
And you could see that on some of the community sites.

808
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,240
So he was sending me messages like how hard are the achievements?

809
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,760
So like, you know, asking me questions, I'll just never forget that because that struck

810
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
me as funny.

811
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
So anyhow.

812
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,840
Well, what do you think though about the arcade games going up to 400 points?

813
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,560
It's you know, in some ways it's achievements, whatever, but in other ways, you know, since

814
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,680
the, the downloadable games are getting more expensive, they are becoming more richer,

815
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
richer experiences.

816
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,000
Like it's not, it's not ports of time pilot anymore.

817
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah.

818
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
You know, we're getting games like limbo and we're getting HD remixes.

819
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Not the time pilots, a bad game, but yeah, now we're getting, you know, other stuff and

820
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,760
a lot of the greatest games to come out are download braid, you know, there's the portal

821
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,800
was a standalone game, you know, for download and stuff.

822
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,660
There's so much good stuff that, you know, it kind of deserves to be bumped up a little

823
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,660
bit, I think.

824
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,880
So, all right.

825
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
So there you go.

826
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,960
Uh, the achievement points are going to be going up, uh, what might be going up or down?

827
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I don't know.

828
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,620
Is Capcom stock depending on a street fighter cross Tekken and how this has been received

829
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:27,520
and on the three 60 not so well, as we mentioned last week on the show, a four player co-op

830
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,700
mode is not on the three 60 version, even though it's there in the instruction manual

831
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,900
and it's there in the PlayStation three version, just so you know, that's when you and a friend

832
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:43,260
go online or you and a friend or local, you go online and take on another pair of people.

833
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,600
And uh, it was addressed by Tomaki Ayano, the assistant producer of the game in a Capcom

834
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,960
unity blog statement throughout the, excuse me, throughout the development process.

835
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,460
There are times when new features are added and we added a lot of them.

836
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,480
And there are also times where we have to make tough decisions regarding things to cut.

837
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,800
This was one of those times this mode is supported in the PlayStation three version.

838
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,760
However, since we tackled that earlier and found the architecture of their system to

839
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,720
be more conducive to implementing it.

840
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,880
So at first we thought they were full of shit because you know, there's other games that

841
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
you can play co-op.

842
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,600
Like it wasn't the first excuse you can't go co-op and go online.

843
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Yeah.

844
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,200
But now it seems like a matter of it's too, it was too hard and we had deadlines to meet

845
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,760
or Sony paid us a lot of money.

846
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't know if it's that.

847
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,960
Well, I mean, you never know if stranger things have happened.

848
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,560
That may be true, but then you should create a second manual for the Xbox three 60 version.

849
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,080
Still is saying, that's just poor, you know, Hey, uh, this mode's available.

850
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,760
Oh, but it's not, it really seems like to me it was a deadline thing.

851
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,400
But it's still very poor taste, it's false advertising.

852
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,520
I understand that, you know, that you had to work on all that DLC that was going to

853
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
be on disc.

854
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,040
So, you know, that might've taken some extra time.

855
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,880
I would have traded kick for comp mode.

856
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,720
It's really stupid that that's even, you know, Oh, it was too hard.

857
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,240
I don't know how to program well enough.

858
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,760
It was so hard.

859
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean, come on.

860
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,880
I mean, this is something that's in a lot of games saying, you know, I think halo call,

861
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I don't know about Call of Duty.

862
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,680
I know Borderlands had, you know, you can do split screen and then go online and play

863
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,240
with other people and stuff like that.

864
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,440
Moral combat had it.

865
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
It's just, that's ridiculous.

866
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
Oh, well, we didn't know how to do it.

867
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,720
Well, I'm sure if you asked Microsoft, Hey, how do you do this?

868
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
They would have probably told you how to do it.

869
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,080
Speaking of Microsoft allowing and not allowing things, frankly, I thought that was pretty

870
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,560
much a required feature for any co-op game to be certified and released for the three

871
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
60.

872
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,920
Uh, no, I don't, I don't think it was.

873
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,720
Um, I mean, I've seen, obviously not cause that happened.

874
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,320
I've seen plenty of games where you don't have to have cause sometimes, you know, doing

875
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:58,160
split screen, um, not every, there's not enough screen space after you split it in half.

876
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,720
Um, well, what I want to know is, you know, since this is not on the show role, um, so

877
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,800
what's everybody think about the doubt, their whole DLC plan?

878
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,600
Oh, I thought I was supposed to do that here too.

879
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
That's all right.

880
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Yeah.

881
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,720
The DLC plan, uh, what, 20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall, right?

882
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah.

883
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,720
20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall.

884
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,760
Um, and they're going to have costume packs as well, which I think was another $13.

885
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,040
I want to say it's 13 different packs for a dollar or something like that.

886
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,200
Well, the release about it really felt like it was trying to butter up the community.

887
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,760
Like they knew that there was this big backlash about it and it really read to me like, Hey

888
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,200
guys, it's not going to be as bad as y'all were thinking.

889
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,720
LOL at you thinking it was going to be five bucks each character.

890
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
We're not doing that guys.

891
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,200
Oh no, we're not complete assholes this time.

892
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,360
We're just pretty big assholes.

893
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:55,340
You know, it's just there, there's still a percentage of us that we're not completely

894
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,960
assholes about this stuff.

895
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,720
And you know, that's, that's great and all that, you know, they're saying that it's going

896
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,320
to be $20 for, you know, all the characters, except there's a problem.

897
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:13,360
It's not all of the characters because you do remember that even though they are PlayStation

898
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:21,240
exclusive, you know, uh, Pac-Man and bad box art or troll mega man is, um, still on the

899
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,040
disc for an Xbox 360.

900
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,720
So that means there's still going to be one more piece of download content that they're

901
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,360
going to have available to, uh, you know, get access to those characters.

902
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
In fact, here we go.

903
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm going to pull this up right now so we can, what'd you say last week?

904
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,640
Like Cole is on the 360 disc, which is ironic.

905
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,920
No, Cole's not on the 360 disc, but the Pac-Man and, um, uh, both Pac-Man and bad box art

906
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
mega man are on the disc.

907
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,400
Uh, so yeah, anyways, here's what it's going to end up being, uh, April 3rd, they're going

908
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,720
to have alternate costumes go on sale.

909
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,560
Those are going to set you back a dollar each, or you can buy all of them for $13.

910
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,480
Um, then they're going to release some free colors.

911
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Oh, thank you.

912
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,960
There were, there were some free things they were trying to look at all this shit.

913
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,240
You're going to get for free costumes and gem slots.

914
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,760
And then this is the pay stuff, you know, characters free stuff.

915
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Yeah.

916
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,720
And then, uh, I guess in April, they're also going to do a free tournament support update,

917
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,520
and they're going to be adding some, uh, three new assist gem packs.

918
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,640
So they're, I guess they're going to be selling those, um, or something, I don't know, um,

919
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,800
which a total of, uh, 60 gems to selection pool, I guess, um, but yeah, those 12 characters

920
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,480
already on disc will not be unlocked until the fall.

921
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,400
Meanwhile, hackers are already been playing with them online.

922
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,560
So wait, can I go online at three 16 and suddenly I'm playing against somebody who is Blanca

923
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,840
or one of the locked characters.

924
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Yeah.

925
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,840
They basically, what they do is they, they swap all the assets and art and stuff like

926
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,200
that and character data for the DLC characters and they move it to one of the regular characters

927
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
in the game.

928
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
They kind of flip flop stuff.

929
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,240
So, uh, but yeah, fantastic.

930
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
And job cap.

931
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, and, and, and on top of all that, you know, cause you're going to have to pay $20

932
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,840
for that or you know what you get by the Vita version, which is probably gonna be like 40

933
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
bucks.

934
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,120
So it's cheaper and has more content.

935
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,120
Let me read some comments from a hit stun in our chat room at chat.org.com.

936
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,600
He has a lot to say on this hit stun says street fighter cross tech and online kind

937
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
of sucks anyway.

938
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm glad I didn't buy it.

939
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,920
The game is clearly unfinished.

940
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Wait until fall.

941
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
It'll be better.

942
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
$20.

943
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,640
I fucking called it, um, making this an $80 game, but I'm thinking not by fall.

944
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Wait until fall.

945
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Yeah.

946
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,320
Because in the world, cause the price will drop inevitably to try and get the extra sales

947
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,480
for Christmas and enough updates and the Vita version is going to be out.

948
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,280
And I'm telling you guys it's on the disc because they're going to repackage it and

949
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,800
just throw in codes that will allow people to unlock the characters for the 60 bucks.

950
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,560
You're going to get it for free in the fall.

951
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Here's the thing too.

952
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,480
Remember how they said they're not going to do like a special, um, you know, arcade edition,

953
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,920
gold edition, whatever.

954
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
Let's just assume that they've sold quite a few copies.

955
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,200
I mean, we're going to say that they're going to sell a million copies probably on, um,

956
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,200
on each system.

957
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,680
Uh, let's just say, cause that, I mean, that's a pretty safe bet considering now to that.

958
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,200
So the greatest hits additional come out.

959
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,040
They won't really say anything, but it'll include the DLC characters on disc or something

960
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
like that.

961
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,760
And they'll, they'll drop the price cause they've done that with like what Call of Duty

962
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,880
just had a rerelease for black ops and modern warfare two with the DLC or at least the first

963
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,880
DLC pack, um, included with it.

964
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,280
Now I don't think it's on disc, but it's still code with it.

965
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,360
And I mean, midnight club LA has done that.

966
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,040
I mean, there's plenty of other games that have done that.

967
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,720
I think mass effect, um, had DLC on the disc, uh, for, or included at least a voucher or

968
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,520
something like that when it was re-released, so I could see them doing this.

969
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm probably just going to get the Vita version to be honest, if I get it, I don't know at

970
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
this point as a, do I need another fighting game that badly?

971
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,960
Yeah, maybe not.

972
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,320
So do you think they got it out in this state in order to allow people to prep for Evo?

973
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,420
Give enough people to get it set so that it can be played as a part of Evo and people

974
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,840
to get their strategies down and actually learn the game to participate in it?

975
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,160
No, I think they just released the game now, so it would make this financial quarter.

976
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,480
I think that's, at the end of the day, they wanted it in this fiscal year.

977
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I think the fan community doesn't mean shit in this circumstance, it's just a convenient

978
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
perk.

979
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,280
I think you're right about the fiscal year thing, because really, what have they had

980
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,900
during this last fiscal year?

981
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,800
They had Dead Rising 2, um, you know, off the record in that kind of thing.

982
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
The Resident Evil 3DS game.

983
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,320
Yeah, but that's a 3DS game.

984
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,360
I mean, I don't think that's, that's like a, that's kind of niche, that's not a big

985
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
revenue for them.

986
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,960
Um, you know, they didn't have any Resident Evil games.

987
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,960
There was no Resident Evil games last year.

988
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,400
Was it Gold Edition last year?

989
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
No, I don't...

990
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
What system?

991
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,600
It was Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.

992
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,020
I don't know if that was last year.

993
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,280
That may have been last March, but that was still a re-release.

994
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:14,120
Um, I guess they had Street Fighter, oh, Marvel, um, was it Marvel vs. Capcom 3, they had that.

995
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,280
But still, that, I don't think that did that, I mean, it did alright, but it wasn't like

996
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,280
big, big, big numbers.

997
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,720
I don't know.

998
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,480
Alright, well, we'll see, um, it'll be interesting when the sales numbers come out at the end

999
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,480
of the month.

1000
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
I'm looking forward to seeing those.

1001
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,320
Meanwhile, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1002
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Dark Soccer.

1003
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,680
Well, this is hopefully something a little bit happier.

1004
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,520
In fact, I want this more than I want a Vita.

1005
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,760
I want it more than a 3DS, because I love everything Neo Geo.

1006
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,480
And there's a new Neo Geo portable coming out, the Neo Geo X.

1007
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,000
And it is going to come with 20 games already built into it.

1008
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,160
And it's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with SD card expansion, AV output, and like I said, 20

1009
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,160
games already included.

1010
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,360
Which I probably own most of them.

1011
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,640
Including Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars, Cyberlip, Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury Special,

1012
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Football Frenzy, Kingdom Monsters, The Last Resort, League Bowling, Magician Lord, awesome

1013
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,800
Metal Slug, even more awesome, Mutation Nation, NAMM 1975, Samurai Shodowns, Sengoku Super

1014
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,040
Sidekicks, King of Fighters 94, which was the best, Ultimate Eleven, Top Players, Golf,

1015
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,520
and World Heroes.

1016
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,280
But when is Windjammer is going to be available for it?

1017
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,280
Really?

1018
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,960
Oh man, I adore that game.

1019
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,840
Baseball Stars is the saving grace in that list for me personally.

1020
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,560
That was a, whenever I came across a multi-cap with that in it, I was pretty happy, but Windjammer

1021
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
was so fun.

1022
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
You know I have that game.

1023
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,560
The cartridge.

1024
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,720
I heard that.

1025
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,680
It's fun.

1026
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:51,200
So they don't have a price up on it yet, but it's going to be distributed by Tomo in North

1027
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,520
America, and that's for the limited edition.

1028
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,360
In Europe it will be released by Blaze.

1029
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,620
It better be cheap, because I can tell you right now, that looks just like a reskin Dingu.

1030
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,620
Because the Dingu...

1031
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,200
The Dingu ate my baby!

1032
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,640
Not that, not a Dingo, a Dingu.

1033
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,560
A Dingu is basically, it was like an emulation device, and it had all the same features and

1034
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,320
looked exactly the same as that.

1035
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,680
And it played Neo Geo games, of course you have to have the ROMs form, but it played

1036
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Neo Geo games and it, I swear to God, the thing is just a Dingu.

1037
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,080
It looks exactly the same.

1038
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,240
And the Dingus, I think they're under $100.

1039
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,760
So if that thing is over $100, eh, not worth it.

1040
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,680
You can make the same argument for the FC Ultras, right?

1041
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,640
The portable, what was it, SNES, NES, and I think maybe even Genesis in a more recent

1042
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
version?

1043
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,480
If you could put a Blackberry phone on it, would it be a Dinguberry?

1044
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,000
No one wants to put a Blackberry phone on anything.

1045
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,980
Cue sad trombone.

1046
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:00,100
And to go back to what you were saying, you're curious about the sales for Street Fighter

1047
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:06,560
Cross Tekken, the first week's sales, Street Fighter Cross Tekken in the US, $240,000 on

1048
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,280
the PS3, and $117,000 on 360.

1049
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,040
Oh, that's interesting that it's doing so much better on PlayStation 3, I guess the

1050
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
word got out about the modes.

1051
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,760
Well, considering that the PS3 seems to be the better version with more characters in

1052
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,960
there, and it works, and it has all these features.

1053
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,960
Interesting, okay, alright.

1054
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,160
I also found out something really weird just now.

1055
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,640
Those sound like good numbers though, yes Starfire.

1056
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,640
That I hadn't realized.

1057
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,000
Ragnarok Online is hitting their 10th anniversary.

1058
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Wow.

1059
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Old.

1060
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And it's still going.

1061
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Just saying.

1062
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And to celebrate the 10 year anniversary, they're banning everything.

1063
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's older than well.

1064
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,320
I apologize because I left the room for a quick minute, but are you going to get one

1065
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,400
of these little Neo Geos?

1066
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
I don't know.

1067
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,400
I want one.

1068
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
I don't know.

1069
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,520
It sounds like a tiny screen.

1070
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,580
Because I mean, seriously, all of the games on there, the ones that I would want to play

1071
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:02,600
are ones that I likely already own either on Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket Color, or a

1072
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Neo Geo.

1073
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,560
3.5 inches is the same size as an iPhone.

1074
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,880
And iPhone isn't fun to play certain games on.

1075
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
Certain games.

1076
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,240
But this won't just be a touch screen.

1077
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Big difference.

1078
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,720
Games that are designed for the iPhone are great on the iPhone.

1079
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,680
Games that they try to port from frickin' Playstation to the iPhone are not so great.

1080
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,600
It's okay with some of the arcade games, like X-Men played just fine, and Espa-ga-ba-ba-ba-bluda

1081
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,200
too.

1082
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,520
Robot Unicorn Attack plays really, really well on the iPhone.

1083
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,680
See, that was made for the iPhone.

1084
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,680
The Dingo doesn't...

1085
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
No it wasn't.

1086
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
It was made for Flash.

1087
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Oh yeah.

1088
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,600
It almost looks like it could be an upgraded Dingo, because the Dingo doesn't have a 3.5

1089
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
inch screen.

1090
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:51,000
It's only 2.8 inches LCD, but I mean, it has the video out and everything, and it looks

1091
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,600
goddamn the same, so...

1092
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,160
It's a Super Dingo.

1093
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,680
It could be a Super Dingo.

1094
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,520
Alright.

1095
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,920
More gaming news, Loki.

1096
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,000
Alright, let's not talk about the Dingo anymore.

1097
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,760
Quick before I make another bad joke.

1098
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,080
God, we don't want to do that.

1099
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,000
Baldur's Gate is coming back, and they're doing an enhanced edition.

1100
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,340
It's going to be coming out this summer.

1101
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:22,720
And of course Baldur's Gate was produced by Wizard of the Coast, or I should say Atari

1102
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,220
is publishing it, but it's based off the D&D stuff.

1103
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,280
And the enhanced edition is going to be kind of like an HD remake.

1104
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,720
They're also talking that they may be doing Baldur's Gate 2 as well, which is kind of

1105
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,000
neat.

1106
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:47,280
But yeah, not much more I guess is kind of out about it right now, but it'll be pretty

1107
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
cool.

1108
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,080
Just to put it in perspective, these are some legendary PC games, and funny enough, I believe

1109
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,840
the original was done by Bioware to kind of bring things full circle.

1110
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,360
I don't think they own the rights anymore, I think that's why they're getting this now,

1111
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,800
but yeah, I'm interested.

1112
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,020
I remember vaguely playing the old ones briefly, but I never, I didn't play them start to finish,

1113
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,900
so I'm definitely interested in this.

1114
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
Take a second look.

1115
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:13,900
What about you, Loki?

1116
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,900
Is this something you might be interested in?

1117
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,800
I never played the original, so meh.

1118
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,920
Nah, not interested.

1119
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Alright.

1120
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,240
Well, maybe this is something that will interest you, Loki.

1121
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:29,520
I don't know if you're a fan of Diablo, but Diablo 3 finally, finally has a date, and

1122
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,980
in case you've been living under a rock or something, and you don't ever check Twitter

1123
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:39,960
because everybody was reporting it like it was news, May 15th 2012 is the date.

1124
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,400
Let me tell you some other things maybe you may not have caught, you know, besides just

1125
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,800
the date news.

1126
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,000
It is an international launch, so the game is going to be available in many different

1127
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
countries all at the exact same time.

1128
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,060
You can digitally pre-order the game now, meaning I guess you download the whole darn

1129
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:02,400
thing to your computer, you can pre-purchase it now, and you'll be ready to play when the

1130
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
game goes live.

1131
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,840
I'm just asking for someone to crack that.

1132
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,240
Well, you know, Blizzard's done this before with some of their other games.

1133
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,860
I think they leave a few crucial pieces of the puzzle out, because, you know, before

1134
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,840
the game unlocks, you know, the launch day, you'll get a patch that's a couple megabytes.

1135
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,240
So I think they conveniently leave some important things out, and don't forget, Diablo 3 is

1136
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,820
going to require that constant online connection.

1137
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,600
Very controversial.

1138
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,720
So maybe that's part of how they're going to keep people out of it.

1139
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,640
That all has to be cracked.

1140
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,640
We'll see, we'll see.

1141
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,480
Well, it was easy enough with the Ubisoft games.

1142
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
Who knows?

1143
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,480
Who knows?

1144
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
Uh...

1145
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
I don't think that's a very fair comparison.

1146
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
Yeah, well...

1147
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,480
Blizzard and Ubisoft.

1148
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
They're not...

1149
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Well, see, here's the thing.

1150
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,240
Blizzard's claiming, anyway, they're not doing it for DRM.

1151
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,820
They're doing it for the...

1152
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,000
They don't want people cloning the items and all that, like all the item distribution

1153
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,680
is going through the servers and all that.

1154
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,680
I'm just saying.

1155
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
All right.

1156
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,680
We'll see.

1157
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,680
We'll see.

1158
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,680
I know what they're saying.

1159
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,680
Hackers gonna hack.

1160
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,920
So we'll see if people get into this before May 15th, but it didn't happen with Starcraft

1161
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
2.

1162
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
I don't know.

1163
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,440
Is that rule 35?

1164
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,680
If it exists, it's hacked?

1165
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,760
Yeah, well, you know the old saying, haters gonna hate.

1166
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,100
It's just like, hackers gonna hack.

1167
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,900
It's the same thing.

1168
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,740
We always talk about this company says, this device is unhackable.

1169
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,740
Hackers gonna hack.

1170
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,740
Huh?

1171
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,740
Master's gonna bait.

1172
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,560
Yes, master's gonna bait.

1173
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,560
Dingus gonna...

1174
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,720
All right.

1175
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,540
By the way, if you want to get your free copy of Diablo III for signing up for the World

1176
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,240
of Warcraft Blood Pact.

1177
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,080
Actually, they call it something else, annual pass or something, but basically you're signing

1178
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:36,100
your life away to Blizzard saying, yes, Blizzard, I will pay you penance for a full year and

1179
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,280
you will give me a flying horse.

1180
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,520
You will give me a beta access to panda people, pandaria.

1181
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,320
I want to sign up.

1182
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,160
And you get your free copy of Diablo.

1183
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,520
Well, Dark Soccer, if you want to sign up, you got to do it before May 1st, because that's

1184
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,760
the day the deal is done and you will not be able to do that anymore.

1185
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,320
Also, if you feel like it, you can get the collector's edition, $99.99 for Diablo III

1186
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,320
collector's edition.

1187
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,360
That would only be in stores though, just so you know, because it's kind of hard to

1188
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,280
do a online collector's edition.

1189
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,280
Yeah.

1190
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,600
You can't download a specially crafted USB drive through your computer.

1191
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,800
That would be a little difficult, but you could get fairy wings for your character,

1192
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,160
which apparently is part of the deluxe pack-in collector's edition.

1193
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,160
There you go.

1194
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,160
All right.

1195
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,960
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us next in gaming news?

1196
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,920
Well, in other news, there is a very happy news for all of us Portal 2 fans.

1197
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,200
They won the BAFTA for the British Academy.

1198
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,560
My God, it's been a year and it's still winning awards.

1199
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,240
Well, they beat out Skyrim.

1200
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
Skyrim got nothing.

1201
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,240
Wow.

1202
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,240
Yeah.

1203
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,560
So- For you, Portal 2, you go, Portal 2, and none

1204
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,780
for Elder Scrolls V. Well, basically, the other, yeah, the big

1205
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:57,440
rivals that it had was Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and Deus Ex.

1206
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:08,960
And it won, I believe, three awards for design, for story, and it looks like game of the year.

1207
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,340
So as far as others that won, Battlefield 3 won the public vote, so it had the game

1208
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,320
award of 2011, and the BAFTA for online multiplayer and audio.

1209
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,840
But that's like the people's choice award, and you know, who-

1210
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,840
But it's still-

1211
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
Who watches that?

1212
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,440
It's still, it's pretty, well-

1213
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,440
I'm kidding.

1214
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
It is a big deal.

1215
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,080
But Portal 2, you know, I just think it's funny that Skyrim got nothing, and Deus Ex

1216
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,440
also got nothing, which was supposed to be a pretty good game.

1217
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh, yeah.

1218
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Oh, yeah.

1219
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,160
And, oh, it only took about five seconds, and there's your joke.

1220
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,120
Sturlok says, Skyrim took an arrow to the knee.

1221
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,160
No, no, no.

1222
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,160
It deserves more.

1223
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,880
The arrow to the dinghy in about a minute if you make that joke again.

1224
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,800
It deserves more than them.

1225
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:01,920
And Acidic Vampire, now this is a great joke, Acidic Vampire asks, was the award a potato?

1226
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,280
A potato.

1227
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,280
So here's what won.

1228
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:14,180
Batman Arkham City won for action, artistic achievement was Rayman Origins, debut game

1229
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,760
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet-

1230
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,240
Oh, I heard a scoff over there on Rayman Origins.

1231
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,920
All I have to say, play that on a Vita.

1232
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
My god.

1233
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,920
It is gorgeous.

1234
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Is so-

1235
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,440
Portal 2 and best game.

1236
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,960
Design was Portal 2, family was LittleBigPlanet 2, game innovation LittleBigPlanet 2, mobile

1237
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:39,640
and handheld was PEGL HD, go fig, online browser was Monstermind, online multiplayer Battlefield

1238
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,980
3.

1239
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,980
This is cool.

1240
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,520
Music, LA Noire, and performer Mark Hamill as the Joker, which was his last time playing

1241
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,520
the Joker.

1242
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,520
Yes.

1243
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
In Arkham City.

1244
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,960
For sports and fitness, Connect Sports 2, for story, Portal 2, strategy, Total War Shogun

1245
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,200
2, BAFTA wants to watch award TikTok Toys, and game award of 2011 was Battlefield 3.

1246
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,000
At least PopCap took mobile and not something by Zynga, I don't know what the eligibility

1247
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,200
is, but I'm fine with PEGL winning a mobile award.

1248
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,080
Now, apparently with Valve going up to the podium so many times and making speeches,

1249
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,040
they actually dedicated one of their speeches to Bethesda, the makers of Skyrim.

1250
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:28,240
It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal, you get nothing, you lose, good day

1251
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,240
sir.

1252
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,320
Well that's very unsportsmanlike of them, that was a pretty rude speech.

1253
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
I love Gene Wilder.

1254
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,680
I know, we're not hating on them, before you send in the angry, Skyrim is a good game,

1255
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,120
you should not make fun of it, I know Skyrim is a good game, it's a great game, it's a

1256
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:47,120
phenomenal game, it's a buggy as fuck game, but it's good.

1257
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:52,220
It's just, for me, Portal 2, oh my god it was like perfect, so I'm happy to hear it's

1258
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,000
winning all these awards, even overseas.

1259
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,180
Alrighty, let's travel around the world and check out some games that might win awards

1260
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:05,880
next year, or maybe not, let's see what releases are coming out this week around the world.

1261
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,040
We'll start with the US, Loki.

1262
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,000
Absolutely, no I'm just kidding, there's actually stuff coming out this week, Ninja Gaiden 3

1263
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,280
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, including there's even a fancy version that's not necessarily

1264
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:27,600
made by Tecmo Koei, but it's from, was it, oh man I can't remember the publisher for

1265
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
it.

1266
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,920
Anyways, it just comes with this really cheesy move sword attachment that you can swing around

1267
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:41,480
with because the target audience for Ninja Gaiden is going to be someone that's interested

1268
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,920
in crap that attaches to your move controller, or even playing with the move controller in

1269
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
that game.

1270
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:52,200
Because we haven't had enough projectiles breaking TVs, now we have a mock sword to

1271
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,600
do it with.

1272
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
Exactly.

1273
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,600
Recipe.

1274
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,540
And then, of course, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1275
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:06,760
this week as well, a game called Gogo's Crazy Bones.

1276
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,220
I'm guessing based off of a toy, I'm not really sure.

1277
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:16,520
Let's see, we also have Dirt 3 The Complete Edition, which is going to be re-released

1278
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:24,440
with Dirt 3 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Armored Core 5 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360,

1279
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:31,840
Silent Hill HD Collection on PS3 and 360, Pampered, or Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets

1280
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Resort for the 3DS, oooh!

1281
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Got it pre-ordered?

1282
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,800
No, I don't have that one pre-ordered, but let's-

1283
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,960
Please tell me more about what it, Pampered Pets, Polly picked a pack of pickled pepper

1284
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
pampered pets-

1285
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,400
It's Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort, it's where you put sunglasses and bows on,

1286
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,400
like, animals.

1287
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,400
Wasn't that a really bad episode of Pokemon?

1288
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,960
There is an audience for this.

1289
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:01,360
I just want to point out, this goes back to an argument, it's convenient we have a guest

1290
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,360
on the show who hasn't been here for about 8 years, because I'm about to do an argument

1291
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,960
that's about 5 years old.

1292
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:13,840
It astounds me that we can get Polly's peppered pickled pals and pampering game, but we can't

1293
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,840
get President Cat.

1294
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,400
The fuck is wrong with this country?

1295
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,200
It's this country, and that's what the fuck wrong with it.

1296
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
That's not all.

1297
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:30,480
In case Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort is not for you, let's ride Best of Breed 3D

1298
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,480
for the 3DS.

1299
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,960
That's right, it is a horse racing.

1300
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,280
Does that come with a move attachment in your butt?

1301
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,280
It is not.

1302
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,720
Let's ride.

1303
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
For the Kinect-

1304
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,680
Instead of friending your butt, it'll ride your butt.

1305
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:52,600
Kinect Rush, a Disney Pixar adventure on the Xbox 360, and then of course, let's see, rounding

1306
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:58,880
things out, Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai for the PC, and Kid Icarus Uprising

1307
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,800
for the 3DS.

1308
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,080
That's it.

1309
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,560
Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.

1310
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,880
On the 3DS, there's a brand new 3DS.

1311
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,600
Okay, it's not a reskin or anything like that, it's just a new color, but Cobalt Blue will

1312
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:18,080
be available from March the 22nd in Japan, so if you want Cobalt Blue, there you go.

1313
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:23,280
In Hikari Shinwa, Palutena no Kagami comes out on March 22nd in Japan.

1314
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,280
Anyone know what that is?

1315
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,280
Huh?

1316
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Huh?

1317
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
That's-

1318
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
That's Kid Icarus.

1319
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
That is, that's their version of Kid Icarus.

1320
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
So there you go.

1321
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,080
Apparently, there's also some 3DSs coming out in pink and white.

1322
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:37,240
I think those colors already exist, but now they will have Mario 3D Land as a pack-in

1323
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,240
game.

1324
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,960
So those will be out very soon on the 24th in Japan as well.

1325
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,040
Let's go over to the Vita and see what the Vita's getting this week.

1326
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,720
Little Busters, converted edition.

1327
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,320
Is that like Little Deviants?

1328
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,320
No.

1329
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,120
That's definitely not Little Deviants.

1330
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,280
These girls look like Deviants of a different sort.

1331
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,120
But Little Busters is, you know, another one of those anime-

1332
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,120
Dating sim!

1333
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,080
Yeah, probably.

1334
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,180
And let's see, what else is coming out?

1335
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,760
Checking quickly on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1336
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,200
PlayStation 3, quite a bit.

1337
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,440
Devil May Cry HD Collection.

1338
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,360
Fallout New Vegas, the ultimate edition, Ninja Gaiden 3, regular and collector's edition.

1339
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:26,160
A-to-Teki Yugi Mugen Souls comes out this week from Compile.

1340
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,160
Wait a minute.

1341
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,160
Compile!

1342
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
Compile's back?

1343
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,680
Compile never went away.

1344
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,160
Who made Guardian Legend?

1345
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,960
Compile?

1346
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,400
I thought they were not around anymore, because that was the reason we weren't getting a new

1347
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,800
Guardian Legend game.

1348
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,500
You can get- Compile made other games.

1349
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,160
I thought they broke up years ago.

1350
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,800
Hold on, let me do some research.

1351
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:53,960
I need to know if Compile is back and making this game, which actually looks kind of cute,

1352
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,520
because it's like anime babes, but there's definitely like these action-y sequences,

1353
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:05,800
and then there's this whole little like, uh-oh, you might see my naughty bits if they weren't

1354
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,380
covered in secret tape.

1355
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:12,320
They were famed for developing shooters and puzzle games such as Alest and Puyo Puyo.

1356
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,680
Following the bankruptcy of Compile in two- okay, that was 2002, site was up until 2007,

1357
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:26,480
where it redirected to Compile Station, owned by D4 Enterprise, Inc., and, uh, company spun

1358
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,680
off Milestone that had arcade shoot-em-ups, and Compile Heart hopes to revive the Compile

1359
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,640
brand name with the assistance of former Compile employees like Puyo Puyo creator Mu Nhatani.

1360
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,960
Okay, so apparently Compile has been- And they made the Spriggan game.

1361
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,680
Compile- I've heard of Compile Heart, so Compile has been to the moon and back, so, um, okay,

1362
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,840
now- So bankruptcy wasn't necessarily the end of

1363
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
the company.

1364
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,720
Well, can I just, just for a moment, moment say, I'd like to please compile, if you're

1365
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,040
listening, consider, you know, it's been what, 26 years and we're getting a new Kid Icarus

1366
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,040
game?

1367
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
I think the time has come for us to get a new Guardian Legend.

1368
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
We need a new Gartic.

1369
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
Gartic?

1370
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,040
They need to- Gartic 3.

1371
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,040
You know what they need to do?

1372
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,040
What?

1373
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,480
They need to release Gartic and Gartic 2, because we didn't get Gartic over here.

1374
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
Right, no we didn't.

1375
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,480
We got the second one as the Guardian Legend.

1376
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,560
That's the MSX game, right?

1377
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,920
So they need to do, like, the Gartic special edition, and then give us Gartic 3.

1378
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,560
Oh, amen to that.

1379
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,440
I will drop the President- I need to bust out that MSX emulator.

1380
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,960
I will drop the President Cat thing right now for that.

1381
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:35,760
I would give, um, a square inch of my flesh, probably from my left arm, in exchange for

1382
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,260
Gartic 3.

1383
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,160
I'm telling you, the Guardian, I know we talk about it a lot on this show, for those of

1384
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,720
you that haven't heard a lot of OLR in the past, the Guardian Legend is, like, the greatest

1385
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,280
8-bit game you probably missed.

1386
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,320
But here's, like, the other big games that they did.

1387
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,320
They did Xanac.

1388
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,320
Oh yeah.

1389
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,320
Alest, which, um, I have Robo-Alest.

1390
01:07:53,320 --> 01:08:00,400
Gunhead, Spriggan, and there's also the big Spriggan anime too, remember?

1391
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,280
But they did that for PC Engine, and then there was, like, um, they did a few Dungeon

1392
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,160
Crawlers, like I said, Pio Pio, and, uh, Golvalius, do you remember that?

1393
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:17,520
They also did two pinball games for the TurboGrafx-16, can you guess what they were?

1394
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,520
No what?

1395
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,760
Wait, Tur- Alien Crush, and Devil's Crush.

1396
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,920
Oh shit, those are some big games.

1397
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:32,800
Blazing Lasers, uh, Choplifter, Ghostbusters, um, we said Gartic, uh, Lode Runner.

1398
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,440
And this is all Wikipedia, so you know it's true.

1399
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:43,760
Well, you can, they did M.U.S.H.A., uh, Power Strike, uh, R-Type, the Sega 3 R-Type, the

1400
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
Mark 3, sorry.

1401
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,280
This could be a compile lovefest all night long, but, what?

1402
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
And, Shadowrun.

1403
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,280
Oh wow.

1404
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,280
Compile's great.

1405
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,760
Anyway, so compile, now that you're back together, um, we have a new project you can

1406
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
get on.

1407
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Gartic.

1408
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
Gartic.

1409
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:01,720
Alright, uh, 360, also gets the Devil May Cry HD collection, again this is Japan, don't

1410
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,840
forget, the Kinect Rush, Disney Pixar Adventure, Ninja Gaiden 3, Collectors, and Regulars Edition.

1411
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,640
There you go, let's go to the UK.

1412
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,440
Uh, send me a ticket, I wish.

1413
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:22,120
Okay, as far as stuff that's out in the UK, on the 21st is Rayman 3 HD, on the 22nd we

1414
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:27,760
have Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Wing Commander Saga The Darkest Dawn, and yesterday, all

1415
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,520
of the, um, the last two being on PC.

1416
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:36,840
On the 23rd, Armored Core 5, Kid Icarus Uprising, Ninja Gaiden 3, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond,

1417
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:43,240
Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City, and Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai.

1418
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,240
Bleh.

1419
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,120
Oh, that's it.

1420
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,360
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the

1421
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,880
week, but first, some stories on new things.

1422
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,840
Alright, um, let's talk a little bit about Kickstarter.

1423
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,520
I know, you're probably sick and tired of hearing about Kickstarter, but, you know,

1424
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:10,360
Double Fine's Kickstarter just finished, um, with 3.3 million dollars.

1425
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,960
That's a lot of money for Kickstarter.

1426
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,960
And for them.

1427
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,160
Um, but yes, uh, way more than they were hoping to get with the, you know, 400,000 being the

1428
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
goal.

1429
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,800
Um, and of course, you know, they're gonna be, uh, doing a lot of extra content because

1430
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,800
of that.

1431
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,960
Um, and of course, you know, Schaeffer, or Tim Schaeffer was quoted saying, I don't wanna

1432
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,920
say this is the end of the whole game industry as we know it.

1433
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:41,680
It's not, it's not, um, but, you know, it's nice that they don't necessarily need publishers

1434
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,240
to make games like this, cause honestly, who would greenlight a public, you know, an adventure

1435
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,320
game, an old school adventure game, um, nowadays.

1436
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,200
It's something that they don't think would sell.

1437
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,900
But I think also maybe success of these types of games might convince publishers that these

1438
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,960
types of games still do alright.

1439
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,440
Just kidding.

1440
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,240
Um, and if you're looking, if you maybe missed out on the whole funding of the Double Fine

1441
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,720
adventure and you're still wondering, hey, where can I throw my money for an extended

1442
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:16,800
pre-order on something, uh, Wasteland 2 has a Kickstarter, um, going for it now.

1443
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:23,320
Now Wasteland is kind of, I would say like the inspiration for the Fallout games, um,

1444
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:31,400
they were hoping to raise, um, $900,000, uh, for, you know, their game and of course already

1445
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,720
have hit that goal and then beyond that and they still have over, um, you know, almost

1446
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:45,120
a month left to go and, uh, now of course, um, they're looking to, um, you know, see

1447
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,720
if they've got, you know, they can reach $1.5 million and they're going to add more, um,

1448
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,600
content to the game and that kind of stuff.

1449
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:58,020
Also porting it to other, um, platforms like OSX and that kind of stuff.

1450
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,220
So, um, you can check out Kickstarter for that and some other projects.

1451
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:08,580
Hopefully though not contributing to the very vague, poorly misspelled, um, MMO project

1452
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,280
from some strange millionaire who seriously looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt

1453
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,080
and Repus, so, uh, maybe avoid that one.

1454
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:28,240
All right, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, um, is this a trend we like seeing in gaming?

1455
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:35,620
Um, I mean, it's, it's, I don't see why we, why we wouldn't like it.

1456
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:40,160
I don't really see what the downside is other than, you mean, it's one of those things like

1457
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,640
if you don't want to support it, then you don't support it.

1458
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,000
It's no one's forcing you to do, you know, put down money for it.

1459
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,240
However, I see a couple, you know, things that are kind of wrong with it.

1460
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:56,200
I mean, cause one basically Kickstarter, a lot of it, people are contributing, not necessarily

1461
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,160
because they support a project because they want the goodies that they get from, you know,

1462
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,160
donating.

1463
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,260
They have different levels of money that you put down and you get different rewards based

1464
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,260
on that.

1465
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,120
And that's what people want to do with it.

1466
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,440
Um, you know, I know I've only contributed to one thing so far, which is, you know, a

1467
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,680
video project done by Freddie Wong because I love all of his videos.

1468
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,040
But you know, I get, you know, with that a, you know, Blu-ray copy of the movie, a signed

1469
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,040
poster by the, you know, the cast and that kind of stuff.

1470
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,720
So there are little things that are kind of neat from it, but at the same time I just

1471
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,160
support, you know, the guy and his work and stuff.

1472
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,360
But some of these, you know, games, a lot of the, um, things from the Kickstarter are

1473
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,200
like, okay, you get a copy of the game.

1474
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:42,260
So it's like a guaranteed sale right there, um, or guaranteed pre-sale if you will.

1475
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,360
But some of them are like, you know, ridiculous amounts people are contributing, like $10,000

1476
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,080
or, um, you know, a couple hundred dollars.

1477
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:55,520
There's one I saw for a, uh, it's a third edition for some, like a book called High

1478
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,040
Score, which is talking about classic games and stuff like that.

1479
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,360
I have that book.

1480
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,640
And they're trying to put out a third edition of it.

1481
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:08,280
And for the $250 level, you can have dinner with a bunch of these like classic game people,

1482
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:16,000
everyone from Peter Molyneaux to, uh, uh, what's his name, the guy behind the Sims series.

1483
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Will Wright.

1484
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Will Wright.

1485
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yes.

1486
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You can have dinner with him.

1487
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,960
Um, just a bunch of really, you know, classic developers.

1488
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,040
Shit, I'd do that just for the experience maybe.

1489
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,040
I don't know.

1490
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,440
I'm a little eh on Kickstarter.

1491
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,480
Like the only things that bugged me about it is a people need to realize Kickstarter

1492
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:38,880
gets 5%, which I, I re they got out of money to they, what, Hey, America's about the capitalism.

1493
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,720
They came up with a great idea and they're taking their share.

1494
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,880
You can't fault him for that.

1495
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,720
But like that, you know, I personally would not like to use Kickstarter for that reason.

1496
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,520
But the other thing that, that really bugs me is that some of the projects, and I'm not

1497
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,600
going to name names, but one in particular that I saw in there felt really ex exploitative

1498
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
to me.

1499
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:03,020
Like it was just exploiting for money for things that I would argue you don't need that

1500
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,500
kind of money for.

1501
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,120
And this type of record was being broken like 10 times over, which props to them for having

1502
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,760
that kind of audience that would just give and give and give and give that kind of money.

1503
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,080
That's that's wonderful.

1504
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:22,560
Um, but I just think the money would be better spent on charity, but that's me.

1505
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,920
I just think you have to be very careful about what you're donating to and think really hard

1506
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
about it.

1507
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,920
Think really hard about it.

1508
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,880
But Rob, I would just always thought, you know, how much better would this show be if

1509
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,680
we had a swanky office?

1510
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,040
Not don't go there.

1511
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,720
Don't don't start stuff.

1512
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,320
I mean, I could just throw one of those up and say, who wants to support me?

1513
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,960
And but that's, but you see, here's the thing.

1514
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,080
As much as you could do that, that's when Kickstarter starts to get a little ridiculous.

1515
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
You know what I mean?

1516
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
It's easy.

1517
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
That's the point.

1518
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,760
It's the, uh, it's the online equivalent of standing out on the street corner with a tin

1519
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,560
can begging for change.

1520
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,200
I mean, I don't think any of us want to see it turn into that.

1521
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,720
So yeah, I mean, here's what I would think.

1522
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:08,840
And granted, I think it would be kind of cool to do a Kickstarter just for funding like

1523
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:09,840
merchandise.

1524
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,120
Cause a lot of times, like, you know, if you're merchandising for like even say like our show

1525
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,320
or something like that, it costs money to make t-shirts and stuff and whether, you know,

1526
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,080
that way it's almost like a pre-sale for merchandise.

1527
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:27,800
You know, I mean, that would be the only intent for it, but, um, I don't know, that'd be the

1528
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,800
only thing I could see.

1529
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,920
You know, if you want to donate the proceeds, you could do that, but, um, I mean, that's

1530
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,360
the only, cause I mean, you're basically using, that's what people use it for anyways, is

1531
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,720
merchandise for a lot of it.

1532
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,400
Um, and some of which I really wish I'd gotten in on, you know, like Cards Against Humanity.

1533
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,720
Fuck, I love that game, but I really wish I had gotten in on that Kickstarter so I can

1534
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,440
get full set of the cards.

1535
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,840
Have you seen Ryan's custom pack?

1536
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,760
Have you seen the pack that we play with at home?

1537
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,280
Uh, the custom pack?

1538
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
No.

1539
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,040
It's, we, you, you know, the fact that they release the PDF of all of the cards in the

1540
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
set.

1541
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,880
We, um, and the whole reason why they do that is because if you missed what amounts to limited

1542
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,240
scale printing and you are particularly savvy, Ryan printed up a pack of her own and we have

1543
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,320
a bunch of custom ones that we made for our own purposes, a couple of custom blacks, and

1544
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,840
then everybody that we know, like everybody that we could really throw in a good joke

1545
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,000
about has their name on a card as well.

1546
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,560
And she's happy to, you know, pay materials and then we'll get a deck out to you.

1547
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,160
Well, no, we, I've printed my own and we've been playing with it, but it's weird though

1548
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,560
cause they're like little crackers.

1549
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,700
Yeah, she didn't, the PDF is in a really nasty square.

1550
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:43,840
We made them general, like, uh, like actually apples to apple side cards because she knows

1551
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,280
how to put it together to be able to do that kind of thing.

1552
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,180
I would have done that, but you know, at the time I was under time, I had to print them

1553
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:53,180
out and cut them up during watching a Rift Tracks version of Twilight.

1554
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,320
So I had limited amount of time, I couldn't, you know, go tweak in the PDF and stuff, but

1555
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,320
hey, who cares?

1556
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,960
It's, you know, they're, they're fun to play with.

1557
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,000
But yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1558
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,440
There's a lot of that stuff on there that's really cool.

1559
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:08,040
Um, you know, they have like a really elaborate Catan board one time, it was all laser etched

1560
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,200
wood and stuff, but it was like $300 for a full fucking set.

1561
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,000
But yeah, there's a lot of game projects on there that are worth, you know, supporting

1562
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,320
if that's your thing, but also, like I said, crazy guy that looks like Jabba the Hutt and

1563
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,320
a rapist.

1564
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:26,880
Um, you know, there's a bunch of people on there that maybe I shouldn't support him.

1565
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
I mean, the guy had...

1566
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,480
You also said that on Bobby's show, so...

1567
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,080
I just want to nail it home.

1568
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,240
He looks like Jabba the Hutt crossed with a rapist.

1569
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,880
The OLR podcasters, podcastees have no idea what you're talking about if they didn't listen

1570
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,880
to Bobby's show this week.

1571
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,160
I think I mentioned it earlier.

1572
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,960
There's a guy who won the lottery.

1573
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:48,400
He won $43 million, and he wants to create an MMO created by gamers for gamers, blah

1574
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,400
blah blah.

1575
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,740
But the thing is, creating an MMO is really fucking hard.

1576
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:55,960
This guy thinks that he can do it because he's played games for like 30 years, and,

1577
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:00,520
you know, I hate to use a cliche of like, oh, he looks like a gamer, no, but I mean,

1578
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,480
seriously, the guy looks like he just crawled out of his mom's basement.

1579
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,480
I mean, just...

1580
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,480
So kind.

1581
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:13,520
But seriously, though, the thing about it, though, is if you look at it, there's no real

1582
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,520
details to this.

1583
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,560
He just keeps throwing out stuff.

1584
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,740
Well, you will get a special mount at level one, and blah blah blah.

1585
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,240
It's like, dude, you're talking about garbage.

1586
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:32,400
I had a guy I used to deal with that had big ideas like this, and it was just like, dude,

1587
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,200
you don't have the smarts or the means to do any of this stuff, so I think that people

1588
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,860
are just pissing away money.

1589
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:47,620
I know a lot of people are donating a dollar so that they can make fun of him on his actual

1590
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,240
page and stuff, so I don't know.

1591
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,560
Let me read some of the comments from chat room.

1592
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,820
There's a lot of talk on this topic at chat.orangelandradio.com.

1593
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,920
Tiger Claw says, C, Loki even agrees.

1594
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,220
OLR needs a Kickstarter.

1595
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,220
Think about it.

1596
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,480
Better equipment, better mics, and maybe a tricaster?

1597
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:10,120
Raginator says, do a Kickstarter project so we can experience OLR and 7.1 surround sound.

1598
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:16,160
As nice as that is to think about, I'm going to be honest, I would feel guilty taking your

1599
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:23,160
money if I couldn't guarantee that 100% of it went into improving the show directly for

1600
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,960
you guys somehow.

1601
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,960
And I don't know.

1602
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,000
We'll think of ideas, I guess.

1603
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,640
I'm sorry.

1604
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,500
One idea I didn't think about before is the idea about funding the t-shirts or something

1605
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,640
in advance would be a good idea, I have to admit.

1606
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,640
So let me put it this way.

1607
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,640
This is the one I was talking about.

1608
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,360
It's called Your World.

1609
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:50,940
It's a video game project by Elwood Bartlett, and he's got $20,000.

1610
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,920
People are funding this already.

1611
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:58,080
Of course, he's never going to hit the goal of $1.1 million, but it's fun.

1612
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,360
People are going to throw it in, but here's some of his...

1613
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,360
It's horribly misspelled, too.

1614
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,160
Like here, pledge $100 or more.

1615
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:11,880
Reward number one, two, and three, access to special VDOR selling items for those who

1616
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,000
donated via Kickstarter.

1617
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,560
Special authenticator to protect your account.

1618
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,280
VDOR, spell check your goddamn shit.

1619
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,280
I mean, seriously.

1620
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,280
All right.

1621
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,280
Other comments from chat.

1622
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,280
Bochi Kawa says, Kickstarter really is just a way to funnel donations.

1623
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,640
OLR would need one because of the listeners.

1624
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:32,040
We are the ones that would support OLR, and we would be the ones to donate, but there's

1625
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,640
a lot of Kickstarter projects that nobody has the slightest clue about, and someone

1626
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,700
a couple thousand miles away would appreciate some money going to a thing they like.

1627
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,720
Which Akdeft also kind of follows up with, we have already helped OLR before without

1628
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Kickstarter.

1629
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,720
And that is very true.

1630
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:49,540
You have to remember, remember my DIVA fit a few years ago when the computer broke?

1631
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:53,760
The Orange Mountains Radio listeners sent a fucking new computer to us, and that is

1632
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,720
like the best, one of the best thing, if not the best thing that has ever happened from

1633
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,720
doing this show.

1634
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,000
I mean, that just, I can't tell you how that felt to just be like, oh my God, they sent

1635
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,560
a computer so we could continue to do the show.

1636
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,680
It was just an amazing feeling.

1637
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,680
Yeah.

1638
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,680
So anyhow.

1639
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:17,720
Really, all, all that we would have to do if anyone wanted to donate anything is just

1640
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,720
set up a PayPal.

1641
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,720
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1642
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,720
Easy.

1643
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,720
All right.

1644
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,040
Last, last word on Kickstarter, anything?

1645
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,560
I mean, I won't post a picture of the guy, I'm just saying, you know.

1646
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,560
All right.

1647
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,560
Uh, Jet Set Radio HD.

1648
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,880
It didn't need anything to fund this.

1649
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,760
Sega just finally decided to bring it out.

1650
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,760
What a good idea.

1651
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,520
So Jet Set Radio, everybody's been asking, what about the soundtrack?

1652
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,760
Are we going to get to keep Rob Zombie?

1653
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,080
Are we going to get to keep Chibomato?

1654
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,600
The answer is no, but there's, okay, hold on.

1655
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,700
It's not that bad because there will be about half of the tracks from the North American

1656
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,240
version will stay in the game.

1657
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,200
Same with the European version.

1658
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,840
They did try to re-license the music, but of course, cost availability, some of these

1659
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:06,200
labels that the music was originally on aren't even around anymore.

1660
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,240
So it just couldn't happen.

1661
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:13,400
Now all the Hideki Naganuma songs that were in the original, those stay, because those

1662
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,180
were created for Sega, so of course those are staying.

1663
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,680
There are a few licensed tracks that will return.

1664
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:24,820
The Guitar Vader songs have been re-licensed, Electric Toothbrush, Reps, BB Rites, those

1665
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,240
songs are coming back, and a few more.

1666
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:32,720
So there will be some songs that are going to return in the Jet Set Radio HD, but Rob

1667
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:36,320
Zombie, Chibomato, those songs will not be coming back.

1668
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,420
But I still think that's pretty cool.

1669
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:41,780
They got to salvage some of it, and at least it will retain that same feel.

1670
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:48,600
Also don't forget, higher resolution, widescreen to play, 60 frames a second, and two analogs

1671
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,680
sticks.

1672
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,280
Jet Set Radio HD.

1673
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,280
I know I'm excited.

1674
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,280
How about you, Dark Sock?

1675
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,280
Are you going to get this?

1676
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,760
We might, but I'm also thinking about starting a Kickstarter for when I have a kid to see

1677
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,200
who contributes the most money and wants to pay for the baby's name.

1678
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,160
Oh my gosh, I don't, you can't sell that on Kickstarter.

1679
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,160
Yes I can.

1680
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,160
Oh no.

1681
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,160
I can put it on eBay.

1682
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
No.

1683
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,160
Alright.

1684
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,160
No.

1685
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,280
Let's take a time back to when games were a lot simpler.

1686
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,840
There was no Kickstarter.

1687
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,160
Just blowing on the cartridge a lot.

1688
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,040
This game sure involves blowing and sucking.

1689
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,880
It's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

1690
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,440
It also involves farting stars.

1691
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:38,920
And that is Kirby's Adventure, also known as, let's see, Hoshi no Kirby Yume no Izumi

1692
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,200
no Monogatari, which was Kirby of the Stars, the story of the Fountain of Dreams.

1693
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,400
Wait, if you listen really carefully, you can hear act-deaf squeaking all the way from

1694
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,400
Mexico.

1695
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,400
Because he loves Kirby, I know that.

1696
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,280
I love the music, though.

1697
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,840
This game just makes me happy.

1698
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,080
It's a pink little puffball.

1699
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,880
I'm so pissed off at Nintendo of America for what they do to poor Kirby.

1700
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,120
They make him look angry in every, you get the Japanese version, Kirby's happy, hi, I'm

1701
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
happy Kirby.

1702
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,320
Anything in America comes out that's got Kirby's face on it.

1703
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,320
Mean Kirby.

1704
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,320
It's angsty.

1705
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,320
It's hipster.

1706
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:20,080
He was happy before he was angry.

1707
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,520
What does he have to be angry about?

1708
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,520
He's so cute.

1709
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:34,000
So Kirby's Adventure was the second and last game that used Kirby's original design.

1710
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,080
The first one was Kirby's Dreamland.

1711
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,920
And also the first one that made him pink.

1712
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,600
Because the first one he was black and white.

1713
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,800
So yeah, this was a platformer.

1714
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:53,280
It came out March 26, 1993 in Japan and came out in America on May 1, 1993 and in Europe

1715
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,360
on December 1, 1993.

1716
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,760
This came out when I was a junior in high school.

1717
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:03,680
Actually no, I was a senior, nevermind.

1718
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:11,160
Anyway, so it was super, super cute and it was actually out on, what?

1719
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,560
Comments from chat.

1720
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,560
Just move on.

1721
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,560
It's not appropriate for me to repeat.

1722
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
What?

1723
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,560
No.

1724
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,560
It's not appropriate for me to repeat.

1725
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,560
Bitch.

1726
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,560
Okay.

1727
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,560
Addressed to the chatroom, not you.

1728
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:29,640
So it came out on the virtual console on February 12, 2007 and in Europe on February 16, 2007

1729
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,560
and in Japan on February 27, 2007, so we actually got it ahead of Japan.

1730
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:40,800
And of course it was one of the 12 inch masterpieces that was given in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1731
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,320
There's also a 3D classics version on the eShop.

1732
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:50,240
So basically the story, Kirby wakes up from his after lunch nap and he didn't have any

1733
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,240
dreams.

1734
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,240
What?

1735
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,240
God it's awesome to be Kirby.

1736
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,240
I'm just thinking.

1737
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,520
He gets to take a CS to after lunch, it's great.

1738
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,000
And he learned that King Dedede has stolen the star rod.

1739
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,520
Fucker.

1740
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,240
Which is the source of power to the fountain of dreams and he broke it into pieces.

1741
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,240
So you have to go get it and you have to go to Wispy Woods.

1742
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,000
And remember I had Kirby's Avalanche.

1743
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So when you...

1744
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Wispy Woods.

1745
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I know.

1746
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,760
Paint Roller, Mr. Shine, Mr. Bright, Cracow, Heavy Mole and Meta Knight.

1747
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,560
And one for himself, King Dedede had.

1748
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,040
So basically you have to go through seven worlds, battle enemies, mini bosses, bosses

1749
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,980
and you have to get the star rod put back together.

1750
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,600
Now here's where it gets fun.

1751
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,600
As we all know.

1752
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,600
What?

1753
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,600
Nothing.

1754
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,640
Just this game makes me laugh.

1755
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,640
It's cute.

1756
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,640
It's adorable.

1757
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,680
You're sitting over there saying names like King Dedede, he took the star rod and he broke

1758
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,680
it up.

1759
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:53,320
It's like I'm listening to a four year old describe something.

1760
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,320
It's great.

1761
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,320
No, I'm not.

1762
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,080
Should I do my 12 year old girl voice?

1763
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,080
Oh my God.

1764
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,080
Yes please.

1765
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,080
So anyway, the game's a platformer.

1766
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,680
Shut up.

1767
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:09,200
So you've got regular levels, a boss fight and a warp star door.

1768
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,520
You guys, King Dedede took the star rod and broke it.

1769
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,080
Oh noes.

1770
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,040
You sound extra gay.

1771
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,080
Just letting you know.

1772
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,080
Not like a 12 year old girl.

1773
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,400
Sorry, that was my impression of the Kony guy in the videos that are on TMZ.

1774
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,160
Ugh, I'm so sick of that.

1775
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:35,040
Anyway he can run and jump and he can attack and dodge enemies by side tackling and he

1776
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:40,240
can fly by inflating himself, meaning he holds his breath until he floats into the air and

1777
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,380
then he can basically get as high as he can.

1778
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,240
He gets high y'all.

1779
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,960
You gotta be high to enjoy this game.

1780
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,960
Shut up.

1781
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:48,960
This game's awesome.

1782
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,960
Oh it is.

1783
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,960
It is.

1784
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,960
I'm on TV.

1785
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,960
You need an STFU right now.

1786
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:53,960
Let me finish.

1787
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,960
But when he's flying he can't use his other abilities.

1788
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,520
He can exhale and this puff of air after he exhales, apparently he has death breath.

1789
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:04,000
Cause when he goes...

1790
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,720
Enemies die.

1791
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:12,000
And anyway, his big ability is that he can inhale.

1792
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,320
So he sucks enemies and objects into his mouth and then it stays into his mouth until he

1793
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:24,240
spits them out.

1794
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,240
I quit.

1795
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,240
I quit.

1796
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,240
Bye.

1797
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,240
No.

1798
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,240
Let me finish.

1799
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,240
God you people are dirty.

1800
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,240
It's a game for six...

1801
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,240
Look.

1802
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,840
UFO catcher Kirby.

1803
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,240
He's fucking fat.

1804
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,240
He's a fat bitch.

1805
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:42,240
Anyway.

1806
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,240
But fluffy.

1807
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:50,240
So anyway, he can spit them right back out and do damage or he can swallow them.

1808
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,240
He swallows or spits.

1809
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,240
There, I said it.

1810
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,240
Are you happy?

1811
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,240
Yes.

1812
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,680
Rob is red in the face.

1813
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,000
He is as red as my shirt, y'all.

1814
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But he can swallow them too and he copies their abilities.

1815
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,440
Like he can spit fire if he swallows something that spits fire.

1816
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,480
So he swallows them and absorbs their DNA a little bit?

1817
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:17,420
He can also use his drop ability, but he can't inhale anything while he has a special ability.

1818
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:25,560
So when he uses up the special ability, he farts a star or he poops a star.

1819
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,760
So I like the flying bouncy star.

1820
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,760
The special power-up.

1821
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:34,660
It's just, it's so cute.

1822
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:37,000
So actually I'm going to read a quote on here about the visuals.

1823
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
This came from IGN.

1824
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:44,080
By 1993, the programmers of the world have learned to unleash every last ounce of power

1825
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,320
hidden inside the original Nintendo system.

1826
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:51,600
Mario's Adventure was one of those late generation games and probably the best of them.

1827
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:59,640
So basically this had, you know, pseudo 3D, different visual effects, it had rotation,

1828
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,680
parallax scrolling, six megabit game, it was the largest, one of the largest games ever

1829
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,340
came out on the NES.

1830
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,620
And I do believe this was the last game that came out on the NES.

1831
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,620
Next to last.

1832
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,620
Next to last.

1833
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,620
Wario Woods.

1834
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,620
Wario Woods.

1835
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:15,620
Yeah.

1836
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,520
Wario Woods was in the box, by the way.

1837
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,900
So yeah, there were different remakes.

1838
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:24,920
Don't bring box into this or I'm only going to laugh harder.

1839
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:29,140
Do not make me redownload the Vuvuzela app, okay?

1840
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:33,860
So now this was re-released on the Game Boy Advance and it was called Kirby Nightmare

1841
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,000
in Dreamland.

1842
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:44,260
And the name that it came out as in Japan was Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi Deluxe, which

1843
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:49,000
was Kirby of the Stars, the Fountain of Dreams deluxe block, there you go.

1844
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,800
The Nightmare in Dreamland had cooperative two to four players, so you could play as

1845
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,700
different colored kirpies.

1846
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,920
It had really good reviews.

1847
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:05,140
It was given a 9.5 out of 10 by EGM.

1848
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,900
GameSpot gave it 7.3 out of 10.

1849
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,180
So it's been- Fuck GameSpot!

1850
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,980
I know, right?

1851
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:17,860
Also, this is a little bit interesting, there's a French version of the game in Canada, which

1852
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:24,660
makes this the only French-only NES released in North America.

1853
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,660
Le Kirby.

1854
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,660
Le Kirby.

1855
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:34,260
The, um, also the soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21st, 1994, and had vocals

1856
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:39,460
by Mako Miyata in the story.

1857
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,540
This is the first game that I know of that actually has a pinball spinoff, and it was

1858
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:47,620
actually my first Kirby game was Kirby's Pinball for the Game Boy.

1859
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,260
Was that on Game Boy Basic?

1860
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:50,260
Yes.

1861
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,340
What about the Pokemon pinball game, was that on-

1862
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,340
That wasn't before Color.

1863
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:54,340
That was Game Boy Color, yes, yeah.

1864
01:32:54,340 --> 01:33:00,300
You know, the first pinball game that I ever played on a handheld was, or on a console,

1865
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:05,260
and I'm con- including handhelds, was Gator's Revenge on the old Game Boy.

1866
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,220
Yeah, I was gonna say, that was the first, that was my first pinball game too.

1867
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:13,460
Uh, although I think I rented Pinball's Quest before, or Pinball Quest before that, but

1868
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,460
anyway.

1869
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,460
Pinbot was also great.

1870
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,460
Well, one thing that was funny is that when we had a pinball party at the house, we had

1871
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,460
a jackpot in the house.

1872
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:23,260
No, we had Ride-A-Pinbot dancing up the nest with Pinbot right next to it.

1873
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,260
Nice.

1874
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:25,260
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

1875
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,260
Um.

1876
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,260
Okay.

1877
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,800
We need a new, like, not to distract from Kirby and the cute music that's in the background,

1878
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,940
but we could use, like, a great new pinball game from Nintendo, because they gave us some

1879
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,940
awesome ones.

1880
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:38,300
There was the Kirby one, even though it was PAL, but it's a second party.

1881
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:43,020
Uh, there was the Metroid pinball game was great, the Pokemon pinball games were outstanding,

1882
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,020
I love that game.

1883
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,420
A rumble pack and a Game Boy cartridge.

1884
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,620
Yeah, it was great.

1885
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,620
So we need a new one.

1886
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:52,220
You know what, I want that new, um, well, it's not new new anymore, but the Kirby game

1887
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:56,100
that came out on, um, DS.

1888
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,780
That's like, it's like ten Kirbys.

1889
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,980
You can borrow it if you want.

1890
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,300
I would love to borrow it.

1891
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,500
It's the Kirby draw one, where you can and I have it.

1892
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,020
Yeah, I really wanted to play that.

1893
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,020
You can borrow it.

1894
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,020
I ain't playing it.

1895
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,020
Alright.

1896
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,020
Thank you.

1897
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,020
You're welcome.

1898
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,020
See, something good came of all that laughter.

1899
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,020
See?

1900
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,020
Laughter brings healing.

1901
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,020
Rob's no longer bright red.

1902
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,020
Alright.

1903
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,020
We'll have to calm down a little bit.

1904
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,020
Alright.

1905
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,020
Plenty more OLR to come.

1906
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,020
We're not done yet.

1907
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,900
We've got, uh, more news coming at you.

1908
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:24,620
We're gonna talk about some really controversial things in the next half, so you wanna stick

1909
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:28,020
with this and, uh, get your say in in our chat room if you're listening live.

1910
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,020

1911

Pants off, dance off.

1922
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:41,020
Oh.

1923
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,020
Just kidding.

1924
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:43,020
Oh, I was gonna say.

1925
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:44,020
That's news to me.

1926
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,020
Who knows what other surprises.

1927
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,020
It was a surprise for 450, Rob.

1928
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,300
Who knows what other surprises Dark Soccer has in store.

1929
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:57,980
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1930
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1931
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:06,940
Live on this Saturday evening, March the 18th of 2012, with the 450th episode of our show.

1932
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,380
And we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in just a little bit.

1933
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:12,980
Hope you all had a good St. Patrick's Day, those of you that, you know, decided to do

1934
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,980
something.

1935
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,500
I don't know if it's just because, like, I'm getting old now or whatever, but I didn't

1936
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,620
really do anything yesterday.

1937
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:21,700
Did you guys do anything to kind of celebrate, like, you know, going out to the bars and

1938
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,180
getting blitzed was awesome when I was 21, but now, like, last night I was like, I'm

1939
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:26,180
too tired.

1940
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:30,020
I got woken up by bagpipes for the first time in my life, as far as I'm aware.

1941
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,020
Oh, that's right.

1942
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,020
Because you were in San Francisco.

1943
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,540
You were right by the Metreon.

1944
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,540
Yes.

1945
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,260
There was a huge parade taking place down Market Street.

1946
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:40,500
I was just right on 4th with an earshot of the Metreon.

1947
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:46,140
And there were a lot of air horns, screams, bagpipes, the occasional siren, and probably

1948
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,140
some other sounds.

1949
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,820
I was too tired to actually parse at the time.

1950
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,620
The only instrument that sounds like cattle being beaten to death?

1951
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:56,220
Hey, now, don't hate.

1952
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,220
I like bagpipes.

1953
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:00,620
But anyway, let's talk Metreon, because you reminded me you were right by there.

1954
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:03,940
Remember when the Metreon used to be, like, nerd heaven?

1955
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:08,580
Remember when the Metreon actually had something more than just a movie theater in five or

1956
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:09,580
six?

1957
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,740
Did you know that the Metreon had gone through some changes?

1958
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,740
No.

1959
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:18,900
It was very surprising coming out here, because I heard of all of these, like, classic video

1960
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:23,020
gaming staples that I was in the immediate vicinity of that aren't there anymore.

1961
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:27,460
Pier 39 doesn't have, Mel told me what the place was called, I completely forgot what

1962
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,460
it was all of a sudden.

1963
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,780
I forgot what it was called, I just remembered the DDR tournament we did live from there,

1964
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:31,780
and that was a good time.

1965
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:32,780
Yeah, the Pier 39.

1966
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:33,780
B3.

1967
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:37,660
B3 was the tournament, but I don't remember the name of the arcade.

1968
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,660
Man.

1969
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,660
Pier 39 had a nice place.

1970
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:45,380
Metreon was, as best as I understand, like, the original DDR tournament location.

1971
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:50,620
When there was a, whether it did or didn't have the first US DDR arcade, it was kind

1972
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:51,620
of the staple of everything.

1973
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:54,500
My first DDR tournament was at the Metreon, yeah.

1974
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,500
Yeah.

1975
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,180
So tell me about, in Metreon, you know, this isn't just about music games, but Metreon

1976
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,060
was the home of the Sony store, the official Sony store, for a long, long time.

1977
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:07,340
So tell me about not knowing any of this, and what you felt when you walked into the

1978
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:10,540
Metreon for the first time in eight years.

1979
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:11,540
For the first time ever, in my case.

1980
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,540
Oh, oh, yes.

1981
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,540
We didn't go there.

1982
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,540
Oh, okay.

1983
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:19,900
No, the Metreon, it's, it's, I kind of expected it as soon as I looked outside, walked up

1984
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,900
the, walked down the street towards it and saw what was going on.

1985
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,460
There's a huge chunk of the Metreon that's just closed off, because apparently they're

1986
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,500
renovating like well over half of it.

1987
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,660
So you go in on the ground floor, and there was just a food court and a couple of places

1988
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:36,660
there, and it directed you to the, there were ticket booths for the IMAX there, and then

1989
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:40,860
there were stairs escalators in the elevator to get up there to go see a movie.

1990
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,860
And that's...

1991
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
Oh, they didn't even have the crane games?

1992
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:46,060
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas there twice.

1993
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,460
There might have been something in the movie theater, I saw a couple of machines.

1994
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:49,460
It's an IMAX.

1995
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,460
Yeah.

1996
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:53,660
Well, in the, on the third floor, that's where the tilt used to be, and then, then for the

1997
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:58,220
longest time, there was just nothing but crane games in the, like, space next to it.

1998
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:59,220
Interesting.

1999
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,220
That's all.

2000
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:03,340
If there was anything in there, it was probably those, here, get a, get a thing of candy,

2001
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:06,140
a winner every time, something ridiculously basic.

2002
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:09,980
A rumor is that Target is going into Metreon, which actually, well, that actually would

2003
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,580
be a big deal, because in San Francisco proper, there's no Target.

2004
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:16,420
The closest Target is in, um, Daly City, which is a little bit south.

2005
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:19,180
Anyway, uh, go to our chat, I'm at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

2006
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,940
We have Porkchop is in our chat room tonight.

2007
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:25,940
Porkchop is Irish, as in Ireland, as in staying up until three in the morning to listen to

2008
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:26,940
this show.

2009
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,540
And Porkchop says, I'm Irish, and I did nothing.

2010
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,420
It's a gigantic mess.

2011
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,020
I, I can't say I blame you.

2012
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,020
I did the same thing.

2013
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:37,260
Uh, Technus in our chat room says, isn't Pier 39 a tourist trap now in San Francisco?

2014
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:38,260
It always was.

2015
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,260
It always was.

2016
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:40,940
Or am I thinking of something totally different?

2017
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:42,420
No, it's just, it, it hasn't changed.

2018
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:46,460
It always has been a giant tourist trap, but I will say this, the fresh donuts, I hope

2019
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,460
those are still there.

2020
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,460
Yes.

2021
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,460
It smells the donuts.

2022
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:53,260
There was that little donut bag stand, which I was very tempted to do if I hadn't eaten

2023
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,580
just before going there.

2024
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,580
Fucking amazing.

2025
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,580
I probably should have done it anyways.

2026
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,540
They smelled so good each time I walked by.

2027
01:38:58,540 --> 01:38:59,540
Oh God.

2028
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:00,540
Oh God.

2029
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:01,540
In the cookie place.

2030
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,980
I had friends from Connecticut that wanted me to send them donuts from Pier 39.

2031
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,820
Oh, in the chocolate place.

2032
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,340
It's like all kinds of chocolate and it has the boost chocolate.

2033
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,780
Did you go to the saltwater taffy store?

2034
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,140
No, I did not.

2035
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:14,820
They have- I passed through a whole bunch of stuff and stepped inside and looked at

2036
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,660
a couple of places, but no, I didn't get in there.

2037
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:22,540
My two favorite places actually is Treasure Isle, the, uh, the big Celtic store and the

2038
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,540
sock store.

2039
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:24,540
All right.

2040
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:28,540
Well, we could reminisce about San Francisco and memories and when the metronome was cool

2041
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,540
and all that.

2042
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,860
Although it is still a good place to see movies, so I'll give it that.

2043
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:36,100
Um, I know you didn't end up doing that, but the, uh, the little nature and Martin Luther

2044
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:39,460
King Memorial Outdoors was actually really nice walk.

2045
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,460
Really cool park in the back.

2046
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:45,180
The weather held up enough that walking around town was, was not, you know, miserable being

2047
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,140
rained on, being blown over, anything like that.

2048
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:49,980
And that was a, it's a, it's a really nice little property in the middle there.

2049
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,620
Moscone, Yerba Buena, and all those.

2050
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,620
Yeah.

2051
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,620
Yeah.

2052
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:54,620
All right.

2053
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,300
Well, let's move on back to some games, uh, as much as we can talk about the outdoors.

2054
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:01,540
Let's get back to some video games with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories that,

2055
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,140
uh, don't fit in anywhere else.

2056
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,260
All right.

2057
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:06,620
Let's talk about Ridiculous Bundles.

2058
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:13,420
Um, Steel Battalion, known for, you know, it's not exactly cheap prices, um, in the

2059
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:21,860
past, but they have a brand new, um, I guess it's available in Japan right now, um, for

2060
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:28,900
35,000 yen or 420 US dollars, uh, via Capcom's online shop.

2061
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:37,180
You can get a Steel Battalion, um, bundle that includes a backpack, um, a helmet, a

2062
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:45,860
jacket, patches, uh, soundtrack to the game, and, uh, I believe an art book.

2063
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,860
That's right.

2064
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:52,140
You can dress up like the character in the game with an actual helmet and looks like

2065
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:56,260
bomber jackets, um, for $400.

2066
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:01,020
It's a little ridiculous, but then again, they used to have a $200 controller.

2067
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:07,340
I bought Dan the full controller when it was $300 for the old one.

2068
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:10,460
I mean, that's something that was kinda necessary.

2069
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:13,020
It has the huge red button.

2070
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:14,300
I love the eject button.

2071
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:15,300
That was pretty fun.

2072
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,060
Now, could you play the game without that controller?

2073
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:20,060
I don't know.

2074
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,060
You're the wrong guy.

2075
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:22,540
Actually, I think that you could.

2076
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:25,340
If you could, it was a very stripped down experience, needless to say.

2077
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,340
Yeah.

2078
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:32,780
Also, they also made, um, made, uh, mods for the full unit to make it a more compact unit.

2079
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:36,460
But did they make any mods to make the compact unit as it was a huge unit, like a battle

2080
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:37,460
tech booth?

2081
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,760
We're talking about units.

2082
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,340
By the way, you know who has two of those controllers now?

2083
01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:43,340
You.

2084
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:44,340
Yep.

2085
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,340
Yeah.

2086
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:50,160
Uh, Skyrim's gonna be getting another update pretty soon, a 1.5 patch that's gonna add

2087
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,700
a bunch of kill cams for things that don't have kill cams right now, including ranged

2088
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:59,020
attacks, also, um, melee, or, or magic spells.

2089
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:04,220
And they're gonna be adding some new melee combat, um, moves and animations as well.

2090
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,960
So it's, uh, kind of enhancing a bunch of stuff.

2091
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,820
More ways to decapitate people.

2092
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:09,820
Hooray!

2093
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:10,820
Exactly!

2094
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:11,820
It sounds awesome.

2095
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:15,620
And also, they're gonna be, um, you know, adding some fixes, hopefully, once again,

2096
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:23,540
to that stupid blood on the ice goddamn mission or quest that I'm on that doesn't fucking

2097
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,540
work.

2098
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:30,700
So they're gonna try to fix it again, and, and props to Bethesda's blog for allowing

2099
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:34,780
me to put in my age, you know how, you know, you have the age gate or whatever.

2100
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:36,900
Happy 130th birthday, Loki!

2101
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:37,900
I know!

2102
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:41,780
Let's just, like, the 1800s, it's, like, awesome.

2103
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:48,020
Uh, but yeah, so they're gonna be fixing some other bug stuff, um, as well on top of the

2104
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:49,020
added features.

2105
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:52,180
But hey, all that's for free!

2106
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,660
So suck it, Capcom!

2107
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,740
Free shit, it's awesome.

2108
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:02,820
Um, and then, last but not least, uh, God of War has a demake that's available on PC,

2109
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,220
if you wanna check it out.

2110
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:11,940
It is, uh, the Bit of War, and it looks like, almost like Rygar or something, um, but, uh,

2111
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:18,980
yeah, 8-bit demake, and it's available on the website armlessoctopus.com.

2112
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:22,620
But really, when you think about it, if an octopus doesn't have any arms, how can it

2113
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,620
really be an octopus?

2114
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:28,220
Just saying.

2115
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:32,700
I can't even put together in my head what that would make it, uh...

2116
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:36,300
I mean, I can think of other, eight other things it could possibly have, but that's

2117
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,820
just, that's just inappropriate, okay?

2118
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:40,820
Inappropriate.

2119
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,820
Alright.

2120
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,320
That never happens here.

2121
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,320
Moving on?

2122
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,320
Moving on.

2123
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:48,300
Um, an 8-bit MMO is set to be released.

2124
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,300
That's actually the name of it.

2125
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,300
8-bit MMO.

2126
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,300
Um, kinda interesting.

2127
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:55,300
It, it's, I looked at the trailer, and it struck me as kinda Minecraft-y, in that it's

2128
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:00,580
very, like, create your own environment, but it's an MMO where the users create everything.

2129
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:01,580
It's all user-generated.

2130
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:06,220
They have what's called a grief protection system that's supposed to protect your stuff

2131
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:11,060
from getting fucked up, um, so, it's under construction, you can actually play it now,

2132
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:12,060
it's free.

2133
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,140
8bitmmo.net, and some people are having a lot of fun with that.

2134
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:20,540
Um, a fan-made Wing Commander game is gonna be allowed to go forward.

2135
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:23,880
This is actually kind of a surprise, usually, uh, companies kinda put the clamp down on

2136
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:30,020
things like this, but EA is allowing the creators of Wing Commander Saga Darkest Dawn to move

2137
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,020
forward.

2138
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:34,420
However, EA does not officially or unofficially endorse the game.

2139
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:40,180
They had to clarify that, uh, they did get the lawyers and everything to sign off of

2140
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,180
them, so that's, um, kind of shocking, but.

2141
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:46,020
So unfortunately that means you're not gonna get a Wing Commander remake any time soon.

2142
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:50,100
Yeah, that doesn't bode well for official Wing Commander stuff, but hey, this fan thing

2143
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,560
sounds like it's gonna be awesome.

2144
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,300
It's free, first off, yay!

2145
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:59,940
Uh, 50 missions, 2 campaigns, 60 voice actors, I wanna be a voice actor, uh, dozens of Terran

2146
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,420
and Kilrathi spaceships, 70 cutscenes.

2147
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,380
It takes place after Wing Commander 3.

2148
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:08,660
Uh, I'm assuming it's gonna pretend that that movie never existed.

2149
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:13,740
Cause if you're a true fan, you're just gonna ignore that movie.

2150
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,380
Who has actually seen that movie in full here?

2151
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:22,420
I've seen parts, and all I remember is Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard of Scream fame.

2152
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:29,860
I, I'm very ashamed to admit this, but long going far away, no, no, I've never spent a

2153
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:30,860
dime on it.

2154
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:34,940
Um, long going far away, it was like the weekend Fox movie or whatever.

2155
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:38,220
I was having an absolutely lazy day and I can honestly say I watched the thing from

2156
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:42,180
start to finish and I really wish I couldn't.

2157
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:47,840
I prefer to think of Matthew Lillard from Hacker's fame.

2158
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,020
That upgrades his status.

2159
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:52,220
Just like, uh, Johnny Lee Miller who would next be seen in Dark Shadows.

2160
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,180
It's gonna be awesome, alright.

2161
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:57,740
Anyhow, which by the way, internet, stop hating on the Dark Shadows trailer.

2162
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:58,740
Stop it.

2163
01:45:58,740 --> 01:45:59,800
It's weird.

2164
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,460
It's weird but it's suppo- okay, if you look at it as like-

2165
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:03,460
Is it Tim Burton?

2166
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:04,460
I mean, cause it's-

2167
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,460
Oh yeah, it's Tim Burton.

2168
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:06,460
Okay, yeah, that makes sense then.

2169
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:10,980
The old show was a little bit cheesy and it's all 70s and stuff cause it's supposed to be

2170
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:11,980
like the old show.

2171
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:17,620
And in the context of the fact that right now everybody's all about Twilight and shit,

2172
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,980
it's actually really funny.

2173
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:21,100
Like I just- I don't know.

2174
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,100
People need to let it go.

2175
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:23,100
Alright, anyhow.

2176
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:26,500
Uh, Rhythm Party, fun game on the Xbox 360.

2177
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:30,300
If you're a Bamani fan, you probably haven't heard of this, which is strange to me because

2178
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,340
it's right up a Bamani fan's alley.

2179
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,140
It's a great Kinect game for Bamani.

2180
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:38,420
I liked it way more than I thought I would, as I said previously on the show.

2181
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,980
And there's some more DLC.

2182
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:44,100
If you are sick of the song list being too tiny, you can get three new songs this week

2183
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,580
in Rhythm Party song pack four.

2184
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:51,260
The Sunbeam by Desrow is one song.

2185
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:55,140
Inside Your Mind by Limahl.

2186
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:58,580
Wasn't that the band that did the Neverending Story?

2187
01:46:58,580 --> 01:46:59,580
Yes it was.

2188
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,740
That was the band that did the Neverending Story.

2189
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:05,140
Now in Rhythm Party with Inside Your Mind.

2190
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,460
I don't know if that's a new song or an old song or what because I only thought they ever

2191
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:09,460
did one song.

2192
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:11,140
But here's the third song.

2193
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:16,300
If you've ever played Bamani games ever, you know this song.

2194
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:21,660
Bag by Revenge is the third song that you can now play in Rhythm Party.

2195
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:23,500
Yeah, Bag, what?

2196
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,500
You hating on Bag over there?

2197
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,900
It's just weird.

2198
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,100
I think it's great.

2199
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:35,140
I was actually trying to see if I had a clip of Bag.

2200
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:38,260
Just for the people that don't know.

2201
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:40,660
Where's my old music folder?

2202
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,580
Speaking of being woken up by bagpipes.

2203
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:43,580
Right?

2204
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:47,940
It's kind of appropriate for the time of year, isn't it?

2205
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:50,300
Perhaps that's exactly why they chose to release it this week.

2206
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:51,300
Perhaps.

2207
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,300
Perhaps.

2208
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,300
What 2DX game was Bag in?

2209
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,300
There it is.

2210
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,300
Eight.

2211
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,300
Or nine.

2212
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:57,300
Wrong.

2213
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,300
Ah, it's hard.

2214
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,300
Here it is.

2215
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,300
2DX.

2216
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,300
I'm sorry.

2217
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:04,300
Imagine flailing your arms and legs to this.

2218
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:14,980
Now when did this come out, because this would be totally appropriate for like yesterday.

2219
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:15,980
Tuesday.

2220
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:16,980
It came out Tuesday.

2221
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,140
Ah, well then perfect.

2222
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:19,380
Totally appropriate for yesterday.

2223
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,380
Yep.

2224
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,380
So there you go.

2225
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:22,380
Actually, you have to see this though quickly.

2226
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:26,580
I know this is terrible radio, but let me show the YouTube here real quick.

2227
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:30,500
Because somebody actually puts together the, it's not Konami, but some fan puts together

2228
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,940
all the DLC stuff into these videos on YouTube.

2229
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:37,420
And you have to see the animations for Bag.

2230
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:38,780
They will blow your mind.

2231
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:39,780
Hold on.

2232
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,780
Here's.

2233
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:41,780
Wait, that's inside your mind.

2234
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:42,780
Here's Bag.

2235
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:46,660
Like, look at all the little dancing sheep in the background.

2236
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:50,780
And then as you're dancing, little bagpipes get attached to it.

2237
01:48:50,780 --> 01:49:04,100
I feel like an entire Beatles album just invaded my brain complete with LSD and George Harrison's

2238
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,420
obsession with the sitar.

2239
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:06,700
I had no look at this.

2240
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,420
I have just been schooled on my eighties pop music by Zena Core in our chat room.

2241
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,700
I seriously had no idea ever of this.

2242
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,160
Zena Core says, Rob Limahl is the singer.

2243
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:20,460
The band was nameless as far as anyone cares.

2244
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:24,220
So it was a studio band or something that I had no idea, but well, if you want to know,

2245
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,220
oh, I closed the window.

2246
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:26,220
All right.

2247
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,220
If you want to know the song, go YouTube it.

2248
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:28,220
All right.

2249
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,420
Uh, or download, download the pack already.

2250
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:32,420
Dark Sakura, rapid fire news for us.

2251
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:36,700
Uh, how about some stuff if I can get back to the window.

2252
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,700
Okay.

2253
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:38,700
Thank you.

2254
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,300
Um, Sonic four is going away.

2255
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:45,700
No more episodes after episode two and everyone cheers.

2256
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,060
Yay.

2257
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:50,260
Because it wasn't very good.

2258
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,100
But maybe volume two will be better.

2259
01:49:52,100 --> 01:50:00,080
So next thing, rumor Shenmue one and two HD finished going to Xbox live arcade and PSN.

2260
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:05,940
It's uh, an anonymous source reported it to gamerzines saying that it was going to be,

2261
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:09,940
uh, it's been completed for over a year and it's pending release, but that doesn't say

2262
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,940
it's true.

2263
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:16,280
Rumor, which is a really good album rumors.

2264
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:19,040
So how about some rock band, three tracks they're coming out.

2265
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,380
How about it?

2266
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:25,500
There will be, um, two tracks for men at work that will, uh, be in the rock band music store

2267
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:29,980
overkill and down under and Carlos Santana's smooth.

2268
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:34,380
Ooh, that should make some people need new pants.

2269
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:36,660
And then, uh, not really that song got played out.

2270
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:39,940
Well, yeah, but for people who like playing pro guitar mode.

2271
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:40,940
Okay.

2272
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:41,940
All right.

2273
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:42,940
I'll give you that.

2274
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:43,940
I'll give you that.

2275
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,300
I can't imagine that would be kind of hot.

2276
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:50,180
And um, so anyway, the tracks are going to be a buck 99 and there is of course, like

2277
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:58,620
I said, pro upgrade available, um, for smooth for 99 cents or 80 Microsoft points, which

2278
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:02,300
is funny because actually on the way up here, I was listening to the lonely Island and the

2279
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:06,340
Santana DVX song came up and that song's funny.

2280
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:07,340
All right.

2281
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,460
We're going to transition back into some longer news here.

2282
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:10,780
The mailbag is coming up in a minute.

2283
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:14,940
A mailbag at orange on traded.com FUs of the week and your calls soon.

2284
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:16,780
Uh, no frugal question this week.

2285
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:17,780
Sorry.

2286
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:19,220
I I'm going to be totally honest with an out of town guest.

2287
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:22,220
I forgot to do it today, so, uh, we'll bring it back next week.

2288
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,220
Sorry about that.

2289
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,220
Loki.

2290
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,220
All right.

2291
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:31,660
Um, let's talk a little bit about mass effect and I mean, come on.

2292
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:36,700
I mean, seriously, people that are fans of mass effect, this is a little ridiculous.

2293
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:43,540
Um, apparently a mass effect three fan has complained about the ending of the game, but

2294
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:47,140
didn't necessarily complain to Bioware or EA.

2295
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:55,060
They complained to the federal trade commission and uh, yes, apparently a Bioware form user

2296
01:51:55,060 --> 01:52:04,480
named El Spico, uh, went to the FTC to file a false advertising complaint at EA and also

2297
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:12,300
filed a complaint with the better business Bureau and you know, his, uh, you know, reasons

2298
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:16,460
for it after reading through the list of promises about the ending of the game that they made

2299
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:19,020
and their advertising campaign and PR interviews.

2300
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:22,500
It was clear that the product we got did not live up to those claims.

2301
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:28,060
This is not something, um, I was happy to do, but after the terrible ending that there

2302
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:32,580
was no way, um, there was no way that the product had been advertised to me.

2303
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:38,620
Um, and the lack of any kind of response from Bioware EA to address this, I felt this is

2304
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:41,420
my only recourse.

2305
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:46,760
And he'll be returning his copy before the end of the 30 days, uh, three a return policy.

2306
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:56,580
If the ending has not been addressed by then, fucking really, I know people are stupid.

2307
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:58,940
There was another, there was more recourse for him.

2308
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:08,180
I didn't like any of the prequel movies for star Wars, but did I go up to, uh, George

2309
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:14,020
Lucas when I was in the same room as him and demand my money back while I was eating meatloaf

2310
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:15,020
prepared by his staff?

2311
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:18,580
No, no, but they totally did that on clerks.

2312
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,580
The animated series.

2313
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,580
It was really fun.

2314
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:21,580
That was great.

2315
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:27,940
I want my $8 that show totally dates that show too.

2316
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:28,940
It's only $8.

2317
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:33,440
Uh, as far as video games though, having there been video games in the past that have had

2318
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,740
shitty endings, like, um, I dunno, like ghouls and ghosts or, uh, you know, I was just watching

2319
01:53:37,740 --> 01:53:40,940
these Zelda two adventures of link long play through today.

2320
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,140
That kind of had a shitty ending.

2321
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:47,700
If you think about it, like the curtain falls before you can see Lincoln, Zelda kissing

2322
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:50,860
or embracing or whatever it is they're doing bony boning.

2323
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:55,460
So yeah, but look, okay, look, look, I'm not trying to compare like mass effect to Zelda,

2324
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:58,940
the adventures of link, although both are great games and I don't know the ending of

2325
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,940
mass effect three.

2326
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:03,660
I am really trying to save myself because I am experiencing the games for the first

2327
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:07,560
time, but I'm kind of thinking, okay, from what I've heard about it, the thing I've

2328
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:11,860
heard or the way it's been explained to me without spoiling it is that mass effect is

2329
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,380
very much about the story decisions you make on along the way.

2330
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:17,860
And if you choose to go paragon or renegade or somewhere down the middle, and it really

2331
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:21,980
seems like the ending kind of doesn't fucking care about how you played the game for the

2332
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,980
past three games.

2333
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:27,540
And so it sounds like kind of that disregard there really kind of irritated people so that

2334
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:32,660
I can kind of see where it's irritating, but are people really letting the last 15 minutes

2335
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,300
just totally like ruin the entire franchise for them?

2336
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:40,020
Because like, even, even if the ending at this point is like, like just fucking goat's

2337
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:45,540
a man comes out and chose me as asshole, like I'm still going to be like, the rest of the

2338
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:48,260
game up until that point was so fucking rad.

2339
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:52,020
I would still recommend this, you know, what happens is he ends up on a roof.

2340
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:57,820
He calls tech support and they tell him to jump off the building in order to wake up.

2341
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:58,820
What if that was the ending?

2342
01:54:58,820 --> 01:54:59,820
Then you'd be really pissed.

2343
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:06,740
Hey, as long as it's got some cigarettes in there, I am all good.

2344
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:11,580
But you know how many movies and how many TV shows or especially TV shows like, and

2345
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:14,620
one I mentioned on Bobby show before it was the sopranos, right?

2346
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:17,820
The sopranos was a hugely popular show on HBO.

2347
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:19,580
Lots of people love this for seven seasons.

2348
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:22,260
And then the ending was really bad.

2349
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:25,260
Like I don't know if you guys know about the ending, but it was just fade to black.

2350
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,060
It's just really bad ending.

2351
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:28,380
It didn't ruin the series.

2352
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:34,580
At least the ending isn't commander shepherd's son driving off with a tranny.

2353
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:36,780
I'm sure a lot of people don't catch that reference.

2354
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:37,860
That's from nip tuck.

2355
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:44,380
That's the last episode is like, what actually the last season was kind of what yes, I watched

2356
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:46,620
all of that series.

2357
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,100
I don't know why.

2358
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:52,680
So I mean, sometimes, and some people would say that battle star Galactica had a terrible

2359
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,680
ending too.

2360
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:55,100
I liked the ending of battle star Galactica.

2361
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,740
I mean, there's only so many ways you get into show like that.

2362
01:55:57,740 --> 01:56:01,260
I thought it was a great ending, but you know, some people don't agree with that.

2363
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:07,080
So the nice thing about mass effect is that they can release something for DLC later or,

2364
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,180
you know, I know BioWare swears up and down.

2365
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:14,740
It'll be the last game, but you guys like fucking really you're going to buy that right.

2366
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,780
Halo three was going to be the last halo game.

2367
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:19,020
Remember that, you know, there's ways they can do.

2368
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:23,540
And I, you know, again, even if it ended with the entire universe imploding, like God came

2369
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:27,720
down and smited everybody, whatever it is, that's so terrible.

2370
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:32,500
Even if that happened, there's no reason they can't do prequels side stories.

2371
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:36,820
You know, the characters before they joined up with shepherd or just in another part of

2372
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:41,060
the galaxy or from the enemy's perspective, there's a million things they could do with

2373
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,060
mass effect.

2374
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:45,120
Still, even if they chose to go to another developer, granted, it probably won't be as

2375
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,220
good if it's not a BioWare game, but you never know.

2376
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:50,860
Once again, though, they can't give into this kind of bullshit.

2377
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:53,500
This is the ending that you guys decided on.

2378
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:58,140
Obviously there is much thought to the ending of a trilogy of a game series that's been

2379
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:00,180
just this massive game.

2380
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:03,420
Yeah, pun intended, I guess.

2381
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:09,300
But you can't just give in because some people complain about the ending to something.

2382
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,140
You can't please everybody.

2383
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:12,140
And so what?

2384
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:14,380
So you hated the ending of the game.

2385
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,940
Well, that's that.

2386
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:21,700
I mean, but if you give into this, then any game that you put out, both, you know, BioWare,

2387
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:26,780
any publisher, you're gonna have people there like, I don't like the ending, I'm gonna complain

2388
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:30,900
to the FTC, I'm gonna complain to the better business bureau because I need you guys to

2389
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,460
change the ending to how I want it.

2390
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,620
Well, no, I want the ending to be like this.

2391
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:35,620
Fuck that.

2392
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:36,620
You know what?

2393
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:40,380
If you're so bent over the ending, just write some fan fiction or something.

2394
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:42,020
That's what we used to do back in the day.

2395
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:45,980
If we didn't like something, we fanfic'd it.

2396
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:47,180
And we liked it.

2397
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:49,860
Get off my lawn.

2398
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:54,820
I seem to remember not liking any of the Stargate shit TV series endings.

2399
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:55,820
You know what?

2400
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:59,300
I loved Stargate all up until like midway through season 8.

2401
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:02,180
That was right before the Ori, wasn't it?

2402
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:03,980
Yeah, it was right after the replicants.

2403
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:04,980
Yeah, yeah.

2404
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:06,820
But did it ruin the first seven seasons?

2405
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:09,380
Well, the first seven seasons did have some pretty crappy writing.

2406
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:10,380
Alright, well, bad example.

2407
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:13,980
But for the most part, for the most part, I looked back on them fondly.

2408
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:20,300
I mean, I own seasons 1 through 8 box sets, so I can't say I didn't like it, but I found

2409
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:24,420
myself wanting to change a number of things.

2410
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:29,620
I think the reason why people are really mad to kind of get here is something I said earlier.

2411
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:33,140
They could fix the ending through DLC, just like they did with Fallout.

2412
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:36,700
And I think people feel like, ah, you had me by the balls here with a shitty ending

2413
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:41,020
and you're going to make me pay 10 bucks to get the real ending, although you all know

2414
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:44,620
you're going to YouTube it.

2415
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:48,300
But half of all of this outcry everybody already has anyways.

2416
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:52,740
And that part of it, I can sympathize a little bit with that.

2417
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:55,780
That is kind of shitty to like force me to get more DLC.

2418
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:57,820
They also, they change endings all the time and stuff.

2419
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:01,820
I mean, look at, you know, for example, I Am Legend.

2420
01:59:01,820 --> 01:59:07,460
They're changing the end of that movie because they're going to make a sequel.

2421
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:11,940
So let's just assume that they kill off Shepard or something like that at the end of Mass

2422
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:12,940
Effect 3.

2423
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:13,940
I have to say something.

2424
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,940
I have to say something about I Am Legend.

2425
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:17,500
They changed it from the original ending anyway.

2426
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:22,980
Well, I can't believe that they changed Titanic, where now the boat's not going to sink, so

2427
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:23,980
that way they can make a Titanic.

2428
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:24,980
What?

2429
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:25,980
I'm joking.

2430
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:32,740
And it transforms into a 50-foot robot, 50-foot robot.

2431
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:36,460
I don't, for the record, I don't care who the spoils were because the movie's been out

2432
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:41,980
forever, but in I Am Legend, it turned out that all the vampire things, which I believe

2433
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:48,460
was in the book, were all sentient and trying to rescue the one that he was keeping in captivity.

2434
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,460
Yes.

2435
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:51,180
They, they, they address that.

2436
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,460
But they didn't end it that way.

2437
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,220
Well, they did in the director's cut.

2438
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,220
Well, okay.

2439
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:56,220
The director's cut.

2440
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:57,980
See, it would make sense to take that to go with.

2441
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,220
Ooh, great point from Tiger Claw in the chat room.

2442
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,220
Portal had its ending changed.

2443
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:02,220
Portal 1.

2444
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:03,220
It didn't have its ending changed.

2445
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:05,220
It had its ending extended.

2446
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:06,220
Enhanced.

2447
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:08,460
Well, but it was an important scene.

2448
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:13,100
It was just straight-up new content and console gamers, well, you heard the news.

2449
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:14,660
What the, what am I thinking?

2450
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:19,820
Yeah, that wasn't, that wasn't like, oh, GLaDOS didn't actually blow up.

2451
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,820
For the record, actually.

2452
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:21,820
I'm sorry to everybody.

2453
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:22,940
I just spoiled that too.

2454
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:29,740
For the record, the, it was actually texted into the, as the original ending, because

2455
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:38,660
you can find a, a bit of programming code for party retrieval bot, and the little model

2456
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:41,380
that they used for it was actually already in the game, because if you go into third

2457
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:44,820
person mode, you can actually see whatever it is that's dragging her off.

2458
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:47,820
And they had, all the, all the data was programmed in.

2459
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:49,660
They just didn't use it.

2460
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:54,820
So going back in with DLC, they were able to use the original ending that they had mined.

2461
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:55,820
Just saying.

2462
02:00:55,820 --> 02:01:02,620
A lot of, a lot of stuff like that, this is why I, I don't ever look at any ending as

2463
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:08,340
canon until they've said, that's it, you know.

2464
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,420
Or until the studio goes out of business.

2465
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,060
Or at least they have no choice.

2466
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:13,620
That's why I have no more cube movies.

2467
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:18,960
All right, well, anyhow, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this situation because my

2468
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,500
thing would be all like, well, if you don't buy, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but

2469
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,980
too late, you already bought it.

2470
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:31,420
And I'd like to pitch, or I should say recommend a title based on your, your joke there, Titanic

2471
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:32,900
2.

2472
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:40,620
There is a game coming out very soon, actually, that is, oh, what the fuck is it called?

2473
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:43,140
It's Titanic something.

2474
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:48,740
It's basically the maiden voyage of the Titanic 2, and you're solving a mystery because there's

2475
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,660
a bomb on the boat.

2476
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,660
So it's like Titanic.

2477
02:01:51,660 --> 02:01:52,660
Is that like Speed 2?

2478
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:56,180
It's like Speed 2 and Titanic 2.

2479
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:57,580
It's Titanic Mystery, that's what it was.

2480
02:01:57,580 --> 02:01:58,580
Does Sandra Bullock be in it again?

2481
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:01,740
All right, I think it's like Titanic Mystery is the name of the game.

2482
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:02,740
We NDS.

2483
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:10,540
All right, anyhow, I think we need to move on with more stories, but seriously, going

2484
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:15,620
to the feds to complain about the ending, like, look at your life, look at your choices.

2485
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:16,780
There's other things to be mad about.

2486
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:20,820
There's some people that call the SWAT team on somebody if they're beating them in Call

2487
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:26,740
of Duty, so I mean, they should be lucky it's just the feds, and they call in a nuke strike

2488
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:27,740
or something.

2489
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:31,620
Honestly, honestly, probably, you know the response that they're going to fucking get

2490
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:38,180
from the feds is going to be, yeah, we're pretty upset about it too.

2491
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:40,820
That's going to be the response that they get.

2492
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:44,860
It's going to be chirp, chirp, chirp.

2493
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:47,140
Yeah, we fucking hated the ending too.

2494
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,540
All right, look, moving on.

2495
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:55,380
Usually this game won't have a shitty ending, but I will say the TV series from what I understand

2496
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:59,780
loves to do twists and turns and has been causing some fan controversy.

2497
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,700
I have sadly not watched any.

2498
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:04,780
I have not watched the show either, but I've heard a lot of good things about it.

2499
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:08,940
I'm not big on the whole zombie stuff, but again, then again, apparently I misjudged

2500
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:12,260
Mass Effect all these years ago, so someday I'm going to have to sit down and watch The

2501
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:17,020
Walking Dead is a show that a lot of people are really into right now, and of course,

2502
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:20,500
when something gets big, there's the inevitable game that comes out, and you may or may not

2503
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,980
remember, Telltale is the ones doing the game.

2504
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:27,620
Of course, Telltale does a lot of the adventure games, the Jurassic Park, you know, the Monkey

2505
02:03:27,620 --> 02:03:29,060
Island reboot and all that.

2506
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:33,340
So The Walking Dead will be out in great Telltale fashion on every fucking platform you can

2507
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:34,340
think of.

2508
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:37,380
Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, PC, Mac, iOS.

2509
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:39,140
First episodes coming out in April.

2510
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,340
There will be five episodes in total.

2511
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:46,180
They will each be regularly released after the first one comes out, so I don't know if

2512
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:48,740
that's one a month, one every three months, whatever that's going to be.

2513
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:50,740
Uh, there you go.

2514
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:55,620
Telltale, the only company that understands episodic content and does it right.

2515
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:57,620
Yeah, thanks Gabe Newell.

2516
02:03:57,620 --> 02:04:00,900
Oh yeah, right, because the Half-Life game.

2517
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:03,540
Because he harped on, episodic content is the way of the future!

2518
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:05,460
I see what you did there.

2519
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:07,540
Although Steam is a great place to get these games.

2520
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,180
Very true, that's where I have Back to the Future.

2521
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:14,320
Walking Dead will also be available on Facebook!

2522
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:18,540
Now it's not the Telltale game, don't get that confused, but here's the deal.

2523
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:27,020
The social game developer RockYou is doing the Walking Dead social game, I'm sorry, published

2524
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:30,340
by RockYou, developed at Eyes Wide Games.

2525
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:35,100
You're going to set up and maintain base camps, you send out scouts to scavenge for supplies,

2526
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,000
and there's also some combat naturally.

2527
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Now you know what would be cool?

2528
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,100
I will say, this does, in theory, this would be a great game, like if I could have a little

2529
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:46,240
zombie camp, and I could send zombies to destroy Dark Sakura's people.

2530
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:47,240
That would be fun.

2531
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:48,240
No, you couldn't do that, you know why?

2532
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,240
I don't play Facebook games.

2533
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:55,660
I'll click on it when you're not home, when you're not watching and logged in.

2534
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:56,660
No way.

2535
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:59,940
Fine, then who plays like every Facebook game that's out there?

2536
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,940
Somebody I know.

2537
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:02,900
People who aren't me.

2538
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,020
Somebody I know on Facebook.

2539
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:08,100
X-Link, X-Link will be playing it.

2540
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:10,220
I'll kill X-Link's zombie camp.

2541
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:15,260
Alright, Shane, Shane likes the Walking Dead, he'll be curious enough to try the game, and

2542
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,260
I will destroy his people, it will be fun.

2543
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,260
Alright.

2544
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:24,180
Yes, Porkchop, there was a Dexter game that was mostly a point-and-click adventure, and

2545
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:28,900
a kind of a 3D version of an old point-and-click adventure game.

2546
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:29,900
Dexter the TV show?

2547
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:30,900
Yeah.

2548
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:31,900
Hmm.

2549
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:32,900
It was, it was, it was okay.

2550
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:35,580
It had a, it could have been longer, how about that?

2551
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:36,580
You know what?

2552
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:37,580
More than three or four cases.

2553
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:38,580
Telltale did a CSI game.

2554
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,180
That was another thing that they did, based on the show.

2555
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:45,780
I hear, now I don't really, you know, I don't even watch the show, I just didn't have a

2556
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:49,380
real big interest in the CSI game, but I hear it wasn't bad, so.

2557
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:50,380
How old was it?

2558
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:51,380
Wasn't that like, six?

2559
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:52,380
Probably about five years ago.

2560
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,700
I mean, the show's been on for what, nine years now?

2561
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:58,500
I seem to remember that X-Play, or perhaps even Extended Play at the time, reviewed it

2562
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:02,780
and said that it was not quite as polished as it should have been for such a, such an

2563
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:03,820
investigative game.

2564
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:06,060
I think I'm thinking about the same thing, I might be wrong.

2565
02:06:06,060 --> 02:06:09,020
Yes, but we can't always trust reviews, as we're gonna learn later in the show, that's

2566
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:10,020
for sure.

2567
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:11,020
Alright.

2568
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:14,580
One thing we can trust is your emails, I think.

2569
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:18,740
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungerated.com, and DarkSakura dives

2570
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:21,820
in or sends her zombie squad in, to pull out the emails.

2571
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:23,260
Eugh, sticky.

2572
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,900
And read them here on the show.

2573
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:25,900
It's a little sticky!

2574
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:28,420
Mailbag at orangelaungerated.com.

2575
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:29,420
That's not email.

2576
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:33,380
Ugh, well, it would help if it would actually let me read it.

2577
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:35,580
Ugh, come on.

2578
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:38,580
Well, we'll just listen to that.

2579
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:39,580
There we go!

2580
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:40,580
Now it's working.

2581
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:41,580
Now it's working.

2582
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:44,260
Well, no, it wasn't letting me get to the screen, so whatever.

2583
02:06:44,260 --> 02:06:45,260
No problems.

2584
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:46,260
Pfft.

2585
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,260
Bitch.

2586
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:51,820
So, um, greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2587
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:55,980
I know that you just added a new show segment, and I've been thinking of a new segment for

2588
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:57,060
a while now.

2589
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:01,500
I'm the guy who isn't keen on cursing, so in order to balance out the eff-us of the

2590
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:05,260
week, what about the love-us of the week?

2591
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:06,260
I'll start.

2592
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:11,500
I have a big love-u to people who are genuinely friendly during disc golf games, and want

2593
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,180
to help you become a better player.

2594
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:17,860
Another example from Loki would be, would sound something like, a big love-u to Nintendo

2595
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:21,980
for always going out on a limb to create new and exciting IPs without rehashing anything

2596
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,980
prior.

2597
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:23,980
This one he has for me.

2598
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:24,980
Okay.

2599
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:28,580
A big love-u to World of Warcraft for rainbow unicorns that make me feel shiny.

2600
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:34,260
Rob, I have a love-u to all the podcasters who take the time to leave us good reviews

2601
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:36,300
on iTunes and for listening to us every week.

2602
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:38,740
I'm gonna verp from all the cuteness.

2603
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:41,740
Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.

2604
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:45,380
We have done a thank you, I think is what we called it, but we have kind of done a thank

2605
02:07:45,380 --> 02:07:46,380
you of the week.

2606
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:54,460
Um, you know, when we're feeling charitable, but it happens once in a great while, but

2607
02:07:54,460 --> 02:08:00,460
I do say a genuine love-u or thank-u to everybody that leaves us nice reviews on iTunes.

2608
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:07,500
When I'm truly not in a pissy mood, I do nice things, you know, but I'm female.

2609
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:08,500
I don't care.

2610
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,500
I didn't even have to say it.

2611
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,500
All right.

2612
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:17,500
We are full of loving stuff for the two and a half hours.

2613
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:18,500
Okay.

2614
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:21,500
Um, this is from Rob.

2615
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:25,700
The fabled art of video game exhibit at the Smithsonian is now open.

2616
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:31,300
I haven't gone yet because all of the opening day talks were booked before I checked.

2617
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:35,440
It is running during Otacon if people want to make the drive from Baltimore to DC.

2618
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:40,700
In Baltimore, I like to take the Metro from I-95 in Greenbelt, Maryland rather than try

2619
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:42,900
and park downtown.

2620
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,540
If I lived there, I knew what that meant.

2621
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:47,280
Oh, I think he's just giving people directions.

2622
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:51,060
They have all these funny terms for roads out there that I've just like the greenbelt.

2623
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:53,860
You don't, what's that?

2624
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,860
He attached the letter from the Smithsonian.

2625
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:56,860
Nice.

2626
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,860
It says open now through September 30th.

2627
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:02,520
It felt like this day would never come, but it finally did in the art of video games exhibition

2628
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,520
is open to the public.

2629
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:07,380
I hope you can make it to see the show in person, but if not, check out the photos of

2630
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:09,500
the final installation on Flickr.

2631
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:11,440
I actually really love to see that.

2632
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:15,380
That's what it's Washington DC where it's the Smithsonian or derp.

2633
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:16,380
Yeah, right.

2634
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:20,680
Um, you know, you step out on the line and you see the, I didn't have like a traveling

2635
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:24,980
Smithsonian dick that sits sticking out of the ground made of marble.

2636
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:27,180
I've been to the Smithsonian before many years ago.

2637
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,180
I was 17 years old.

2638
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:29,180
You know what the big exhibit was?

2639
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:30,180
You know what?

2640
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:33,100
So was I, but you know what the big exhibit was the year I was there.

2641
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:38,900
Uh, the Enola Gay, they had the actual plane, you know, that was used in world war two and

2642
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:41,420
all that was very, very strange.

2643
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:43,540
Did you say world of war two?

2644
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,540
I said world war two.

2645
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:45,540
I'm pretty sure.

2646
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:46,540
All right.

2647
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:48,420
Then I said world of war two and I meant to say world war two.

2648
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:49,420
Anyhow.

2649
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:54,700
Well, to finish, um, on here, it says, uh, one of the best parts of the exhibit exhibition

2650
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,500
in my opinion is the interviews with video game artists, designers, developers, musicians,

2651
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,500
writers, and scholars.

2652
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,380
Um, yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it.

2653
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,820
So yeah, pretty cool.

2654
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:08,420
I, um, I don't have the link to, uh, the flicker on here, so I would suggest seeing if you

2655
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:10,340
can find it.

2656
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:12,220
And last email if you're ready.

2657
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:16,780
Well, not into sports games and not interested in the canceled Ubisoft game.

2658
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:23,820
For some reason, the pronunciation of Adidas, how you, you said Adidas.

2659
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:25,300
The rest of the world says Adidas.

2660
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:26,300
Adidas.

2661
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:28,100
I've, I've, I've said Adidas before.

2662
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:29,100
Okay.

2663
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,420
Well, he said it sounded odd.

2664
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,620
I'm more used to Adidas myself.

2665
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:34,100
Where does the other pronunciation come from?

2666
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,100
I'm sure I've heard of it.

2667
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,100
Heard it that way before.

2668
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:40,300
That comes from Robert M. Adidas was when they would call it was what the corn song

2669
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:41,300
was called.

2670
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,300
Yes.

2671
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:43,300
All day.

2672
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:50,980
I dream about, all right, forget it.

2673
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:55,060
Like that's the one like rage metal song I'm going to admit to liking here on the show.

2674
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:58,240
But yes, I used to have a college radio show back in the day and we'd play stuff like that.

2675
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:00,860
So we, and the song was called Adidas.

2676
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:01,980
Like that's how you pronounce it.

2677
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:05,300
So now whenever I see that, like I can't help, but say it that way.

2678
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,500
Even though I know everybody says the company is Adidas, but consider it a funny pun.

2679
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:13,300
I don't know.

2680
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:14,300
That's audible blinking.

2681
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,100
You never heard the corn song.

2682
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:18,980
I don't like corn.

2683
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:21,580
Not even in a tortilla.

2684
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:22,580
Actually I'm allergic to corn.

2685
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:23,700
Did you know that?

2686
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:24,700
Are you really?

2687
02:11:24,700 --> 02:11:25,700
No, I didn't.

2688
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:26,700
I am allergic to corn.

2689
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:27,700
I can have it.

2690
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:30,100
The more processed it is, the easier I have a time having it, but pure corn will make

2691
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:32,260
my lips swell and my throat itch.

2692
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:33,260
All right.

2693
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,260
Is that it for emails?

2694
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:35,260
Yes.

2695
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:36,340
Little known fact, everybody.

2696
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:38,180
Now you know something about me.

2697
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:42,460
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

2698
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:45,980
I might say this name wrong here since I love pronouncing things wrong here on the show.

2699
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:50,980
Delighter, Delitter, Delighter in our chat room says all day I dream about sex song of

2700
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:53,500
my life.

2701
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,420
You and every man and a lot of women too.

2702
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:57,420
So there you go.

2703
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:58,420
All right.

2704
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:01,340
Time's nothing.

2705
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,340
All right.

2706
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:06,220
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2707
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:08,900
Or if you want, the thank yous of the week.

2708
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:09,900
Fuck that.

2709
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:18,500
I mean, poo, poopy poo poo.

2710
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:25,220
My FU goes towards, um, I'm still going to include daylight savings time as being involved

2711
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:30,300
with this FU, but it goes for this crazy ass insomnia I've been having.

2712
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:33,600
And then when I do fall asleep, of course I can't wake up in the morning.

2713
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:37,940
I have been sleeping on average until noon.

2714
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:39,060
Not on purpose.

2715
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:42,340
If I don't set an alarm, I just won't wake up.

2716
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:44,100
And Dan had to wake me up.

2717
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:49,660
And then I found out that I was just really, I've just been really, really tired.

2718
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,780
Just haven't been feeling great.

2719
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:54,780
And even doing my yoga this morning didn't help.

2720
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:56,740
Today has just been a day of exhaustion.

2721
02:12:56,740 --> 02:13:03,700
However, I would like to give a thank you to the SF Market on Florin Road in South Sac,

2722
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:07,260
which is usually a very scary part of town, but I found something wonderful and delightful

2723
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:08,260
there.

2724
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:14,460
Apart from mochi and salt and a chocolate salt pokey.

2725
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:17,580
They had Cafe Du Monde chicory coffee.

2726
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:22,660
The only other place I've purchased this before was in New Orleans at the Cafe Du Monde.

2727
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:25,260
So it just made me really homesick.

2728
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:29,660
And the weather here today, the weird ass weather we've been having, reminds me of Alabama.

2729
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:30,660
So I've been doubly homesick.

2730
02:13:30,660 --> 02:13:35,420
I really, really, really want to get back to Alabama and visit everybody before, you

2731
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:38,700
know, everything blooms and the humid hits.

2732
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:40,700
Very sad.

2733
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:41,700
Loki.

2734
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:50,340
Uh, I guess, uh, fuck you to the people, or I should say, I think it's the California

2735
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:55,980
Transportation Department or something like that for not painting lines on the freeway

2736
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:57,660
and scratching out.

2737
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:59,820
There's like four sets of scratched out lines.

2738
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:02,300
I don't know where the fuck the lanes are 50 on the way here.

2739
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:03,300
Huh?

2740
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:04,300
Oh my God.

2741
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,300
In the rain.

2742
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:06,300
It makes all the other lines transparent.

2743
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:10,740
It's just like, I don't know where the fucking lanes are because they're just going and they

2744
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:11,740
don't go straight.

2745
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:16,860
Yeah, it's doing it on 82 where they're doing repaving on 80.

2746
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:21,900
And when we had that really bad rain on Friday night, and I'm saying bad for California because

2747
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,260
people in California don't know how to drive.

2748
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:24,260
I know.

2749
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,260
I know.

2750
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:31,300
Um, coming from South Sac all the way on, um, from 99 to 80 was just torture.

2751
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,780
So yeah, I, I get ya.

2752
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:35,140
It's just like, I'm like, am I in the lane?

2753
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:36,980
Which, which lines did I follow?

2754
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:37,980
It's just ridiculous.

2755
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:38,980
So fuck that.

2756
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:43,460
Um, Jason, our guest, do you have anything you want to give angst to?

2757
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:48,820
F you to California weather this weekend, this is a shitty weekend to visit.

2758
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,820
I'm so sorry.

2759
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:51,940
It's been, it's been rainy.

2760
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:54,020
We drove through Hale on the way up here.

2761
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,540
It's been windy as all hell.

2762
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:58,540
It's been a, it's not fucking sunshine and beaches.

2763
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:00,640
I left Alabama weather.

2764
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,860
I left nice Colorado weather.

2765
02:15:02,860 --> 02:15:06,120
Like it was literally just cleaning up the day that I got on the bus and it's kind of

2766
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:09,540
been miserable since we got here, including the actual bus trip out here.

2767
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:14,420
Other than that, F you to the screens and God only knows what other sounds at all hours

2768
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,420
of the night in downtown San Francisco.

2769
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:20,860
I'm probably never going to get used to that, but you know, that's, that's pretty much it.

2770
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:21,860
All right.

2771
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:25,380
I will, I will indulge the email from earlier and I will start off tonight with a thank

2772
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:26,380
you.

2773
02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:31,380
I would like to say thank you to the tortilla lady at Denio's farmers market because the

2774
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:33,620
pumpkin tortillas are amazing.

2775
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:34,620
So thank you.

2776
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:35,620
Thank you.

2777
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:36,620
Tortilla lady.

2778
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:42,860
F you to the pistachio dude, because your pistachios kind of tastes like vinegar.

2779
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:43,860
Serious stuff, guys.

2780
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:44,860
Serious stuff.

2781
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:45,860
All right.

2782
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:46,860
Um, more gaming news.

2783
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,780
Your calls are just a little bit away.

2784
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,340
One eight seven seven game OLR, but not yet.

2785
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,820
We still have some news, some big news.

2786
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:52,820
Loki.

2787
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:53,820
All right.

2788
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:59,300
Let's uh, let's talk a little bit about, um, this kind of ties in a little bit with the

2789
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:02,140
whole kickstart thing, but we'll get to that obsidian man.

2790
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:07,500
They cannot catch a break this week, um, or even like it looks like the past year, but

2791
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:08,780
let's start off with obsidian.

2792
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:12,860
They've been hit with some layoffs and of course obsidian's working on the South Park

2793
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:16,100
RPG that's going to be coming out, um, later this year.

2794
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:22,660
They also worked out on a fallout new Vegas, so, um, and apparently they have had to let

2795
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:30,960
go and they've, um, lost approximately 20 to 30 people and, um, they also have another

2796
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,580
project canceled.

2797
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:36,380
This time is supposed to be for a future next gen system, uh, which I believe is the new

2798
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:38,580
Xbox system.

2799
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:45,020
And uh, also I guess, um, you know, there are some people that let go of one that started,

2800
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:50,620
uh, the day before and one that, you know, started the week before.

2801
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:55,060
And um, so yeah, that, that kind of sucks.

2802
02:16:55,060 --> 02:17:02,100
Um, also they've had, uh, an Xbox Live Arcade title that they were working on, um, a new

2803
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:10,100
original IP, uh, that has been put on hold as well and, uh, that kind of sucks.

2804
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:16,180
Um, the other thing too, which, um, I didn't see, well, I think we'll get to it a little

2805
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:22,340
bit later, but, um, they, uh, they may be going to a Kickstarter actually.

2806
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:23,340
It's kind of cool.

2807
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:29,300
There was this opinion piece that was written on Kotaku and it was kind of interesting talking

2808
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:33,860
about Kickstarter and the fact that, you know, some of these studios just can't catch a break

2809
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:37,840
because of all this publisher bullshit, whether the publisher's, you know, not greenlighting

2810
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:43,100
something because it's a genre, like an old genre that they don't think is viable anymore,

2811
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:47,780
or if it's just, you know, kind of this really experimental type of game or that kind of

2812
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:52,140
stuff where that they can actually cut out the publishers if they go to Kickstarter and

2813
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,580
get their projects funded.

2814
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:58,580
Not only will it kind of get funded by Kickstarter, but the, especially lately with, like, these,

2815
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:03,660
you know, Tim Schafer stuff and the whole, uh, Wasteland 2 thing, that, you know, it

2816
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:08,160
gets a lot of press and people get, you know, you know, behind it, plus, you know, a lot

2817
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:13,880
of this, you know, independent games, a lot of them are getting a lot of indie coverage

2818
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:18,300
and, like, grassroots, you know, efforts through Facebook and Twitter and, you know, those

2819
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,820
get picked up by, you know, the gaming blogs and whatnot.

2820
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:27,700
So it's kind of interesting and, um, so I wonder if we will see a lot of people turning

2821
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:34,500
to Kickstarter, especially some of these companies that are, like, can you imagine, like, if

2822
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:39,380
Grin, for example, started some Kickstarters for different projects that they were working

2823
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:42,580
on that would have been, well, I don't, obviously-

2824
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:44,900
Oh, that new Strider game we talked about a couple weeks ago.

2825
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:49,900
It's a silly Strider, but, you know, they could go to Kickstarter to, um, get some of

2826
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:54,540
the stuff, well, I don't know if they would be able to pull out a Strider, but, um, you

2827
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:59,420
know, make some really awesome games and maybe they would have been able to do some of that

2828
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:00,420
stuff.

2829
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:04,700
You know, it kind of sucks that they're working on a lot of good stuff, but, um, so yeah,

2830
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:09,100
that's one good thing, I guess, that Kickstarter can provide is, you know, an avenue for some

2831
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:13,660
of these game genres that publishers think are dead.

2832
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:15,660
I love SSJ100Matt's idea in the chatroom.

2833
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:19,200
We should do a list list of what Kickstarter game funds we would give money to.

2834
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,980
We should have- we will do that in a future episode.

2835
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:27,420
So, um, you kind of two different directions there, um, Obsidian, I want to start there,

2836
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:31,620
um, good news or bad news for the South Park game, like, I was looking forward to it and

2837
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:35,300
now I'm kind of like, uh-oh, I mean, hopefully it's far along in development where these

2838
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,300
won't matter.

2839
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:39,140
I don't think it's- I would think that they have a bigger team than 20 or 30 people working

2840
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:43,420
on it, and it's not just programmers or developers and that, you know, it's not just programmers,

2841
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:44,820
but it's just, like, kind of across the board.

2842
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:50,860
They're just making cuts at the company, um, and I think we may touch on why they might

2843
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:55,820
be making cuts on that stuff in a little bit, but, uh, it's just, you know, they have to

2844
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:57,700
trim the fat, I guess.

2845
02:19:57,700 --> 02:20:03,540
Um, Kickstarter, um, again, kind of like we were saying earlier, there's just- there's

2846
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:07,140
a lot I worry about with Kickstarter where it's just gonna be too much, it's gonna get

2847
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:11,700
saturated and, you know, I don't think everybody needs to get on board with it, but I like

2848
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:13,460
the comparison you give with the grand.

2849
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:17,460
See, now, Kickstarter, I'm not sure exactly how it works, if it has- a project has to

2850
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:22,860
be fully funded or not, because that one, the guy I was referring to as the Jabba the

2851
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:29,980
Hutt Reapus guy, um, he quoted saying that they have to make 10 grand to get money.

2852
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:32,740
They have to basically- 10 grand is the bottom limit.

2853
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:37,980
I've seen some Kickstarters for $500, though, so I think it's just- I don't think Kickstarter

2854
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:38,980
sets that.

2855
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:39,980
I think they're setting it for their project.

2856
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:41,660
Maybe it's a percentage or something, I don't know.

2857
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:42,660
It could be.

2858
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:43,660
Yeah, it could be.

2859
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:45,660
It could be a certain percentage, depending on how much you get.

2860
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:50,500
Alright, well, there's some more stories that somewhat tie into this, and one of them is

2861
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:57,900
this interesting piece that's out there, and this is a particular piece that was on YouTube,

2862
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:03,240
and then Kotaku wrote up an article on it that basically kind of went to talking about

2863
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:08,700
these points about video game reviews, and the whole video just kind of, you know, it's

2864
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:13,100
a lot of the stuff I think we've kind of heard before about the reviews are bought, basically.

2865
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:17,620
I did watch the whole thing, and a lot of- I think there's some of their facts are straight,

2866
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:19,860
some of them are kind of eh, you know.

2867
02:21:19,860 --> 02:21:22,000
Let me go through some of these bullets here.

2868
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,940
Video game publishers see game reviewers as marketing tools.

2869
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:26,260
Yes, that's absolutely true.

2870
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:29,560
Well, they see game reviews as marketing tools, for sure.

2871
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:33,060
Publishers sometimes allow positive reviews to be published before negative ones.

2872
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:34,060
Absolutely.

2873
02:21:34,060 --> 02:21:37,300
Publishers sometimes require game reviewers to not mention certain plot or technical details

2874
02:21:37,300 --> 02:21:39,780
in exchange for being furnished with an advanced review copy.

2875
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:41,140
That is fact, yes.

2876
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:43,980
Publishers might not want to advertise on an outlet that slams their game.

2877
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:46,160
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

2878
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:49,660
Critics are often at a loss for insightful ways of describing what they found objectionable

2879
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:53,540
about a game they don't like.

2880
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:55,260
I can see that sometimes, yeah.

2881
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:58,660
Yeah, I can too, based on the way some people react to it.

2882
02:21:58,660 --> 02:22:01,620
Reviews are banal checklists.

2883
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:03,540
I think some are.

2884
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:08,540
Especially ones not written by professional gamers.

2885
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:12,700
I think a lot of the ones that you see, and I'm not slamming every, but a lot like in

2886
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:19,020
the community newspapers and stuff, are the press release reworded.

2887
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:21,420
Some that I've seen.

2888
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:24,800
Game reviewers may not know that they're biased, but if they knew they were biased, would they

2889
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,980
tell us?

2890
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:28,980
I'm sure that they would, they have to seem unbiased.

2891
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:31,420
I think some know they are biased, personally.

2892
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,820
All these positive reviews from biased reviewers lead the public into accidentally playing

2893
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:39,140
bad games.

2894
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:44,620
Playing bad games or buying bad games, I think is, you know, I mean, so what?

2895
02:22:44,620 --> 02:22:48,620
If you play a bad game, it's not like you can, you know, contract herpes or something

2896
02:22:48,620 --> 02:22:49,620
like that.

2897
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:52,100
I mean, I don't see, it's like, oh my God, I played a horrible game.

2898
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:54,020
I need to, like, hide in the corner.

2899
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:55,020
I mean, who cares?

2900
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,460
So you play a bad game.

2901
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:57,460
Brain herpes.

2902
02:22:57,460 --> 02:23:01,500
I mean, because someone, once again, it's someone's opinion, just because they like

2903
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:02,940
it, doesn't mean you're necessarily gonna like it.

2904
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:06,020
You remember the Gamefly commercials and the Epic Rage?

2905
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:07,540
Oh yeah, it's stupid.

2906
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:09,700
That's the point they're pushing in those commercials.

2907
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:11,060
Here's the last one.

2908
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:16,740
Legislators are happy when this mess results in pro-American games topping the charts.

2909
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,420
I think that's a little much.

2910
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:19,700
That seems a little much.

2911
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:21,180
That's the stretch bullet right there.

2912
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:22,900
That's the, we need to pad this up to one more.

2913
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:23,900
Okay, here goes.

2914
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:24,900
No, no.

2915
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:33,980
Um, now, I, I think that whole embargo thing is starting to get overboard.

2916
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:38,560
And I would really only trust a site that refuses to sign them, even if they get the

2917
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:39,560
reviews late.

2918
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:42,860
Like, that's one thing I'm happy, even though I don't have the time to play every game,

2919
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,440
I don't do this for a living or whatever, I can give you my honest opinion on games

2920
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:52,100
because we don't sign those, and we don't get these games for free, I mean, very, very

2921
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:54,180
rarely have we gotten them for free.

2922
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:57,820
And you know, we've spent our own money on them, so, you know, we can kind of tell you

2923
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:58,820
from that perspective.

2924
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:01,340
Got like two games from publishers.

2925
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:05,260
Not that I'm saying OLR is the authority or that we're somehow better than all of the

2926
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:08,340
rest of this, but I'm just saying, I like that, you know, because there's plenty of

2927
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:12,260
other podcasters out there that are in the same boat, and that's why I kind of like hearing

2928
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:19,100
the opinion of quote-unquote real people when it comes to games.

2929
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:20,640
Let's also kind of take a step further.

2930
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:24,460
There was another story this week that talked about how reviews can really be kind of screwing

2931
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:31,100
up the industry, and that is this whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores.

2932
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:35,460
Not user Metacritic scores, Metacritic scores from established critics.

2933
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,780
And Obsidian was going to be, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you heard about this story,

2934
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:42,460
but for Fallout New Vegas, Obsidian, you know, it wasn't Bethesda, it was Obsidian that kind

2935
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:47,380
of did the port of it or whatever, did the, you know, newer, New Vegas part of it.

2936
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:53,340
They would have been given a bonus if an 85 plus score was on Metacritic.

2937
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:57,380
So if the game got an 85 plus on Metacritic, they would have got a big bonus.

2938
02:24:57,380 --> 02:24:58,380
You know what it got?

2939
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:04,300
An 84 on Metacritic, and so no bonus.

2940
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:10,740
Just the whole thing of paying or giving incentives for good reviews just totally makes me think

2941
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:11,740
of the government.

2942
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:17,320
And also, here's the other thing too, is Metacritic, how exactly, first off, how exactly do they

2943
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:20,820
... who is an authorized person?

2944
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:23,940
Who is an actual, like, site reviewer or whatever like that?

2945
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:27,420
If we put a review on our site, is it gonna show up on Metacritic?

2946
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:33,540
I believe it's similar to Rotten Tomatoes where you have to have so many reviews under

2947
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:39,940
your belt and you have to have some type of... you're either a member of an association

2948
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:41,420
or you have some type of degree or something.

2949
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:44,420
I don't know, I haven't looked at the rules, but I did look them up for Rotten Tomatoes

2950
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:48,380
once and it was something like that at the time, which was several years ago.

2951
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:56,820
So that leads into discussions about why are game developer bonuses based on review scores?

2952
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,460
I thought it was about the sales.

2953
02:25:58,460 --> 02:25:59,460
Exactly.

2954
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:03,560
It should be about the sales because a game can totally get great reviews.

2955
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:09,580
Mad World, for example, or... I'm trying to think, there's a lot of niche games on

2956
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:10,580
... pretty much.

2957
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:14,640
Okay, let's look at these RPGs that are coming out on the Wii.

2958
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:18,300
They're getting great reviews, but they're not gonna sell well.

2959
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:21,380
It's just because it's a niche audience that it's reaching.

2960
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:26,180
And so why are they basing it on reviews?

2961
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:27,620
So a game gets good reviews.

2962
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:31,860
It doesn't mean people are gonna buy it.

2963
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:36,540
And lastly, some news came out this week that we already kinda knew and that was this whole

2964
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:39,820
... it was a result of the fact, I don't know if you guys heard, but Giant Bomb got bought

2965
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:42,620
by CBS Interactive, which owns GameSpot.

2966
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:46,860
The ironic thing about that is that one of the big personalities that kinda started Giant

2967
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:51,920
Bomb, Jeff Gerstmann, well, he made Giant Bomb because he had to leave GameSpot.

2968
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:54,020
They basically sat him in a room and fired him.

2969
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,340
Why did they fire him?

2970
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:59,140
At the time, a lot of people were saying it's because he gave Kane & Lynch a bad review

2971
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:02,380
and they were big sponsors of the site at the time.

2972
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:08,080
And sure enough, it came out that it wasn't specifically the Kane & Lynch review because

2973
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:13,620
another thing was referenced about the Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction review

2974
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:14,860
from Sony.

2975
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:20,740
But basically GameSpot's editorial management basically sat him down and said that he couldn't

2976
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:24,300
be trusted as an editorial director.

2977
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:29,000
Couldn't be trusted with the people that are paying for ads on their site.

2978
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,780
That's absolutely ridiculous and completely unfair.

2979
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:36,940
Now, who is to blame at the end of the day for this whole cycle?

2980
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:38,940
Who is to blame?

2981
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,820
Corporations.

2982
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:42,380
You.

2983
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,140
You are to blame.

2984
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:50,060
If you've ever filled out a comment or a survey thing that said, why did you buy this game?

2985
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:52,060
Review from what website?

2986
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:57,380
If you did that, you are partially to blame.

2987
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,380
Think about it.

2988
02:27:58,380 --> 02:27:59,380
I don't think I've ever done that.

2989
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:00,380
I'm just saying.

2990
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,780
I know what I'm saying it in a way that's gonna catch people off guard a little bit,

2991
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:05,440
but I want you to really think about that.

2992
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:11,060
I mean, why else do the companies feel like they can get away with this?

2993
02:28:11,060 --> 02:28:16,860
I think we as the users have to kind of rise up and demand more transparency.

2994
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:24,220
I think we need to support sites that will not support embargoes and this stuff and not

2995
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:26,140
let the publishers do the talking.

2996
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:27,140
It's the same.

2997
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:29,460
It's practically the same thing as lobbying, you know.

2998
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,460
Oh yeah.

2999
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:38,500
Or politicians who take, you know, sponsorships from major corporations, it's the same thing.

3000
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:42,500
You know, they're basically getting paid, so of course they're gonna put in a good word.

3001
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:48,060
Or in the case of, you know, the politics analogy, they're gonna lean their vote towards

3002
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:51,620
the interest of the people they're paying their, you know, lining their pockets.

3003
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:57,500
So support independent radio websites.

3004
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:01,540
I really mean it, because this kind of stuff's only going to continue.

3005
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:04,060
And don't vote partisan.

3006
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:07,580
All right.

3007
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:08,580
Moving on.

3008
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:09,580
Did I have anything else?

3009
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:12,540
I think I got all the little pieces of that story, because there was quite a bit there.

3010
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:13,540
Yeah.

3011
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:14,540
So.

3012
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:15,540
How about something happy?

3013
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:16,540
How about something happy?

3014
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:17,540
Okay.

3015
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:20,420
Well, I'm sure I've made it no secret that I am a huge fan of Cracked.

3016
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:22,500
I love Cracked.com.

3017
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:26,580
And they actually posted an article that really made me stop and look at it that I wanted

3018
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:27,580
to share with everybody.

3019
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:30,620
And, you know, so full credit to Cracked for this.

3020
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:35,420
I'm, you know, not trying to step on toes, so this goes to Mike Cooney, Eddie Rodriguez,

3021
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:37,980
and Steve Hanley, who wrote the article.

3022
02:29:37,980 --> 02:29:38,980
Shout out.

3023
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:40,460
I'm just saying, because it was really good.

3024
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:44,100
It's six acts of real-life heroism made possible by video games.

3025
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:45,100
So I'm just gonna go over it real quick.

3026
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,100
Okay.

3027
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:47,100
And then I'd like to get everyone's thoughts on it.

3028
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,100
Mm-hmm.

3029
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:49,100
Okay.

3030
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:52,820
And really, it's actually the first three on the list that really stuck with me.

3031
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:59,820
There was the one where online gamers saved a guy from killing himself.

3032
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:04,460
There was an autistic, it says, a Canadian teenager made the news after helping an autistic

3033
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:10,900
youth online who was showing serious signs of depression to the point of hinting at suicide.

3034
02:30:10,900 --> 02:30:15,500
So he didn't know where he lived, only had his gammer tag, but he contacted the police

3035
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:19,620
and contacted the kid over Xbox Live and they talked him down.

3036
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:20,620
Wow.

3037
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:23,300
He was showing concern for another human being.

3038
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:26,860
I don't, that's a good thing out of Xbox Live?

3039
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:27,860
That's astounding.

3040
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:29,700
Well, there's more on that, too.

3041
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:31,380
His parents didn't even know.

3042
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:32,380
Wow.

3043
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:34,980
Someone who lived 1,500 miles away noticed.

3044
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:41,500
So it's another sign, too, that you basically, I don't think in a lot of cases, once your

3045
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:44,700
kid's out and going to school, I don't think parents really know their kids as well as

3046
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:51,100
they think they might, not in the ways that I think they can really relate to, not as

3047
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:54,920
much as somebody within their own peer group, you know what I mean?

3048
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:57,860
And I think that someone needs to be careful and look at all the signs.

3049
02:30:57,860 --> 02:31:00,180
You put yourself in their shoes.

3050
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:03,100
And then this one now, this one I thought was really neat.

3051
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:04,100
This is that Evony game.

3052
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:11,140
I know, I kind of scoff at the game, but there's a guy with muscular dystrophy who, his house

3053
02:31:11,140 --> 02:31:16,540
caught on fire while he was playing a game, and he couldn't get out safely because he

3054
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:19,860
had muscular dystrophy, it was wheelchair-bound.

3055
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:25,840
And his friends in the game called the police department and the fire department and helped

3056
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:27,460
him get out of his house.

3057
02:31:27,460 --> 02:31:28,460
Wow.

3058
02:31:28,460 --> 02:31:29,700
So there's that.

3059
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:34,220
This one, this is the number five on the list that I thought was pretty cool.

3060
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:39,820
A guy who had been playing Medal of Modern War, oh, never mind, they just-

3061
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:40,820
Medal of Modern Warfare?

3062
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:44,980
It was a little name that they came up with, but he had actually been playing America's

3063
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,980
Army.

3064
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:46,980
Which-

3065
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:47,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3066
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:50,020
I watched the medic training on that one, and it's pretty-

3067
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:53,660
Well, it's an army recruitment game at the end of the day, yeah.

3068
02:31:53,660 --> 02:32:02,660
I mean, but he, what happened is that he had encountered a car crash where someone in an

3069
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:09,340
SUV flipped upside down and the car was spewing smoke, and he actually used the medic training

3070
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:16,580
from the game to help the guy, basically the person in the accident lost like two fingers

3071
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:21,540
and was gushing blood from his head, and he bandaged the hand, raised it above his head

3072
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,420
to stop the bleeding, and bandaged the guy's head-

3073
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:24,740
Oh, my God.

3074
02:32:24,740 --> 02:32:33,660
And contacted EMT, all from knowing, and he credited it to the medical training in America's

3075
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:34,660
Army.

3076
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:35,660
Wow.

3077
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:38,740
So, and then this one was actually pretty cool, and this is a World of Warcraft one,

3078
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:39,740
so this one-

3079
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,740
And he was immediately drafted.

3080
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:41,740
I'm just kidding.

3081
02:32:41,740 --> 02:32:45,300
This one, this one hits a little close, because you'll know what I'm talking about.

3082
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:46,300
A little glimped?

3083
02:32:46,300 --> 02:32:47,300
Okay.

3084
02:32:47,300 --> 02:32:52,220
A 12-year-old Norwegian boy was walking with his sister and got attacked by a moose.

3085
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:55,220
Yeah, a moose once bit my sister.

3086
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:57,420
Ghost crawler promised me a moose.

3087
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,420
Okay.

3088
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:04,700
His sister was 10, and the moose started to charge him, male moose probably in season,

3089
02:33:04,700 --> 02:33:12,300
and so the little boy taunted the moose away from his sister and played dead.

3090
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,620
And he credited it to World of Warcraft.

3091
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:16,700
To taunt and feign death.

3092
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:17,700
He said, if you've got-

3093
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,820
Well, now, hunters can't taunt.

3094
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:20,820
Let me finish.

3095
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:23,020
This damn kid doesn't know what he's talking about.

3096
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:25,020
Let me finish.

3097
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:33,540
But he said basically is that his brain translated it as aggro, and it was an aggressive animal,

3098
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:37,940
so he grabbed his attention, because an aggressive animal is going to go to the thing making

3099
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:40,620
the biggest noise, the biggest threat.

3100
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:47,300
And then he said he played dead, he feigned death, and the moose sniffed at him, nudged

3101
02:33:47,300 --> 02:33:52,420
him, and walked off, left him and his sister alone.

3102
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:53,420
Pretty neat.

3103
02:33:53,420 --> 02:33:57,780
And the other ones on here, now those are like the big three for me on these, because

3104
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:03,900
the other ones are about how they're helping stroke victims recover by improving hand-eye

3105
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:05,900
coordination.

3106
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:09,860
There's another one here about a web browser game that people have used to discover two

3107
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:15,100
planets that's- Let me see if I can't get the name of this called.

3108
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:21,860
It's Planet Hunters, which basically chooses them to monitor light emissions, and it'll

3109
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:27,180
do a certain thing when a planet crosses through a particular star's path, and players have

3110
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:30,340
discovered two planets that way.

3111
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:33,820
There's another one on here about helping stroke victims recover.

3112
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:39,860
One of them got really excited, but it turned out it was just Bluto.

3113
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:46,100
And then- Thank you, I'll be here all week.

3114
02:34:46,100 --> 02:34:52,740
They used the skills of a 14-year-old boy who invented a procedure, this is for a science

3115
02:34:52,740 --> 02:35:00,740
fair project, of using a controller to do internal stitches, where you'd have to use

3116
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:02,420
a robot for it.

3117
02:35:02,420 --> 02:35:07,780
And now you kind of have that with Kinect, if the Windows commercials are to be believed.

3118
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:16,140
But it was using a surgical device called an endostitch, and it's used to sew up patients

3119
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:24,240
after a hysterectomy, but he was using that same procedure only with a video game controller

3120
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:25,240
for medical purposes.

3121
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:28,260
But I want to go back to the first three that I listed.

3122
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:33,940
Those are, instead of just applying what you know from video games, those are saving people's

3123
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:34,940
lives.

3124
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:41,140
I mean, when you have a bear come in your thing, you're told to play dead, but he specifically

3125
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:44,780
said that he needed to taunt the aggro away.

3126
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:45,780
From his sister, yeah.

3127
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:54,600
And, you know, I've run into, like, I had a case when I was playing PSO, where I actually

3128
02:35:54,600 --> 02:36:02,140
got really sick and was given some advice from just a random person in there who happened

3129
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:05,020
to be an EMT.

3130
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:08,660
And it took care of me from being nauseous, I didn't have to go to the hospital.

3131
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:13,100
I think I told you about that, like, yeah.

3132
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:16,460
You know, I've had plenty of friends that were going through really hard times that

3133
02:36:16,460 --> 02:36:20,740
just, you know, being friends with them online has kind of kept their head above water so

3134
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:22,660
that they have a support network.

3135
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:28,300
You know, but the one that really struck me was the guy getting the, you know, the medical

3136
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:29,300
training.

3137
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:34,740
And I watched the video, it's actually, I've had emergency training before, and it's more

3138
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:39,460
in depth than what I did in my first aid classes.

3139
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:44,500
So I'm just pretty amazed at that, I mean, what do you think of, I wanted to bring this

3140
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:48,140
up because people say, oh, video games make you violent, meh.

3141
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:51,300
Well, obviously, I know that that's not true, and, you know, I've heard of some of these

3142
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:52,860
good things before.

3143
02:36:52,860 --> 02:36:55,260
There's sometimes a dark side to these MMOs.

3144
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:59,040
You know, we heard about the, you know, kidnapped across state lines and all that.

3145
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:03,340
It's nice to hear some of the good stuff, too, about how technology, I think it's more

3146
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:09,020
technology is saving lives, and, you know, gaming is that technology, some of it.

3147
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:12,780
So I don't know, how can you argue with the good news here?

3148
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:14,660
I mean, it's good stuff.

3149
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:23,340
I just really wish that more, like, more mainstream news sources would really focus more on advertising

3150
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:28,140
stuff like this instead of just finding sensationalist stories that give everybody a bad name.

3151
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,380
Speaking of supporting independent media.

3152
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:31,380
Exactly.

3153
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:35,900
Yeah, and this is, wow, stutter-tastic.

3154
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:40,760
This kind of thing, it's exactly the kind of thing you want to hear, because it's people

3155
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:47,020
that are applying any kind of knowledge that's at least rooted in some kind of truth.

3156
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:49,660
It's such, yeah, they have a weird association.

3157
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:51,620
I learned about it from a video game.

3158
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:52,620
Big deal.

3159
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:53,620
As long as you've learned.

3160
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:54,620
Good for them.

3161
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:58,220
They did something fantastic with a little bit of knowledge bestowed upon them.

3162
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:00,900
You know, I actually did learn how to drive through Ridge Racer.

3163
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:02,140
No, big-

3164
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:08,700
And it's funny that you say that, because when I was starting to get towards the age

3165
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:15,220
of learning driving, about to go to driving school, my grandpa, one of my grandpas, would

3166
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:19,140
give me a hard time because I would talk about driving video games.

3167
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:25,380
And it's like, I think I probably went a little bit above and beyond in a sense that I don't

3168
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:30,220
want to, I think I may have one time said, I don't want to drive, you know, video games

3169
02:38:30,220 --> 02:38:33,100
can't kill you, so I would rather do that instead.

3170
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:37,540
But at the same time, it's like, I went in there and I wasn't scared of driving.

3171
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:39,980
I wasn't, it wasn't new to me.

3172
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:43,060
I've been in my parents' car plenty of times.

3173
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:45,380
Yeah, you pick up things like this.

3174
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:46,380
Well, great.

3175
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:49,860
My whole thing was that I always had problems cornering because I was learning how to drive

3176
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:54,900
in a boat pretty much, you know, an older large vehicle.

3177
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:59,020
And it was, because you know how wonky the original Ridge Racer steering was and how

3178
02:38:59,020 --> 02:39:01,580
you had to be super careful with your cornering.

3179
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:07,020
It was while playing that game that it clicked in my head what I was doing wrong in the car.

3180
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:08,500
And I never had a problem cornering.

3181
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:09,500
Never.

3182
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:10,500
All right.

3183
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:14,500
Well, you can ask Ron about that when I managed to make that turn off off the Bay Bridge to

3184
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:17,500
going to Treasure Island in my Lancer and drifted.

3185
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:19,180
Ah, all right.

3186
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:20,180
Let's move on.

3187
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:21,180
I'm trying to get to call.

3188
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:22,180
So we have some time for calls.

3189
02:39:22,180 --> 02:39:23,180
Loki quickly.

3190
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:24,180
All right.

3191
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:25,980
I will be super quick.

3192
02:39:25,980 --> 02:39:29,980
So let's talk a little bit about Peter Molyneux.

3193
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:35,640
Well, not Peter Molyneux per se, but Peter Moly-doe.

3194
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:42,060
It's the parody account that's on Twitter that comes up with all these weird like game

3195
02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:43,060
ideas.

3196
02:39:43,060 --> 02:39:47,800
Like for example, you control a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during winter.

3197
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,980
You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses.

3198
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:53,740
So similar to the OLR dream games.

3199
02:39:53,740 --> 02:39:54,960
Yeah, something like that.

3200
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:57,220
Just really weird stuff.

3201
02:39:57,220 --> 02:39:59,340
Here's the funny thing.

3202
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:04,620
Someone has convinced him that he should do a game jam where independent developers out

3203
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:10,120
there will create games based on these crazy ideas.

3204
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:11,460
And that's what's going to happen.

3205
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:20,220
Actually going to Moly Jam 2012 is set to run, I guess, March 31st and or through April

3206
02:40:20,220 --> 02:40:21,220
1st.

3207
02:40:21,220 --> 02:40:30,740
And actually a few cities, San Francisco and Brighton also that has expanded to now a few

3208
02:40:30,740 --> 02:40:40,300
more cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Melbourne and New York.

3209
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:47,380
And of course, what's even more interesting about that is Peter Molyneux is actually going

3210
02:40:47,380 --> 02:40:49,820
to join in on this as well.

3211
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:52,380
Now that he's got some free time.

3212
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:54,460
Good for him having a sense of humor about the whole thing.

3213
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:58,260
And he's actually, it's kind of funny, is some of the ideas like for example, there

3214
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:05,700
is a post by the Peter Molyneux that he's all, my first mobile game will be free, but

3215
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:11,140
if you pay a little, then the NPCs will be extra nice and compliment you more while playing.

3216
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:14,140
Peter Molyneux responds, that's not a bad idea actually.

3217
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:17,620
And so, you know, just like, you know, funny things like that.

3218
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:20,740
And this one's another funny one.

3219
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:24,380
Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment.

3220
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:28,860
Your baby would act as a torch, rocking the baby intensifies the glow, et cetera.

3221
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:36,060
You know, just like, that just makes me think of the crying scene for Max Payne.

3222
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:39,520
But the whole thing is, you know, he has these really weird ideas, but there's actually some

3223
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:44,340
funny ones that he came up with like the bullying, the RPG or whatever that had bullying as,

3224
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:47,620
you know, the combat system or something like that.

3225
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:51,300
And so they're gonna make some of these things, including that rabbit one, they actually have

3226
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:52,880
a video of that.

3227
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:59,460
And yeah, there's actually some people that are, you know, interested in doing that.

3228
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:04,580
They're saying that, I guess they're, I'm trying to see if there's any other really

3229
02:42:04,580 --> 02:42:05,580
big guys.

3230
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:10,820
The people behind it right now, the organizers, Anna Kipleness, Brandon Sheffield, Patrick

3231
02:42:10,820 --> 02:42:21,140
Klepec, which I think he was from Joystiq, Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Joe Kowalski, and

3232
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:24,380
Edward Paris.

3233
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:31,420
So it's interesting, and of course, if you're interested in this, you can check out, well,

3234
02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:37,400
you can follow, or check out Vox Games, or you can follow, I think they've got a website

3235
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:41,660
for this already, let's see here.

3236
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:45,380
I know some people that are participating in this, so it's gonna be fun.

3237
02:42:45,380 --> 02:43:02,420
Yeah, well, first off, you can check the fake Twitter account for, it's Peter Molydeux,

3238
02:43:02,420 --> 02:43:12,060
and they have a Google Docs page, but you can just look it up, it's Game Jams Fun Time,

3239
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:13,860
Fun Times.

3240
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:18,700
So yeah, check it out, and then of course, you know, I think they're gonna be adding

3241
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:21,500
like an actual webpage and stuff for this at some point.

3242
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:26,940
Alright, I got one more story for you guys, and I'm gonna make this real quick, because

3243
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:31,880
this is something that has been going around for forever, and just will not go away, and

3244
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:34,460
that is that there is no new Xbox this year at E3.

3245
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:37,540
I could've sworn this was already reported on, but it made the rounds on the gaming blogs

3246
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:39,420
again this week.

3247
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:43,920
Some folks that are close to, I guess, Bloomberg, are insisting that Microsoft's gonna introduce

3248
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:46,660
a new console in 2013.

3249
02:43:46,660 --> 02:43:52,840
It'll be at E3 next year, but Bloomberg Magazine was told by David Dennis, who's a group manager

3250
02:43:52,840 --> 02:44:00,120
of PR at Xbox, 2012 is all about the Xbox 360, so stop the rumors, there will be no

3251
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:02,740
slick new Xbox lube until 2013.

3252
02:44:02,740 --> 02:44:05,160
There you go.

3253
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:06,160
That's the final word.

3254
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,300
Well it makes sense, they've got stuff to show off this year, next year will be when

3255
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:09,300
they unveil it.

3256
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:13,500
Alright, we are gonna open the phones, so call now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

3257
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:18,200
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

3258
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:22,900
OrangeLoungeRadio, and damn that's fast, it's already lighting up, we got a call, hi you're

3259
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:24,660
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3260
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:25,660
This is Shane.

3261
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:28,180
Hey, you're fast, you like know when we're gonna open it up, what's up?

3262
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:31,060
I know, it's like I was given advanced warning or something.

3263
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:34,100
Something like that, well what's on your mind tonight, what do you wanna talk about?

3264
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:37,260
What do I normally talk about?

3265
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:38,260
Mass Effect.

3266
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:43,380
Yes, that is my second best favorite thing in the world, so let's talk about that.

3267
02:44:43,380 --> 02:44:47,140
Okay, since you're pissed off that I didn't give you credit for getting me into Mass Effect,

3268
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:50,780
which was basically that you were pouting and whining and crying and threatening not

3269
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:53,540
to be my friend anymore unless I would play Mass Effect.

3270
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:59,260
Which that's a lie, I think I just bombarded you with me talking about it, I don't think

3271
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:01,220
there was pouting or crying.

3272
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:02,220
There was a little bit.

3273
02:45:02,220 --> 02:45:04,580
You need to convince Jamie that she should play it too.

3274
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:07,300
Jamie, it's gonna, it'll change your life.

3275
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:09,740
Buy me a copy.

3276
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:10,740
We're all poor.

3277
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:11,740
Me too please.

3278
02:45:11,740 --> 02:45:12,740
I'm broke.

3279
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:17,540
Alright, we're pressed for time tonight, so what do you wanna say about Mass Effect?

3280
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:22,620
Well as I sit here just exiting out of Mass Effect 1 that I was just playing, and in

3281
02:45:22,620 --> 02:45:32,740
my N7 t-shirt, I would probably like to say that I am on the side of the retake Mass Effect

3282
02:45:32,740 --> 02:45:36,220
3 movement, which is give us a different ending.

3283
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:37,220
Oh, why?

3284
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:39,580
You didn't go to the government, did you?

3285
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:43,220
No, I'm not stupid, I joined a Facebook group.

3286
02:45:43,220 --> 02:45:46,260
Well, that's activism of the 21st century.

3287
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:50,140
Alright, so at least you're not totally crazy, you're in the same crowd.

3288
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:54,020
So without spoiling, why is the ending pissing everybody off?

3289
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:59,020
It's pretty much for the reason, well, the good reason that it's making everybody angry

3290
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:04,100
is that, like you said earlier, everything you've done up until the last 10 minutes of

3291
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:08,180
the game does not matter based on these endings.

3292
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:10,820
I don't care if it's not a happy ending.

3293
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:16,820
I didn't really expect it to be happy endings, but I expect an actual ending that makes sense,

3294
02:46:16,820 --> 02:46:23,180
not some Matrix crap or something stupid like that.

3295
02:46:23,180 --> 02:46:30,740
And I'm also part of the group of people that believe one of the endings that you get, if

3296
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:35,060
you do really well with all the extra stuff in the game, you get like an extra 10 seconds,

3297
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:40,860
and that leads to this entirely different theory about all the endings and that this

3298
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:45,300
one that you may consider bad is actually leading up to a real ending that they have

3299
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:46,540
not given us yet.

3300
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:49,400
And I will pay for DLC if they do it.

3301
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:52,340
So what is the point of joining the Facebook group?

3302
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:53,340
What do you want?

3303
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:54,460
What do you want out of all this?

3304
02:46:54,460 --> 02:46:57,940
I want a DLC ending.

3305
02:46:57,940 --> 02:47:03,300
Like I could see if somebody is not invested in the series, the endings are probably fine

3306
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:04,820
for them.

3307
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:12,660
But seeing as how I really like everything about the story and my Shepard's journey,

3308
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:16,780
they didn't end it like they kind of promised they would.

3309
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:21,900
And I'm not going to be like, I'll never buy one of your games again, but I will be like,

3310
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:26,800
I'll pay for DLC for you guys to make it right.

3311
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,660
Do you think that you should have to do that though?

3312
02:47:28,660 --> 02:47:32,940
Do you feel like maybe you're being exploited a little bit for your money because you're

3313
02:47:32,940 --> 02:47:33,940
so into this?

3314
02:47:33,940 --> 02:47:36,200
No, I don't think so.

3315
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:38,740
I think they just had a screw up.

3316
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:39,740
That's it.

3317
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:44,260
And I'm reading what a SIG vampire says, I'm just ignoring it because it doesn't, that

3318
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:49,020
part doesn't matter in one and two and when you end a trilogy and they promise that everything

3319
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:54,740
you've done up until the point is going to shape your game and it doesn't, that's where

3320
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:57,340
it's stupid.

3321
02:47:57,340 --> 02:48:01,700
But complaining to the government over it's pretty stupid too, you got to admit.

3322
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:04,780
No, I definitely agree with that.

3323
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:08,520
Now you sure, you sure there's never going to be another Mass Effect game?

3324
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:14,340
They said, again, you know, who knows what Bioware is really thinking sometimes, but

3325
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:18,180
they said if they ever did another game, it would not take place after three, you'd have

3326
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:21,180
to take place before or during three.

3327
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:27,460
And I don't know for a game like this, I don't understand why I'd want to play something

3328
02:48:27,460 --> 02:48:31,680
that takes place before the Mass Effect one through three and that definitely don't want

3329
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:37,540
to play something that takes place during three unless it's just extra DLC for three.

3330
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:43,680
So yeah, I can't see them doing a four that takes place after three, especially with what

3331
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,740
the endings do right now, currently.

3332
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:48,940
All right, well I got to wrap up to get more calls or any other thoughts you want to get

3333
02:48:48,940 --> 02:48:49,940
in there?

3334
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:53,260
Um, I had one and then I forgot it.

3335
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:55,300
Yeah, I forgot it.

3336
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:56,300
All right.

3337
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:57,300
That's right.

3338
02:48:57,300 --> 02:48:58,300
Right.

3339
02:48:58,300 --> 02:48:59,300
You forget.

3340
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:00,300
All right.

3341
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:01,300
Whatever.

3342
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:02,300
All right.

3343
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:03,300
By the way, Alan beat Mass Effect one if you didn't hear it.

3344
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:06,460
I know I talked to him on life journal about it already on it.

3345
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:07,460
All right.

3346
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:08,460
Yeah.

3347
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:09,460
I better let you go.

3348
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:10,460
So we get more calls.

3349
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:11,460
All right.

3350
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:12,460
Bye.

3351
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:13,460
One eight seven seven game.

3352
02:49:13,460 --> 02:49:14,460
OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio.

3353
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:15,460
You're laughing over there.

3354
02:49:15,460 --> 02:49:16,460
Jason.

3355
02:49:16,460 --> 02:49:19,580
Oh, just the, just, just the, just what's happening.

3356
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:20,580
Just the conversation around you.

3357
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:21,580
Right.

3358
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:22,580
All right.

3359
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:23,580
We got another call.

3360
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:24,580
Hi.

3361
02:49:24,580 --> 02:49:25,580
You're on orange launch radio.

3362
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:26,580
Who's this?

3363
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:27,580
What up guys?

3364
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,580
It's cynical for me.

3365
02:49:28,580 --> 02:49:29,580
Okay.

3366
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:30,580
See how you doing?

3367
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:31,580
Hey, I'm good.

3368
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:32,580
Xenocore.

3369
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:33,580
I had no idea about that.

3370
02:49:33,580 --> 02:49:34,580
Eighties music, by the way.

3371
02:49:34,580 --> 02:49:35,580
Thank you for sending me straight on that.

3372
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:36,580
Yeah, no.

3373
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:37,580
Oh, good.

3374
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:38,580
What's up?

3375
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:39,580
What's uh, what do we have the phone?

3376
02:49:39,580 --> 02:49:40,580
Oh, the phone call to tonight.

3377
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:46,060
I only caught the second part of the previous caller, but, uh, as far as the, the ending

3378
02:49:46,060 --> 02:49:48,180
and mass effect, it's, it's just piss poor.

3379
02:49:48,180 --> 02:49:53,340
I mean, literally Bioware has written much better content than that.

3380
02:49:53,340 --> 02:49:57,580
Uh, again, trying to keep it spoiler free cause I'm, I'm making my way there, but what

3381
02:49:57,580 --> 02:50:01,060
is it about the ending that's so irritating is it, would you say it's kind of the same

3382
02:50:01,060 --> 02:50:04,580
thing that's been brought up before that no matter what you do, you're kind of getting

3383
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:06,220
the same shit at the end?

3384
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:13,700
True, but they could've even covered it by not giving you the actual choice just by picking

3385
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:17,940
something that you did in the past and it would auto pick that choice when you got to

3386
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:18,940
the end.

3387
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:22,900
So it actually, something you did had some sway over what happened, but the way they

3388
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,060
did it, it was all erased.

3389
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:28,860
It was all used for filler and considering the quality of writing that Bioware usually

3390
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:33,640
puts out, surely their writers are a little bit better and coming up with summation better

3391
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:34,780
than that.

3392
02:50:34,780 --> 02:50:39,540
So are you into the DLC conspiracy where you're getting something real, but for a low, low

3393
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:41,100
price of $10?

3394
02:50:41,100 --> 02:50:44,900
Why would you pay for a product that's been trashed already?

3395
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:48,860
If you give me another 10 bucks, I'll actually finish it and put it together for you.

3396
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:53,060
No, if it said some assembly required, that's the way you're selling it.

3397
02:50:53,060 --> 02:50:54,060
Cause it worked for Bethesda.

3398
02:50:54,060 --> 02:50:58,900
Well true, I mean, I'm not saying they're not going to make money if they do that either.

3399
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:04,160
That product was so good in one and two, it's almost guaranteed to make money with the DLC.

3400
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:05,160
It's guaranteed.

3401
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:09,220
I mean, people are already asking for it, like, give me DLC, just finish the story the

3402
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:10,220
way we want.

3403
02:51:10,220 --> 02:51:13,380
So they probably will, they'll charge 10 bucks and they'll get their money.

3404
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:17,380
Interesting, Shane is sending me a private message with this comment, maybe you want

3405
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:18,900
to respond to this, I don't know.

3406
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:23,780
He says the other thing he forgot was, it's about the precedent it sets demanding DLC

3407
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:24,780
endings.

3408
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:29,060
Also, how even though it had a terrible ending, it didn't ruin the journey or the game.

3409
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:33,100
Did the ending ruin Mass Effect for you?

3410
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:37,700
I was watching a roomie play it, and it guaranteed I'm not buying it in a Mass Effect 3.

3411
02:51:37,700 --> 02:51:41,340
I see, okay, so you just kind of saw it through somebody else, but that's okay, I mean, certainly

3412
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:42,340
you can get Mass Effect 3.

3413
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:45,840
Well, I mean, I saw enough of stuff on the internet without seeing all the trailers to

3414
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:51,200
know that if I got to that ending, because the game isn't that difficult, it's not like

3415
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:55,960
the ending of Rygar to where getting to the ending is the feat itself because the game's

3416
02:51:55,960 --> 02:51:58,460
so damn hard, few people actually see it.

3417
02:51:58,460 --> 02:52:02,340
Well, to use the Sopranos comparison again, I didn't watch the whole series, I saw an

3418
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:05,620
episode or two, but even I know the ending of that sucked.

3419
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:12,260
True, true, I respect the way they did it, and even if, it's not so much the endings

3420
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:17,900
they provided, it's just the way they came to those endings, the user has no, half the

3421
02:52:17,900 --> 02:52:19,420
work you do is erased.

3422
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:24,420
God, I never play video games to completion, ever, ever, so if I beat Mass Effect 3, that's

3423
02:52:24,420 --> 02:52:29,460
a big if, but if I beat Mass Effect 3, that in itself is going to be like a noteworthy

3424
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:36,260
thing for the journal, you know, like, I beat a video game, because my ADD usually kicks

3425
02:52:36,260 --> 02:52:40,500
in 20 hours before this point.

3426
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:43,820
Some point I will finish Final Fantasy 13 too, I swear.

3427
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:44,820
Squirrels!

3428
02:52:44,820 --> 02:52:46,860
Seven, in my case.

3429
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:55,140
Oh, but I don't finish seven, because speaking of shit endings, alright, hey, SSJ100 Matt

3430
02:52:55,140 --> 02:53:00,220
says Bioware trolled you all, did Bioware troll us, Xenocore?

3431
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:05,320
Exactly, exactly, I'm convinced something must have happened corporate wise, maybe they

3432
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:10,180
ran out of time and they rushed the ending, or something smells fishy as far as the development

3433
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:11,740
to why the game is the way it is.

3434
02:53:11,740 --> 02:53:17,860
If the DLC conspiracies is true, then EA trolled us all.

3435
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:19,740
That's not too far fetched either, so.

3436
02:53:19,740 --> 02:53:22,540
Alright, well Xenocore, anything else before we let you go?

3437
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:24,380
No, that's it, y'all take it easy.

3438
02:53:24,380 --> 02:53:26,940
Alright you two, have a good one buddy.

3439
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:27,940
Alright, bye.

3440
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:35,060
877 game OLR, username on Skype, chat, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3441
02:53:35,060 --> 02:53:36,060
What is that?

3442
02:53:36,060 --> 02:53:37,060
You're having a fun night, Rob!

3443
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:41,780
I'm having like the burpiest night in the history of OLR, this is, what did I eat?

3444
02:53:41,780 --> 02:53:46,860
I had, I had Mongolian BBQ, because I took, I took to a new place, there is a new place

3445
02:53:46,860 --> 02:53:48,860
downtown called MongoMongo.

3446
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:50,940
I need to go there.

3447
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:51,940
Yes you do.

3448
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:52,940
It was good.

3449
02:53:52,940 --> 02:53:53,940
Alright.

3450
02:53:53,940 --> 02:53:54,940
Let's take a call.

3451
02:53:54,940 --> 02:53:55,940
I gotta be fast.

3452
02:53:55,940 --> 02:53:56,940
Hey.

3453
02:53:56,940 --> 02:53:57,940
Hey Sky, how's it going?

3454
02:53:57,940 --> 02:53:58,940
It's Legend Zaku here.

3455
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:00,020
Hey Zaku, you got through.

3456
02:54:00,020 --> 02:54:01,020
What's up buddy?

3457
02:54:01,020 --> 02:54:05,300
Yeah, it's been a long time, I don't know if I've actually called this year so far,

3458
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:10,620
I may have done it in January, but yeah, I'm just like touching back on what you know,

3459
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:15,120
what you mentioned already with like Tim Shaver and Kickstarter and just like all these, all

3460
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:21,700
these devel, all these like pop, developers that are basically, yeah these uh, these video

3461
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:28,220
game shops that apparently, because of the way the business works, that you know, sourcing

3462
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:35,000
out to Kickstarter might, it might open new avenues, but at the same time, it's, it breaks

3463
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:40,140
the mold of the way that whole business has, you know, publisher, the whole video game

3464
02:54:40,140 --> 02:54:44,580
industry has like switched in the past 15 or so years.

3465
02:54:44,580 --> 02:54:49,820
Like back in the days of NES and Super Nintendo, it wasn't really about like pumping out sequels

3466
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:54,320
that quickly, it was about creating like games that would be memorable and that would just

3467
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:56,020
be pushing the envelope.

3468
02:54:56,020 --> 02:55:01,880
Nowadays you have companies like Activision and to an extent EA just short, just thinking

3469
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:02,880
with a short sight.

3470
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:03,880
Well, hold on, hold on.

3471
02:55:03,880 --> 02:55:06,340
In other words, taking a franchise and just milking it out.

3472
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:09,060
You want to know one interesting thing I read today that I didn't realize?

3473
02:55:09,060 --> 02:55:11,180
Like thank you Wikipedia, I learned something new today.

3474
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:15,440
You know, even though I wouldn't say this is necessarily an example of milking it out,

3475
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:20,180
it's certainly Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link on the Nintendo Entertainment System,

3476
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,660
nine months after the original.

3477
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:23,780
I mean, talk about a quick turnaround.

3478
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:26,820
Well, I mean, those are exceptions, but you also have to take in the ones that, you know,

3479
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:32,100
the ones that have grown up in my childhood, you know, stuff like Super Mario World, the

3480
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,100
Sonic series.

3481
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:34,100
In Japan, by the way.

3482
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:36,460
Even the first early titles of the PlayStation.

3483
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:40,200
Those were like groundbreaking in the sense that they, they push, you know, they push

3484
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:43,240
the game styles into a different direction.

3485
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:47,060
Then you have like, then nowadays you have companies like Activision, for example, that

3486
02:55:47,060 --> 02:55:48,460
only live by the quarter.

3487
02:55:48,460 --> 02:55:53,620
Like, you know, they milk Call of Duty and they see that as something where they can,

3488
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:55,620
you know, make money in the short term.

3489
02:55:55,620 --> 02:55:56,620
Milking is destroyed.

3490
02:55:56,620 --> 02:56:01,100
This is where the bean counter perspective comes into the industry, which so far has

3491
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:04,380
been a fixture of it for quite a while now.

3492
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:10,260
So, you know, in other words, instead of like actual video game developers, you know, brainstorming

3493
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:14,740
ideas, you have like, you have the suits, for example, that just do, you know, they

3494
02:56:14,740 --> 02:56:18,900
have research and they have numbers in which they can create, you know, facts out of anything

3495
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:23,740
as a means of creating ideas in which they can, you know, they can milk.

3496
02:56:23,740 --> 02:56:28,500
Milking franchises, though, like, as like Guitar Hero was destroyed by the milking,

3497
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:31,060
you know, like, so it hasn't always been successful.

3498
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:35,340
The whole video, the whole rhythm music game genre is pretty much on its last throws because

3499
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,340
of that.

3500
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:41,060
It wasn't until Guitar Hero that it, you know, after it went mainstream, it basically fizzled

3501
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:42,060
out.

3502
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:48,420
Like, this is like everything before that time, like during when Konami still had a

3503
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:54,900
handle on that genre, it was still pretty underground, but it wasn't going away any

3504
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:55,900
time soon.

3505
02:56:55,900 --> 02:56:59,220
You know, they were still milking out, I mean, they were still sending out new titles and

3506
02:56:59,220 --> 02:57:00,220
so forth.

3507
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:05,500
But, as I said, once you bring something mainstream, that's one of the, you know, it's one of

3508
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:08,540
the vulnerabilities right there.

3509
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:09,540
Alright.

3510
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:12,740
I have to wrap up, I have to wrap up because we're supposed to be done at 9.15 tonight,

3511
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:16,260
but quickly, any like final thoughts on this?

3512
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:21,140
I'm pretty certain that the video game publishers have like a cabal with the reviewers to the

3513
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:26,980
point where, at some point, the feds have to get involved, thinking that you may have

3514
02:57:26,980 --> 02:57:32,460
like a case where these publishers are paying their way, not through like official channels,

3515
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:39,580
but under the table in terms of a paying for like reviews or any of that type that might

3516
02:57:39,580 --> 02:57:40,580
be...

3517
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:41,900
I want them all dragged through the courts!

3518
02:57:41,900 --> 02:57:44,020
I want mud flung on them!

3519
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:49,580
Sony got busted for astroturfing for the PSP a few years ago, for actually like posting

3520
02:57:49,580 --> 02:57:55,620
it through another, through a supposedly, you know, real actual user, or an actual blog

3521
02:57:55,620 --> 02:58:01,700
post that turned out to be fake, it was mostly, you know, marketing posts without disclosing

3522
02:58:01,700 --> 02:58:07,820
whether or not they had like a, that they were actually, you know, part Sony.

3523
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:08,820
Alright.

3524
02:58:08,820 --> 02:58:09,820
I gotta wrap up.

3525
02:58:09,820 --> 02:58:10,820
Thank you so much, Zaku.

3526
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:11,820
Have a good one.

3527
02:58:11,820 --> 02:58:12,820
Have a good one too.

3528
02:58:12,820 --> 02:58:13,820
Later.

3529
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:17,820
Sorry, I couldn't give him more time, but I'm supposed to be wrapped up by now.

3530
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:21,180
Thank you guys so much for getting, those of you that were able to call through on Skype

3531
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:22,180
tonight.

3532
02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:26,740
If you didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but do send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

3533
02:58:26,740 --> 02:58:30,940
I did not mean to ignore the Twitters tonight, let me just quickly get through some of these

3534
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:37,140
at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Ramaditya Knight sent us some NES soundtracks to check out,

3535
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:38,660
and so I'm gonna check those out.

3536
02:58:38,660 --> 02:58:44,420
Dragon Fighter, Shatterhand, Final Mission, some pretty good picks in there.

3537
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:49,820
Eric RPG sent us a link to a Kickstarter, but this is for a JRPG that looks like it

3538
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:50,820
could be interesting.

3539
02:58:50,820 --> 02:58:54,660
It's called Americana Dawn, and definitely looks like kind of the old retro.

3540
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:58,420
I don't want to say like Super Nintendo, but maybe a little more like PlayStation era,

3541
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:00,140
like RPGs.

3542
02:59:00,140 --> 02:59:04,620
So that's pretty cool, and for $7 you can put an NPC in the development room.

3543
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:07,580
So if this looks like something you want to support, there you go.

3544
02:59:07,580 --> 02:59:10,780
They've raised well over half of what they're supposed to get.

3545
02:59:10,780 --> 02:59:14,400
They're only trying to get $2,700, so that's pretty cool.

3546
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:16,980
So good luck with that.

3547
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:18,320
Tiger Claw sent us a few links.

3548
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:21,180
I'm not gonna be able to super duper have time to get into these.

3549
02:59:21,180 --> 02:59:22,980
One of these is about the Pong Developer Challenge.

3550
02:59:22,980 --> 02:59:26,380
I actually think we touched on this last week because there was some controversy about this

3551
02:59:26,380 --> 02:59:33,180
whole thing, about how the rights were being sold over to Atari, but I got an email on

3552
02:59:33,180 --> 02:59:37,100
it this week too, so I guess they're still pushing it, and I haven't really heard any

3553
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:39,120
clarifications from Atari.

3554
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:44,860
The other one has to do with the Tiger Claw sent me Mass Effect 3 and the Gay card.

3555
02:59:44,860 --> 02:59:52,020
I want to read this in more detail and probably talk about it at a later time, because obviously

3556
02:59:52,020 --> 02:59:54,060
this is an issue I would be interested in.

3557
02:59:54,060 --> 02:59:59,980
I think some people are unfairly, there's some people out there like, I don't want Shepherd

3558
02:59:59,980 --> 03:00:00,980
to be gay.

3559
03:00:00,980 --> 03:00:03,620
Why does Bioware have to make everything gay?

3560
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:04,620
Well you know what?

3561
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:06,820
Why does everything have to be one way or the other?

3562
03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:10,940
One thing I really like about Mass Effect is you have the freedom to do what you want

3563
03:00:10,940 --> 03:00:12,860
or not do something.

3564
03:00:12,860 --> 03:00:13,860
Hello?

3565
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:14,860
So.

3566
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:15,860
Anyhow.

3567
03:00:15,860 --> 03:00:20,100
I will read that more later.

3568
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:24,660
SJ100Matt sent us a link about Chinatown Fair Arcade reopening, but I think that was covered

3569
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:25,660
in Rapid Fire News.

3570
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:27,020
Did we cover that at some point?

3571
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:28,020
No.

3572
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,340
Oh, I thought we had that linked.

3573
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:33,300
All right, well, Chinatown Fair Arcade rumored reopening, there you go.

3574
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:36,340
And that's it for Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.

3575
03:00:36,340 --> 03:00:37,980
Call me when Arcade Infinity reopens.

3576
03:00:37,980 --> 03:00:38,980
Yeah, right?

3577
03:00:38,980 --> 03:00:42,020
Talking about things that disappeared in the last couple years.

3578
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:46,460
Yeah, sorry about all the closures coming to California.

3579
03:00:46,460 --> 03:00:50,540
We need to wrap up and get out of here for the night, but we need to get our final thoughts

3580
03:00:50,540 --> 03:00:51,540
first.

3581
03:00:51,540 --> 03:00:53,180
Jason, thank you so much for being here.

3582
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:57,180
And thank you, of course, for hosting our website, as you so graciously have, for the

3583
03:00:57,180 --> 03:01:00,300
past probably about eight years that you've been doing the website.

3584
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:01,300
Thank you.

3585
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:02,720
You know, I really, really appreciate that.

3586
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:07,180
And I don't think the listeners understand, without you, there wouldn't be fucking web

3587
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:08,920
space to download shows.

3588
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:13,340
There would be a place, you know, Live 365 or something like that to go to, but outside

3589
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:14,340
of it.

3590
03:01:14,340 --> 03:01:15,340
No, no, no.

3591
03:01:15,340 --> 03:01:16,340
Oh, the horror, the horror.

3592
03:01:16,340 --> 03:01:19,140
It's kind of medium to listen, but beyond that, you know, I do what I can.

3593
03:01:19,140 --> 03:01:22,980
I've enjoyed the ride, and why the hell stop it?

3594
03:01:22,980 --> 03:01:24,080
So why do we need Kickstarter?

3595
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:26,960
We have generous people like Jason who help us out with what they can, you know, help

3596
03:01:26,960 --> 03:01:27,960
get us.

3597
03:01:27,960 --> 03:01:29,300
I need Kickstarter to recoup costs.

3598
03:01:29,300 --> 03:01:30,300
Come on, guys.

3599
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:31,300
No, no, no, no.

3600
03:01:31,300 --> 03:01:32,300
All right.

3601
03:01:32,300 --> 03:01:34,660
So, Jason, final thoughts tonight?

3602
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:35,660
Kirby Superstar.

3603
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:39,100
All right, Loki, final thoughts tonight?

3604
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:44,260
I hope there's not a size limit to Excel files, because the one I'm using right now to make

3605
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:48,060
a editor for Grand Theft Auto Maps is 65 megs now.

3606
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:51,780
I think 65,535 rows is the most you can have.

3607
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:52,780
That's rows.

3608
03:01:52,780 --> 03:01:53,780
I'm talking about file size.

3609
03:01:53,780 --> 03:01:54,780
Oh, good luck with that.

3610
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:58,540
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

3611
03:01:58,540 --> 03:02:01,580
And my final thought is Cool Whip.

3612
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:02,580
Yay!

3613
03:02:02,580 --> 03:02:03,580
Cool Whip.

3614
03:02:03,580 --> 03:02:04,580
Yes, Cool Whip.

3615
03:02:04,580 --> 03:02:05,580
Cool Whip.

3616
03:02:05,580 --> 03:02:06,580
All right.

3617
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:10,060
Thank you, guys, so much for downloading and listening live to our program.

3618
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:11,300
We really appreciate it.

3619
03:02:11,300 --> 03:02:12,780
You know we do it for free.

3620
03:02:12,780 --> 03:02:17,660
We don't ask for your money, although maybe I'll get talked into the Kickstarter thing.

3621
03:02:17,660 --> 03:02:18,660
I don't know, though.

3622
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:19,660
I kind of doubt it.

3623
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:21,020
But we'll see.

3624
03:02:21,020 --> 03:02:22,100
I do say this, though.

3625
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:26,100
If you enjoy what you've heard, please tell somebody about the show.

3626
03:02:26,100 --> 03:02:27,400
Help spread the word.

3627
03:02:27,400 --> 03:02:29,300
Help grow our community.

3628
03:02:29,300 --> 03:02:33,020
This is a no embargo zone, and we give you our honest opinions.

3629
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:34,020
Actually, we did sign one.

3630
03:02:34,020 --> 03:02:36,660
We signed one once, and we got burned by it.

3631
03:02:36,660 --> 03:02:38,340
It wasn't about reviews, though.

3632
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:39,340
That's something else.

3633
03:02:39,340 --> 03:02:40,340
I'm not going to get into it now.

3634
03:02:40,340 --> 03:02:41,340
We're out of time.

3635
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:48,980
It's an easy topic if we want to talk about that while we're not recording.

3636
03:02:48,980 --> 03:02:49,980
Okay, then.

3637
03:02:49,980 --> 03:02:53,620
We're going to turn off the mics and say, see you next week.

3638
03:02:53,620 --> 03:02:54,620
We'll be back.

3639
03:02:54,620 --> 03:02:57,860
Thank you, guys, very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

3640
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:58,860
We love you guys.

3641
03:02:58,860 --> 03:02:59,860
Have a great week.

3642
03:02:59,860 --> 03:03:00,860
Bye, everyone.
