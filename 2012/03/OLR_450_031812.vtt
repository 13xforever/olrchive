00:10.148 --> 00:12.309
[SPEAKER_13]: Sky, and Loki.

00:14.130 --> 00:20.133
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, March 18, 2012, a new handheld will let you experience an old system all over again.

00:20.474 --> 00:26.697
[SPEAKER_13]: Diablo III finally gets a release date, and one fan goes to the feds over a controversial video game ending.

00:31.707 --> 00:36.932
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.172 --> 00:38.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.914 --> 00:42.096
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live with episode number 450.

00:42.557 --> 00:45.920
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice round number of our show on this March the 18th of 2012.

00:48.442 --> 00:56.469
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

00:56.509 --> 00:59.332
[SPEAKER_05]: A big thank you to them for letting us steal their bandwidth.

00:59.792 --> 01:00.813
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

01:00.913 --> 01:05.477
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but I'll be guiding you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

01:05.817 --> 01:08.740
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:09.140 --> 01:09.341
[SPEAKER_12]: Buh.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.141
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

01:10.422 --> 01:10.602
[SPEAKER_12]: Buh.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.563
[SPEAKER_12]: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

01:11.843 --> 01:12.023
Buh.

01:12.263 --> 01:12.523
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:12.764 --> 01:13.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Rob.

01:13.464 --> 01:13.624
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:14.065 --> 01:14.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

01:15.706 --> 01:17.167
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you're wearing a red shirt tonight.

01:17.487 --> 01:17.968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.088
[SPEAKER_05]: With a Star Trek logo.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.389
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're just waiting to get shot.

01:20.729 --> 01:21.710
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's engineering.

01:21.910 --> 01:22.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

01:22.530 --> 01:23.131
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're safe.

01:23.711 --> 01:24.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:24.852 --> 01:25.152
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:25.292 --> 01:26.833
[SPEAKER_05]: No falling objects on Jamie tonight.

01:26.993 --> 01:33.157
[SPEAKER_11]: No, usually just, you know, the core will overheat and they'll have to close down engineering and someone will fall into the antimatter.

01:33.457 --> 01:34.138
[SPEAKER_11]: But that won't be me.

01:34.218 --> 01:35.779
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can't mix the matter with antimatter.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.830
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you can't do that.

01:39.571 --> 01:43.353
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki, joining us every week.

01:43.493 --> 01:43.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

01:44.053 --> 01:44.613
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Loki?

01:44.934 --> 01:45.774
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

01:45.794 --> 01:46.815
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got your Vita out.

01:47.435 --> 01:47.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:47.995 --> 01:48.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing Vita.

01:48.936 --> 01:50.357
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taking his Vitamins.

01:50.377 --> 01:56.520
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to have my Vita see my phone so it can tether to it so I can download something.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, downloading over 3G would be really fucking slow.

01:59.382 --> 02:00.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I shouldn't do that.

02:00.623 --> 02:01.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would be very slow.

02:01.743 --> 02:02.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, never mind.

02:02.524 --> 02:02.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Skip that.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

02:04.025 --> 02:04.325
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:04.705 --> 02:05.786
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26.445 --> 02:29.148
[SPEAKER_05]: But, he's a name that should be familiar to all you guys.

02:29.449 --> 02:32.793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our webmaster, VXJasonXV is here tonight.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Jason.

02:33.413 --> 02:34.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi OL Army.

02:34.374 --> 02:34.995
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

02:35.596 --> 02:36.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, exhausted.

02:37.078 --> 02:40.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Buses are, doing nothing for upwards of a day is very tiring, go figure.

02:41.002 --> 02:43.025
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not much of a flyer, you're a busser.

02:43.185 --> 02:46.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore, unfortunately, so I get to deal with day or multi-day trips.

02:46.929 --> 02:50.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now that they take nudies of you at the airport, I can understand.

02:51.091 --> 02:54.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Another very good reason why I decided to stop going to airports.

02:54.152 --> 02:56.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Where your hesitation comes from.

02:57.593 --> 02:58.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people want to charge for those.

03:00.314 --> 03:00.894
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's see.

03:00.934 --> 03:01.895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been about eight years.

03:01.975 --> 03:02.455
[SPEAKER_05]: How have you been?

03:04.616 --> 03:07.277
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been older, I guess, since you put it in those wonderful terms.

03:09.797 --> 03:13.100
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived in three different states since the last time I was on the show.

03:13.140 --> 03:20.286
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved out of New Mexico to Arizona around the middle of 2000 and then a couple years later moved out to Colorado where I've been for about the last five.

03:20.946 --> 03:25.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Bought a house and things are progressing in the life kind of way.

03:25.890 --> 03:33.857
[SPEAKER_04]: When Dark Tetsuya interviewed me, I mentioned that in the last year I've actually been a part of a podcast of my own called the Ask Different Podcast.

03:33.877 --> 03:36.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Plenty of Apple nerdiness and whatnot.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still doing it or did that stop you?

04:03.553 --> 04:11.158
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been off for the past couple of weeks, primarily because I've been on this trip, and one of the other co-hosts has been sick, so it hasn't been working out so well.

04:11.178 --> 04:16.722
[SPEAKER_04]: But the last episode was just posted, should have either been the first week of the month or just before that.

04:17.082 --> 04:20.564
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been regular since the start of winter, at least.

04:20.624 --> 04:23.166
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a little winter hiatus, but it's been regular since.

04:23.386 --> 04:24.187
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been taking its fiber.

04:25.359 --> 04:26.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not on a spending money trip unfortunately

04:40.859 --> 04:41.299
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to conform.

04:41.459 --> 04:44.641
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also temporary housing, too, so we don't plan to stay here forever, but anyway.

05:05.029 --> 05:09.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, so let's talk a little bit about your history here on OLR.

05:09.291 --> 05:19.995
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last time you were on this show, just put it in perspective, we were still a show primarily about music video games and DDR, Beatmania, Parappa, all that stuff.

05:20.475 --> 05:22.316
[SPEAKER_05]: So you still playing music games?

05:23.176 --> 05:25.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, occasionally, every once in a while.

05:25.297 --> 05:42.925
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually one of those things where if somebody we know is over that has never heard of them before, we like to... I have a homemade poppin' music controller, full-size, you know, 2 ratio and whatnot, and so we throw in one of the versions and play some hard songs, and they get a kick out of this loud, clacky game with an oversized controller.

05:44.586 --> 06:06.161
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to keep up on the 2DX console releases unfortunately the arcade that did have a machine nearby went to Utah in the past couple of months so some of the arcade avenues have disappeared for me but I try not so much DDR as much as other things and it's you know it's still interesting because I still adore the music I still listen to it any chance I get

06:07.482 --> 06:12.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in the new 2DXs, you forgive the music, because I'm kind of not a big fan of where Bomani music went.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as good as it used to be, in my opinion.

06:14.366 --> 06:17.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game music, music in general follows a flow with me.

06:18.088 --> 06:24.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to have an association with it, and as of Empress, I don't have an association with it anymore, so no, it's not as interesting to me.

06:24.952 --> 06:30.515
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of gems here and there, but if you ask me to pick a favorite, I would probably go back to 6th, 8th style.

06:32.182 --> 07:00.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when it was the classics You were a moderator on DDR Freak I was, I think technically I might still be listed as one DDR Freak closed, I don't know if you heard I was still listed as one and I hadn't looked at the site in years I'm a highly active moderator as well I told them, I think it was about three years ago When I was kind of saying that I'm not going to be around the site as much anymore Because I just don't feel relevant anymore I don't feel that I'm relevant with it anymore

07:01.213 --> 07:10.779
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I heard that that was happening, and maybe I did hear that it closed down, but not going to the site anymore and seeing the page means that it doesn't really, you know, it's not any different to me.

07:10.819 --> 07:12.019
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to be there to look at it anyways.

07:12.039 --> 07:16.822
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still there, but the forums are all, it's, and the forums were the last great hurrah.

07:16.842 --> 07:22.385
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that and the machine locations, which I think kind of got dusty, so I don't think, you know, they're really doing...

07:22.705 --> 07:28.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much all the hardcore Bimani nerds, as far as I know, unless there's other sites I'm not aware of, are on Bimani style at this point.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Bimani style, Aaron in Japan is still very prominent.

07:31.030 --> 07:31.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it?

07:31.470 --> 07:34.592
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zenis I, Vanisher is the trendy name of the week.

07:34.612 --> 07:34.952
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that.

07:35.212 --> 07:35.633
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know that.

07:35.773 --> 07:36.953
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've been around a couple of years.

07:36.973 --> 07:37.614
[SPEAKER_05]: I know them.

07:37.734 --> 07:37.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

07:38.554 --> 07:39.075
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.

07:40.175 --> 07:43.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, gosh, what else do I ask a man who hasn't been on the show in eight years?

07:44.016 --> 07:45.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about eight years ago.

07:45.417 --> 07:46.597
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I went to E3 together.

07:46.857 --> 07:47.477
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dear Friends.

07:47.697 --> 07:48.097
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

07:48.278 --> 07:49.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gosh, yes.

07:49.558 --> 07:50.798
[SPEAKER_05]: That first Dear Friends concert.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I was on the show, Nobu was still part of Square.

07:55.720 --> 08:01.321
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the night, and I know I've told this story on the show many times, but that was the night where we were surprised.

08:01.361 --> 08:02.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember this case?

08:02.442 --> 08:06.723
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even... Like, you and I got tickets, or I think I bought tickets and you bought one or something.

08:06.743 --> 08:09.644
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember how we did it, but you and I ended up going to this thing together.

08:10.034 --> 08:10.955
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:29.929 --> 08:30.870
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:59.909 --> 09:00.950
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

09:18.172 --> 09:20.776
[SPEAKER_05]: So he can get to his seat that's blocked off.

09:21.496 --> 09:25.001
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was like our brush with greatness right there.

09:25.021 --> 09:31.129
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously the man, Final Fantasy was the music for so long.

09:31.209 --> 09:36.536
[SPEAKER_05]: So just kind of being able to have that as part of the experience of going to a concert all about the music was amazing.

09:36.696 --> 09:40.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe me, I've told that story my fair share of times to nerds that would appreciate it as well too.

09:41.283 --> 09:44.288
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny because that wasn't even the section that you wanted to buy tickets for in the first place.

09:44.308 --> 09:45.550
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanted to be one more section up.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.011
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't.

09:46.051 --> 09:47.213
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were completely sold out.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.698
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're like, okay, let's upgrade then and not downgrade an orchestra section.

09:50.738 --> 09:51.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it.

09:52.816 --> 09:57.979
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, yeah, because at that time, A, I was a 20-year-old with no responsibility whatsoever.

09:58.439 --> 10:01.340
[SPEAKER_05]: B, it was kind of like, you know, why not?

10:01.981 --> 10:03.641
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times are they going to do a concert like this?

10:03.661 --> 10:05.442
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know a tour or anything like that.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you and I didn't go to More Friends.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.505
[SPEAKER_05]: More Friends was not as good, sadly.

10:10.805 --> 10:12.126
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot of problems with that venue.

10:12.166 --> 10:15.128
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, we won't dwell on the negative, just the positive.

10:15.588 --> 10:17.489
[SPEAKER_05]: But was that the only E3 you ended up going to?

10:17.529 --> 10:19.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've only ever been to 04.

10:19.851 --> 10:22.213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've even been back in the state since 2004.

10:23.213 --> 10:27.716
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, to put it in perspective, the big thing they showed off that year was the Nintendo DS.

10:28.016 --> 10:29.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the DSi, not the DS.

10:29.577 --> 10:30.838
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pokemon XD.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.960
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a very big corner of that, I remember.

10:34.181 --> 10:34.781
[SPEAKER_05]: And how was E3?

10:34.821 --> 10:34.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

10:37.805 --> 10:40.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I don't even remember E3 to be completely honest.

10:40.306 --> 10:49.327
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was one of those things where I came out and it was, you know, finally putting faces to names of so many people because it was the big, the four of us in the room here now were a part of it.

10:49.407 --> 10:57.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously I flew out with DDR Freak so there was a whole bunch of people whose names I know and talked with frequently, I can finally be in person with.

10:59.470 --> 11:05.991
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 was, for a gamer, it was fun because there was plenty of things to look at and get your hands on and

11:06.851 --> 11:33.274
[SPEAKER_04]: G4 was still prominent back then they had the orange booth last that that year if you remember and all the college kids running around interning for him and whatnot I'm trying to think of one specific thing about the show that was exciting and minus the Konami booth which is kind of a given and the fact that Square had a humongous Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 11 was prominent back then WoW wasn't even the MMO of the year WoW did not exist at that point

11:34.314 --> 11:36.035
[SPEAKER_05]: They might have been showing the early stuff about it.

11:36.075 --> 11:36.515
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

11:36.535 --> 11:37.336
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too long ago.

11:37.376 --> 11:38.996
[SPEAKER_04]: You even PVP'd at E3.

11:40.337 --> 11:42.198
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was the year I won the computer.

11:42.418 --> 11:42.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

11:43.198 --> 11:46.440
[SPEAKER_05]: The old show computer was won in a Final Fantasy XI event.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I won the... Thank you, Square, for the old computer.

11:50.341 --> 11:51.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we don't use it anymore.

11:51.502 --> 11:51.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

11:51.882 --> 11:52.442
[SPEAKER_04]: What was in there?

11:52.522 --> 11:55.384
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gizmondo, I think, was still being... The Phantom.

11:56.124 --> 11:57.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Phantom.

11:57.405 --> 12:02.727
[SPEAKER_04]: They hadn't relegated themselves to a keyboard yet, but the Phantom was still very prominent there, right behind Konami, as a matter of fact.

12:03.880 --> 12:13.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I will never forget the experience of walking in there the first time and the very first thing I saw at E3 was Konami's booth and the big game they were doing that year was Silent Hill 4 The Room

12:14.707 --> 12:17.408
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the coolest setup I'd ever seen.

12:17.428 --> 12:18.468
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not awesome.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.029
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just kind of like, wow, it's like I'm at the state fair.

12:21.930 --> 12:23.150
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's all about video games.

12:23.170 --> 12:26.211
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Silent Hill 4 and Metal Gear Solid 3, wasn't it?

12:26.311 --> 12:27.992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they kind of had both going on.

12:28.032 --> 12:34.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I just remember the big setup with all the little like... The inner room with the eight or so systems and close proximity.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.874
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a room!

12:38.035 --> 12:38.876
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're in it!

12:40.643 --> 13:10.227
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're playing The Room which I still I started and speaking of this since we're talking about that game specifically I had a little Silent Hill Marathon week a while ago I replayed through the first three I replayed the first one I've done that before I played two and three started to get to four and I guess it worked that time because it kind of creeped me out I wasn't I couldn't actually make it through that game just the pace and the ambience and what not got to me for some reason and I actually didn't wind up making it through that one I'll have to try again someday

13:10.680 --> 13:11.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

13:26.774 --> 13:28.877
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, they released a new Silent Hill game!

13:29.437 --> 13:30.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally fucking forgot about this!

13:31.099 --> 13:35.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Silent Hill Downpour came out, and Shane is sending me private messages here.

13:35.744 --> 13:40.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, and this is like a tiny spoiler, but not really, it's not a story spoiler, don't worry.

13:40.508 --> 13:48.577
[SPEAKER_05]: He says that you totally get to visit Henry's room from Silent Hill 4 as an Easter egg, and it's still locked from the inside, so I guess they're...

13:48.857 --> 13:49.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

14:06.371 --> 14:08.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that would have sucked.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.992
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm confused with the fact that... So, was his room supposed to be in Silent Hill?

14:12.333 --> 14:15.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the actual room part?

14:15.533 --> 14:17.614
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because... I don't get it.

14:17.814 --> 14:21.015
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember there was the portals to Silent Hill, but was his room supposed to be in Silent Hill?

14:21.035 --> 14:24.136
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how many years it's been since I've played Silent Hill in the room?

14:25.036 --> 14:26.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be eight, by chance?

14:26.376 --> 14:28.197
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have thought that this would have stuck with you?

14:28.337 --> 14:29.737
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... No.

14:30.537 --> 14:30.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

14:31.778 --> 14:32.578
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to figure it out.

14:32.598 --> 14:33.338
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all a dream.

14:33.478 --> 14:33.899
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all a dream.

14:33.939 --> 14:34.179
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the video games you've been playing this week.

14:38.541 --> 14:44.463
[SPEAKER_05]: We always talk a little bit about how is your gaming week and what video games you've been playing, whether it be new or whether it be eight years old.

14:45.704 --> 14:47.504
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, hi, how are you?

14:47.544 --> 14:48.225
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

14:50.666 --> 14:51.166
[SPEAKER_11]: I have another 85.

14:51.206 --> 14:55.588
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's a Hobag dealer.

14:58.302 --> 14:59.102
[SPEAKER_11]: She's a ho-bag.

14:59.662 --> 15:01.263
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm dressing her as slutty as possible.

15:01.383 --> 15:02.143
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're a blood elf.

15:02.543 --> 15:03.463
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and well.

15:06.984 --> 15:11.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I honestly thought we were talking about Saints Row or something like that at first.

15:12.205 --> 15:13.725
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of fell off that train of thought.

15:13.765 --> 15:16.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have known better, but I fell off somewhere.

15:16.246 --> 15:21.587
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a big reveal coming tonight about Mists of Pandaria, which is the next expansion.

15:21.647 --> 15:22.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Panda people, I don't know if you've heard.

15:22.987 --> 15:23.667
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:41.295 --> 15:43.397
[SPEAKER_05]: But, there have been some early leaks.

15:45.038 --> 15:49.382
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have an NDA for a week, inevitably somebody's gonna, it's too hot for their hands, they gotta let it out.

15:49.723 --> 15:51.624
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've seen what the female pandas look like now.

15:51.724 --> 15:56.068
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like red pandas, although some are saying that could just be one coloring.

15:56.308 --> 15:57.449
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just a coloring.

15:57.629 --> 16:03.695
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the videos that show off some of the dungeons, I gotta say, that temple of the Jade Serpent looks amazing.

16:04.275 --> 16:06.237
[SPEAKER_05]: So, can't wait to get in some of those new instances.

16:06.337 --> 16:06.898
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked at it.

16:07.078 --> 16:07.798
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was pretty cool.

16:08.179 --> 16:08.319
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

16:12.024 --> 16:14.225
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to play some more Star Mine, but I'm actually stuck on a puzzle.

16:14.785 --> 16:17.167
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's really about it.

16:18.127 --> 16:21.849
[SPEAKER_11]: And I watched Scott Pilgrim again for the 50 millionth time on St.

16:21.869 --> 16:22.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.149
[SPEAKER_05]: What possessed that?

16:23.450 --> 16:24.010
[SPEAKER_11]: We were bored.

16:25.691 --> 16:28.012
[SPEAKER_09]: I also learned a new game.

16:28.352 --> 16:30.393
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called How Not to Blow Up the House with a Pressure Cooker.

16:31.233 --> 16:31.674
[SPEAKER_09]: Good idea.

16:31.694 --> 16:32.914
[SPEAKER_09]: My first time using a pressure cooker.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Made corned beef.

16:34.955 --> 16:35.676
[SPEAKER_09]: It was epic!

16:35.956 --> 16:36.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Under pressure.

16:37.977 --> 16:38.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.018
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a few things.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's kind of funny.

16:43.119 --> 16:56.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of going to just dedicating a month to playing PlayStation games because I realize I have all these games on my PS3 that I'm just not playing.

16:56.344 --> 16:57.405
[SPEAKER_02]: And not enough trophies.

16:58.305 --> 16:58.945
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

17:00.466 --> 17:02.827
[SPEAKER_02]: The trophy level is quite small at this point.

17:03.527 --> 17:07.608
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's like LittleBigPlanet 2, I have to play through that still.

17:07.768 --> 17:13.730
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Infamous that I got from the whole fallout from the network being down that I had to play through.

17:15.891 --> 17:17.052
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure there's some other games.

17:17.472 --> 17:23.914
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go back and play through Resistance 1, 2, and 3 actually because I played through 1 all the way and I loved Resistance.

17:23.974 --> 17:28.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Resistance was, to me, when you compare Resistance and Halo 3, Resistance by far, way better game.

17:30.377 --> 17:35.339
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of want to go through 2 and 3 and play through those before I get the Vita 1.

17:36.099 --> 18:01.015
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, so stuff I actually did play, I played Journey, I bought that game, it's an amazing game, very short, but who cares, you can play through it a bunch of times, and it's just, it's a beautiful game, it's one of those games that, like, I had people over, I'm like, hey, you gotta see this game, because it's really beautiful, so And the big spoiler last week, I was trying to hide, but it was brought to my attention from Bobby, that it's revealed in the trailer, so oops, my bad, but it's a multiplayer game

18:01.736 --> 18:22.936
[SPEAKER_05]: and you don't I knew nothing about Journey going into it but when I say it's a multiplayer game you can't talk it doesn't work like other online games you have one emote and that's the little chirp that you do you can't type, you can't talk you don't even know who it is that you're playing with and you might think, god that sounds basic as hell you don't know until the end

18:23.576 --> 18:29.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, yeah, I will show you their little, I keep wanting to say gamer tags, but PSN IDs or whatever they're called at the very, very, very end of the game.

18:30.261 --> 18:33.384
[SPEAKER_05]: But until that point, you have no idea who it is and you can't really communicate.

18:33.444 --> 18:35.285
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might think, God, that seems so basic.

18:35.325 --> 18:38.627
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it's brilliant in its simplicity, isn't it?

18:39.148 --> 18:42.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even, like, why do we hate to play games online these days?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.903
[SPEAKER_06]: Fag, fag, fag, stop being such a fag.

18:46.943 --> 18:48.625
[SPEAKER_06]: You play with a fag, you noob fag.

18:49.025 --> 18:50.667
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I can't play games online.

18:50.727 --> 18:52.509
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to mute everybody.

18:52.909 --> 19:03.401
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact that Journey kind of scales it back and you have this experience or whatever with somebody else where you communicate through this new method of communication, the little chirping, is neat.

19:03.881 --> 19:07.084
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to dominate your conversation, but I had to get that out since last week.

19:20.713 --> 19:21.413
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some stuff on the Vita

19:40.278 --> 20:04.126
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly just I went back and played a little bit more Motorstorm RC still kind of frustrated the controls and that because like I'll be doing like a perfect lap and then like I'll run into the AI character or run into a wall because I can't see it well enough because of the camera of sucking so that's a little annoying but I did manage to top out all my friends on leaderboards there and

20:04.806 --> 20:32.224
[SPEAKER_02]: at least for all the tracks I've played I saw and played through the whole game and I do like how it's like oh this track's not unlocked yet and you can hit it and it says buy and you can buy the unlock to unlock all I'm like why would I waste my time doing that you know seriously um there I one thing I'm noticing about the Vita is that it is moving closer and closer to Facebook games I in some of the games I played I'd say I don't like that one bit like it's like really like press this button to buy it right now you don't have to get your recharge

20:32.404 --> 20:32.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now!

21:00.124 --> 21:17.277
[SPEAKER_02]: and now this is kind of funny I played the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita except the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita is their E3 2011 demo that they had which isn't really a demo at all it's just a demo of a

21:18.437 --> 21:23.399
[SPEAKER_02]: The engine, the concept, I'm not really sure what the fuck it's supposed to be.

21:23.499 --> 21:28.401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, it's just shots of the car, like it's panning around the car.

21:28.782 --> 21:35.104
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you touch the screen and drag your finger across, it sort of tweaks the music a little bit.

21:35.124 --> 21:39.766
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hold the L or R buttons, it'll kind of remix the music a bit.

21:40.226 --> 21:40.806
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

21:40.947 --> 21:43.247
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, oh, okay, this is kind of neat.

21:43.267 --> 21:44.408
[SPEAKER_02]: While they're talking about the game...

21:44.708 --> 21:47.769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, you know, the end of demo.

21:47.789 --> 21:49.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, where's the racing?

21:50.149 --> 21:51.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the fuck is the racing?

21:51.770 --> 21:53.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer 10, showroom.

21:54.090 --> 21:58.611
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, there is no fucking... Press X to unlock the racing for only 100% of the credits.

21:58.631 --> 22:00.592
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, they're like, buy the full game.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not even sure what the full game is.

22:03.673 --> 22:04.613
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing here.

22:04.913 --> 22:07.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny because there's nothing in the real game either.

22:07.373 --> 22:07.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, though.

22:07.934 --> 22:09.254
[SPEAKER_05]: To be devil's advocate, Loki...

22:10.114 --> 22:11.635
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ridge Racer 7 from the Playstation 3

22:34.802 --> 22:38.484
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them, all three of them that are included with the game.

22:38.864 --> 22:44.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and you get another three if you purchase the game right away, you know, because you need to have Ridge Racer.

22:45.008 --> 22:50.611
[SPEAKER_02]: You get another three tracks or you can pay another like $7 to unlock some more tracks and cars.

22:52.296 --> 23:03.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've heard the argument that, well, you know, really a lot of the cars that are in these games are just kind of reskins of other cars and stuff like that with different stats and, you know, whatever.

23:03.845 --> 23:09.569
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really, you know, these three cars you can upgrade and keep unlocking stuff or whatever.

23:11.290 --> 23:16.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, you know, we kind of talked about this last week with OnDiscDLC and stuff like that.

23:16.874 --> 23:18.295
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the illusion of it, okay?

23:18.315 --> 23:18.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

23:19.276 --> 23:19.917
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:38.835 --> 23:43.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a stupid way to say you have double the amount of tracks that you do.

23:43.581 --> 23:50.230
[SPEAKER_02]: But since you can't really have one and a half tracks in the game, they're going to have to count three full tracks.

23:50.350 --> 23:53.654
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard of a game that sounds so perfect for the rental market?

23:54.884 --> 23:56.684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not perfect for the rental market.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect for a demo.

23:59.485 --> 24:00.105
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.386
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a demo right there.

24:02.846 --> 24:10.528
[SPEAKER_02]: If they wanted to put that game out for free and then have the extra cars, I don't think anyone would be really complaining about it.

24:10.808 --> 24:14.189
[SPEAKER_02]: That it has only three cars, but it's free and you get to play Ridge Racer.

24:14.549 --> 24:18.190
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to buy additional cars, no one would balk at that.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably buy it.

24:19.730 --> 24:22.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wouldn't buy it because it would be free, but...

24:22.811 --> 24:29.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pay the extra money to maybe download some extra tracks and stuff like that if it was free.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.620
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not.

24:30.740 --> 24:33.243
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs $25, which they consider a discount.

24:33.563 --> 24:36.086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a fucking discount because there's plenty of games that are out there for $29.99.

24:37.908 --> 24:54.028
[SPEAKER_02]: and considering that a full game is only $10 more or even you know kind of a not so full game but it's Touch My Katamari was the same price and I consider that a better experience although not by much but at least there's actual content in there um

24:55.149 --> 24:56.069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't understand.

24:56.229 --> 24:57.830
[SPEAKER_02]: And why was the game delayed?

24:58.490 --> 24:59.751
[SPEAKER_02]: It still sucks.

24:59.871 --> 25:04.012
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has frame rate problems.

25:04.072 --> 25:06.753
[SPEAKER_02]: They were supposedly doing graphic updates and stuff like that.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.234
[SPEAKER_02]: It was supposed to run better, and it still sucks.

25:09.334 --> 25:10.935
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what were you doing?

25:10.955 --> 25:14.776
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to... I don't even know.

25:14.836 --> 25:19.278
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all the geometry still for the tracks because they were in Ridge Racer 7.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.019
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't do anything.

25:22.116 --> 25:24.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, just upgrade the graphics from the PSP version.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.439
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been way better.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anything else you want to bitch about for your gaming week?

25:30.242 --> 25:31.283
[SPEAKER_02]: I play Call of Duty 4.

25:32.384 --> 25:34.626
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing with some GPD mods now, which is fun.

25:34.686 --> 25:41.931
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have what we call Ninja Mode, or the Ninja games that I host because I have the mod in my system.

25:42.712 --> 25:45.874
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I host it, it allows us to run really fast and jump really high.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of fun with a few people.

25:48.356 --> 25:50.518
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we still play legit games and I still own all those.

25:51.438 --> 25:56.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Catching up on some of our comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com The chat is talking about Journey a little bit.

25:57.022 --> 26:00.825
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, the only thing that would make Journey better would be music from Journey.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I don't think it would.

26:03.367 --> 26:09.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on, because Randy piggybacks on that and says, if you play Journey while listening to Don't Stop Believin' on loop, it totally syncs up.

26:09.952 --> 26:15.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as much as I love Journey, and all Journey jokes aside, it should be noted that the soundtrack for the game is pretty frickin' sweet.

26:16.257 --> 26:18.999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great ambience soundtrack.

26:19.679 --> 26:25.663
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to rock out while you play an ambient artsy game, okay, sure, pick Journey.

26:27.944 --> 26:29.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

26:29.985 --> 26:30.286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

26:30.466 --> 26:32.227
[SPEAKER_05]: Then let me go to Jason since you're here tonight.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.468
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, what kind of games have you been playing?

26:36.349 --> 26:42.033
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones where you serve customers and get money for it, by which I mean not really.

26:42.355 --> 26:52.421
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've kind of been in a slump for the past month, gearing up for this trip and just kind of working a lot.

26:52.581 --> 26:58.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now, I know you brought your 3DS with you because our 3DSs mated when we weren't looking and did the whole street pass thing.

26:58.844 --> 26:59.825
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of DS game?

27:00.345 --> 27:02.046
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you played any on the bus on the way here.

27:02.706 --> 27:07.789
[SPEAKER_04]: I surprisingly didn't do anything on the bus the way here except for sleep and occasional music.

27:08.589 --> 27:14.391
[SPEAKER_04]: For what it's worth, when I picked up my 3DS, I have the same set of games then as I do now.

27:14.851 --> 27:19.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Those would be Bust a Move Universe, I think is the 3DS version.

27:20.913 --> 27:31.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Bust a Move, Star Fox 3D, Ocarina of Time 3D, and two more that I probably have never touched because I don't... Oh, Mario Land 3D, can't forget that one.

27:32.216 --> 27:32.376
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

27:33.737 --> 27:35.859
[SPEAKER_04]: at this point, probably a fifth game that I've... Mario Kart?

27:36.139 --> 27:37.640
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't picked up Kart.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.862
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to, but that was right after I lost my job, so I didn't.

27:44.312 --> 27:45.212
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright, don't worry about it.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you excited about the Kid Icarus game?

27:49.274 --> 27:50.675
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say economy wasn't a factor.

27:50.975 --> 27:53.477
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never played the original Kid Icarus meaningfully.

27:53.717 --> 27:54.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here's the thing though.

27:55.017 --> 27:57.459
[SPEAKER_05]: When did the original Kid Icarus come out?

27:57.479 --> 27:57.459
1984?

27:57.559 --> 28:00.360
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been about 20-something years since that game came out?

28:00.760 --> 28:01.621
[SPEAKER_05]: A damn near 30?

28:02.101 --> 28:08.224
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they're having to market this new Kid Icarus game at people who have never played Kid Icarus.

28:08.264 --> 28:08.804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

28:09.344 --> 28:10.685
[SPEAKER_04]: So, does it look interesting?

28:11.105 --> 28:11.225
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

28:12.606 --> 28:14.967
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not been looking at the news yet.

28:40.278 --> 28:48.569
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there are three things that I can say I've been playing On the road to 200.6%ing Castlevania Symphony of the Night Nice

28:51.198 --> 29:05.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I get completely frustrated with grinding out those stupid little blocks that are underwater, above water in the Upside Down Castle, whenever I get frustrated with that, I go to Serious Sam 2 and then get frustrated with that in about 10 minutes, if that.

29:06.289 --> 29:11.173
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all of my saves exist in the rooms where you have to survive for as long as possible.

29:11.753 --> 29:12.774
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:31.750 --> 29:33.012
[SPEAKER_05]: watching, watching.

29:33.332 --> 29:36.296
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 minutes later, shit, I need to go to the grocery store.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.820
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how Dan puts himself to sleep is watching long playthroughs.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.883
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a ton of long playthrough videos out there.

29:42.984 --> 29:43.684
[SPEAKER_05]: My God.

29:43.704 --> 29:45.867
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's exactly why he has a new one for every night.

29:45.907 --> 29:47.449
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and there's like a huge community out there.

29:47.469 --> 29:49.672
[SPEAKER_09]: He and I will just watch those instead of movies.

29:51.133 --> 29:51.653
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm serious.

29:51.914 --> 29:52.994
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's awesome.

29:53.594 --> 29:56.216
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the long playthroughs for Ridge Racer Vita.

29:56.296 --> 29:59.717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure after that 30 seconds I'll be ready for some more.

29:59.777 --> 30:00.738
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw corrects me.

30:00.758 --> 30:00.938
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 1986.

30:01.879 --> 30:02.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

30:02.879 --> 30:03.459
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.040
[SPEAKER_05]: So 26 years then.

30:05.500 --> 30:05.861
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been.

30:05.881 --> 30:05.861
86.

30:06.841 --> 30:07.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

30:08.562 --> 30:13.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if that's all you want to share about your gaming week, then I will talk about mine.

30:13.124 --> 30:17.106
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I gotta admit, mine isn't... I don't have a variety of games like I usually do.

30:17.486 --> 30:18.787
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing two games this week.

30:19.067 --> 30:19.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Two.

30:19.748 --> 30:20.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect and Journey?

30:21.359 --> 30:22.199
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pretty close.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.000
[SPEAKER_05]: I even put Journey aside.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.220
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant to play it more, but I can't stop playing Journey.

30:26.281 --> 30:30.762
[SPEAKER_05]: I play WoW, of course, because I have a rating group, so I have to kind of play that at a set time every week.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.583
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, I'm playing Mass Effect.

30:34.303 --> 30:35.603
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Mass Effect 3, mind you.

30:35.643 --> 30:36.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 1.

30:36.643 --> 30:37.884
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you heard last week's show.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm five years late to the party, and I said I'm going to start from the very beginning.

30:41.845 --> 30:41.985
[SPEAKER_05]: And I...

30:43.786 --> 30:50.270
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to say, because I can do this on a podcast and we don't make any money off this show or whatever.

30:50.330 --> 30:53.172
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't answer to anybody but the listeners and ourselves, right?

30:54.112 --> 30:56.474
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally misjudged this game five years ago.

30:57.254 --> 30:58.815
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something I'm sure we have all done.

30:59.375 --> 31:04.118
[SPEAKER_05]: You see a little bit – you hear a snippet of a song and, oh, that album sucks.

31:04.678 --> 31:07.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you go to a restaurant one time and the food's bad.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this place sucks.

31:08.561 --> 31:09.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

31:09.281 --> 31:10.602
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:31.380 --> 31:38.049
[SPEAKER_05]: which is, like, the two parts of the game that I hear are fixed in two, especially the car parts and all that.

31:38.550 --> 31:43.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, now that I play Mass Effect 1 and I'm not afraid to play it on casual mode, it doesn't bother me at all.

31:43.797 --> 31:48.804
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I actually really enjoy the combat and, like, flinging things around like they're, you know...

31:49.184 --> 31:50.585
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were going to say Flinging Poo.

32:17.927 --> 32:19.708
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's so much I want to explore.

32:19.728 --> 32:25.991
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, you know who I think would love Mass Effect that hasn't been playing it?

32:27.311 --> 32:27.671
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.

32:28.932 --> 32:30.553
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think you need to give this game a chance.

32:30.733 --> 32:30.893
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

32:30.933 --> 32:32.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll borrow it when you're done.

32:33.214 --> 32:33.774
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

32:33.814 --> 32:36.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because the whole like, you know, I know you're not big on controllers.

32:36.375 --> 32:41.597
[SPEAKER_05]: I would urge you to check out the PC one because I just think the depth of the story, because you like science fiction and all that stuff.

32:41.617 --> 32:41.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it cheap?

32:41.918 --> 32:42.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

32:43.158 --> 32:47.821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $19.99, but I got it for $12 used at Dimple.

32:48.201 --> 32:49.581
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking PC, though.

32:50.342 --> 32:51.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait for Steam sales, I'm sure.

32:52.603 --> 32:55.484
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody still has any Steam coupons or anything.

32:57.365 --> 32:58.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you never know.

32:58.086 --> 33:03.829
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I just gotta say, I think you would be really into this, because I know you like a good story.

33:04.749 --> 33:09.812
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the whole fact that I think you would try to romance certain characters and see what happens.

33:09.832 --> 33:10.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Like who?

33:10.752 --> 33:11.133
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

33:11.153 --> 33:16.258
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just see you like... I like my minor Meryl obsession for Dragon Age 2.

33:16.358 --> 33:18.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I could see you... Because it was Eve Miles.

33:18.620 --> 33:18.920
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

33:19.061 --> 33:24.386
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see you talking to the guy and kind of romancing the guy, but then you'd be like, I like this cool Darth Vader chick.

33:24.406 --> 33:25.547
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to romance her.

33:26.628 --> 33:28.410
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care as long as I don't hurt myself playing.

33:41.542 --> 33:56.470
[SPEAKER_05]: so but anyway yeah so I gotta say that I'm really enjoying it I've already bought Mass Effect 2 because I'm waiting for when I finish Mass Effect 1 because I'm apparently not super super super far from the end I probably have about five more hours to go my character's level 33 or 34 so

33:59.744 --> 34:04.306
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you be in that close of proximity to someone and not have an ending spoiled?

34:17.892 --> 34:18.432
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:42.700 --> 34:44.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so yeah, that was my gaming week.

34:44.681 --> 34:45.341
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of Mass Effect.

34:47.481 --> 34:49.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about housekeeping.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Visit our websites.

34:52.043 --> 34:59.425
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangelaunchradio.com, of course, is our main website, which is graciously hosted by Jason, and I should also say designed by Dekeman.

34:59.465 --> 35:00.445
[SPEAKER_05]: He deserves a shout-out, too.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.406
[SPEAKER_05]: He does some great work.

35:02.166 --> 35:06.627
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the upper right-hand corner is the extended play box.

35:06.647 --> 35:07.687
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost said now playing.

35:07.988 --> 35:09.148
[SPEAKER_05]: Extended play box.

35:09.488 --> 35:10.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Flashback to PHP Nuke.

35:10.848 --> 35:11.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

35:11.589 --> 35:11.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

35:11.849 --> 35:13.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, also what we were doing eight years ago.

35:14.890 --> 35:16.470
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can find the Facebook there.

35:16.510 --> 35:17.791
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find Google Plus there.

35:17.811 --> 35:23.452
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find just the Steam community if you are playing Mass Effect on PC and want to talk to others through Steam, you can do that.

35:23.592 --> 35:24.733
[SPEAKER_05]: And so good times.

35:24.913 --> 35:26.733
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

35:27.053 --> 35:28.294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into gaming news.

35:28.314 --> 35:31.755
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been quite a bit of gaming news this week, so Loki's going to start us off tonight.

35:32.915 --> 35:35.477
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good news if you're an achievement whore.

35:35.897 --> 35:39.839
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to raise the gamer score allotments for Xbox Live Arcade titles.

35:39.959 --> 35:47.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, right now it's currently 200, but that's going to double to 400 with a maximum of 30 achievements possible instead of 20.

35:48.323 --> 36:16.450
[SPEAKER_02]: also downloadable content they're going to allow I guess more gamer score to be added with 100 or I guess 100 with up to 8 achievements allowed per quarter with maximum of 4 packs allowed over time so they're going to allow you to add a lot more gamer score to all that stuff and this will take a place I guess it's going to start with titles coming out between April 1st and May 31st

36:18.615 --> 36:21.718
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised this is such a problem.

36:21.738 --> 36:23.800
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many restrictions for Microsoft.

36:24.641 --> 36:30.426
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not retail partners, but they're still going through the entire Microsoft process.

36:30.726 --> 36:33.789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like indie games can throw in achievements or anything like that.

36:33.809 --> 36:36.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait until indie games are allowed to throw in achievements.

36:37.392 --> 36:39.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that will always be off limits.

36:39.074 --> 36:39.294
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

36:39.818 --> 36:40.418
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

37:03.334 --> 37:03.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

37:04.055 --> 37:14.642
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of it seems to kind of slip by, but otherwise, you know, Microsoft's been very much about, like, they don't, you know, they've bombed people's scores to zero when they suspect that they're, like, cheating and all this stuff.

37:14.662 --> 37:15.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're very protective of it.

37:15.743 --> 37:18.044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real easy to cheat if you want to, but it's...

37:19.165 --> 37:20.125
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're going to notice.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.966
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just don't do that.

37:23.507 --> 37:26.688
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, look, I achieved all of my achievements in about five minutes.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.808
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not by Avatar, then whoo!

37:29.209 --> 37:41.053
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you can just mod your actual user account on your system, and then you can add games that you've never played and just give yourself 1,000 achievement points.

37:41.373 --> 37:42.633
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, they're going to notice it.

37:42.753 --> 37:44.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your gamer score jumped by 100,000.

37:44.614 --> 37:45.034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little odd.

37:47.635 --> 38:00.258
[SPEAKER_05]: I will never forget... Speaking of getting banned from Xbox Live because of achievements and all this stuff, I will never forget the time I was playing Dance Dance Revolution Universe on Xbox 360 for the first time, and I got the message from Strip Club DJ.

38:00.418 --> 38:02.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody remember that name on Xbox 360?

38:02.478 --> 38:08.220
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the guy that had the most points ever, and he sent me a message like, are the achievements in that game hard to get?

38:08.320 --> 38:08.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently...

38:09.520 --> 38:10.841
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38:27.279 --> 38:30.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what do you think, though, about the arcade games going up to 400 points?

38:30.741 --> 38:34.704
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, it's achievements, whatever.

38:34.784 --> 38:42.850
[SPEAKER_05]: But in other ways, since the downloadable games are getting more expensive, they are becoming more richer experiences.

38:43.030 --> 38:45.612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not ports of Time Pilot anymore.

38:45.652 --> 38:47.093
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting games like Limbo.

38:47.373 --> 38:49.795
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting HD remixes of Time Pilot.

38:50.735 --> 38:52.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that Time Pilot's a bad game.

38:52.497 --> 38:57.541
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, now we're getting other stuff and a lot of the greatest games to come out are download.

38:57.781 --> 39:02.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Braid, Portal was a standalone game for download and stuff.

39:02.685 --> 39:07.168
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much good stuff that it kind of deserves to be bumped up a little bit, I think.

39:09.550 --> 39:10.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so there you go.

39:11.351 --> 39:12.953
[SPEAKER_05]: The achievement points are going to be going up.

39:15.111 --> 39:21.954
[SPEAKER_05]: What might be going up or down, I don't know, is Capcom's stock, depending on Street Fighter X Tekken and how this has been received on the 360.

39:22.774 --> 39:23.795
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so well.

39:24.395 --> 39:34.719
[SPEAKER_05]: As we mentioned last week on the show, four-player co-op mode is not on the 360 version, even though it's there in the instruction manual, and it's there in the PlayStation 3 version.

39:35.239 --> 39:41.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, that's when you and a friend go online, or you and a friend are local, you go online and take on another co-op.

39:43.163 --> 40:09.745
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was addressed by Tomoaki Ayano the assistant producer of the game in a Capcom Unity blog statement throughout the development process there are times when new features are added and we added a lot of them and there are also times where we have to make tough decisions regarding things to cut this was one of those times this mode is supported in the Playstation 3 version however since we tackled that earlier and found the architecture of their system to be more conducive to implementing it

40:10.686 --> 40:12.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony paid us a lot of money.

40:28.886 --> 40:29.887
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's that.

40:29.947 --> 40:30.887
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you never know.

40:30.987 --> 40:31.728
[SPEAKER_05]: Strange things happen.

40:31.748 --> 40:41.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that may be true, but then you should create a second manual for the Xbox 360 version still is saying, you know, hey, this mode's available.

40:41.353 --> 40:41.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but it's not.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.995
[SPEAKER_05]: It really seems like to me it was a deadline thing.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.257
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still very poor taste.

40:48.277 --> 40:49.298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's false advertising.

40:49.818 --> 40:54.241
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, you know, that you had to work on all that DLC that was going to be on disc.

40:54.361 --> 40:56.362
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that might have taken some extra time.

40:57.136 --> 40:58.717
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have traded kick for comp mode.

41:24.119 --> 41:24.920
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous.

41:25.241 --> 41:26.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we didn't know how to do it.

41:26.982 --> 41:30.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure if you asked Microsoft, hey, how do you do this?

41:30.747 --> 41:33.650
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have probably told you how to do it.

41:33.890 --> 41:41.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Microsoft allowing and not allowing things, frankly, I thought that was pretty much a required feature for any co-op game to be certified and released for the 360.

41:43.159 --> 41:44.680
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think it was.

41:45.661 --> 41:47.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously not, because it happened.

41:47.741 --> 41:57.646
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen plenty of games where you don't have to have... Because sometimes doing split screen... There's not enough screen space after you split it in half.

41:59.466 --> 42:07.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I want to know is, since this is not on the show roll... So what's everybody think about their whole DLC plan?

42:09.028 --> 42:10.429
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought I was supposed to do that here, too.

42:10.469 --> 42:10.869
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

42:10.889 --> 42:15.652
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yeah, the DLC plan, what, $20 for all 12 characters this fall, right?

42:15.852 --> 42:24.736
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, $20 for all 12 characters this fall, and they're going to have costume packs as well, which I think was another $13.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.838
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it's 13 different packs for a dollar or something like that.

42:28.018 --> 42:35.704
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the release about it really felt like it was trying to butter up the community, like they knew that there was this big backlash about it.

42:35.744 --> 42:40.968
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really read to me like, hey, guys, it's not going to be as bad as y'all were thinking.

42:41.428 --> 42:44.690
[SPEAKER_05]: LOL at you, thinking it was going to be five bucks each character.

42:44.730 --> 42:45.751
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not doing that, guys.

42:45.811 --> 42:48.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, we're not complete assholes this time.

42:48.173 --> 42:50.355
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just pretty big assholes.

42:51.616 --> 42:57.060
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a percentage of us that we're not completely assholes about this stuff.

42:57.860 --> 43:04.561
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's great and all that, you know, they're saying that's going to be $20 for, you know, all the characters.

43:05.282 --> 43:06.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Except there's a problem.

43:06.922 --> 43:22.425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all of the characters because you do remember that even though they are PlayStation exclusive, you know, Pac-Man and Bad Box Art or Troll Mega Man is still on the disc for Xbox 360.

43:22.665 --> 43:25.846
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means there's still going to be one more piece of download content that they're

43:27.546 --> 43:27.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy

43:47.225 --> 43:49.947
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, anyways, here's what it's going to end up being.

43:50.688 --> 43:53.590
[SPEAKER_02]: April 3rd, they're going to have alternate costumes go on sale.

43:53.630 --> 43:58.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to set you back a dollar each, or you can buy all of them for $13.

43:58.774 --> 44:02.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're going to release some free colors.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

44:03.278 --> 44:03.638
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

44:03.678 --> 44:04.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Free colors.

44:04.138 --> 44:08.121
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some free things they were trying to – look at all this shit you're going to get for free.

44:08.542 --> 44:13.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Costumes and gem slots, and then this is the pay stuff, you know, characters.

44:14.306 --> 44:15.006
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff, yeah.

44:15.046 --> 44:18.708
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess in April they're also going to do a free tournament support update.

44:19.569 --> 44:23.651
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be adding some three new assist gem packs.

44:24.471 --> 44:27.533
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess they're going to be selling those or something.

44:27.573 --> 44:28.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

44:29.634 --> 44:32.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Which a total of 60 gems to a selection pool, I guess.

44:33.476 --> 44:37.738
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, those 12 characters already on disc will not be unlocked until the fall.

44:38.439 --> 44:41.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, hackers have already been playing with them online.

44:42.361 --> 44:42.561
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

44:43.359 --> 44:48.805
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, can I go online on 316 and suddenly I'm playing against somebody who is Blanka or one of the locked characters?

44:48.845 --> 45:00.657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically what they do is they swap all the assets and art and stuff like that and character data for the DLC characters and they move it to one of the regular characters in the game.

45:00.677 --> 45:03.320
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of flip-flop on the stuff.

45:03.400 --> 45:03.640
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

45:04.241 --> 45:06.423
[SPEAKER_02]: $20 I fucking called it making this an $80 game

45:32.941 --> 45:34.402
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:56.420 --> 45:57.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, too.

45:57.601 --> 46:03.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how they said they're not going to do a special arcade edition, gold edition, or whatever?

46:03.764 --> 46:07.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just assume that they've sold quite a few copies.

46:07.526 --> 46:14.090
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to say that they're going to sell a million copies probably on each system, let's just say.

46:14.110 --> 46:16.631
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a pretty safe bet considering now.

46:17.612 --> 46:19.133
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Greatest Hits edition will come out.

46:19.173 --> 46:24.676
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't really say anything, but it'll include the DLC characters on disc or something like that, and it'll drop the price.

46:25.694 --> 46:53.367
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've done that with like what Call of Duty just had a re-release for Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2 with the DLC or at least the first DLC pack included with it now I don't think it's on disc but it's still code with it and I mean Midnight Club LA has done that I mean there's plenty of other games that have done that I think Mass Effect had DLC on the disc for or included at least a voucher or something like that when it was re-released so I could see them doing this I'm probably just gonna get the Vita version to be honest

46:54.688 --> 46:55.289
[SPEAKER_05]: If I get it.

46:55.509 --> 46:55.870
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

46:55.970 --> 46:58.152
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, do I need another fighting game that badly?

46:58.873 --> 46:59.834
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, maybe not.

46:59.934 --> 47:04.500
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think they got it out in this state in order to allow people to prep for EVO?

47:06.282 --> 47:12.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Give enough people to get it set so that it can be played as a part of EVO and people to get their strategies down and actually learn the game to participate in it.

47:13.001 --> 47:13.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil 3DS Game

47:36.992 --> 47:37.833
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

47:52.621 --> 47:53.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year.

47:53.861 --> 47:55.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the Gold Edition last year?

47:55.642 --> 47:58.142
[SPEAKER_05]: What system?

47:59.282 --> 48:01.583
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.

48:01.643 --> 48:02.883
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that was last year.

48:02.923 --> 48:05.244
[SPEAKER_02]: That may have been last March, but that was still a re-release.

48:07.524 --> 48:08.604
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they had Street Fighter.

48:09.004 --> 48:12.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Marvel was at Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

48:12.445 --> 48:13.445
[SPEAKER_02]: They had that.

48:14.045 --> 48:16.046
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I don't think that did that.

48:16.446 --> 48:19.627
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it did all right, but it wasn't like big, big, big numbers.

48:20.387 --> 48:20.727
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

48:21.187 --> 48:21.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we'll see.

48:24.601 --> 48:26.901
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting when the sales numbers come out at the end of the month.

48:27.021 --> 48:28.241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to seeing those.

48:28.602 --> 48:30.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, let's move on with some more gaming news.

48:30.202 --> 48:30.702
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

48:31.642 --> 48:34.463
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is hopefully something a little bit happier.

48:35.243 --> 48:37.264
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I want this more than I want a Vita.

48:37.604 --> 48:41.845
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it more than a 3DS because I love everything Neo Geo.

48:42.645 --> 48:45.726
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a new Neo Geo portable coming out, the Neo Geo X.

48:47.326 --> 49:04.261
[SPEAKER_09]: and it is going to come with 20 games already built into it and it's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with SD card expansion AV output and like I said 20 games already included which I probably own most of them

49:05.041 --> 49:23.788
[SPEAKER_09]: including Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars, Cyber Lip, Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury Special, Football Frenzy, King of Monsters, Last Resort, League Bowling, Magician Lord, Awesome Game, Metal Slug, even more awesome, Mutation Nation, NAMM 1975, Samurai Showdown, Sengoku, Super Sidekicks, King of Fighters 94, which was the best, Ultimate 11, Top Players, Golf, and World Heroes.

49:24.449 --> 49:26.791
[SPEAKER_04]: But when is Windjammer going to be available for it?

49:28.173 --> 49:28.433
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

49:28.453 --> 49:30.455
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man, I adore that game.

49:30.855 --> 49:34.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Baseball Stars is the saving grace in that list for me personally.

49:34.619 --> 49:37.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I came across a multicab with that in it, I was pretty happy.

49:37.081 --> 49:38.483
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have that game.

49:39.404 --> 49:39.864
[SPEAKER_09]: The cartridge.

49:41.265 --> 49:41.686
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that.

49:42.627 --> 49:42.747
Yeah.

49:43.348 --> 49:45.089
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

49:45.829 --> 49:54.053
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a price up on it yet but it's going to be distributed by Tomo in North America and that's for the limited edition.

49:54.514 --> 49:57.135
[SPEAKER_09]: In Europe it will be released by Blaze.

49:58.539 --> 50:03.862
[SPEAKER_02]: It better be cheap, because I can tell you right now, that looks just like a reskinned Dingu.

50:05.303 --> 50:07.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Dingu... The Dingu ate my baby!

50:08.064 --> 50:10.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that, not a Dingo, a Dingu.

50:10.465 --> 50:18.249
[SPEAKER_02]: A Dingu is basically, it was like an emulation device, and it had all the same features, and looked exactly the same as that.

50:18.529 --> 50:21.671
[SPEAKER_02]: And it played Neo Geo games, of course you had to have the ROMs for them.

50:22.111 --> 50:26.654
[SPEAKER_02]: But it played Neo Geo games, and I swear to God, the thing is just a Dingu.

50:26.714 --> 50:28.355
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks exactly the same.

50:30.036 --> 50:32.117
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Dingu's, I think they're under $100.

50:32.217 --> 50:35.399
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that thing is over $100, eh, not worth it.

50:35.759 --> 50:38.040
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make the same argument for the FC Ultras, right?

50:38.681 --> 50:43.023
[SPEAKER_04]: The portable, what was it, SNES, NES, and I think maybe even Genesis in a more recent version?

50:43.443 --> 50:46.045
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could put a BlackBerry phone on it, would it be a DinguBerry?

50:48.885 --> 50:50.846
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants to put a BlackBerry phone on anything.

50:50.926 --> 50:52.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Cue sad trombone.

51:11.656 --> 51:14.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's interesting that it's doing so much better on PlayStation 3.

51:14.757 --> 51:16.138
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the word got out about the modes.

51:16.178 --> 51:23.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, considering that the PS3 seems to be the better version with more characters in there, and it works, and it has all these features.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.521
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, all right.

51:25.081 --> 51:27.061
[SPEAKER_09]: I also found out something really weird just now.

51:27.201 --> 51:28.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Those sound like good numbers, though.

51:28.342 --> 51:28.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, DarkSakura.

51:28.662 --> 51:29.382
[SPEAKER_09]: That I hadn't realized.

51:30.042 --> 51:31.763
[SPEAKER_09]: Ragnarok Online is hitting their 10th anniversary.

51:32.202 --> 51:32.582
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

51:33.903 --> 51:34.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Old.

51:34.623 --> 51:35.303
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's still going.

51:36.624 --> 51:37.024
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

51:37.084 --> 51:39.545
[SPEAKER_02]: And to celebrate the 10 year anniversary, they're banning everybody.

51:39.565 --> 51:43.747
[SPEAKER_09]: It's older than wow.

51:43.867 --> 51:49.049
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize because I left the room for a quick minute, but are you going to get one of these little Neo Geos?

51:49.549 --> 51:49.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

51:50.109 --> 51:50.449
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

51:50.489 --> 51:50.950
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one.

51:51.450 --> 51:51.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

51:52.924 --> 51:54.427
[SPEAKER_05]: Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket Color, or a Neo Geo.

52:04.369 --> 52:06.130
[SPEAKER_04]: 3.5 inches is the same size as an iPhone.

52:06.470 --> 52:09.611
[SPEAKER_05]: And iPhone isn't fun to play certain games on.

52:09.691 --> 52:10.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain games.

52:10.872 --> 52:12.092
[SPEAKER_04]: But this won't just be a touchscreen.

52:12.112 --> 52:12.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Big difference.

52:12.833 --> 52:16.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Games that are designed for the iPhone are great on the iPhone.

52:16.514 --> 52:21.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Games that they try to port from freaking PlayStation to the iPhone are not so great.

52:21.716 --> 52:23.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I did okay with some of the arcade games.

52:23.437 --> 52:24.677
[SPEAKER_09]: Like X-Men played just fine.

52:25.177 --> 52:27.258
[SPEAKER_09]: And Espagabaluda 2.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Robot Unicorn Attack plays really, really well on the iPhone.

52:34.704 --> 52:35.745
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that was made for the iPhone.

52:35.885 --> 52:36.726
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it wasn't.

52:36.746 --> 52:37.686
[SPEAKER_11]: It was made for Flash.

52:39.048 --> 52:43.892
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like it could be an upgraded Dingo because the Dingo doesn't have a 3.5-inch screen.

52:43.912 --> 52:50.318
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only 2.8 inches LCD, but it has the video out and everything.

52:50.398 --> 52:52.420
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks goddamn the same.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.621
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a super Dingo.

52:54.142 --> 52:55.383
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a super Dingo.

52:57.705 --> 52:58.105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

52:58.425 --> 52:59.466
[SPEAKER_02]: More gaming news, Loki.

53:00.266 --> 53:00.586
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

53:00.626 --> 53:02.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not talk about the dingo anymore.

53:02.967 --> 53:04.287
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick, before I make another bad joke.

53:04.987 --> 53:06.748
[SPEAKER_02]: God, we don't want to do that.

53:07.028 --> 53:11.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Baldur's Gate is coming back, and they're doing an enhanced edition.

53:11.329 --> 53:13.090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be coming out this summer.

53:14.191 --> 53:37.968
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course Baldur's Gate was produced by Wizards of the Coast or I should say Atari is publishing it but it's based off the D&D stuff and the Enhanced Edition is going to be kind of like an HD remake they're also talking that they may be doing Baldur's Gate 2 as well which is kind of neat um

53:41.051 --> 53:44.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much more, I guess, is kind of out about it right now.

53:47.732 --> 54:13.426
[SPEAKER_05]: just to put it in perspective these are some legendary PC games and funny enough I believe the original was done by Bioware to kind of bring things full circle I don't think they own the rights anymore I think that's why they're getting this now but yeah I'm interested I remember vaguely playing the old ones briefly but I didn't play them start to finish so I'm definitely interested in this take a second look what about you Loki?

54:13.466 --> 54:16.188
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played the original so yeah

54:17.756 --> 54:18.477
[SPEAKER_02]: May 15, 2012 is the date.

54:39.895 --> 54:44.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you some other things maybe you may not have caught, you know, besides just the date news.

54:44.778 --> 54:46.860
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an international launch.

54:47.560 --> 54:52.463
[SPEAKER_05]: So the game is going to be available in many different countries all at the exact same time.

54:52.964 --> 54:55.626
[SPEAKER_05]: You can digitally pre-order the game now.

54:56.026 --> 54:59.008
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning, I guess you download the whole darn thing to your computer.

54:59.108 --> 55:03.131
[SPEAKER_05]: You can pre-purchase it now and you'll be ready to play when the game goes live.

55:03.151 --> 55:03.831
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking for some...

55:03.871 --> 55:04.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows, who knows, uh

55:34.451 --> 55:35.952
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a very fair comparison.

55:36.433 --> 55:37.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard and Ubisoft.

55:37.694 --> 55:39.075
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not... Well, see, here's the thing.

55:39.115 --> 55:41.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard's claiming anyway they're not doing it for DRM.

55:42.157 --> 55:45.880
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing it for the... They don't want people cloning the items and all that.

55:45.940 --> 55:48.362
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all the item distribution is going through the servers and all that.

55:48.822 --> 55:49.923
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

55:50.343 --> 55:50.664
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

55:50.864 --> 55:51.204
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

55:51.244 --> 55:51.644
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

55:52.425 --> 55:53.266
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what they're saying.

55:53.326 --> 55:54.126
[SPEAKER_05]: Hacker's gonna hack.

55:54.166 --> 55:56.328
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see if people get into this before May 15th.

55:56.388 --> 55:57.869
[SPEAKER_05]: But it didn't happen with StarCraft 2.

55:58.270 --> 55:59.450
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

56:00.411 --> 56:01.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that rule 35?

56:01.492 --> 56:02.633
[SPEAKER_04]: If it exists, it's hacked?

56:02.653 --> 56:02.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

56:02.990 --> 56:04.715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you know the old saying, haters gonna hate.

56:04.775 --> 56:06.058
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, hackers gonna hack.

56:06.098 --> 56:06.820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

56:07.923 --> 56:11.351
[SPEAKER_05]: We always talk about, this company says, this device is unhackable.

56:11.572 --> 56:12.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Hackers gonna hack.

56:14.411 --> 56:15.212
[SPEAKER_11]: Master's gonna bait?

56:15.992 --> 56:17.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Master's gonna bait.

56:17.553 --> 56:19.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Dingu's gonna bait.

56:21.736 --> 56:41.349
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you want to get your free copy of Diablo 3 for signing up for the World of Warcraft Blood Pact, actually they call it something else, Annual Pass or something, but basically you're signing your life away to Blizzard saying, yes, Blizzard, I will pay you penance for a full year and you will give me a flying horse, you will give me beta access to panda people.

56:41.549 --> 56:42.530
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to sign up.

56:43.130 --> 56:45.331
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get your free copy of Diablo.

56:45.371 --> 56:53.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, DarkSakura, if you want to sign up, you got to do it before May 1st because that's the day the deal is done and you will not be able to do that anymore.

56:54.616 --> 56:56.877
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you feel like it, you can get the collector's edition, $99.99.

56:59.358 --> 57:00.819
[SPEAKER_05]: for Diablo 3 Collector's Edition.

57:00.879 --> 57:02.580
[SPEAKER_05]: That would only be in stores, though, just so you know.

57:03.020 --> 57:06.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's kind of hard to do an online Collector's Edition.

57:06.362 --> 57:10.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can't download a specially crafted USB drive through your computer.

57:10.784 --> 57:11.825
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a little difficult.

57:11.925 --> 57:17.168
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could get fairy wings for your character, which apparently is part of the deluxe pack-in Collector's Edition.

57:17.528 --> 57:17.968
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you got for us next in gaming news?

57:22.265 --> 57:27.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other news, there is very happy news for all of us Portal 2 fans.

57:27.891 --> 57:31.014
[SPEAKER_09]: They won the BAFTA for the British Academy.

57:32.175 --> 57:34.418
[SPEAKER_05]: My God, it's been a year and it's still winning awards.

57:34.658 --> 57:36.239
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they beat out Skyrim.

57:36.279 --> 57:37.160
[SPEAKER_09]: Skyrim got nothing.

57:38.882 --> 57:39.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

57:39.983 --> 57:40.244
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

57:41.245 --> 57:45.269
[SPEAKER_05]: Or for you, Portal 2, you go, Portal 2, and none for Elder Scrolls.

57:45.289 --> 57:45.429
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

57:47.436 --> 57:56.241
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically, the big rivals that it had was Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and Deus Ex.

57:57.301 --> 58:05.205
[SPEAKER_09]: And it won, I believe, three awards for design, for story, and the...

58:07.441 --> 58:20.014
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a game of the year, so as far as others that won, Battlefield 3 won the public vote, so it had the Game Award of 2011, and the BAFTA for online multiplayer and audio.

58:20.274 --> 58:24.298
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's like the People's Choice Award, and you know, who watches that?

58:24.478 --> 58:26.160
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still, it's pretty, well...

58:26.560 --> 58:27.120
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

58:27.180 --> 58:27.860
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a big deal.

58:27.980 --> 58:31.441
[SPEAKER_09]: But Portal 2, you know, I just think it's funny that Skyrim got nothing.

58:32.441 --> 58:35.282
[SPEAKER_09]: And Deus Ex also got nothing, which was supposed to be a pretty good game.

58:35.402 --> 58:35.722
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

58:35.742 --> 58:35.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

58:36.122 --> 58:38.303
[SPEAKER_05]: And, oh, it only took about five seconds.

58:38.363 --> 58:39.063
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's your joke.

58:39.123 --> 58:42.384
[SPEAKER_05]: Sterlok says, Skyrim took an arrow to the knee.

58:46.545 --> 58:46.925
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

58:47.165 --> 58:47.625
[SPEAKER_10]: It deserves more.

58:47.645 --> 58:50.785
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to take an arrow to the dingo in about a minute if you make that joke again.

58:50.865 --> 58:52.066
[SPEAKER_10]: It deserves more than the...

58:55.774 --> 58:56.695
[SPEAKER_05]: and Acidic Vampire.

58:56.735 --> 58:57.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is a great joke.

58:58.036 --> 59:00.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire asks, was the award a potato?

59:02.941 --> 59:03.602
[SPEAKER_09]: A potato.

59:04.263 --> 59:05.644
[SPEAKER_09]: So, here's what won.

59:07.226 --> 59:08.627
[SPEAKER_09]: Batman Arkham City won for action.

59:09.028 --> 59:10.930
[SPEAKER_09]: Artistic Achievement was Rayman Origins.

59:13.612 --> 59:15.814
[SPEAKER_09]: Debut game, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.

59:15.935 --> 59:17.917
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a scoff over there on Rayman Origins.

59:18.137 --> 59:18.617
[SPEAKER_05]: All I have to say...

59:19.358 --> 59:20.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Play that on a Vita.

59:20.879 --> 59:21.439
[SPEAKER_05]: My god.

59:21.899 --> 59:22.599
[SPEAKER_05]: It is gorgeous.

59:24.900 --> 59:26.000
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal 2 and best game.

59:27.141 --> 59:28.201
[SPEAKER_09]: Design was Portal 2.

[SPEAKER_09]: Family was LittleBigPlanet 2.

59:29.681 --> 59:31.262

[SPEAKER_04]: It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal You get nothing, you lose Good day, sir

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:30.731
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very unsportsmanlike of them.

01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:32.212
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty rude speech.

01:00:32.432 --> 01:00:33.693
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Gene Wilder.

01:00:35.114 --> 01:00:36.155
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not hating on them.

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:38.637
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you send in the angry, Skyrim is a good game.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.357
[SPEAKER_05]: You should not make fun of it.

01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:40.999
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Skyrim is a good game.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.019

[SPEAKER_05]: It's a phenomenal game.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.622
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a buggy as fuck game.

01:00:46.403 --> 01:00:46.903
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's good.

01:00:47.123 --> 01:00:50.126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, for me, Portal 2, oh my god, was like perfect.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's where you put sunglasses and bows on animals.

01:02:51.084 --> 01:02:53.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that a really bad episode of Pokemon?

01:02:54.315 --> 01:02:56.216
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is wrong with this country?

01:02:56.236 --> 01:02:58.818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this country, and that's what the fuck wrong with it.

01:02:58.838 --> 01:02:59.639
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not all.

01:04:29.939 --> 01:04:33.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's also some 3DSs coming out in pink and white.

01:04:33.139 --> 01:04:37.301
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those colors already exist, but now they will have Mario 3D Land as a pack-in game.

01:04:37.701 --> 01:04:41.122
[SPEAKER_05]: So those will be out very soon on the 24th in Japan as well.

01:04:41.882 --> 01:04:44.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to the Vita and see what the Vita's getting this week.

01:04:45.003 --> 01:04:47.103
[SPEAKER_05]: Little Busters Converted Edition.

01:04:47.704 --> 01:04:48.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Little Deviants?

01:04:50.316 --> 01:04:52.077
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's definitely not Little Deviants.

01:04:52.978 --> 01:04:54.979
[SPEAKER_05]: These girls look like Deviants of a different sort.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.062
[SPEAKER_05]: But Little Busters is, you know, another one of those anime.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Dating sim.

01:05:00.043 --> 01:05:00.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

01:05:02.924 --> 01:05:05.947
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, what else is coming out?

01:05:06.047 --> 01:05:09.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Checking quickly on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:05:10.229 --> 01:05:12.151
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3, quite a bit.

01:05:12.191 --> 01:05:13.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Devil May Cry HD Collection.

01:05:14.392 --> 01:05:16.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Fallout New Vegas, the Ultimate Edition.

01:05:16.193 --> 01:05:18.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninja Gaiden 3, Regular and Collector's Edition.

01:05:20.476 --> 01:05:25.417
[SPEAKER_05]: and Atuteki Yugi Mugen Souls comes out this week from Compile.

01:05:26.037 --> 01:05:26.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

01:05:26.457 --> 01:05:27.397
[SPEAKER_11]: Compile.

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:28.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Compile's back?

01:05:29.178 --> 01:05:30.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Compile never went away.

01:05:32.639 --> 01:05:34.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Who made Guardian Legend?

01:05:35.079 --> 01:05:35.639
[SPEAKER_11]: Compile?

01:05:37.039 --> 01:05:42.361
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they were not around anymore because that was the reason we weren't getting a new Guardian Legend game.

01:05:43.601 --> 01:05:44.601
[SPEAKER_11]: Compile made other games.

01:05:45.638 --> 01:05:47.060
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they broke up years ago.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, let me do some research.

01:05:48.702 --> 01:06:02.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I need to know if Compile is back and making this game, which actually looks kind of cute because it's like anime babes, but there's definitely like these action-y sequences and then there's this whole little like, uh-oh, you might see my...

01:06:04.198 --> 01:06:22.929
[SPEAKER_09]: Compile Publisher They were famed for developing shooters and puzzle games such as Aleste and Puyo Puyo following the bankruptcy of Compile in 2002 Sight was up until 2007 were redirected to Compile Station and by D4 Enterprise Inc.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:38.409
[SPEAKER_09]: and a company spun off Milestone that had arcade shoot-em-ups and Compile Heart hopes to revive the Compile brand name with the assistance of former Compile employees like Puyo Puyo creator Mu Nittani.

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:41.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so apparently Compile... And they made this friggin' game.

01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:43.351
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of Compile Heart.

01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:44.832
[SPEAKER_05]: So Compile has been to the moon and back.

01:06:45.512 --> 01:06:49.234
[SPEAKER_05]: So bankruptcy wasn't necessarily the end of the company.

01:06:49.314 --> 01:06:54.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, can I just for a moment say, I'd like to please, Compile, if you're listening, consider...

01:06:55.377 --> 01:06:59.098
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's been, what, 26 years and we're getting a new Kid Icarus game?

01:06:59.178 --> 01:07:01.839
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the time has come for us to get a new Guardian Legend.

01:07:02.199 --> 01:07:02.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Guardic?

01:07:02.839 --> 01:07:03.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Guardic 3.

01:07:03.159 --> 01:07:04.260
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what they need to do?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:04.600
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.461
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to release Guardic and Guardic 2 because we didn't get Guardic over here.

01:07:09.621 --> 01:07:11.202
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the second one as the Guardian Legend.

01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:12.362
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an MSX game, right?

01:07:12.522 --> 01:07:17.263
[SPEAKER_09]: So they need to do, like, the Guardic Special Edition and then give us Guardic 3.

01:07:18.524 --> 01:07:19.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen to that.

01:07:20.743 --> 01:07:46.094
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to bust out that MSX emulator I will drop the President Cat thing right now for that I would give a square inch of my flesh probably from my left arm in exchange for Guardic 3 I'm telling you, I know we talk about it a lot on this show for those of you that haven't heard a lot of OLR in the past The Guardian Legend is like the greatest 8-bit game you probably missed

01:07:46.887 --> 01:07:48.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's like the other big games that they did.

01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:59.734
[SPEAKER_09]: They did Zanuck, Aleste, which I have Robo Aleste, Gunhead, Spriggan, and there's also the big Spriggan anime too, you remember?

01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:08.578
[SPEAKER_09]: But they did that for PC Engine, and then there was like, they did a few dungeon crawlers, like I said, Pio Pio, and Golvalius.

01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:10.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember that?

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.701
[SPEAKER_09]: They also did two pinball games for the TurboGrafx-16.

01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:15.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guess what they were?

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:29.610
[SPEAKER_09]: Alien Crush, and Devil's Crush Blazing Lasers, Choplifter, Ghostbusters, Lode Runner,

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.051
[SPEAKER_09]: Shadowrun

01:08:50.023 --> 01:08:50.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Compile's great.

01:08:51.123 --> 01:08:55.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so Compile, now that you're back together, we have a new project you need to get on.

01:08:56.565 --> 01:09:00.606
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, 360 also gets the Devil May Cry HD collection.

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is Japan, don't forget.

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:06.628
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kinect Rush Disney Pixar Adventure, Ninja Gaiden 3 Collectors and Regulars Edition.

01:09:06.748 --> 01:09:07.928
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, let's go to the UK.

01:09:09.873 --> 01:09:10.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Send me a ticket, I wish.

01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:19.699
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as stuff that's out in the UK, on the 21st is Rayman 3 HD.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:29.825
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 22nd, we have Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Wing Commander Saga, The Darkest Dawn, and yesterday, all of the last two being on PC.

01:09:30.485 --> 01:09:42.802
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 23rd, Armored Core 5, Kid Icarus Uprising, Ninja Gaiden 3, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond, Resident Evil, Operation Raccoon City, and Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai.

01:09:44.364 --> 01:09:44.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Bleh.

01:09:46.487 --> 01:09:46.868
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:47.932
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

01:10:03.492 --> 01:10:08.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Fine's Kickstarter just finished with $3.3 million.

01:10:10.116 --> 01:10:15.140
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of money for Kickstarter and for them.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.423
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more than they were hoping to get with $400,000 being the goal.

01:10:20.764 --> 01:10:26.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're going to be doing a lot of extra content because of that.

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:52.496
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course Tim Schafer was quoted saying I don't want to say this is the end of the whole game industry as we know it it's not, it's not but it's nice that they don't necessarily need publishers to make games like this because honestly who would green light an adventure game an old school adventure game nowadays it's something that they don't think would sell

01:10:52.976 --> 01:10:59.797
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I think also maybe success of these types of games might convince publishers that these types of games still do alright.

01:11:00.878 --> 01:11:01.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:11.920
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're looking, if you maybe missed out on the whole funding of the Double Fine Adventure and you're still wondering, hey, where can I throw my money for an extended pre-order on something?

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasteland 2 has a Kickstarter going for it now.

01:11:16.761 --> 01:11:21.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Wasteland is kind of, I would say, like the inspiration for the Fallout games.

01:11:23.263 --> 01:11:37.813
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hoping to raise $900,000 for their game and of course already have hit that goal and then beyond that and they still have almost a month left to go.

01:11:38.893 --> 01:11:57.667
[SPEAKER_02]: and now of course they're looking to see if they can reach 1.5 million dollars and they're going to add more content to the game and that kind of stuff also porting it to other platforms like OSX and that kind of stuff.

01:11:57.967 --> 01:12:01.448
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check out Kickstarter for that and some other projects.

01:12:01.948 --> 01:12:12.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, though, not contributing to the very vague, poorly misspelled MMO project from some strange millionaire who seriously looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt and a rapist.

01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:15.570
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe avoid that one.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:18.531
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:22.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Kickstarter, Kickstarter, Kickstarter.

01:12:25.352 --> 01:12:27.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a trend we like seeing in gaming?

01:12:28.935 --> 01:12:35.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I don't see why we wouldn't like it.

01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.283
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see what the downside is.

01:12:37.944 --> 01:12:42.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than, I mean, it's one of those things like if you don't want to support it, then you don't support it.

01:12:43.549 --> 01:12:46.651
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's forcing you to put down money for it.

01:12:46.852 --> 01:12:48.053
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I see a couple...

01:12:48.413 --> 01:12:48.733
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

01:13:05.092 --> 01:13:08.055
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what people want to do with it.

01:13:08.155 --> 01:13:23.948
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've only contributed to one thing so far which is a video project done by Freddie Wong because I love all of his videos but I get with that a Blu-ray copy of the movie, a signed poster by the cast and that kind of stuff.

01:13:23.988 --> 01:13:27.171
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are little things that are kind of neat from it but

01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:28.572
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:47.936 --> 01:13:48.957
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple hundred dollars.

01:13:48.977 --> 01:13:58.165
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one I saw for a third edition for a book called High Score, which is talking about classic games and stuff like that.

01:13:58.185 --> 01:13:58.766
[SPEAKER_10]: I have that book.

01:13:59.206 --> 01:14:01.288
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to put out a third edition of it.

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:08.035
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the $250 level, you can have dinner with a bunch of these classic game people.

01:14:08.155 --> 01:14:10.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone from Peter Molyneux to...

01:14:13.039 --> 01:14:13.499
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name?

01:14:13.539 --> 01:14:15.420
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy behind the Sims series.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.401
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Wright.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:17.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Wright, yes.

01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:18.782
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have dinner with him.

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:23.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a bunch of really classic developers.

01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:25.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit, I'd do that just for the experience maybe.

01:14:25.105 --> 01:14:27.226
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little eh on Kickstarter.

01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:35.755
[SPEAKER_05]: The only things that bug me about it is A, people need to realize Kickstarter gets 5%, which I... They gotta run the site.

01:14:36.576 --> 01:14:38.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, America's about the capitalism.

01:14:38.859 --> 01:14:41.282
[SPEAKER_05]: They came up with a great idea and they're taking their share.

01:14:41.703 --> 01:14:44.026
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't fault them for that.

01:14:44.266 --> 01:14:45.968
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally would not like to use Kickstarter.

01:14:46.889 --> 01:14:47.489
[SPEAKER_05]: for that reason.

01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:56.972
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing that really bugs me is that some of the projects and I'm not going to name names, but one in particular that I saw in there felt really exploitative to me.

01:14:57.232 --> 01:15:03.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was just exploiting for money for things that I would argue you don't need that kind of money for.

01:15:04.434 --> 01:15:12.556
[SPEAKER_05]: And this type of record was being broken like 10 times over, which props to them for having that kind of audience that would just give and give and give and give that kind of money.

01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:13.676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wonderful.

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:16.297
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think

01:15:17.406 --> 01:15:19.687
[SPEAKER_05]: The money would be better spent on charity.

01:15:19.727 --> 01:15:20.867
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's me.

01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:26.248
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think you have to be very careful about what you're donating to and think really hard about it.

01:15:26.268 --> 01:15:27.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Think really hard about it.

01:15:27.529 --> 01:15:33.290
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rob, I just always thought, you know, how much better would this show be if we had a swanky office?

01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.750
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go there.

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:36.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't.

01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:37.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't start stuff.

01:15:38.311 --> 01:15:40.872
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could just throw one of those up and say, who wants to support me?

01:15:43.128 --> 01:15:43.788
[SPEAKER_05]: See, here's the thing.

01:15:43.948 --> 01:15:47.590
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as you could do that, that's when Kickstarter starts to get a little ridiculous.

01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.471
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

01:15:48.571 --> 01:15:49.431
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's the point.

01:15:49.551 --> 01:15:56.095
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the online equivalent of standing out on the street corner with a tin can begging for change.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:59.017
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think any of us want to see it turn into that.

01:16:00.831 --> 01:16:02.431
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, here's what I would think.

01:16:02.952 --> 01:16:09.693
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I think it would be kind of cool to do a Kickstarter just for funding merchandise.

01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:18.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of times, if you're merchandising for even, say, our show or something like that, it costs money to make t-shirts and stuff.

01:16:18.255 --> 01:16:20.776
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, it's almost like a pre-sale for merchandise.

01:16:22.056 --> 01:16:24.717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would be the only intent for it.

01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:24.977
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

01:16:26.997 --> 01:16:28.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that'd be the only thing I could see.

01:16:29.578 --> 01:16:31.918
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to donate the proceeds, you could do that.

01:16:34.579 --> 01:16:41.020
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the only... Because, I mean, you're basically using... That's what people use it for anyways, is merchandise for a lot of it.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.361
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of which I really wish I'd gotten in on, you know, like Cards Against Humanity.

01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:51.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I love that game, but I really wish I had gotten in on that Kickstarter so I can get a full set of the cards.

01:16:53.402 --> 01:16:54.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen Ryan's custom pack?

01:16:54.803 --> 01:16:56.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the pack that we play with at home?

01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.910
[SPEAKER_04]: The custom pack?

01:16:57.970 --> 01:16:58.791
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:04.895
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the fact that they release the PDF of all of the cards on the set.

01:17:05.396 --> 01:17:19.507
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole reason why they do that is because if you missed what amounts to limited scale printing and you are particularly savvy, Ryan printed up a pack of her own and we have a bunch of custom ones that we made for our own purposes, a couple custom blacks, and then...

01:17:20.888 --> 01:17:26.231
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody that we know, like everybody that we could really throw in a good joke about has their name on a card as well.

01:17:26.911 --> 01:17:31.314
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's happy to, you know, pay materials and then we'll get a deck out to you.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I've printed my own.

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:34.576
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been playing with it.

01:17:34.596 --> 01:17:36.717
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's weird, though, because they're like little cracker-sized.

01:17:36.737 --> 01:17:37.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:37.877 --> 01:17:39.638
[SPEAKER_04]: The PDF is in a really nasty square.

01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:45.282
[SPEAKER_04]: We made them general, like actually apples-to-appleside cards because she knows how to put it together to be able to do that kind of thing.

01:17:45.302 --> 01:17:45.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would have done that.

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:47.423
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, at the time, I was under a time.

01:17:47.623 --> 01:17:49.524
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to print them out and cut them up.

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.078
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:16.985
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's a lot of game projects on there that are worth supporting if that's your thing.

01:18:17.305 --> 01:18:21.987
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, like I said, crazy guy that looks like Jabba the Hutt and a rapist.

01:18:22.127 --> 01:18:27.189
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of people on there that maybe I shouldn't support them.

01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:29.130
[SPEAKER_05]: You also said that on Bobby's show.

01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:30.970
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to nail it home.

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:33.451
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like Jabba the Hutt crossed with a rapist.

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:37.613
[SPEAKER_05]: The OLR podcasters have no idea what you're talking about if they didn't listen to Bobby's show this week.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mentioned it earlier.

01:18:39.034 --> 01:18:41.656
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy who won the lottery.

01:18:41.936 --> 01:18:48.042
[SPEAKER_02]: He won $43 million, and he wants to create an MMO created by gamers for gamers.

01:18:48.342 --> 01:18:48.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:51.444
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, creating an MMO is really fucking hard.

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:59.731
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy thinks that he can do it because he's played games for like 30 years, and I hate to use the cliche of like, oh, he looks like a gamer.

01:18:59.871 --> 01:19:03.154
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but seriously, the guy looks like he just crawled out of his mom's basement.

01:19:03.615 --> 01:19:04.996
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just... So kind.

01:19:05.016 --> 01:19:05.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:19:06.096 --> 01:19:14.461
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously though, the thing about it though is if you look at it, there's no real details to this.

01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:16.401
[SPEAKER_02]: He just keeps throwing out stuff.

01:19:16.442 --> 01:19:22.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you will get a special mount at level one and blah, blah, blah.

01:19:22.685 --> 01:19:24.986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dude, you're talking about garbage.

01:19:25.066 --> 01:19:28.568
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a guy I used to deal with that had big ideas like this.

01:19:28.588 --> 01:19:29.288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:19:31.272 --> 01:19:35.357
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, dude, you don't have the smarts or the means to do any of this stuff.

01:19:35.377 --> 01:19:37.399
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that people are just pissing away money.

01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:45.568
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people were donating a dollar so that they can make fun of him on his like...

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:49.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual page and stuff, so I don't know.

01:19:50.171 --> 01:19:51.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read some of the comments from chat room.

01:19:51.471 --> 01:19:54.992
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of talk on this topic at chat.orangenautradio.com.

01:19:55.773 --> 01:19:57.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, See, Loki even agrees.

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:59.054
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR needs a Kickstarter.

01:19:59.114 --> 01:19:59.594
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

01:19:59.634 --> 01:20:02.635
[SPEAKER_05]: Better recording equipment, better mics, and maybe a TriCaster?

01:20:03.475 --> 01:20:08.376
[SPEAKER_05]: Rageinator says, do a kickstart project so we can experience OLR and 7.1 surround sound.

01:20:10.117 --> 01:20:13.897
[SPEAKER_05]: As nice as that is to think about, I'm going to be honest.

01:20:14.097 --> 01:20:24.120
[SPEAKER_05]: I would feel guilty taking your money if I couldn't guarantee that 100% of it went into improving the show directly for you guys somehow.

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.440
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.441
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll think of ideas, I guess.

01:20:29.061 --> 01:20:29.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:29.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:20:29.981 --> 01:20:30.321
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:20:30.922 --> 01:20:36.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, one idea I didn't think about before is the idea about funding the t-shirts or something in advance.

01:20:36.104 --> 01:20:38.145
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a good idea, I have to admit.

01:20:38.606 --> 01:20:39.506
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me put it this way.

01:20:39.546 --> 01:20:40.507
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one I was talking about.

01:20:40.587 --> 01:20:41.667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Your World.

01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:48.731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a video game project by Elwood Bartlett, and he's got...

01:20:50.452 --> 01:20:53.114
[SPEAKER_02]: $20,000!

01:20:50.672 --> 01:20:53.114
[SPEAKER_02]: People are funding this already.

01:20:53.314 --> 01:20:57.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, he's never going to hit the goal of $1.1 million, but it's fun.

01:20:57.897 --> 01:20:59.578
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to throw it in.

01:20:59.718 --> 01:21:02.900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horribly misspelled, too.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:05.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Pledge $100 or more.

01:21:05.841 --> 01:21:07.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Reward number one, two, and three.

01:21:07.923 --> 01:21:13.506
[SPEAKER_02]: Access to special VDOR selling items for those who donated via Kickstarter.

01:21:13.626 --> 01:21:16.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Special authenticator to protect your account.

01:21:16.568 --> 01:21:17.028
[SPEAKER_02]: Vidor.

01:21:17.329 --> 01:21:19.250
[SPEAKER_02]: Spell check your goddamn shit.

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.290
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:22.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Other comments from chat.

01:21:23.092 --> 01:21:26.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Bochikawa says, Kickstarter really is just a way to funnel donations.

01:21:26.314 --> 01:21:28.235
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR wouldn't need one because of the listeners.

01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:31.617
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the ones that would support OLR and we would be the ones to donate.

01:21:31.857 --> 01:21:34.979
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of Kickstarter projects that nobody has the slightest clue about.

01:21:35.279 --> 01:21:38.901
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone a couple thousand miles away would appreciate some money going to a thing they like.

01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:58.130
[SPEAKER_05]: which Actdeft also kind of follows up with we have already helped OLR before without Kickstarter and that is very true you have to remember remember my diva fit a few years ago when the computer broke the Orange Ones Radio listeners sent a fucking new computer to us and that is like the best one of the best things if not the best thing that has ever happened

01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:59.371
[SPEAKER_05]: from doing this show.

01:21:59.411 --> 01:22:06.477
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you how that felt to just be like, oh my god, they sent a computer so we could continue to do the show.

01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:09.399
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just an amazing feeling.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.000
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

01:22:13.923 --> 01:22:18.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, all that we would have to do if anyone wanted to donate anything is just set up a PayPal.

01:22:19.147 --> 01:22:20.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:22:20.949 --> 01:22:22.069
[SPEAKER_05]: And they take 4%.

01:22:24.091 --> 01:22:25.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Last word on Kickstarter.

01:22:25.392 --> 01:22:25.712
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything?

01:22:27.154 --> 01:22:27.414
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to post a picture of the guy.

01:22:30.086 --> 01:22:30.806
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:31.286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:22:32.767 --> 01:22:34.148
[SPEAKER_05]: Jet Set Radio HD.

01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:35.809
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't need anything to fund this.

01:22:35.849 --> 01:22:37.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega just finally decided to bring it out.

01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:38.411
[SPEAKER_05]: What a good idea.

01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:41.392
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jet Set Radio, everybody's been asking, what about the soundtrack?

01:22:41.492 --> 01:22:42.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get to keep Rob Zombie?

01:22:42.973 --> 01:22:44.634
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get to keep Chibamato?

01:22:44.995 --> 01:22:46.575
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is no.

01:22:46.976 --> 01:22:47.656
[SPEAKER_05]: Dun, dun, dun.

01:22:47.736 --> 01:22:49.397
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's – okay, hold on.

01:22:49.557 --> 01:22:56.141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that bad because there will be about half of the tracks from the North American version will stay in the game.

01:22:56.201 --> 01:22:57.322
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with the European version.

01:22:58.203 --> 01:23:07.811
[SPEAKER_05]: They did try to re-license the music, but of course, cost, availability, some of these labels that the music was originally on aren't even around anymore, so it just couldn't happen.

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:15.738
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, all the Hideki Nagunuma songs that were in the original, those stay, because those were created for Sega, so of course those are staying.

01:23:16.118 --> 01:23:18.320
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few licensed tracks that will return.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.942
[SPEAKER_05]: The Guitar Vader songs have been re-licensed.

01:23:21.742 --> 01:23:24.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Electric Toothbrush, Reps, B.B.

01:23:24.204 --> 01:23:26.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrights, those songs are coming back, and a few more.

01:23:27.186 --> 01:23:36.253
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be some songs that are going to return in the Jet Set Radio HD, but Rob Zombie, Chibamato, those songs will not be coming back.

01:23:36.293 --> 01:23:40.696
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still think that's pretty cool they got to salvage some of it, and at least it will retain that same feel.

01:23:41.657 --> 01:23:44.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, don't forget, higher resolution, widescreen to play,

01:23:45.139 --> 01:23:48.961
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 frames a second, and two analog sticks.

01:23:51.742 --> 01:23:53.243
[SPEAKER_05]: Jet Set Radio HD.

01:23:53.303 --> 01:23:54.103
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm excited.

01:23:54.323 --> 01:23:55.104
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, DarkSakura?

01:23:55.124 --> 01:23:55.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to get this?

01:23:56.845 --> 01:23:57.185
[SPEAKER_11]: We might.

01:23:57.565 --> 01:24:03.207
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm also thinking about starting a Kickstarter for when I have a kid to see who contributes the most money and wants to pay for the baby's name.

01:24:05.316 --> 01:24:06.257
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh!

01:24:06.817 --> 01:24:08.358
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't sell that on Kickstarter.

01:24:08.779 --> 01:24:09.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.000
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put it on eBay.

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:11.561
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:12.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:17.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a time back to when games were a lot simpler.

01:24:17.225 --> 01:24:18.566
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no Kickstarter.

01:24:18.726 --> 01:24:20.247
[SPEAKER_05]: Just blowing on the cartridge a lot.

01:24:21.144 --> 01:24:23.025
[SPEAKER_09]: This game sure involves blowing and sucking.

01:24:24.987 --> 01:24:27.728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

01:24:27.909 --> 01:24:29.350
[SPEAKER_09]: It also involves farting stars.

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:43.219
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is Kirby's Adventure, also known as, let's see, Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi no Monogatari, which was Kirby of the Stars, the Story of the Fountain of Dreams.

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:49.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, if you listen really carefully, you can hear Actdeft squeeing all the way from Mexico, because he loves Kirby, I know that.

01:24:49.483 --> 01:24:50.344
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the music, though.

01:24:54.185 --> 01:24:55.486
[SPEAKER_09]: This game just makes you happy.

01:24:56.346 --> 01:24:57.766
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pink little puffball.

01:24:58.206 --> 01:25:02.088
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so pissed off at Nintendo of America for what they do to poor Kirby.

01:25:02.828 --> 01:25:06.629
[SPEAKER_09]: They make him look angry in every... You get the Japanese version.

01:25:06.689 --> 01:25:07.530
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirby's happy.

01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:08.530
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm happy Kirby.

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:11.371
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything in America comes out that's got Kirby's face on it.

01:25:12.151 --> 01:25:12.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Mean Kirby.

01:25:14.132 --> 01:25:14.792
[SPEAKER_02]: It's angsty.

01:25:16.053 --> 01:25:16.633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hipster.

01:25:18.633 --> 01:25:19.914
[SPEAKER_09]: He was happy before he was angry.

01:25:21.627 --> 01:25:21.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey boy.

01:25:45.549 --> 01:25:46.710
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this was a platformer.

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:53.993
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out on March 26, 1993 in Japan and came out in America on May 1, 1993 and in Europe on December 1, 1993.

01:25:54.573 --> 01:25:57.535
[SPEAKER_09]: This came out when I was a junior in high school.

01:25:58.575 --> 01:26:02.137
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no, I was a senior.

01:26:02.377 --> 01:26:02.697
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

01:26:03.618 --> 01:26:09.861
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so it was super, super cute and it's actually out on what?

01:26:11.101 --> 01:26:12.022
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from chat.

01:26:13.423 --> 01:26:14.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Just move on.

01:26:14.704 --> 01:26:15.845
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not appropriate for me to repeat.

01:26:18.533 --> 01:26:18.993
[SPEAKER_09]: Badge.

01:26:19.053 --> 01:26:19.613
[SPEAKER_09]: Again.

01:26:20.294 --> 01:26:21.194
[SPEAKER_09]: Address to the chatroom, not you.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:32.838
[SPEAKER_09]: So it came out on the Virtual Console on February 12, 2007, and in Europe on February 16, 2007, and in Japan on February 27, 2007, so we actually got it ahead of Japan.

01:26:33.778 --> 01:26:40.001
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, it was one of the 12-inch masterpieces that was given in Super Smash Bros.

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:40.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Brawl.

01:26:40.681 --> 01:26:43.262
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a 3D Classics version on the eShop.

01:26:44.262 --> 01:26:50.866
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, the story, Kirby wakes up from his after-lunch nap, and he didn't have any dreams.

01:26:51.086 --> 01:26:51.386
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:26:51.426 --> 01:26:52.707
[SPEAKER_05]: God, it's awesome to be Kirby.

01:26:52.747 --> 01:26:53.447
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking.

01:26:54.548 --> 01:26:56.069
[SPEAKER_05]: He gets to take a siesta after lunch.

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.489
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

01:26:57.372 --> 01:27:00.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Paint Roller, Mr. Shine, Mr. Bright, Cracko, Heavy Mole, and Meta Knight

01:27:23.627 --> 01:27:26.150
[SPEAKER_09]: and one for himself, King Dedede had.

01:27:27.491 --> 01:27:33.358
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically you have to go through seven worlds, battle enemies, mini-bosses, bosses, and you have to get the Star Rod put back together.

01:27:33.959 --> 01:27:35.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Now here's where it gets fun.

01:27:36.565 --> 01:27:38.226
[SPEAKER_09]: as we all know, what?

01:27:38.467 --> 01:27:57.041
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing, just, this game makes me laugh, it's cute, it's adorable you're sitting over there saying names like King Dedede, he took the star rod and he broke it up it's like I'm listening to a 4 year old describe something, it's great should I do my 12 year old girl voice?

01:27:57.161 --> 01:28:02.566
[SPEAKER_09]: oh my god, yes please so anyway, the game's a platformer shut up

01:28:04.625 --> 01:28:09.069
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got regular levels, a boss fight, and a warp star door!

01:28:09.209 --> 01:28:10.030
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys!

01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:14.013
[SPEAKER_09]: King DDD took the star rod and broke it!

01:28:14.133 --> 01:28:15.054
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

01:28:16.035 --> 01:28:17.656
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound extra gay.

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:18.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Just letting you know.

01:28:20.999 --> 01:28:21.680
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like a 12-year-old girl.

01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:24.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that was my impression of the Kony guy in the videos that are on TMZ.

01:28:24.963 --> 01:28:26.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh, I'm so sick of that.

01:28:27.986 --> 01:28:43.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, he can run and jump, and he can attack and dodge enemies by side-tackling, and he can fly by inflating himself, meaning he holds his breath until he floats into the air, and then he can basically get as high as he can.

01:28:43.422 --> 01:28:44.222
[SPEAKER_09]: He gets high, y'all.

01:28:45.183 --> 01:28:47.065
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta be high to enjoy this game.

01:28:47.145 --> 01:28:47.665
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

01:28:47.705 --> 01:28:48.666
[SPEAKER_09]: This game's awesome.

01:28:48.986 --> 01:28:49.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it is.

01:28:49.406 --> 01:28:49.687
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

01:28:49.727 --> 01:28:50.007
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on TV.

01:28:50.027 --> 01:28:51.008
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to STFU right now.

01:28:51.068 --> 01:28:51.628
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me finish.

01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:54.670
[SPEAKER_09]: But when he's flying, he can't use his other abilities.

01:28:54.891 --> 01:28:58.613
[SPEAKER_09]: But he can exhale and this puff of air after he exhales.

01:28:58.894 --> 01:29:00.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently he has death breath.

01:29:00.094 --> 01:29:04.598
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when he goes... Enemies die.

01:29:07.604 --> 01:29:12.187
[SPEAKER_09]: and anyway, his big ability is that he can inhale.

01:29:12.587 --> 01:29:19.171
[SPEAKER_09]: So he sucks enemies and objects into his mouth and then it stays into his mouth until he spits them out.

01:29:24.353 --> 01:29:25.154
[SPEAKER_09]: I quit, bye.

01:29:27.455 --> 01:29:28.816
[SPEAKER_09]: No, let me finish.

01:29:28.856 --> 01:29:29.836
[SPEAKER_09]: God, you people are dirty.

01:29:30.337 --> 01:29:34.259
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game for six, look, UFO Catcher Kirby.

01:29:37.777 --> 01:29:38.778
[SPEAKER_09]: He's fucking fat.

01:29:40.159 --> 01:29:41.020
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a fat bitch.

01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:42.561
[SPEAKER_05]: But fluffy.

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:48.306
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, he can spit them right back out and do damage.

01:29:48.726 --> 01:29:49.507
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he can swallow them.

01:29:50.247 --> 01:29:51.108
[SPEAKER_09]: He swallows or spits.

01:29:51.448 --> 01:29:52.109
[SPEAKER_09]: There, I said it.

01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:53.310
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you happy?

01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:29:55.905 --> 01:29:57.266
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob is red in the face.

01:29:57.666 --> 01:29:59.327
[SPEAKER_09]: He is as red as my shirt, y'all.

01:30:00.948 --> 01:30:03.790
[SPEAKER_09]: But he can swallow them too, and he copies their abilities.

01:30:04.570 --> 01:30:07.392
[SPEAKER_09]: He can spit fire if he swallows something that spits fire.

01:30:07.432 --> 01:30:09.553
[SPEAKER_09]: So he swallows them and absorbs their DNA a little bit?

01:30:11.529 --> 01:30:16.493
[SPEAKER_09]: He can also use his drop ability, but he can't inhale anything while he has a special ability.

01:30:17.354 --> 01:30:20.996
[SPEAKER_09]: So when he uses up the special ability, he farts a star.

01:30:23.278 --> 01:30:24.239
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he poops a star.

01:30:25.519 --> 01:30:28.602
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like the flying bouncy star, the special power-up.

01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:36.469
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirby's Adventure was one of those late generation games and probably the best of them.

01:30:51.596 --> 01:30:54.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Wario Woods I have this game in the box, by the way.

01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:19.643
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, there were different remakes.

01:31:19.804 --> 01:31:22.126
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't bring box into this or I'm only going to laugh harder.

01:31:24.969 --> 01:31:27.552
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not make me re-download the Vuvuzela app, okay?

01:31:29.145 --> 01:31:34.608
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, now this was re-released on the Game Boy Advance and it was called Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland.

01:31:35.929 --> 01:31:43.173
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, the, uh, name that it came out, um, as in Japan was Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi Deluxe.

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:46.736
[SPEAKER_09]: Which was Kirby of the Stars, the Fountain of Dreams Deluxe.

01:31:46.796 --> 01:31:47.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, there you go.

01:31:48.477 --> 01:31:52.999
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the, uh, Nightmare in Dreamland had cooperative, uh, two to four players.

01:31:53.379 --> 01:31:54.760
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could play as different colored Kirpys.

01:31:56.361 --> 01:31:58.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it had really good reviews.

01:31:58.982 --> 01:32:04.205
[SPEAKER_09]: It was given a 9.5 out of 10 by EGM.

01:32:05.085 --> 01:32:07.006
[SPEAKER_09]: GameSpot gave it 7.3 out of 10.

01:32:07.906 --> 01:32:10.107
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's been... Fuck GameSpot!

01:32:10.347 --> 01:32:10.928
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

01:32:12.168 --> 01:32:14.409
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, this is a little bit interesting.

01:32:14.869 --> 01:32:22.513
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a French version of the game in Canada, which makes this the only French-only NES released in North America.

01:32:24.699 --> 01:32:25.240
[SPEAKER_05]: La Kirby.

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:26.080
[SPEAKER_09]: La Kirby.

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:35.609
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21st, 1994, and had vocals by Mako Miata.

01:32:36.791 --> 01:32:37.271
[SPEAKER_09]: End of story.

01:32:39.473 --> 01:32:42.716
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first game that I know of that actually has a pinball spinoff.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:46.440
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually my first Kirby game was Kirby's Pinball for the Game Boy.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that on Game Boy Basic?

01:32:49.546 --> 01:32:49.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:32:50.466 --> 01:32:51.907
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the Pokemon pinball game?

01:32:52.087 --> 01:32:54.128
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't before Color.

01:32:54.849 --> 01:33:05.414
[SPEAKER_09]: The first pinball game that I ever played on a handheld was, or on a console, and I'm including handhelds, was Gator's Revenge on the old Game Boy.

01:33:05.454 --> 01:33:07.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say, that was my first pinball game too.

01:33:08.756 --> 01:33:13.198
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I think I rented Pinball Quest before that, but anyway.

01:33:13.678 --> 01:33:15.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinbot was also great.

01:33:15.259 --> 01:33:19.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one thing that was funny is that when we had a pinball party at the house, we had a jackpot in the house.

01:33:19.523 --> 01:33:22.765
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we had Bride of Pinbot dancing up the nest with Pinbot right next to it.

01:33:23.146 --> 01:33:23.406
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

01:33:23.626 --> 01:33:24.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was pretty funny.

01:33:24.687 --> 01:33:25.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:33:25.888 --> 01:33:34.556
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a new, like, not to distract from Kirby and the cute music that's in the background, but we could use, like, a great new pinball game from Nintendo, because they gave us some awesome ones.

01:33:34.596 --> 01:33:35.937
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was the Kirby one, you know...

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Outstanding, I love that game.

01:33:38.278 --> 01:33:38.979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was great.

01:33:39.039 --> 01:33:40.359
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need a new one.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.122
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, I want that new, well it's not new new anymore, but the Kirby game that came out on DS.

01:33:55.934 --> 01:33:57.715
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 10 Kirby's.

01:33:57.755 --> 01:33:58.976
[SPEAKER_05]: You can borrow it if you want.

01:33:59.096 --> 01:34:00.297
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to borrow it.

01:34:00.337 --> 01:34:01.537
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Kirby draw one.

01:34:01.697 --> 01:34:01.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:34:02.098 --> 01:34:02.518
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

01:34:02.598 --> 01:34:03.839
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wanted to play that.

01:34:03.859 --> 01:34:04.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

01:34:04.299 --> 01:34:04.779
[SPEAKER_05]: You can borrow it.

01:34:05.119 --> 01:34:05.580
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't playing it.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:06.960
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:07.721
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:09.502
[SPEAKER_05]: See, something good came of all that laughter.

01:34:10.022 --> 01:34:11.163
[SPEAKER_05]: See, laughter brings healing.

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:12.784
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's no longer bright red.

01:34:13.004 --> 01:34:13.264
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:34:13.364 --> 01:34:14.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've calmed down a little bit.

01:34:14.765 --> 01:34:15.005
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:34:16.462 --> 01:34:17.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Plenty more OLR to come.

01:34:17.642 --> 01:34:18.543
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not done yet.

01:34:18.603 --> 01:34:20.423
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got more news coming at you.

01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:23.964
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about some really controversial things in the next half.

01:34:24.004 --> 01:34:27.665
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to stick with this and get your say in in our chat room if you're listening live.

01:34:27.725 --> 01:34:32.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat, excuse me, dot OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:34:32.106 --> 01:34:35.807
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio with Jason in studio tonight.

01:34:36.147 --> 01:34:38.808
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first ever OLR, Pants Off, Dance Off.

01:34:39.788 --> 01:34:40.188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:40.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

01:34:40.828 --> 01:34:42.369
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, that's news to me.

01:34:43.730 --> 01:34:45.471
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a surprise for $4.50, Rob.

01:34:46.112 --> 01:34:48.214
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what other surprises DarkSakura has in store?

01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:51.497
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:06.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Saturday evening, March the 18th of 2012, with the 450th episode of our show.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.341
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in just a little bit.

01:35:09.661 --> 01:35:10.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you all had a good St.

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:13.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick's Day, those of you that, you know, decided to do something.

01:35:13.524 --> 01:35:17.726
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's just because, like, I'm getting old now or whatever, but I didn't really do anything yesterday.

01:35:17.766 --> 01:35:19.547
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys do anything to kind of celebrate?

01:35:19.627 --> 01:35:25.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, going out to the bars and getting blitzed was awesome when I was 21, but now, like, last night, I was like, I'm too tired to do anything.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.852
[SPEAKER_04]: The only instrument that sounds like cattle being beaten to death?

01:35:53.829 --> 01:35:54.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey now, don't hate.

01:35:56.293 --> 01:35:57.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I like bagpipes.

01:35:57.094 --> 01:35:58.496
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, let's talk Metreon.

01:35:58.576 --> 01:36:00.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you reminded me you were right by there.

01:36:00.378 --> 01:36:03.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when the Metreon used to be like nerd heaven?

01:36:03.755 --> 01:36:08.319
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when the Metreon actually had something more than just a movie theater in 5 or 6?

01:36:08.919 --> 01:36:11.021
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that the Metreon had gone through some changes?

01:36:11.321 --> 01:36:11.481
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:36:12.042 --> 01:36:22.771
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very surprising coming out here because I heard of all of these classic video gaming staples that I was in the immediate vicinity of that aren't there anymore.

01:36:22.931 --> 01:36:26.794
[SPEAKER_04]: Pier 39 doesn't have... Mel told me what the place was called.

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.095
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely forgot what it was all of a sudden.

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:28.676
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot what it was called.

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.797
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember the DDR tournament we did live from there.

01:36:30.897 --> 01:36:31.458
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good time.

01:36:31.478 --> 01:36:31.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Pier 39...

01:36:33.059 --> 01:36:35.260
[SPEAKER_05]: B3 was a tournament, but I don't remember the name of the arcade.

01:36:37.561 --> 01:36:39.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Pier 39 had a nice place.

01:36:39.302 --> 01:36:44.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Metreon was, as best as I understand, the original DDR tournament location.

01:36:46.605 --> 01:36:51.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it did or didn't have the first US DDR arcade, it was kind of the staple of everything.

01:36:51.807 --> 01:36:53.728
[SPEAKER_05]: My first DDR tournament was at the Metreon, yeah.

01:36:53.928 --> 01:36:55.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:36:55.248 --> 01:37:02.511
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell me about, and Metron, you know, this isn't just about music games, but Metron was the home of the Sony store, the official Sony store for a long, long time.

01:37:03.031 --> 01:37:09.193
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell me about not knowing any of this and what you felt when you walked into the Metron for the first time in eight years.

01:37:09.213 --> 01:37:09.253
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

01:37:10.513 --> 01:37:11.574
[SPEAKER_04]: for the first time ever in my case.

01:37:11.594 --> 01:37:12.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we didn't go there.

01:37:12.654 --> 01:37:13.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

01:37:13.214 --> 01:37:22.519
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Metreon, I kind of expected it as soon as I looked outside, walked down the street towards it and saw what was going on.

01:37:22.779 --> 01:37:27.081
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a huge chunk of the Metreon that's just closed off because apparently they're renovating well over half of it.

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:28.462
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Nightmare Before Christmas there twice

01:37:45.745 --> 01:37:47.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a thing of candy, a winner every time, something ridiculously basic

01:38:06.424 --> 01:38:08.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumor is that Target is going into Metreon.

01:38:08.945 --> 01:38:12.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that actually would be a big deal because in San Francisco proper, there's no Target.

01:38:12.567 --> 01:38:16.009
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest Target is in Daly City, which is a little bit south.

01:38:16.089 --> 01:38:19.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:38:19.190 --> 01:38:20.751
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Porkchop is in our chatroom tonight.

01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:26.173
[SPEAKER_05]: Porkchop is Irish, as in Ireland, as in staying up until 3 in the morning to listen to this show.

01:38:26.213 --> 01:38:28.154
[SPEAKER_05]: And Porkchop says, I'm Irish and I did nothing.

01:38:28.514 --> 01:38:29.575
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gigantic mess.

01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:32.051
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say I blame you.

01:38:32.091 --> 01:38:32.672
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the same thing.

01:38:33.333 --> 01:38:36.957
[SPEAKER_05]: Technus in our chatroom says, isn't Pier 39 a tourist trap now in San Francisco?

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:37.959
[SPEAKER_05]: It always was.

01:38:37.979 --> 01:38:38.780
[SPEAKER_05]: It always was.

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Or am I thinking of something totally different?

01:38:40.983 --> 01:38:42.464
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it hasn't changed.

01:38:42.505 --> 01:38:43.926
[SPEAKER_05]: It always has been a giant tourist trap.

01:38:43.946 --> 01:38:44.627
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say this.

01:38:45.328 --> 01:38:46.269
[SPEAKER_05]: The fresh donuts.

01:38:46.329 --> 01:38:47.351
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope those are still there.

01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:49.013
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little stand that sells the donuts.

01:38:49.153 --> 01:38:49.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Donut Bag Stand

01:39:04.671 --> 01:39:05.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and the chocolate place.

01:39:05.752 --> 01:39:07.012
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like all kinds of chocolate.

01:39:07.032 --> 01:39:07.953
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the boost chocolate.

01:39:08.293 --> 01:39:10.034
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you go to the Saltwater Taffy store?

01:39:10.054 --> 01:39:10.674
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did not.

01:39:11.915 --> 01:39:16.597
[SPEAKER_04]: I passed through a whole bunch of stuff and stepped inside and looked at a couple of places, but no, I didn't get in there.

01:39:16.677 --> 01:39:23.221
[SPEAKER_09]: My two favorite places actually is Treasure Isle, the big Celtic store, and the Sock store.

01:39:24.341 --> 01:39:29.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well we could reminisce about San Francisco and memories and when the Metron was cool and all that.

01:39:29.204 --> 01:39:31.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, it is still a good place to see movies, I'll give it that.

01:39:32.787 --> 01:39:39.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you didn't end up doing that, but... The little nature in Martin Luther King Memorial Outdoors was actually a really nice walk.

01:39:39.351 --> 01:39:40.352
[SPEAKER_05]: Really cool park in the back.

01:39:40.392 --> 01:39:47.877
[SPEAKER_04]: The weather held up enough that walking around town was not miserable, being rained on, being blown over, anything like that.

01:39:48.037 --> 01:39:51.419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really nice little property in the middle there, Moscone, Yerba Buena, and all those.

01:39:51.639 --> 01:39:52.080
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

01:39:52.782 --> 01:39:56.265
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let's move on, back to some games, as much as we can talk about the outdoors.

01:39:57.326 --> 01:40:02.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back to some video games with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories that don't fit in anywhere else.

01:40:03.432 --> 01:40:07.316
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's talk about Ridiculous Bundles.

01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:15.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Steel Battalion, known for, you know, it's not exactly cheap prices in the past, but they have a brand new...

01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:28.858
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's available in Japan right now for 35,000 yen or 420 US dollars via Capcom's online shop.

01:40:28.878 --> 01:40:38.428
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a Steel Battalion bundle that includes a backpack, a helmet, a jacket, a

01:40:39.469 --> 01:40:45.010
[SPEAKER_02]: Patches, soundtrack to the game, and I believe an art book.

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:46.170
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:55.172
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dress up like the character in the game with an actual helmet and looks like bomber jacket for $400.

01:40:55.472 --> 01:40:57.693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little ridiculous.

01:40:58.373 --> 01:41:00.313
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, they used to have a $200 controller.

01:41:01.213 --> 01:41:03.954
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Dan the full controller when it was $300 for the old one.

01:41:07.464 --> 01:41:09.505
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something that was kind of unnecessary.

01:41:10.465 --> 01:41:11.805
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the huge red button.

01:41:13.106 --> 01:41:14.246
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the eject button.

01:41:14.286 --> 01:41:15.026
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty fun.

01:41:15.106 --> 01:41:16.687
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, could you play the game without that controller?

01:41:19.207 --> 01:41:19.507
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:41:19.527 --> 01:41:20.368
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking for the wrong guy.

01:41:20.628 --> 01:41:22.328
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think that you could.

01:41:22.568 --> 01:41:25.029
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could, it was a very stripped-down experience, needless to say.

01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:25.489
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:41:26.089 --> 01:41:30.410
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know they also made mods for the full unit to make it a more compact unit?

01:41:32.271 --> 01:41:32.431
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:41:32.731 --> 01:41:43.851
[SPEAKER_04]: but did they make any mods to make the compact unit as it was a huge unit like a Battletech booth we're talking about units by the way you know who has two of those controllers now you yep yeah

01:41:45.738 --> 01:42:03.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Skyrim is going to be getting another update pretty soon, a 1.5 patch that's going to add a bunch of kill cams for things that don't have kill cams right now, including ranged attacks, also magic spells, and they're going to be adding some new melee combat moves and animations as well.

01:42:04.202 --> 01:42:06.683
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of enhancing a bunch of stuff.

01:42:07.003 --> 01:42:07.884
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

01:42:27.598 --> 01:42:32.341
[SPEAKER_02]: And props to Bethesda's blog for allowing me to put in my age.

01:42:32.481 --> 01:42:34.642
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how you hit the age gate or whatever?

01:42:34.783 --> 01:42:36.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 130th birthday, Loki!

01:42:37.064 --> 01:42:37.544
[SPEAKER_02]: I know!

01:42:37.945 --> 01:42:39.506
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just select the 1800s.

01:42:39.566 --> 01:42:40.466
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, awesome.

01:42:43.849 --> 01:42:48.892
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so they're going to be fixing some other bug stuff as well on top of the added features.

01:42:49.298 --> 01:42:51.399
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, all that's for free!

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.640
[SPEAKER_02]: So suck it, Capcom!

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Free shit, awesome.

01:42:57.643 --> 01:43:03.746
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, God of War has a demake that's available on PC if you want to check it out.

01:43:04.606 --> 01:43:09.649
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Bit of War, and it looks almost like Rygar or something.

01:43:11.410 --> 01:43:17.513
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, 8-bit demake, and it's available on the website armlessoctopus.com

01:43:18.834 --> 01:43:19.254
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:43:42.102 --> 01:43:43.063
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that never happens.

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.081
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:44:30.822 --> 01:44:34.343
[SPEAKER_05]: However, EA does not officially or unofficially endorse the game.

01:44:34.383 --> 01:44:35.864
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to clarify that.

01:44:36.844 --> 01:44:41.966
[SPEAKER_05]: They did get the lawyers and everything to sign off of them, so that's kind of shocking.

01:44:42.166 --> 01:44:45.947
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately that means you're not going to get a Wing Commander remake anytime soon.

01:44:45.987 --> 01:44:49.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that doesn't bode well for official Wing Commander stuff.

01:44:49.108 --> 01:44:51.349
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, this fan thing sounds like it's going to be awesome.

01:44:51.489 --> 01:44:52.669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free, first off.

01:44:52.749 --> 01:44:54.210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

01:44:54.230 --> 01:44:56.771
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 missions, 2 campaigns, 60 voice actors.

01:44:57.011 --> 01:44:57.951
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be a voice actor.

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:15.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Dozens of Terran and Kilrathi spaceships, 70 cutscenes It takes place after Wing Commander 3 I'm assuming it's going to pretend that that movie never existed Because if you're a true fan, you're just going to ignore that movie Who has actually seen that movie in full here?

01:45:16.424 --> 01:45:19.106
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen parts, and all I remember is Freddie Prinze Jr.

01:45:19.126 --> 01:45:22.388
[SPEAKER_05]: and Matthew Lillard of Scream fame I...

01:45:23.659 --> 01:45:30.543
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very ashamed to admit this, but long ago and far away, I've never spent a dime on it.

01:45:31.163 --> 01:45:34.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Long ago and far away, it was like the weekend Fox movie or whatever.

01:45:34.965 --> 01:45:40.588
[SPEAKER_04]: I was having an absolutely lazy day, and I can honestly say I watched the thing from start to finish, and I really wish I couldn't.

01:45:42.245 --> 01:45:46.286
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to think of Matthew Litter from Hacker's Fame.

01:45:47.687 --> 01:45:48.747
[SPEAKER_04]: That upgrades his status.

01:45:48.827 --> 01:45:52.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Johnny Lee Miller, who would next be seen in Dark Shadows.

01:45:52.809 --> 01:45:53.869
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.

01:45:54.369 --> 01:45:57.410
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, which by the way, internet, stop hating on the Dark Shadows trailer.

01:45:57.511 --> 01:45:57.891
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

01:45:59.011 --> 01:45:59.391
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.

01:45:59.692 --> 01:46:03.014
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird, but it's supposed... Okay, if you look at it as like... Is it Tim Burton?

01:46:03.034 --> 01:46:04.014
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's Tim Burton.

01:46:04.074 --> 01:46:05.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

01:46:05.635 --> 01:46:08.397
[SPEAKER_05]: And the old show was a little bit cheesy.

01:46:08.637 --> 01:46:11.519
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all 70s and stuff because it's supposed to be like the old show.

01:46:11.899 --> 01:46:18.664
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the context of the fact that right now everybody's all about Twilight and shit, it's actually really funny.

01:46:18.884 --> 01:46:20.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just... I don't know.

01:46:20.965 --> 01:46:22.006
[SPEAKER_05]: People need to let it go.

01:46:22.086 --> 01:46:22.566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

01:46:23.567 --> 01:46:26.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhythm Party, fun game on the Xbox 360.

01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:32.215
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a Bomani fan, you probably haven't heard of this, which is strange to me because it's right up a Bomani fan's alley.

01:46:32.295 --> 01:46:33.936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great Kinect game for Bomani.

01:46:34.417 --> 01:46:37.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it way more than I thought I would, as I said previously on the show.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.561
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some more DLC.

01:46:40.002 --> 01:46:45.807
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are sick of the song list being too tiny, you can get three new songs this week in Rhythm Party Song Pack 4.

01:46:46.627 --> 01:46:48.249
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sunbeam by Dez Roe.

01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:50.914
[SPEAKER_05]: is one song.

01:46:51.215 --> 01:46:53.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Inside Your Mind by Limahl.

01:46:54.983 --> 01:46:56.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that the band that did The NeverEnding Story?

01:46:58.464 --> 01:46:59.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was.

01:46:59.784 --> 01:47:05.046
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the band that did The NeverEnding Story is now in Rhythm Party with Inside Your Mind.

01:47:05.226 --> 01:47:09.147
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's a new song or an old song or what because I only thought they ever did one song.

01:47:09.687 --> 01:47:10.787
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the third song.

01:47:11.127 --> 01:47:15.188
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever played Bomani Games ever, you know this song.

01:47:15.868 --> 01:47:21.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Bag by Revenge is the third song that you can now play in Rhythm Party.

01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:23.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bag.

01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:23.390
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:47:23.410 --> 01:47:24.731
[SPEAKER_05]: You hating on Bag over there?

01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:26.231
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just weird.

01:47:27.992 --> 01:47:28.733
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

01:47:30.135 --> 01:47:34.340
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually trying to see if I had a clip of bag.

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:36.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the people that don't know.

01:47:38.116 --> 01:47:40.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is my old music folder?

01:47:40.617 --> 01:47:42.497
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of being woken up by bagpipes.

01:47:43.237 --> 01:47:43.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

01:47:43.677 --> 01:47:45.738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of appropriate for the time of year, isn't it?

01:47:47.658 --> 01:47:49.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps that's exactly why they chose to release it this week.

01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:50.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps, perhaps.

01:47:51.719 --> 01:47:53.119
[SPEAKER_05]: What 2DX game was back in?

01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:53.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight.

01:47:53.959 --> 01:47:54.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Or nine.

01:47:54.539 --> 01:47:54.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong.

01:47:54.959 --> 01:47:55.239
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

01:47:55.259 --> 01:47:56.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine flailing your arms and legs to this.

01:48:11.778 --> 01:48:12.739
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when did this come out?

01:48:12.759 --> 01:48:15.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this would be totally appropriate for, like, yesterday.

01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:16.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday.

01:48:16.121 --> 01:48:16.722
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out Tuesday.

01:48:16.942 --> 01:48:17.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, well then, perfect.

01:48:17.963 --> 01:48:19.184
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally appropriate for yesterday.

01:48:19.504 --> 01:48:20.325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so there you go.

01:48:20.705 --> 01:48:22.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you have to see this, though, quickly.

01:48:22.546 --> 01:48:25.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is terrible radio, but let me show the YouTube here real quick.

01:48:26.409 --> 01:48:34.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Because somebody actually puts together the... It's not Konami, but some fan puts together all the DLC stuff into these videos on YouTube.

01:48:34.896 --> 01:48:37.358
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to see the animations for Bag.

01:48:37.418 --> 01:48:38.658
[SPEAKER_05]: They will blow your mind.

01:48:38.699 --> 01:48:39.059
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

01:48:39.439 --> 01:48:39.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's...

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:41.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, that's inside your mind.

01:48:41.561 --> 01:48:42.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Bag.

01:48:44.224 --> 01:48:50.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, look at all the little dancing sheep in the background, and then as you're dancing, little bagpipes get attached to you.

01:48:50.912 --> 01:48:57.961
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like an entire Beatles album just invaded my brain.

01:49:00.931 --> 01:49:05.296
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete with LSD and George Harrison's obsession with the sitar.

01:49:05.677 --> 01:49:06.658
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no... Look at this.

01:49:06.818 --> 01:49:10.423
[SPEAKER_05]: I have just been schooled on my 80s pop music by Xenacore in our chat room.

01:49:10.563 --> 01:49:12.445
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously had no idea ever of this.

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:15.709
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenacore says, Rob, Limahl is the singer.

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:18.833
[SPEAKER_05]: The band was nameless as far as anyone cares.

01:49:20.427 --> 01:49:21.187
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, RapidFireNews

01:49:50.185 --> 01:49:51.966
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe Volume 2 will be better.

01:49:52.066 --> 01:49:53.206
[SPEAKER_09]: So next thing.

01:49:53.706 --> 01:49:54.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor.

01:49:54.487 --> 01:50:00.129
[SPEAKER_09]: Shenmue 1 and 2 HD finished going to Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

01:50:00.409 --> 01:50:08.631
[SPEAKER_09]: An anonymous source reported it to Gamerzine saying that it's been completed for over a year and it's pending release.

01:50:08.872 --> 01:50:10.332
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't say it's true.

01:50:11.553 --> 01:50:11.813
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor.

01:50:12.713 --> 01:50:13.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumor.

01:50:13.993 --> 01:50:14.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is a really good album.

01:50:15.074 --> 01:50:15.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumors.

01:50:16.214 --> 01:50:18.896
[SPEAKER_09]: So how about some Rock Band 3 tracks that are coming out?

01:50:18.996 --> 01:50:19.537
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

01:50:20.217 --> 01:50:26.702
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be two tracks from Men at Work that will be in the Rock Band Music Store, Overkill and Down Under.

01:50:27.603 --> 01:50:29.164
[SPEAKER_09]: And Carlos Santana's Smooth.

01:50:31.306 --> 01:50:33.387
[SPEAKER_09]: That should make some people need new pants.

01:50:34.328 --> 01:50:36.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, that song got played out.

01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:39.872
[SPEAKER_09]: Well yeah, for people who like playing pro guitar mode.

01:50:41.013 --> 01:50:42.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll give you that, I'll give you that.

01:50:43.514 --> 01:50:44.975
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine that would be kind of hot.

01:50:46.195 --> 01:50:53.338
[SPEAKER_09]: And so anyway, the tracks are going to be $1.99 and there is, of course, like I said, pro upgrade available for smooth for $0.99 or 80 Microsoft points.

01:50:58.510 --> 01:51:05.515
[SPEAKER_09]: which is funny because actually on the way up here I was listening to Lonely Island and the Santana DVX song came up and that song's funny.

01:51:06.296 --> 01:51:09.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to transition back into some longer news here.

01:51:09.458 --> 01:51:10.759
[SPEAKER_05]: The mailbag is coming up in a minute.

01:51:10.859 --> 01:51:14.781
[SPEAKER_05]: A mailbag at orangeentree.com FUs of the week and your calls soon.

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:16.603
[SPEAKER_05]: No Fugle question this week.

01:51:16.663 --> 01:51:19.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm going to be totally honest with an out-of-town guest.

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:20.185
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to do it today.

01:51:20.586 --> 01:51:22.147
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll bring it back next week.

01:51:22.187 --> 01:51:22.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

01:51:22.867 --> 01:51:23.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

01:51:24.288 --> 01:51:25.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:27.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about

01:51:28.451 --> 01:51:32.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, and... I mean, come on.

01:51:32.392 --> 01:51:36.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, people that are fans of Mass Effect, this is a little ridiculous.

01:51:36.772 --> 01:51:46.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, a Mass Effect 3 fan has complained about the ending of the game, but didn't necessarily complain to BioWare or EA.

01:51:47.114 --> 01:51:49.795
[SPEAKER_02]: They complained to the Federal Trade Commission.

01:51:50.815 --> 01:51:56.216
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yes, apparently, a BioWare forum user named ElSpico...

01:51:58.076 --> 01:52:06.279
[SPEAKER_02]: went to the FTC to file a false advertising complaint at EA and also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

01:52:07.379 --> 01:52:12.701
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, his reasons for it.

01:52:12.841 --> 01:52:21.984
[SPEAKER_02]: After reading through the list of promises about the ending of the game that they made in their advertising campaign and PR interviews, it was clear that the product we got did not live up to those claims.

01:52:22.424 --> 01:52:23.505
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not something...

01:52:24.745 --> 01:52:39.673
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy to do, but after the terrible ending that there was no way that the product had been advertised to me and the lack of any kind of response from Bioware EA to address this, I felt this is my only recourse.

01:52:41.333 --> 01:52:48.657
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll be returning his copy before the end of the 30-day return policy if the ending has not been addressed by then.

01:52:51.098 --> 01:52:51.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking really?

01:52:52.079 --> 01:52:52.539
Yeah.

01:52:53.874 --> 01:52:55.936
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, people are stupid.

01:52:56.516 --> 01:52:58.698
[SPEAKER_04]: There was more recourse for him.

01:52:59.058 --> 01:53:14.910
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't like any of the prequel movies for Star Wars, but did I go up to George Lucas when I was in the same room as him and demand my money back while I was eating meatloaf prepared by his staff?

01:53:16.111 --> 01:53:16.271
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:53:16.291 --> 01:53:16.331
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:53:17.031 --> 01:53:17.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Link and Zelda Kissing

01:53:47.717 --> 01:53:49.418
[SPEAKER_05]: or Embracing or whatever it is they're doing.

01:53:49.519 --> 01:53:49.879
[SPEAKER_05]: Boning.

01:53:50.079 --> 01:53:50.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, boning.

01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:51.560
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

01:53:52.021 --> 01:53:52.921
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, look, look.

01:53:53.102 --> 01:53:57.225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to compare, like, Mass Effect to Zelda The Adventures of Link, although both are great games.

01:53:57.926 --> 01:53:59.687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know the ending of Mass Effect 3.

01:53:59.807 --> 01:54:03.730
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really trying to save myself because I am experiencing the games for the first time.

01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:04.011
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:22.996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of thinking, okay, from what I've heard about it, the thing I've heard, or the way it's been explained to me without spoiling it, is that Mass Effect is very much about the story decisions you make along the way, and if you choose to go Paragon or Renegade or somewhere down the middle, and it really seems like the ending kind of doesn't fucking care about how you played the game for the past three games.

01:54:23.036 --> 01:54:26.877
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it sounds like kind of that disregard there really kind of irritated people.

01:54:27.297 --> 01:54:29.138
[SPEAKER_05]: So that I can kind of see where it's irritating, but...

01:54:30.558 --> 01:54:35.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Are people really letting the last 15 minutes just totally ruin the entire franchise for them?

01:54:35.079 --> 01:54:49.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even if the ending at this point is just fucking Goatse Man comes out and shows me his asshole, I'm still going to be like, the rest of the game up until that point was so fucking rad, I would still recommend this game to other people.

01:54:49.744 --> 01:54:55.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what happens is he ends up on a roof, he calls tech support, and they tell him to jump off the building in order to wake up.

01:54:57.748 --> 01:54:58.832
[SPEAKER_05]: What if that was the ending?

01:54:58.872 --> 01:55:00.418
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you'd be really pissed.

01:55:00.458 --> 01:55:03.208
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's got some cigaros in there, I am all good.

01:55:06.707 --> 01:55:14.330
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, how many movies and how many TV shows, or especially TV shows, and one I mentioned on Bobby's show before was The Sopranos, right?

01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:17.411
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sopranos was a hugely popular show on HBO.

01:55:17.691 --> 01:55:21.813
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of people loved this for seven seasons, and then the ending was really bad.

01:55:22.233 --> 01:55:24.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know if you guys know about the ending, but it was just fade to black.

01:55:25.414 --> 01:55:27.075
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a really bad ending.

01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:28.435
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't ruin the series.

01:55:28.575 --> 01:55:32.337
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the ending isn't Commander Shepard's son driving off with a tranny.

01:55:34.659 --> 01:55:36.622
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sure A Lot Of People Don't Catch That Reference

01:55:48.047 --> 01:56:13.528
[SPEAKER_05]: so I mean sometimes and some people would say that Battlestar Galactica had a terrible ending too I like the ending of Battlestar Galactica I mean there's only so many ways you get into a show like that I thought it was a great ending but you know some people don't agree with that so the nice thing about Mass Effect is that they can release something for DLC later or you know I know Bioware swears up and down it'll be the last game but you guys like fucking really you're gonna buy that

01:56:14.349 --> 01:56:17.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Halo 3 was going to be the last Halo game, remember that?

01:56:17.630 --> 01:56:37.897
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's ways they could do... And, you know, again, even if it ended with the entire universe imploding, like God came down and smited everybody, whatever it is that's so terrible, even if that happened, there's no reason they can't do prequels, side stories, you know, the characters before they joined up with Shepard, or just in another part of the galaxy, or...

01:56:38.477 --> 01:57:02.752
[SPEAKER_02]: from the enemy's perspective there's a million things they could do with Mass Effect still even if they chose to go to another developer granted it probably won't be as good if it's not a Bioware game but you never know once again though they can't give in to this kind of bullshit this is the ending that you guys decided on obviously there is much thought to the ending of a trilogy of a game series that's been just this massive game um yeah pun intended I guess um

01:57:03.252 --> 01:57:08.538
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't just give in because some people complain about the ending to something.

01:57:09.278 --> 01:57:10.660
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't please everybody.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:11.781
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what?

01:57:12.041 --> 01:57:13.663
[SPEAKER_02]: So you hated the ending of the game.

01:57:15.185 --> 01:57:15.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's that.

01:57:16.226 --> 01:57:25.852
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you give in to this, then any game that you put out, both BioWare, EA, any publisher, you're going to have people that are like, I don't like the ending.

01:57:26.012 --> 01:57:27.893
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to complain to the FTC.

01:57:27.953 --> 01:57:32.416
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to complain to the Better Business Bureau because I need you guys to change the ending to how I want it.

01:57:32.456 --> 01:57:34.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I want the ending to be like this.

01:57:34.498 --> 01:57:34.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

01:57:35.458 --> 01:57:35.899
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

01:57:35.979 --> 01:57:40.241
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're so bent over the ending, just write some fan fiction or something.

01:57:40.261 --> 01:57:42.043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we used to do back in the day.

01:57:42.083 --> 01:57:43.964
[SPEAKER_09]: If we didn't like something, we fan ficked it.

01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:47.712
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:58:04.514 --> 01:58:05.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58:24.073 --> 01:58:41.961
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know I think the reason why people are really mad to kind of get here you know is something I said earlier they could fix the ending through DLC just like they did with Fallout and I think people feel like ah you had me by the balls here with a shitty ending and you're gonna make me pay 10 bucks to get the real ending although y'all know you're gonna YouTube it

01:58:45.039 --> 01:58:48.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Half of all of this outcry, everybody already has anyways.

01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:52.621
[SPEAKER_05]: And that part of it, I can sympathize a little bit with that.

01:58:52.661 --> 01:58:55.622
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of shitty to force me to get more DLC.

01:58:55.762 --> 01:58:57.742
[SPEAKER_02]: They also change endings all the time and stuff.

01:58:57.782 --> 01:59:00.963
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look at, for example, I Am Legend.

01:59:00.983 --> 01:59:01.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars.

01:59:01.743 --> 01:59:06.184
[SPEAKER_02]: They're changing the end of that movie because they're going to make a sequel.

01:59:07.424 --> 01:59:12.791
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's just assume that they kill off Shepard or something like that at the end of Mass Effect 3.

01:59:13.111 --> 01:59:14.573
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say something about I Am Legend.

01:59:15.073 --> 01:59:16.816
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed it from the original ending anyway.

01:59:18.499 --> 01:59:24.804
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can't believe that they changed Titanic where now the boat's not going to sink so that way they can make a Titanic.

01:59:25.404 --> 01:59:26.245
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.

01:59:26.465 --> 01:59:31.689
[SPEAKER_02]: And it transforms into a 50-foot robot.

01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:32.710
[SPEAKER_02]: 50-foot robot.

01:59:33.671 --> 01:59:48.142
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, I don't care who the spoils work is, how the movie's been out forever, but in I Am Legend, it turned out that all the vampire things, which I believe was in the book, were all sentient and trying to rescue the one that he was keeping in captivity.

01:59:48.482 --> 01:59:50.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they addressed that.

01:59:51.084 --> 01:59:52.205
[SPEAKER_09]: But they didn't end it that way.

01:59:52.565 --> 01:59:54.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did in the director's cut.

01:59:54.546 --> 01:59:55.427
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the director's cut.

01:59:55.687 --> 01:59:57.829
[SPEAKER_05]: See, it would make sense to take that to go with.

01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:59.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Great point from TigerClaw in the chat room.

01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:01.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Portal had its ending changed.

02:00:01.651 --> 02:00:01.911
[SPEAKER_05]: Portal 1.

02:00:02.152 --> 02:00:03.593
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't have its ending changed.

02:00:03.733 --> 02:00:05.494
[SPEAKER_05]: It had its ending extended.

02:00:05.554 --> 02:00:06.054
[SPEAKER_05]: Enhanced.

02:00:06.294 --> 02:00:08.416
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but it was an important scene.

02:00:08.456 --> 02:00:09.777
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just straight up new content.

02:00:09.857 --> 02:00:12.979
[SPEAKER_04]: And console gamers, well, you heard the news.

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:13.559
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I thinking?

02:00:14.864 --> 02:00:18.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that wasn't like, oh, GLaDOS didn't actually blow up.

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:21.545
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, actually... I'm sorry to everybody.

02:00:21.585 --> 02:00:22.725
[SPEAKER_04]: I just spoiled that, too.

02:00:22.845 --> 02:00:28.846
[SPEAKER_09]: For the record, it was actually texted as the original ending.

02:00:29.527 --> 02:00:36.608
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can find a bit of programming code for party retrieval bot.

02:00:37.368 --> 02:00:40.548
[SPEAKER_09]: And the little model that they used for it was actually already in the game.

02:00:40.568 --> 02:00:43.929
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you go into third-person mode, you can actually see whatever it is that's dragging her off.

02:00:44.609 --> 02:00:47.511
[SPEAKER_09]: and they had all the data was programmed in.

02:00:47.832 --> 02:00:49.052
[SPEAKER_09]: They just didn't use it.

02:00:49.553 --> 02:00:54.436
[SPEAKER_09]: So going back in with DLC they were able to use the original ending that they had mined.

02:00:55.477 --> 02:00:55.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

02:00:57.258 --> 02:00:57.959
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of stuff like that.

02:00:57.979 --> 02:01:05.804
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I don't ever look at any ending as canon until they've said that's it.

02:01:07.406 --> 02:01:07.686
[SPEAKER_09]: You know.

02:01:08.366 --> 02:01:09.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Or until the studio goes out of business.

02:01:10.448 --> 02:01:11.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Or until they have no choice.

02:01:11.969 --> 02:01:13.310
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I have no more cube movies.

02:01:15.396 --> 02:01:23.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, anyhow, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this situation because my thing would be all like, well, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but too late, you already bought it.

02:01:24.203 --> 02:01:31.529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to pitch, or I should say recommend a title based on your joke there, Titanic 2.

02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:37.834
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a game coming out very soon, actually, that is...

02:01:39.495 --> 02:01:39.695
[SPEAKER_02]: We, NDS

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:05.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

02:02:05.881 --> 02:02:14.164
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to move on with more stories, but seriously, going to the feds to complain about the ending, like, look at your life, look at your choices.

02:02:15.505 --> 02:02:16.725
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other things to be mad about.

02:02:16.745 --> 02:02:22.248
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people that call the SWAT team on somebody if they're beating them in Call of Duty, so I mean, eh.

02:02:23.408 --> 02:02:23.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:44.875
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be chirp, chirp, chirp.

02:02:44.996 --> 02:02:46.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we fucking hated the ending too.

02:02:48.017 --> 02:02:49.738
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, look, moving on.

02:02:50.278 --> 02:02:59.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully this game won't have a shitty ending, but I will say the TV series, from what I understand, loves to do twists and turns and has been causing some fan controversy.

02:02:59.903 --> 02:03:01.424
[SPEAKER_09]: I have sadly not watched any.

02:03:01.804 --> 02:03:04.486
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not watched this show either, but I've heard a lot of good things about it.

02:03:04.867 --> 02:03:13.114
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not big on the whole zombie stuff, but then again, apparently I misjudged Mass Effect all these years ago, so someday I'm going to have to sit down and watch The Walking Dead.

02:03:13.755 --> 02:03:20.100
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a show that a lot of people are really into right now, and of course, when something gets big, there's the inevitable game that comes out.

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:22.923
[SPEAKER_05]: You may or may not remember, Telltale is the ones doing the game.

02:03:23.223 --> 02:03:28.648
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Telltale does a lot of the adventure games, the Jurassic Park, the Monkey Island reboot and all that.

02:03:29.308 --> 02:03:33.751
[SPEAKER_05]: The Walking Dead will be out in great Telltale fashion on every fucking platform you can think of.

02:03:34.291 --> 02:03:36.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, PC, Mac, iOS.

02:03:37.193 --> 02:03:39.014
[SPEAKER_05]: First episodes coming out in April.

02:03:39.094 --> 02:03:40.935
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be five episodes in total.

02:03:41.335 --> 02:03:45.697
[SPEAKER_05]: They will each be regularly released after the first one comes out.

02:03:45.738 --> 02:03:48.359
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if that's one a month, one every three months, whatever that's going to be.

02:03:49.159 --> 02:03:49.560
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:55.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Telltale, the only company that understands episodic content and does it right.

02:03:55.643 --> 02:03:57.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks Gabe Newell.

02:03:59.478 --> 02:04:03.420
[SPEAKER_04]: because he harped on episodic content is the way of the future.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.540
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

02:04:05.441 --> 02:04:07.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Steam is a great place to get these games.

02:04:08.382 --> 02:04:08.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.

02:04:08.782 --> 02:04:09.903
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I have Back to the Future.

02:04:10.163 --> 02:04:13.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Walking Dead will also be available on Facebook.

02:04:14.249 --> 02:04:14.870
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:04:30.190 --> 02:04:32.452
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to set up and maintain base camps.

02:04:32.512 --> 02:04:34.634
[SPEAKER_05]: You send out scouts to scavenge for supplies.

02:04:34.994 --> 02:04:36.635
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also some combat, naturally.

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:37.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know what would be cool?

02:04:38.016 --> 02:04:41.199
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say, in theory, this would be a great game.

02:04:41.399 --> 02:04:45.823
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could have a little zombie camp, and I could send zombies to destroy DarkSakura's people.

02:04:46.083 --> 02:04:46.763
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

02:04:46.843 --> 02:04:47.504
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you couldn't do that.

02:04:47.544 --> 02:04:47.964
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

02:04:48.104 --> 02:04:48.324
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

02:04:48.705 --> 02:04:49.525
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play Facebook games.

02:04:52.581 --> 02:04:53.722
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on it when you're not home.

02:04:53.742 --> 02:04:55.643
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're not watching and logged in.

02:04:55.743 --> 02:04:56.243
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

02:04:56.443 --> 02:04:56.643
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

02:04:56.663 --> 02:04:59.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Then who plays like every Facebook game that's out there?

02:04:59.705 --> 02:05:00.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody I know.

02:05:00.285 --> 02:05:01.186
[SPEAKER_08]: People who aren't me.

02:05:02.647 --> 02:05:03.207
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody I know.

02:05:03.767 --> 02:05:04.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody I know on Facebook.

02:05:04.968 --> 02:05:05.348
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link.

02:05:05.448 --> 02:05:06.449
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link will be playing it.

02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:09.551
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll kill X-Link's zombie camp.

02:05:10.251 --> 02:05:10.551
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:05:11.952 --> 02:05:12.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane.

02:05:12.352 --> 02:05:13.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane likes The Walking Dead.

02:05:13.533 --> 02:05:16.254
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll be curious enough to try the game and I will destroy his people.

02:05:16.314 --> 02:05:16.815
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be fun.

02:05:18.962 --> 02:05:29.267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Porkchop, there was a Dexter game that was mostly a point-and-click adventure and kind of a 3D version of an old point-and-click adventure game.

02:05:29.307 --> 02:05:31.108
[SPEAKER_04]: Dexter the TV show?

02:05:31.268 --> 02:05:31.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:05:31.568 --> 02:05:33.109
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:34.950
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been longer.

02:05:35.690 --> 02:05:36.191
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

02:05:36.211 --> 02:05:36.851
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

02:05:37.011 --> 02:05:38.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Telltale did a CSI game.

02:05:38.972 --> 02:05:40.953
[SPEAKER_05]: That was another thing that they did based on the show.

02:05:41.533 --> 02:05:44.415
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear, and I don't even watch the show.

02:05:44.475 --> 02:05:48.157
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't have a real big interest in the CSI game, but I hear it wasn't bad.

02:05:49.297 --> 02:05:49.998
[SPEAKER_04]: How old was it?

02:05:50.198 --> 02:05:51.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that like six?

02:05:51.338 --> 02:05:52.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about five years ago.

02:05:52.279 --> 02:05:54.660
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the show's been on for, what, nine years now?

02:05:54.740 --> 02:06:03.786
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember that X-Play, or perhaps even Extended Play at the time, reviewed it and said that it was not quite as polished as it should have been for such an investigative game.

02:06:03.866 --> 02:06:05.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm thinking about the same thing.

02:06:05.227 --> 02:06:05.867
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be wrong.

02:06:05.967 --> 02:06:09.429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but we can't always trust reviews, as we're going to learn later in the show, that's for sure.

02:06:09.509 --> 02:06:09.809
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:13.872
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we can trust is your emails, I think.

02:06:14.472 --> 02:06:15.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails.

02:06:15.854 --> 02:06:21.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And DarkSakura dives in or sends her zombie squad in to pull out the emails.

02:06:22.281 --> 02:06:22.761
[SPEAKER_09]: Sticky.

02:06:23.142 --> 02:06:24.703
[SPEAKER_05]: And read them here on the show.

02:06:24.723 --> 02:06:25.604
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little sticky.

02:06:25.885 --> 02:06:29.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com That's not email.

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.832
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it would help if it would actually let me read it.

02:06:37.659 --> 02:06:39.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll just listen to the happy pulpy music.

02:07:05.362 --> 02:07:12.789
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start, I have a big love you to people who are genuinely friendly during disc golf games and want to help you become a better player.

02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:22.439
[SPEAKER_09]: Another example from Loki would sound something like, a big love you to Nintendo for always going out on a limb to create new and exciting IPs without rehashing anything prior.

02:07:22.979 --> 02:07:23.880
[SPEAKER_09]: This one he has for me.

02:07:24.741 --> 02:07:28.204
[SPEAKER_09]: A big love you to World of Warcraft for rainbow unicorns that make me feel shiny.

02:07:29.205 --> 02:07:30.186
[SPEAKER_09]: If If If

02:07:54.231 --> 02:08:00.098
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do say a genuine love you or thank you to everybody that leaves us nice reviews on iTunes.

02:08:00.438 --> 02:08:05.864
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm truly not in a pissy mood, I do nice things, you know, but I'm female.

02:08:07.686 --> 02:08:08.226
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

02:08:08.287 --> 02:08:09.187
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even have to say it.

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:10.429
[SPEAKER_09]: Girl, please.

02:08:13.462 --> 02:08:17.103
[SPEAKER_05]: We are full of love and stuff for the two and a half hours.

02:08:18.603 --> 02:08:19.424
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:08:19.444 --> 02:08:25.505
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from... The fabled Art of Video Game exhibit at the Smithsonian is now open.

02:08:25.866 --> 02:08:30.307
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't gone yet because all of the opening day talks were booked before I checked.

02:08:30.607 --> 02:08:30.827
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

02:08:31.287 --> 02:08:34.968
[SPEAKER_09]: It is running during Otakon if people want to make the drive from Baltimore to D.C.

02:08:35.348 --> 02:08:41.490
[SPEAKER_09]: From Baltimore, I like to take the Metro from I-95 in Greenbelt, Maryland rather than try and park downtown.

02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:44.230
[SPEAKER_05]: If I lived there, I knew what that meant.

02:08:45.931 --> 02:08:47.211
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's just giving people directions.

02:08:47.251 --> 02:08:50.892
[SPEAKER_05]: They have all these funny terms for roads out there, like the green belt.

02:08:51.532 --> 02:08:51.992
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

02:08:53.852 --> 02:08:55.832
[SPEAKER_09]: He attached the letter from the Smithsonian.

02:08:56.293 --> 02:08:56.573
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

02:08:56.973 --> 02:08:58.453
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, open now through September 30th.

02:08:58.813 --> 02:09:03.414
[SPEAKER_09]: It felt like this day would never come, but it finally did, and the Art of Video Games exhibition is open to the public.

02:09:03.854 --> 02:09:08.975
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you can make it to see the show in person, but if not, check out the photos of the final installation on Flickr.

02:09:09.827 --> 02:09:10.548
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

02:09:31.184 --> 02:09:31.464
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

02:09:49.645 --> 02:09:59.192
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to finish on here, it says one of the best parts of the exhibition, in my opinion, is the interviews with video game artists, designers, developers, musicians, writers, and scholars.

02:10:00.333 --> 02:10:01.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it.

02:10:01.334 --> 02:10:02.014
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, pretty cool.

02:10:03.956 --> 02:10:09.099
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the link to the Flickr on here, so I would suggest seeing if you can find it.

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.461
[SPEAKER_09]: And last email, if you're ready.

02:10:12.762 --> 02:10:14.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not into sports games.

02:10:14.103 --> 02:10:16.444
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not interested in the cancelled Ubisoft game.

02:10:16.744 --> 02:10:21.926
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason, the pronunciation of Adidas... You said Adidas.

02:10:23.807 --> 02:10:25.008
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest of the world says Adidas.

02:10:25.388 --> 02:10:25.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Adidas.

02:10:26.889 --> 02:10:27.869
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said Adidas before.

02:10:28.329 --> 02:10:28.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:30.170
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he said it sounded odd.

02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:32.071
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more used to Adidas myself.

02:10:32.551 --> 02:10:34.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does the other pronunciation come from?

02:10:34.152 --> 02:10:35.713
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I've heard it that way before.

02:10:35.733 --> 02:10:39.534
[SPEAKER_05]: That comes from Robert M. Adidas was what the Korn song was called.

02:10:43.941 --> 02:11:09.806
[SPEAKER_05]: yes all day I got it dream about all right forget it like that's the one like rage metal song I'm going to admit to liking here on the show but yes I used to have a college radio show back in the day and we'd play stuff like that so we and the song was called Adidas like that's how you pronounced it so now whenever I see that like I can't help but say it that way even though I know everybody says the company is Adidas but consider it a funny pun I don't know

02:11:11.482 --> 02:11:12.062
[SPEAKER_10]: Blink, blink.

02:11:13.163 --> 02:11:14.304
[SPEAKER_10]: That's audible blinking.

02:11:14.344 --> 02:11:15.445
[SPEAKER_10]: You've never heard the corn song?

02:11:16.185 --> 02:11:16.906
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like corn.

02:11:18.907 --> 02:11:19.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even in a tortilla?

02:11:21.388 --> 02:11:22.529
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm allergic to corn.

02:11:22.549 --> 02:11:23.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that?

02:11:23.710 --> 02:11:24.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you really?

02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:24.811
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.

02:11:25.011 --> 02:11:25.891
[SPEAKER_09]: I am allergic to corn.

02:11:25.991 --> 02:11:28.853
[SPEAKER_09]: I can have it the more processed it is, the easier I have a time having it.

02:11:28.873 --> 02:11:31.295
[SPEAKER_09]: But pure corn will make my lips swell and my throat itch.

02:11:32.636 --> 02:11:32.936
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:11:33.156 --> 02:11:33.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it for emails?

02:11:34.397 --> 02:11:34.657
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:11:35.077 --> 02:11:36.258
[SPEAKER_09]: Little known fact, everybody.

02:11:36.318 --> 02:11:37.259
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you know something about me.

02:11:38.146 --> 02:12:02.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I might say this name wrong here since I love pronouncing things wrong here on the show Delighter, Delitter, Delighter in our chatroom says All day I dream about sex, song of my life You and every man And a lot of women too, so there you go And sometimes, nothing Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week

02:12:06.178 --> 02:12:08.947
[SPEAKER_05]: or if you want, the thank yous of the week.

02:12:18.442 --> 02:12:19.283
[SPEAKER_09]: My F.U.

02:12:19.503 --> 02:12:25.948
[SPEAKER_09]: goes towards... I'm still going to include Daylight Savings Time as being involved with this F.U.

02:12:26.389 --> 02:12:29.631
[SPEAKER_09]: But it goes for this crazy ass insomnia I've been having.

02:12:30.212 --> 02:12:33.434
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I do fall asleep, of course, I can't wake up in the morning.

02:12:33.735 --> 02:12:36.277
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been sleeping on average until noon.

02:12:37.785 --> 02:12:38.286
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:56.644 --> 02:13:07.312
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I would like to give a thank you to the SF Market on Florin Road in South Sac, which is usually a very scary part of town, but I found something wonderful and delightful there.

02:13:07.792 --> 02:13:13.436
[SPEAKER_09]: Apart from mochi and chocolate salt pocky.

02:13:14.397 --> 02:13:16.739
[SPEAKER_09]: They had Café du Monde Chicory Coffee.

02:13:17.539 --> 02:13:21.682
[SPEAKER_09]: The only other place I've purchased this before was in New Orleans at the Café du Monde.

02:13:21.703 --> 02:13:22.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucked up.

02:13:22.583 --> 02:13:25.124
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it just made me really homesick.

02:13:25.204 --> 02:13:29.545
[SPEAKER_09]: And the weather here today, the weird-ass weather we've been having, reminds me of Alabama.

02:13:29.585 --> 02:13:30.626
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been doubly homesick.

02:13:30.746 --> 02:13:37.968
[SPEAKER_09]: I really, really, really want to get back to Alabama and visit everybody before, you know, everything blooms and the humid hits.

02:13:39.588 --> 02:13:40.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Very sad.

02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:13:43.381 --> 02:14:01.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I guess, uh, fuck you to the people, or I should say, I think it's the California Transportation Department or something like that, for not painting lines on the freeway and scratching out, there's like four sets of scratched out lines, I don't know where the fuck the lanes are.

02:14:01.749 --> 02:14:02.429
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 on the way here, huh?

02:14:02.449 --> 02:14:02.589
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:14:02.649 --> 02:14:04.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I drive through that every day.

02:14:04.210 --> 02:14:07.031
[SPEAKER_02]: In the rain, it makes all the other lines transparent, it's just like...

02:14:07.691 --> 02:14:08.291
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll see you next time

02:14:24.722 --> 02:14:31.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming from South Sac all the way from 99 to 80 was just torture.

02:14:31.267 --> 02:14:32.587
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I get you.

02:14:32.707 --> 02:14:34.809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, I'm like, am I in the lane?

02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:36.730
[SPEAKER_02]: Which lines do I follow?

02:14:36.850 --> 02:14:37.851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.

02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:39.632
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fuck that.

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:42.994
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, our guest, do you have anything you want to give angst to?

02:14:43.574 --> 02:14:46.096
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to California weather this weekend.

02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:48.831
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a shitty weekend to visit.

02:14:48.871 --> 02:14:49.772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

02:14:51.153 --> 02:14:51.913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been rainy.

02:14:51.953 --> 02:14:53.955
[SPEAKER_04]: We drove through hail on the way up here.

02:14:54.035 --> 02:14:55.416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been windy as all hell.

02:14:55.516 --> 02:14:58.038
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fucking sunshine and beaches.

02:14:58.538 --> 02:15:00.560
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Alabama weather.

02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:02.761
[SPEAKER_04]: I left nice Colorado weather.

02:15:02.881 --> 02:15:09.066
[SPEAKER_04]: It was literally just cleaning up the day that I got on a bus and it's kind of been miserable since we got here including the actual bus trip out here.

02:15:09.474 --> 02:15:16.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, F you to the screams and God only knows what other sounds at all hours of the night in downtown San Francisco.

02:15:16.938 --> 02:15:20.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably never going to get used to that, but you know, that's pretty much it.

02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:25.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will indulge the email from earlier and I will start off tonight with a thank you.

02:15:26.143 --> 02:15:33.006
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to say thank you to the Tortilla Lady at Denio's Farmers Market because the pumpkin tortillas are amazing.

02:15:33.647 --> 02:15:35.388
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you Tortilla Lady.

02:15:36.588 --> 02:15:39.812
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the pistachio, dude, because your pistachios kind of taste like vinegar.

02:15:40.032 --> 02:15:40.573
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

02:15:42.475 --> 02:15:43.496
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious stuff, guys.

02:15:43.536 --> 02:15:44.037
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious stuff.

02:15:44.077 --> 02:15:44.317
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:15:45.138 --> 02:15:45.979
[SPEAKER_05]: More gaming news.

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Your calls are just a little bit away.

02:15:48.662 --> 02:15:49.864
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:15:49.884 --> 02:15:50.264
[SPEAKER_05]: But not yet.

02:15:50.304 --> 02:15:50.965
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have some news.

02:15:51.005 --> 02:15:51.506
[SPEAKER_05]: Some big news.

02:15:51.586 --> 02:15:51.786
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

02:15:54.413 --> 02:16:00.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about... This kind of ties in a little bit with the whole Kickstarter thing, but we'll get to that.

02:16:00.996 --> 02:16:06.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Obsidian, man, they cannot catch a break this week, or even like it looks like the past year.

02:16:06.679 --> 02:16:08.700
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's start off with Obsidian.

02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:10.220
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been hit with some layoffs.

02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:15.963
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Obsidian's working on the South Park RPG that's going to be coming out later this year.

02:16:16.283 --> 02:16:18.884
[SPEAKER_02]: They also worked on Fallout New Vegas.

02:16:19.504 --> 02:16:32.134
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and apparently they have had to let go and they've, um, lost approximately 20 to 30 people and, um, they also have another project canceled.

02:16:32.495 --> 02:16:37.419
[SPEAKER_02]: This time is supposed to be for a future next gen system, uh, which I believe is a new Xbox system.

02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:43.946
[SPEAKER_02]: and also I guess there are some people that let go.

02:16:44.106 --> 02:16:49.512
[SPEAKER_02]: One that started the day before and one that started the week before.

02:16:52.536 --> 02:16:53.897
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that kind of sucks.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:08.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they've had an Xbox Live Arcade title that they were working on, a new original IP that has been put on hold as well, and that kind of sucks.

02:17:10.918 --> 02:17:22.246
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing too, which I didn't see, well I think we'll get to it a little bit later, but they may be going to Kickstarter actually.

02:17:22.306 --> 02:17:22.926
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.

02:17:23.327 --> 02:17:29.671
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this opinion piece that was written on Kotaku and it was kind of interesting talking about...

02:17:30.311 --> 02:17:31.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

02:17:48.579 --> 02:17:50.119
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

02:18:06.884 --> 02:18:08.046
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:18:21.921 --> 02:18:24.002
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

02:18:26.142 --> 02:18:28.563
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if we will see a lot of people turning to Kickstarter.

02:18:29.043 --> 02:18:41.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially some of these companies that are like... Can you imagine if Grin, for example, started some Kickstarters for different projects that they were working on that would have been...

02:18:42.027 --> 02:18:44.809
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that new Strider game we talked about a couple weeks ago.

02:18:44.829 --> 02:18:50.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily Strider, but they could go to Kickstarter to get some of the stuff.

02:18:50.853 --> 02:18:56.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if they'd be able to pull out a Strider, but make some really awesome games.

02:18:57.438 --> 02:18:59.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they would have been able to do some of that stuff.

02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:01.941
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sucks that they're working on a lot of good stuff.

02:19:02.461 --> 02:19:02.621
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:12.391
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's one good thing I guess that Kickstarter can provide is an avenue for some of these game genres that publishers think are dead.

02:19:13.733 --> 02:19:15.655
[SPEAKER_05]: I love SSJ100Matt's idea in the chat room.

02:19:15.675 --> 02:19:18.798
[SPEAKER_05]: We should do a list list of what Kickstarter game funds we would give money to.

02:19:19.198 --> 02:19:21.060
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do that in a future episode.

02:19:23.138 --> 02:19:25.600
[SPEAKER_05]: So, kind of two different directions there.

02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Obsidian, I want to start there.

02:19:27.901 --> 02:19:29.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Good news or bad news for the South Park game?

02:19:30.543 --> 02:19:32.664
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking forward to it, and now I'm kind of like, uh-oh.

02:19:32.944 --> 02:19:36.307
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hopefully it's far along in development where these won't matter.

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:39.428
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that they have a bigger team than 20 or 30 people working on it.

02:19:39.609 --> 02:19:41.210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just programmers or developers.

02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:44.812
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just programmers, but it's just kind of across the board.

02:19:44.832 --> 02:19:46.213
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just making cuts at the company.

02:19:47.013 --> 02:19:56.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think we may touch on why they might be making cuts on that stuff in a little bit, but, uh, it's just, you know, they have to trim the fat, I guess.

02:19:57.921 --> 02:20:06.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Kickstarter, um, again, kind of like we were saying earlier, there's just, there's a lot I worry about with Kickstarter where it's just going to be too much.

02:20:06.847 --> 02:20:13.051
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to get saturated and, you know, I don't think everybody needs to get on board with it, but I like the comparison you give with Grin.

02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:13.151
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:20:13.431 --> 02:20:29.322
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now, Kickstarter, I'm not sure exactly how it works, if a project has to be fully funded or not, because that one, the guy I was referring to as the Jabba the Hutt, Reapus guy, he quoted saying that they have to make 10 grand to get money.

02:20:29.983 --> 02:20:32.505
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to basically, 10 grand is the bottom limit.

02:20:32.845 --> 02:20:38.569
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some Kickstarters for $500, though, so I don't think Kickstarter sets that.

02:20:38.609 --> 02:20:39.910
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're setting it for their project.

02:20:39.930 --> 02:20:41.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a percentage or something, I don't know.

02:20:41.491 --> 02:20:41.771
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

02:20:41.811 --> 02:20:42.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could be.

02:20:42.371 --> 02:20:44.312
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a certain percentage, depending on how much you get.

02:20:45.653 --> 02:20:45.893
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:20:45.933 --> 02:20:48.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's some more stories that somewhat tie into this.

02:20:49.394 --> 02:20:52.555
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them is this interesting piece that's out there.

02:20:53.075 --> 02:20:57.257
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a particular piece that was on YouTube.

02:20:57.857 --> 02:21:05.160
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Kotaku wrote up an article on it that basically kind of went to talking about these points about video game reviews.

02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:08.483
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Game Publishers See Game Reviewers As Marketing Tools

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's absolutely true.

02:21:26.321 --> 02:21:29.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they see game reviews as marketing tools for sure.

02:21:29.143 --> 02:21:32.466
[SPEAKER_05]: Publishers sometimes allow positive reviews to be published before negative ones.

02:21:32.586 --> 02:21:33.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

02:21:33.386 --> 02:21:39.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Publishers sometimes require game reviewers to not mention certain plot or technical details in exchange for being furnished with an advanced review copy.

02:21:39.671 --> 02:21:40.572
[SPEAKER_05]: That is fact, yes.

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:43.634
[SPEAKER_05]: Publishers might not want to advertise on an outlet that slams their game.

02:21:44.435 --> 02:21:45.416
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, that makes sense.

02:21:45.916 --> 02:21:50.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Critics are often at a loss for insightful ways of describing what they found objectionable about a game they don't like.

02:21:53.362 --> 02:21:55.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that sometimes, yeah.

02:21:55.224 --> 02:21:57.747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can too, based on the way some people react to it.

02:21:58.168 --> 02:22:00.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Reviews are banal checklists.

02:22:02.112 --> 02:22:02.532
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are.

02:22:03.894 --> 02:22:07.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially ones not written by professional gamers.

02:22:08.621 --> 02:22:35.522
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of the ones that you see and I'm not slamming every but a lot like in the community newspapers and stuff are the press release rewarded some that I've seen game reviewers may not know that they're biased but if they knew they were biased would they tell us I'm sure that they would they have to seem unbiased I think some know they are biased personally all these positive reviews from biased reviewers lead the public into accidentally playing bad games

02:22:38.209 --> 02:22:39.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

02:22:57.390 --> 02:23:02.874
[SPEAKER_02]: And because someone, once again, it's someone's opinion, just because they like it doesn't mean you're necessarily going to like it.

02:23:02.914 --> 02:23:05.976
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the Gamefly commercials and the Epic Rage?

02:23:06.157 --> 02:23:07.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it's stupid.

02:23:07.878 --> 02:23:09.519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the point they're pushing in those commercials.

02:23:09.619 --> 02:23:10.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the last one.

02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:14.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Legislators are happy when this mess results in pro-American games topping the charts.

02:23:16.925 --> 02:23:18.085
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a little much.

02:23:18.386 --> 02:23:19.566
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems a little much.

02:23:19.586 --> 02:23:21.108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the stretch bullet right there.

02:23:21.608 --> 02:23:22.809
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to pad this up to one more.

02:23:22.969 --> 02:23:23.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here goes.

02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.810
[SPEAKER_05]: Now,

02:23:29.186 --> 02:23:53.592
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that whole embargo thing is starting to get overboard and I would really only trust a site that refuses to sign them even if they get the reviews late like that's one thing I'm happy even though I don't have the time to play every game I don't do this for a living or whatever I can give you my honest opinion on games because we don't sign those and we don't get these games for free I mean very very rarely have we gotten them for free and

02:23:54.032 --> 02:23:58.574
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know we've spent our own money on them so you know we can kind of tell you from that perspective.

02:23:58.594 --> 02:24:01.154
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten like two games from publishers.

02:24:01.194 --> 02:24:16.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I'm saying OLR is the authority or that we're somehow better than all of the rest of this but I'm just saying I like that you know because there's plenty of other podcasters out there that are in the same boat and that's why I kind of like hearing the opinion of quote unquote real people when it comes to games.

02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:46.938
[SPEAKER_05]: let's also kind of take a step further there was another story this week that talked about how reviews can really be kind of screwing up the industry and that is this whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores not user Metacritic scores Metacritic scores from established critics and Obsidian was going to be I mean I'm sure a lot of you heard about this story but for Fallout New Vegas Obsidian you know it wasn't Bethesda it was Obsidian that kind of did the port of it or whatever did the you know newer New Vegas part of it

02:24:47.738 --> 02:24:57.987
[SPEAKER_05]: they would have been given a bonus if an 85 plus score was on Metacritic so if the game got an 85 plus on Metacritic they would have got a big bonus you know what it got?

02:24:58.367 --> 02:25:01.390
[SPEAKER_05]: an 84 on Metacritic and so no bonus

02:25:04.159 --> 02:25:11.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the whole thing of paying or giving incentives for good reviews just totally makes me think of the government.

02:25:11.383 --> 02:25:20.768
[SPEAKER_02]: And also here's the other thing too is Metacritic, how exactly, first off, how exactly do they, who is an authorized person?

02:25:20.808 --> 02:25:23.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is an actual site reviewer or whatever like that?

02:25:23.930 --> 02:25:27.352
[SPEAKER_02]: If we put a review on our site, is it going to show up on Metacritic?

02:25:27.632 --> 02:25:55.895
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's similar to Rotten Tomatoes where you have to have so many reviews under your belt and you have to have some type of you're either a member of an association or you have some type of degree or something I don't know I haven't looked at the rules but I did look them up for Rotten Tomatoes once and it was something like that at the time which was several years ago so that leads into discussions about why are game developer bonuses based on review scores

02:25:56.952 --> 02:25:58.152
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was about the sales.

02:25:58.513 --> 02:25:58.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:25:59.113 --> 02:26:02.854
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be about the sales because a game can totally get great reviews.

02:26:03.554 --> 02:26:07.955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad World, for example, or... I'm trying to think.

02:26:07.995 --> 02:26:10.876
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of niche games on... Pretty much.

02:26:11.176 --> 02:26:14.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look at these RPGs that are coming out on the Wii.

02:26:14.597 --> 02:26:17.638
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting great reviews, but they're not going to sell well.

02:26:18.279 --> 02:26:20.879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because it's a niche audience that it's reaching.

02:26:21.339 --> 02:26:21.820
[SPEAKER_02]: And so...

02:26:23.401 --> 02:26:25.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they basing it on reviews?

02:26:26.172 --> 02:26:29.044
[SPEAKER_02]: So a game gets good reviews, it doesn't mean people are going to buy it.

02:26:31.822 --> 02:26:54.928
[SPEAKER_05]: and lastly some news came out this week that we already kind of knew and that was this whole it was a result of the fact I don't know if you guys heard but Giant Bomb got bought by CBS Interactive which owns GameSpot the ironic thing about that is that one of the big personalities that kind of started Giant Bomb Jeff Gerstmann well he made Giant Bomb because he had to leave GameSpot they basically sat him in a room and fired him why did they fire him

02:26:55.328 --> 02:27:22.758
[SPEAKER_05]: at the time a lot of people were saying it's because he gave Kane and Lynch a bad review and you know they were big sponsors of the site at the time and sure enough it came out that it wasn't specifically the Kane and Lynch review because another thing was referenced about the Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction review from Sony but basically GameSpot's editorial management basically sat him down and said that he couldn't be trusted as an editorial director

02:27:24.147 --> 02:27:36.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't be trusted with the people that are paying for ads on their site That's absolutely ridiculous and completely unfair Now, who is to blame at the end of the day for this whole cycle?

02:27:36.953 --> 02:27:37.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is to blame?

02:27:38.634 --> 02:27:40.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Corporations You

02:27:42.316 --> 02:27:55.281
[SPEAKER_05]: you are to blame if you've ever filled out a comment or a survey thing that said why did you buy this game review from what website if you did that you are partially to blame

02:27:57.721 --> 02:27:58.642
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've ever done that.

02:27:58.922 --> 02:27:59.663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

02:28:00.384 --> 02:28:05.207
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I'm saying it in a way that's going to catch people off guard a little bit, but I want you to really think about that.

02:28:05.568 --> 02:28:10.412
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why else do the companies feel like they can get away with this?

02:28:11.212 --> 02:28:16.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we as the users have to kind of rise up and demand more transparency.

02:28:17.097 --> 02:28:25.824
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to support sites that will not support embargoes and this stuff and not let the publishers do the talking.

02:28:26.084 --> 02:28:28.985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's practically the same thing as lobbying, you know.

02:28:29.525 --> 02:28:30.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

02:28:30.486 --> 02:28:36.768
[SPEAKER_09]: Or politicians who take sponsorships from major corporations.

02:28:36.928 --> 02:28:38.769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same thing.

02:28:38.949 --> 02:28:41.970
[SPEAKER_09]: They're basically getting paid, so of course they're going to put in a good word.

02:28:42.511 --> 02:28:50.134
[SPEAKER_09]: Or in the case of the politics analogy, they're going to lean their vote towards the interest of the people they're lining their pockets with.

02:28:52.609 --> 02:28:55.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Support independent radio websites.

02:28:57.578 --> 02:28:58.199
[SPEAKER_05]: I really mean it.

02:28:59.221 --> 02:29:01.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this kind of stuff is only going to continue.

02:29:01.485 --> 02:29:02.527
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't vote partisan.

02:29:05.831 --> 02:29:06.151
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:29:07.332 --> 02:29:07.992
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

02:29:08.352 --> 02:29:09.013
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I have anything else?

02:29:09.133 --> 02:29:12.134
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got all the little pieces of that story because there was quite a bit there.

02:29:12.434 --> 02:29:12.634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:29:13.935 --> 02:29:14.755
[SPEAKER_09]: How about something happy?

02:29:14.835 --> 02:29:15.756
[SPEAKER_05]: How about something happy?

02:29:16.296 --> 02:29:16.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:29:16.716 --> 02:29:19.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure I've made it no secret that I am a huge fan of Cracked.

02:29:20.678 --> 02:29:21.599
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Cracked.com.

02:29:22.379 --> 02:29:27.400
[SPEAKER_09]: and they actually posted an article that really made me stop and look at it that I wanted to share with everybody.

02:29:28.061 --> 02:29:30.401
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, so full credit to Cracked for this.

02:29:30.581 --> 02:29:32.962
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, you know, not trying to step on toes.

02:29:32.982 --> 02:29:37.303
[SPEAKER_09]: So this goes to Mike Cooney, Eddie Rodriguez and Steve Hanley who wrote the article.

02:29:38.063 --> 02:29:38.423
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out.

02:29:39.024 --> 02:29:40.024
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying because it was really good.

02:29:40.384 --> 02:29:43.385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six acts of real life heroism made possible by video games.

02:29:43.965 --> 02:29:44.406
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:29:59.688 --> 02:30:10.121
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an autistic, it says, a Canadian teenager made the news after helping an autistic youth online who was showing serious signs of depression to the point of hitting it's suicide.

02:30:10.842 --> 02:30:18.532
[SPEAKER_09]: So, he didn't know where he lived, only had his gamertag, but he contacted the police and contacted the kid over Xbox Live and they talked him down.

02:30:19.301 --> 02:30:19.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:30:20.061 --> 02:30:22.322
[SPEAKER_09]: Just showing concern for another human being.

02:30:23.122 --> 02:30:26.702
[SPEAKER_05]: And... I don't... That's a good thing out of Xbox Live?

02:30:26.722 --> 02:30:27.662
[SPEAKER_05]: That's astounding.

02:30:27.822 --> 02:30:29.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's more on that, too.

02:30:29.643 --> 02:30:31.083
[SPEAKER_09]: His parents didn't even know.

02:30:31.863 --> 02:30:32.103
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:30:32.163 --> 02:30:34.904
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone who lived 1,500 miles away noticed.

02:30:35.784 --> 02:30:47.686
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's another sign, too, that you basically... I don't think in a lot of cases, you know, once your kid's out and going to school, I don't think parents really know their kids as well as they think they might, not in the ways that I think...

02:30:49.386 --> 02:30:50.467
[SPEAKER_09]: They can really relate to.

02:30:50.867 --> 02:30:53.148
[SPEAKER_09]: Not as much as somebody within their own peer group.

02:30:53.428 --> 02:30:53.848
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

02:30:54.848 --> 02:30:57.349
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that someone needs to be careful and look at all the signs.

02:30:57.810 --> 02:30:59.010
[SPEAKER_09]: You put yourself in their shoes.

02:31:00.090 --> 02:31:03.011
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this one I thought was really neat.

02:31:03.031 --> 02:31:03.972
[SPEAKER_09]: This is that Ebony game.

02:31:05.092 --> 02:31:06.233
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I kind of scoff at the game.

02:31:06.313 --> 02:31:09.354
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a guy with muscular dystrophy.

02:31:10.274 --> 02:31:17.638
[SPEAKER_09]: who his house caught on fire while he was playing a game and he couldn't get out safely because he had muscular dystrophy.

02:31:17.738 --> 02:31:18.779
[SPEAKER_09]: He was wheelchair bound.

02:31:19.739 --> 02:31:26.603
[SPEAKER_09]: And his friends in the game called the police department and the fire department and helped him get out of his house.

02:31:27.024 --> 02:31:27.224
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

02:31:28.024 --> 02:31:29.065
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's that.

02:31:29.585 --> 02:31:33.326
[SPEAKER_09]: This one, this is the number five on the list that I thought was pretty cool.

02:31:34.327 --> 02:31:38.668
[SPEAKER_09]: A guy who had been playing Medal of Modern Warfare.

02:31:38.809 --> 02:31:39.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, never mind.

02:31:39.949 --> 02:31:41.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Medal of Modern Warfare?

02:31:41.129 --> 02:31:45.291
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the little name that they came up with, but he had actually been playing America's Army.

02:31:45.931 --> 02:31:46.632
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:31:46.912 --> 02:31:51.794
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched the medic training on that one, and it's pretty... Well, it's an army recruitment game.

02:31:51.814 --> 02:31:52.174
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

02:31:52.234 --> 02:31:53.134
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, yeah.

02:31:53.755 --> 02:31:56.456
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, but he... What happened is that...

02:31:58.176 --> 02:32:06.040
[SPEAKER_09]: He had encountered a car crash where someone in an SUV flipped upside down and the car was spewing smoke.

02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:12.823
[SPEAKER_09]: And he actually used the medic training from the game to help the guy.

02:32:12.843 --> 02:32:18.085
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the person in the accident lost like two fingers and was gushing blood from his head.

02:32:19.306 --> 02:32:23.788
[SPEAKER_09]: And he bandaged the hand, raised it above his head to stop the bleeding and bandaged the guy's head.

02:32:24.488 --> 02:32:26.449
[SPEAKER_09]: And contacted EMT.

02:32:28.636 --> 02:32:33.981
[SPEAKER_09]: All from knowing, and he credited it to the medical training in America's Army.

02:32:34.341 --> 02:32:34.601
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

02:32:35.162 --> 02:32:37.644
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then this one was actually pretty cool.

02:32:37.664 --> 02:32:39.246
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a World of Warcraft one, so this one.

02:32:39.366 --> 02:32:40.467
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was immediately drafted.

02:32:40.847 --> 02:32:41.247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

02:32:41.828 --> 02:32:45.331
[SPEAKER_09]: This one, this one hits a little close, because you'll know what I'm talking about.

02:32:45.371 --> 02:32:45.852
[SPEAKER_05]: A little glimped?

02:32:46.112 --> 02:32:46.332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:32:47.373 --> 02:32:51.777
[SPEAKER_09]: A 12-year-old Norwegian boy was walking with his sister and got attacked by a moose.

02:32:53.889 --> 02:32:56.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghostcrawler promised me a moose

02:33:12.273 --> 02:33:13.754
[SPEAKER_09]: and he credited it to World of Warcraft.

02:33:14.574 --> 02:33:16.435
[SPEAKER_05]: To taunt and feign death.

02:33:16.695 --> 02:33:19.777
[SPEAKER_09]: He said if you've got... Well, now, hunters can't taunt.

02:33:20.157 --> 02:33:20.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me finish.

02:33:20.817 --> 02:33:22.778
[SPEAKER_09]: This damn kid doesn't know what he's talking about.

02:33:22.979 --> 02:33:23.639
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me finish.

02:33:24.579 --> 02:33:26.460
[SPEAKER_09]: But he said basically is that...

02:33:28.141 --> 02:33:49.536
[SPEAKER_09]: his brain translated it as aggro and it was an aggressive animal so he grabbed its attention because an aggressive animal is going to go to the thing making the biggest noise the biggest threat and then he said he played dead he feigned death and the moose sniffed at him nudged him and walked off left him and his sister alone

02:33:52.264 --> 02:33:52.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty neat.

02:33:54.205 --> 02:34:04.709
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other ones on here, now those are like the big three for me on these because the other ones are about how they're helping stroke victims recover by improving hand-eye coordination.

02:34:05.749 --> 02:34:10.491
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one here about a web browser game that people have used to discover two planets.

02:34:12.411 --> 02:34:13.951
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see if I can't get the name of this called.

02:34:14.952 --> 02:34:19.692
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Planet Hunters, which basically teaches them to use monitor light emissions.

02:34:20.973 --> 02:34:25.333
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll do a certain thing when a planet crosses through a particular star's path.

02:34:25.953 --> 02:34:28.374
[SPEAKER_09]: And players have discovered two planets that way.

02:34:30.174 --> 02:34:33.995
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one on here about helping stroke victims recover.

02:34:34.335 --> 02:34:37.135
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them got really excited, but it turned out it was just Pluto.

02:34:39.756 --> 02:34:40.176
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

02:34:42.452 --> 02:34:45.114
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I'll be here all week.

02:34:46.074 --> 02:35:01.504
[SPEAKER_09]: They used the skills of a 14-year-old boy who invented a procedure, this is for a science fair project, of using a controller to do internal stitches where you'd have to use a robot for it.

02:35:02.405 --> 02:35:07.048
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you kind of have that with Kinect, if the Windows commercials are to be believed.

02:35:07.671 --> 02:35:12.717
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was, it said using a surgical device called an endostitch.

02:35:13.899 --> 02:35:17.503
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's used to sew up patients after a hysterectomy.

02:35:18.604 --> 02:35:22.729
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was using that same procedure, only with a video game controller.

02:35:23.130 --> 02:35:23.250
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

02:35:24.211 --> 02:35:24.932
[SPEAKER_09]: for medical purposes.

02:35:25.172 --> 02:35:27.674
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to go back to the first three that I listed.

02:35:28.134 --> 02:35:34.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are, instead of just applying what you know from video games, those are saving people's lives.

02:35:34.559 --> 02:35:44.586
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when you have a bear come in your thing, you're told to play dead, but he specifically said that he needed to taunt the aggro away.

02:35:44.746 --> 02:35:45.446
[SPEAKER_05]: From his sister, yeah.

02:35:45.466 --> 02:35:45.607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:35:49.449 --> 02:36:03.255
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a case when I was playing PSO where I actually got really sick and was given some advice from just a random person in there who happened to be an EMT.

02:36:04.455 --> 02:36:04.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

02:36:29.876 --> 02:36:45.121
[SPEAKER_09]: and I watched the video it's actually I've had emergency training before and it's more in depth than what I did in my first aid classes so I'm just pretty amazed that I mean what do you think of I wanted to bring this up because

02:36:45.521 --> 02:36:47.982
[SPEAKER_09]: People say, oh, video games make you violent.

02:36:48.062 --> 02:36:50.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, obviously, I know that that's not true.

02:36:50.343 --> 02:36:52.284
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I've heard of some of these good things before.

02:36:52.364 --> 02:36:54.745
[SPEAKER_05]: There's sometimes a dark side to these MMOs.

02:36:55.225 --> 02:36:58.826
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we heard about the kid kidnapped across state lines and all that.

02:36:58.966 --> 02:37:05.369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to hear some of the good stuff, too, about how technology, I think it's more technology is saving lives.

02:37:05.589 --> 02:37:08.270
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, gaming is that technology, some of it.

02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:10.491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

02:37:10.671 --> 02:37:12.711
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you argue with the good news here?

02:37:12.791 --> 02:37:14.052
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's good stuff.

02:37:14.939 --> 02:37:27.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really wish that more mainstream news sources would really focus more on advertising stuff like this instead of just finding sensationalist stories that give everybody a bad name.

02:37:28.146 --> 02:37:29.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of supporting independent media.

02:37:30.748 --> 02:37:33.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

02:37:34.090 --> 02:37:35.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, stutter-tastic.

02:37:35.851 --> 02:37:45.798
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of thing, it's exactly the kind of thing you want to hear because it's people that are applying any kind of knowledge that's at least rooted in some kind of truth.

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have a weird association.

02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:51.202
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned about it from a video game.

02:37:51.522 --> 02:37:52.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Big deal.

02:37:52.823 --> 02:37:54.445
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you've learned.

02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:58.348
[SPEAKER_04]: They did something fantastic with a little bit of knowledge bestowed upon them.

02:37:58.448 --> 02:38:00.470
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I actually did learn how to drive through Ridge Racer.

02:38:03.852 --> 02:38:19.045
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that you say that because when I was starting to get towards the age of learning driving, about to go to driving school, my grandpa, one of my grandpas, would give me a hard time because I would talk about driving video games.

02:38:19.105 --> 02:38:19.526
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like,

02:38:21.146 --> 02:38:28.769
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I probably went a little bit above and beyond in a sense that I don't want to... I think I may have one time said, I don't want to drive.

02:38:29.729 --> 02:38:32.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games can't kill you, so I would rather do that instead.

02:38:32.971 --> 02:38:37.312
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I went in there and I wasn't scared of driving.

02:38:39.053 --> 02:38:39.933
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't new to me.

02:38:39.993 --> 02:38:42.294
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in my parents' car plenty of times.

02:38:43.534 --> 02:38:44.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you pick up things like this.

02:38:45.535 --> 02:38:45.715
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

02:38:45.735 --> 02:38:45.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

02:39:10.815 --> 02:39:17.299
[SPEAKER_09]: You can ask Ranma about that when I managed to make that turn off off the Bay Bridge to going to Treasure Island in my Lancer and drifted.

02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:19.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

02:39:19.921 --> 02:39:21.762
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get to calls so we have some time for calls.

02:39:22.202 --> 02:39:22.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, quickly.

02:39:23.453 --> 02:39:24.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will be super quick.

02:39:25.914 --> 02:39:30.215
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk a little bit about Peter Molino.

02:39:30.235 --> 02:39:34.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not Peter Molino per se, but Peter Molido.

02:39:35.556 --> 02:39:42.738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the parody account that's on Twitter that comes up with all these weird game ideas.

02:39:42.978 --> 02:39:47.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, you can troll a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during winter.

02:39:47.759 --> 02:39:51.800
[SPEAKER_02]: You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses.

02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.561
[SPEAKER_05]: So similar to the OLR Dream Games.

02:39:53.881 --> 02:39:54.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

02:39:54.862 --> 02:39:56.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really weird stuff.

02:39:57.103 --> 02:39:57.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the funny thing.

02:39:59.124 --> 02:40:09.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has convinced him that he should do a Game Jam where independent developers out there will create games based on these crazy ideas.

02:40:10.029 --> 02:40:11.090
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's going to happen.

02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:15.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Molly Jam 2012 is set to run, I guess, March 31st through April 1st.

02:40:21.535 --> 02:40:26.658
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually a few cities, San Francisco and Brighton.

02:40:27.299 --> 02:40:38.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that has expanded to now a few more cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Melbourne and New York.

02:40:40.227 --> 02:40:51.231
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, what's even more interesting about that is Peter Molyneux is actually going to join in on this as well, now that he's got some free time.

02:40:52.312 --> 02:40:54.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for him having a sense of humor about the whole thing.

02:40:54.373 --> 02:40:56.254
[SPEAKER_02]: And, actually, it's kind of funny.

02:40:56.694 --> 02:41:03.257
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ideas, like, for example, there was a post by the Peter Molyneux that said,

02:41:04.217 --> 02:41:10.722
[SPEAKER_02]: My first mobile game will be free, but if you pay a little, then the NPCs will be extra nice and compliment you more while playing.

02:41:11.083 --> 02:41:14.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Molina responds, that's not a bad idea, actually.

02:41:14.545 --> 02:41:17.267
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, just like, you know, funny things like that.

02:41:17.528 --> 02:41:20.290
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one's another funny one.

02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:24.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment.

02:41:24.333 --> 02:41:28.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Your baby would act as a torch, rocking the baby intensifies the glow, etc.

02:41:28.816 --> 02:41:29.357
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like.

02:41:30.037 --> 02:41:33.999
[SPEAKER_08]: That just makes me think of the crying scene from Max Payne.

02:41:35.959 --> 02:41:47.144
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole thing is, you know, he has these really weird ideas, but there's actually some funny ones that he came up with, like the bullying, the RPG or whatever that had bullying as, you know, the combat system or something like that.

02:41:47.624 --> 02:41:50.845
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're going to make some of these things, including that rabbit one.

02:41:50.885 --> 02:41:52.106
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have a video of that.

02:41:52.786 --> 02:41:57.468
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, there's actually some people that are, you know, interested in doing that.

02:42:02.793 --> 02:42:05.015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's any other really big guys.

02:42:05.635 --> 02:42:13.864
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind it right now, the organizers, Anna Kipnis, Brandon Sheffield, Patrick Klepek, which I think he was from Joystick.

02:42:14.865 --> 02:42:41.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Joe Kowalski, and Edward Paris so it's interesting and of course if you're interested in this you can check out well you can follow or check out Vox Games or you can follow I think they've got a website for this already let's see here

02:42:41.747 --> 02:42:45.010
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some people that are participating in this, so it's going to be fun.

02:42:45.671 --> 02:42:47.292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:42:47.953 --> 02:43:01.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, you can check the fake Twitter account for... It's PeterMollyDeux, P-E-T-E-R-M-O-L-Y-D-E-U-X.

02:43:02.285 --> 02:43:06.589
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a Google Docs page, but you can just look it up.

02:43:06.909 --> 02:43:07.029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

02:43:09.326 --> 02:43:10.867
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Jams Fun Time.

02:43:11.967 --> 02:43:12.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun times.

02:43:13.808 --> 02:43:16.149
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, check it out.

02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:20.852
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you know, I think they're going to be adding like an actual web page and stuff for this at some point.

02:43:22.272 --> 02:43:22.752
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:43:22.812 --> 02:43:24.933
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more story for you guys.

02:43:25.054 --> 02:43:31.637
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to make this real quick because this is something that has been going around for forever and just will not go away.

02:43:31.697 --> 02:43:34.418
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is that there is no new Xbox this year at E3.

02:43:34.518 --> 02:43:38.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have sworn this was already reported on, but it made the rounds on the gaming blogs again this week.

02:43:39.340 --> 02:44:02.476
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks that are close to, I guess, Bloomberg are insisting that Microsoft's going to introduce a new console in 2013 It'll be at E3 next year But Bloomberg Magazine was told by David Dennis, who's a group manager of PR at Xbox 2012 is all about the Xbox 360, so stop the rumors There will be no slick new Xbox Lube until 2013 There you go

02:44:04.998 --> 02:44:05.498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the final word.

02:44:05.518 --> 02:44:05.899
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it makes sense.

02:44:05.919 --> 02:44:07.239
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got stuff to show off this year.

02:44:07.399 --> 02:44:08.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year will be when they unveil it.

02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:09.361
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:44:09.461 --> 02:44:10.481
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to open the phones.

02:44:10.561 --> 02:44:11.242
[SPEAKER_05]: So call now.

02:44:11.262 --> 02:44:15.104
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:15.124 --> 02:44:19.306
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:19.666 --> 02:44:20.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, that's fast.

02:44:20.447 --> 02:44:21.367
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already lighting up.

02:44:21.467 --> 02:44:22.088
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a call.

02:44:22.708 --> 02:44:23.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:23.669 --> 02:44:24.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:44:24.589 --> 02:44:25.290
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Shane.

02:44:25.410 --> 02:44:26.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're fast.

02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:27.811
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when we're going to open it up.

02:44:27.851 --> 02:44:28.171
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

02:44:28.271 --> 02:44:28.531
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

02:44:28.611 --> 02:44:31.013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I was given advanced warning or something.

02:44:31.033 --> 02:44:31.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

02:44:31.753 --> 02:44:32.374
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:32.394 --> 02:44:33.134
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want to talk about?

02:44:33.979 --> 02:44:36.622
[SPEAKER_07]: What do I normally talk about?

02:44:37.123 --> 02:44:52.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect Yes, that is my second best favorite thing in the world so let's talk about that Okay, since you're pissed off that I didn't give you credit for getting me into Mass Effect which was basically that you were pouting and whining and crying and threatening not to be my friend anymore unless I would play Mass Effect

02:44:53.499 --> 02:44:54.460
[SPEAKER_07]: which that's a lie.

02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:58.742
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I just bombarded you with me talking about it.

02:44:58.962 --> 02:45:00.703
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there was pouting or crying.

02:45:01.203 --> 02:45:01.984
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a little bit.

02:45:02.204 --> 02:45:04.265
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to convince Jamie that she should play it too.

02:45:04.565 --> 02:45:06.986
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, it'll change your life.

02:45:07.267 --> 02:45:10.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy me a copy.

02:45:10.088 --> 02:45:10.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, please.

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:14.210
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm broke.

02:45:14.631 --> 02:45:16.852
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pressed for time tonight, so what do you want to say about Mass Effect?

02:45:17.475 --> 02:45:35.855
[SPEAKER_07]: well as I sit here just exiting out of Mass Effect 1 that I was just playing and in my N7 t-shirt I would probably like to say that I am on the side of the retake Mass Effect 3 movement which is give us a different ending

02:45:36.055 --> 02:45:36.995
[SPEAKER_05]: No, why?

02:45:37.196 --> 02:45:39.377
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't go to the government, did you?

02:45:39.817 --> 02:45:41.177
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not stupid.

02:45:41.197 --> 02:45:42.778
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined a Facebook group.

02:45:42.838 --> 02:45:46.320
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's activism of the 21st century.

02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:48.421
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so at least you're not totally crazy.

02:45:48.461 --> 02:45:49.501
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in the singing crowd.

02:45:49.821 --> 02:45:53.143
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so without spoiling, why is the ending pissing everybody off?

02:45:53.923 --> 02:46:06.734
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty much for the reason... Well, the good reason that it's making everybody angry is that, like you said earlier, everything you've done up until the last 10 minutes of the game does not matter based on these endings.

02:46:08.335 --> 02:46:10.417
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care if it's not a happy ending.

02:46:10.938 --> 02:46:20.406
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really expect it to be happy endings, but I expect an actual ending that makes sense, not some Matrix crap or something stupid like that.

02:46:23.029 --> 02:46:46.234
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm also part of the group of people that believe one of the endings that you get if you do really well with all the extra stuff in the game you get like an extra 10 seconds and that leads to this entirely different theory about all the endings and that this one that you may consider bad is actually leading up to a real ending that they have not given us yet.

02:46:46.474 --> 02:46:49.216
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will pay for DLC if they do it.

02:46:49.377 --> 02:46:52.139
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the point of joining the Facebook group?

02:46:52.219 --> 02:46:52.960
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want?

02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:54.281
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want out of all this?

02:46:54.581 --> 02:46:57.183
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a DLC ending.

02:46:57.844 --> 02:47:03.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I could see if somebody's not invested in the series, the ending's probably fine for them.

02:47:04.570 --> 02:47:10.875
[SPEAKER_07]: But seeing as how I really like everything about the story and my Shepard's journey...

02:47:12.636 --> 02:47:33.603
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't end it like they kind of promised they would and I'm not going to be like I'll never buy one of your games again but I will be like I'll pay for DLC for you guys to make it right do you think that you should have to do that though do you feel like maybe you're being exploited a little bit for your money because you're so into this

02:47:34.764 --> 02:47:35.965
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think so.

02:47:36.265 --> 02:47:38.327
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they just had a screw up.

02:47:38.587 --> 02:47:38.967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

02:47:39.888 --> 02:47:41.409
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading what a sick vampire says.

02:47:41.469 --> 02:47:46.253
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just ignoring it because that part doesn't matter in 1 and 2.

02:47:46.613 --> 02:47:55.400
[SPEAKER_07]: When you end a trilogy and they promise that everything you've done up until the point is going to shape your game and it doesn't, that's where it's stupid.

02:47:57.261 --> 02:48:01.542
[SPEAKER_05]: But complaining to the government over it's pretty stupid too, you gotta admit.

02:48:01.682 --> 02:48:04.683
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I definitely agree with that.

02:48:04.743 --> 02:48:07.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you sure there's never going to be another Mass Effect game?

02:48:08.504 --> 02:48:17.726
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, again, who knows what BioWare is really thinking sometimes, but they said if they ever did another game, it would not take place after 3.

02:48:17.966 --> 02:48:19.906
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to take place before or during 3.

02:48:19.946 --> 02:48:20.006
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

02:48:22.307 --> 02:48:22.687
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:48:22.988 --> 02:48:30.134
[SPEAKER_07]: For a game like this, I don't understand why I'd want to play something that takes place before the Mass Effect 1 through 3.

02:48:30.854 --> 02:48:36.479
[SPEAKER_07]: And I definitely don't want to play something that takes place during 3 unless it's just extra DLC for 3.

02:48:37.460 --> 02:48:45.847
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I can't see them doing a 4 that takes place after 3, especially with what the endings do right now, currently.

02:48:45.867 --> 02:48:46.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

02:48:46.187 --> 02:48:47.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, I gotta wrap up to get more calls.

02:48:47.888 --> 02:48:49.208
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other thoughts you want to get in there?

02:48:50.249 --> 02:48:52.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I had one and then I forgot it.

02:48:53.770 --> 02:48:55.011
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I forgot it.

02:48:55.411 --> 02:48:55.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang it.

02:48:56.031 --> 02:48:58.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Write it down for next week.

02:48:59.333 --> 02:48:59.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, whatever.

02:49:00.862 --> 02:49:02.824
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Alan beat Mass Effect 1 if you didn't hear it.

02:49:02.844 --> 02:49:06.187
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I talked to him on Life Journal about it.

02:49:06.367 --> 02:49:08.729
[SPEAKER_05]: I better let you go so we can get more calls.

02:49:09.769 --> 02:49:11.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

02:49:11.271 --> 02:49:13.833
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

02:49:13.853 --> 02:49:15.074
[SPEAKER_05]: You're laughing over there, Jason.

02:49:16.835 --> 02:49:19.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what's happening.

02:49:19.477 --> 02:49:21.038
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the conversation around you.

02:49:21.078 --> 02:49:21.639
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another call.

02:49:21.679 --> 02:49:22.600
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:22.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

02:49:23.666 --> 02:49:24.066
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?

02:49:24.086 --> 02:49:25.327
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Xenocore from the OKC.

02:49:25.367 --> 02:49:25.787
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

02:49:25.887 --> 02:49:27.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm good, Xenocore.

02:49:27.188 --> 02:49:29.149
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea about that 80s music, by the way.

02:49:29.209 --> 02:49:30.830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for setting me straight on that.

02:49:31.370 --> 02:49:32.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

02:49:32.091 --> 02:49:34.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I see something, I just don't forget it, and it's stuck in my head.

02:49:35.033 --> 02:49:35.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn videos.

02:49:36.333 --> 02:49:36.774
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all good.

02:49:36.834 --> 02:49:37.154
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

02:49:37.214 --> 02:49:39.795
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we owe the phone call to tonight?

02:49:40.476 --> 02:49:48.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I only caught the second part of the previous caller, but as far as the ending in Mass Effect, it's just piss poor.

02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:49.241
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, literally.

02:49:49.881 --> 02:49:52.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioware's written much better content than that.

02:49:53.809 --> 02:49:55.111
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:50:12.455 --> 02:50:13.316
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:50:41.061 --> 02:50:44.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you pay for a product that's been trashed already?

02:50:44.864 --> 02:50:48.526
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give me another $10, I'll actually finish it and put it together for you.

02:50:49.047 --> 02:50:49.287
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:50:49.707 --> 02:50:52.769
[SPEAKER_03]: If it said some assembly required, that's the way you're selling it.

02:50:52.809 --> 02:50:54.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it worked for Bethesda.

02:50:55.611 --> 02:50:56.192
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

02:50:56.472 --> 02:50:58.754
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying they're not going to make money if they do that either.

02:50:58.794 --> 02:51:03.877
[SPEAKER_03]: That product was so good in 1 and 2, it's almost guaranteed to make money what they'll see.

02:51:04.097 --> 02:51:04.678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's guaranteed.

02:51:06.091 --> 02:51:07.392
[SPEAKER_03]: People are already asking for it.

02:51:07.432 --> 02:51:08.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me DLC.

02:51:08.312 --> 02:51:09.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Just finish the story the way we want.

02:51:10.033 --> 02:51:10.994
[SPEAKER_03]: So they probably will.

02:51:11.014 --> 02:51:12.895
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll charge $10 and they'll get their money.

02:51:13.835 --> 02:51:14.236
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

02:51:14.496 --> 02:51:16.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane is sending me a private message with this comment.

02:51:16.577 --> 02:51:18.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you want to respond to this.

02:51:18.138 --> 02:51:18.478
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

02:51:18.898 --> 02:51:24.061
[SPEAKER_05]: He says the other thing he forgot was it's about the precedent it sets demanding DLC endings.

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:28.443
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, how even though it had a terrible ending, it didn't ruin the journey or the game.

02:51:28.944 --> 02:51:31.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the ending ruin Mass Effect for you?

02:51:33.253 --> 02:51:37.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching a roomie play it, and it guaranteed I'm not buying it in Mass Effect 3.

02:51:38.102 --> 02:51:38.382
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

02:51:38.442 --> 02:51:40.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you just kind of saw it through somebody else.

02:51:40.383 --> 02:51:40.844
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's okay.

02:51:40.884 --> 02:51:50.289
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly you can get... Well, I mean, I saw enough of stuff on the internet without seeing all the trailers to know that if I got to that ending... Because the game isn't that difficult.

02:51:50.769 --> 02:51:58.233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the ending of Rygar to where getting to the ending is the feat itself because the game's so damn hard, few people actually see it.

02:51:58.453 --> 02:52:01.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to use the Sopranos comparison again, I didn't watch the whole series.

02:52:02.055 --> 02:52:04.637
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw an episode or two, but even I know the ending of that sucked.

02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:06.571
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

02:52:07.451 --> 02:52:08.753
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect the way they did it.

02:52:09.714 --> 02:52:15.379
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if it's not so much the endings they provided, it's just the way they came to those endings.

02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:19.083
[SPEAKER_03]: The user has no, half the work you do is erased.

02:52:19.827 --> 02:52:22.648
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I never play video games to completion, ever, ever.

02:52:22.768 --> 02:52:31.512
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I beat Mass Effect 3, that's a big if, but if I beat Mass Effect 3, that in itself is going to be like a noteworthy thing for the journal, you know?

02:52:31.572 --> 02:52:33.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I beat a video game.

02:52:34.574 --> 02:52:38.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my ADD usually kicks in 20 hours before this point.

02:52:40.356 --> 02:52:43.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Some point I will finish Final Fantasy XIII too, I swear.

02:52:44.818 --> 02:52:45.218
[SPEAKER_05]: Squirrel!

02:52:45.618 --> 02:52:46.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in my case.

02:52:47.778 --> 02:52:49.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't finish seven, because speaking of shit endings.

02:52:54.442 --> 02:52:57.164
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, BioWare trolled you all.

02:52:58.100 --> 02:52:59.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Did BioWare troll us, Xenocore?

02:53:00.181 --> 02:53:01.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

02:53:02.603 --> 02:53:05.045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm convinced something must have happened corporate-wise.

02:53:05.085 --> 02:53:07.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they ran out of time and they rushed the ending.

02:53:07.927 --> 02:53:11.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Something smells fishy as far as the development to why the game is the way it is.

02:53:11.729 --> 02:53:15.712
[SPEAKER_05]: If the DLC conspiracies is true, then EA trolled us all.

02:53:16.152 --> 02:53:17.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

02:53:17.713 --> 02:53:19.274
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not too far-fetched either.

02:53:19.955 --> 02:53:20.235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:53:20.475 --> 02:53:21.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Xenocore, anything else before we let you go?

02:53:22.997 --> 02:53:23.457
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's it.

02:53:23.657 --> 02:53:24.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll take it easy.

02:53:24.298 --> 02:53:24.838
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you too.

02:53:24.878 --> 02:53:25.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

02:53:25.498 --> 02:53:26.379
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, bye.

02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:31.957
[SPEAKER_05]: 877-GAME-OLR username on Skype chat username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio

02:53:35.177 --> 02:53:36.238
[SPEAKER_05]: You're having a fun night, Rob.

02:53:36.258 --> 02:53:39.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having like the burpiest night in the history of OLR.

02:53:40.460 --> 02:53:41.161
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I eat?

02:53:41.901 --> 02:53:45.984
[SPEAKER_05]: I had Mongolian barbecue because I took to a new place.

02:53:46.004 --> 02:53:49.066
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a new place downtown called Mongo Mongo.

02:53:50.226 --> 02:53:50.847
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to go there.

02:53:51.107 --> 02:53:51.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you do.

02:53:51.847 --> 02:53:52.168
It was good.

02:53:52.468 --> 02:53:52.788
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:53:53.528 --> 02:53:54.209
[SPEAKER_05]: One more call.

02:53:54.769 --> 02:53:55.330
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to be fast.

02:53:55.350 --> 02:53:56.931
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Sky.

02:53:56.951 --> 02:53:57.471
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?

02:53:57.511 --> 02:53:59.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Zaku.

02:53:59.092 --> 02:53:59.832
[SPEAKER_05]: You got through.

02:53:59.912 --> 02:54:00.573
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, buddy?

02:54:01.252 --> 02:54:02.453
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a long time.

02:54:02.473 --> 02:54:05.394
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I've actually called this year so far.

02:54:05.454 --> 02:54:07.275
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have done it in January, but yeah.

02:54:07.755 --> 02:54:26.145
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just touching back on what you mentioned already with Tim Shaver and Kickstarter and just all these developers that are basically these video game shops that apparently, because of the way the business works...

02:54:27.936 --> 02:54:32.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Sourcing out to Kickstarter might open new avenues, but at the same time,

02:54:33.354 --> 02:54:44.401
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks the mold of the way that whole video game industry has switched in the past 15 or so years.

02:54:45.002 --> 02:54:50.526
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the days of NES and Super Nintendo, it wasn't really about pumping out sequels that quickly.

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:55.429
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about creating games that would be memorable and that would just be pushing the envelope.

02:54:55.989 --> 02:55:01.053
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, you have companies like Activision and to an extent EA just thinking with a short sight.

02:55:03.394 --> 02:55:06.196
[SPEAKER_01]: in other words taking a franchise and just milking it out

02:55:22.908 --> 02:55:23.909
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about a quick turnaround.

02:55:23.929 --> 02:55:29.096
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are exceptions, but you also have to take in the ones that I've grown up in my childhood.

02:55:29.856 --> 02:55:36.164
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like Super Mario World, the Sonic series, even the first early titles of the PlayStation.

02:55:36.244 --> 02:55:42.351
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were groundbreaking in the sense that they pushed the game styles into a different direction.

02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:49.258
[SPEAKER_01]: Then nowadays you have companies like Activision, for example, that only live by the quarter.

02:55:49.298 --> 02:55:55.143
[SPEAKER_01]: They milk Call of Duty and they see it as something where they can make money in the short term.

02:55:55.323 --> 02:55:56.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Milking is destroyed.

02:55:56.444 --> 02:56:04.191
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the bean counter perspective comes into the industry, which so far has been a fixture of it for quite a while now.

02:56:05.132 --> 02:56:07.975
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, instead of actual video game developers...

02:56:09.736 --> 02:56:35.675
[SPEAKER_01]: brainstorming ideas you have like you have the suits for example that just do you know they have research and they have numbers in which they can create you know facts out of anything as a means of creating ideas in which they can you know they can milk milking franchises though like Guitar Hero was destroyed by the milking you know like so it hasn't always been successful the whole rhythm music game genre is pretty much on its last throes because of that

02:56:36.155 --> 02:56:42.662
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until Guitar Hero that after it went mainstream it basically fizzled out.

02:56:43.123 --> 02:56:50.070
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything before that time, during when Konami still had a handle on that genre, it was

02:56:51.069 --> 02:56:55.595
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still pretty underground, but it wasn't going away anytime soon.

02:56:56.135 --> 02:56:59.740
[SPEAKER_01]: They were still sending out new titles and so forth.

02:57:00.461 --> 02:57:03.645
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said, once you bring something mainstream, that's one of the...

02:57:07.089 --> 02:57:08.470
[SPEAKER_01]: and some vulnerabilities right there.

02:57:09.331 --> 02:57:14.854
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to wrap up because we're supposed to be done at 9.15 tonight but quickly, any final thoughts on this?

02:57:16.395 --> 02:57:30.563
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty certain that the video game publishers have a cabal with the reviewers to the point where at some point the feds have to get involved thinking that you may have a case where these publishers are paying their way.

02:57:31.003 --> 02:57:34.665
[SPEAKER_01]: Not through official channels but under the table in terms of paying for

02:57:35.746 --> 02:57:41.647
[SPEAKER_01]: for reviews or any of that type that might be... I want them all drugged through the courts!

02:57:42.127 --> 02:57:44.328
[SPEAKER_05]: I want mud flung on them!

02:57:44.348 --> 02:57:57.310
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony got busted for astroturfing for the PSP a few years ago for actually posting it through a supposedly real actual user or an actual blog post that turned out to be fake.

02:57:57.350 --> 02:58:02.651
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly marketing posts without disclosing whether or not they had a...

02:58:04.059 --> 02:58:07.783
[SPEAKER_01]: That they were actually, you know, part Sony.

02:58:22.536 --> 02:58:29.039
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not mean to ignore the Twitters tonight.

02:58:29.499 --> 02:58:32.600
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just quickly get through some of these at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:38.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramaditya Knight sent us some NES soundtracks to check out, and so I'm going to check those out.

02:58:38.682 --> 02:58:43.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Fighter, Shatterhand, Final Mission, some pretty good picks in there.

02:58:44.525 --> 02:58:50.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric RPG sent us a link to a Kickstarter, but this is for a JRPG that looks like it could be interesting.

02:58:50.508 --> 02:58:54.691
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Americana Dawn and definitely looks like kind of the old retro.

02:58:54.711 --> 02:58:59.174
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say like Super Nintendo, but maybe a little more like PlayStation era like RPGs.

02:59:00.115 --> 02:59:01.375
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

02:59:01.596 --> 02:59:04.517
[SPEAKER_05]: And for $7, you can put an NPC in the development room.

02:59:04.577 --> 02:59:06.639
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this looks like something you want to support, there you go.

02:59:07.259 --> 02:59:07.499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:59:07.519 --> 02:59:07.599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:59:30.959 --> 02:59:49.559
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that I got an email on it this week too I guess they're still pushing it and I haven't really heard any clarifications from Atari The other one has to do with the Tiger Claw sent me Mass Effect 3 and the gay card I want to read this in more detail and probably talk about it at a later time because obviously

02:59:51.921 --> 03:00:16.521
[SPEAKER_05]: this is an issue I would be interested in I think some people are unfairly there's some people out there like I don't want Shepard to be gay why does Bioware have to make everything gay well you know what why does everything have to be one way or the other one thing I really like about Mass Effect is you have the freedom to do what you want or not do something hello so anyhow

03:00:18.405 --> 03:00:19.486
[SPEAKER_05]: I will read that more later.

03:00:20.607 --> 03:00:25.612
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt sent us a link about Chinatown Fair Arcade reopening, but I think that was covered in Rapid Fire News.

03:00:25.652 --> 03:00:26.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we cover that at some point?

03:00:26.713 --> 03:00:27.053
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

03:00:28.114 --> 03:00:29.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought we had that linked.

03:00:29.255 --> 03:00:32.138
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Chinatown Fair Arcade rumored reopening.

03:00:32.238 --> 03:00:32.598
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

03:00:33.219 --> 03:00:34.460
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it for Twitter.

03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:36.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

03:00:36.281 --> 03:00:37.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Call me when Arcade Infinity reopens.

03:00:38.174 --> 03:00:38.655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.

03:00:39.996 --> 03:00:42.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about things that disappeared in the last couple years.

03:00:42.098 --> 03:00:44.600
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry about all the closures coming to California.

03:00:46.462 --> 03:00:50.807
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to wrap up and get out of here for the night, but we need to get our final thoughts first.

03:00:50.847 --> 03:00:52.208
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, thank you so much for being here.

03:00:53.149 --> 03:00:57.633
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, of course, for hosting our website, as you so graciously have for the past...

03:00:58.274 --> 03:00:58.694
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

03:01:22.185 --> 03:01:22.885
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell stop it?

03:01:22.965 --> 03:01:24.086
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do we need Kickstarter?

03:01:24.106 --> 03:01:27.368
[SPEAKER_05]: We have generous people like Jason who help us out with what they can help get us.

03:01:27.548 --> 03:01:29.189
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Kickstarter to recoup costs.

03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:30.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, guys.

03:01:30.350 --> 03:01:30.750
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:32.231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

03:01:32.431 --> 03:01:34.152
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jason, final thoughts tonight.

03:01:34.692 --> 03:01:35.713
[SPEAKER_04]: Kirby Superstar.

03:01:36.658 --> 03:01:38.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, final thought tonight.

03:01:39.219 --> 03:01:48.084
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope there's not a size limit to Excel files because the one I'm using right now to make a editor for Grand Theft Auto maps is 65 megs now.

03:01:48.204 --> 03:01:51.606
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 65,535 rows is the most you can have.

03:01:51.686 --> 03:01:52.386
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rows.

03:01:52.526 --> 03:01:53.807
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about file size.

03:01:54.067 --> 03:01:54.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with that.

03:01:54.988 --> 03:01:56.088
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:01:58.533 --> 03:02:01.156
[SPEAKER_05]: and my final thought is Cool Whip!

03:02:02.017 --> 03:02:02.778
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

03:02:03.138 --> 03:02:03.719
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool Whip?

03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:06.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool Whip!

03:02:06.682 --> 03:02:10.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening live to our program.

03:02:10.066 --> 03:02:10.967
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

03:02:11.287 --> 03:02:12.469
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we do it for free.

03:02:12.789 --> 03:02:14.071
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't ask for your money.

03:02:14.571 --> 03:02:17.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Although maybe I'll get talked into the Kickstarter thing.

03:02:17.734 --> 03:02:19.195
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, though I kind of doubt it.

03:02:19.675 --> 03:02:20.176
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

03:02:21.176 --> 03:02:22.037
[SPEAKER_05]: I do say this, though.

03:02:22.117 --> 03:02:25.640
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoy what you've heard, please tell somebody about the show.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:26.961
[SPEAKER_05]: Help spread the word.

03:02:27.301 --> 03:02:28.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Help grow our community.

03:02:28.703 --> 03:02:30.644
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a no embargo zone.

03:02:31.605 --> 03:02:33.086
[SPEAKER_05]: And we give you our honest opinions.

03:02:33.206 --> 03:02:34.447
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we did sign one.

03:02:34.507 --> 03:02:36.189
[SPEAKER_05]: We signed one once and we got burned by it.

03:02:36.709 --> 03:02:37.650
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't about reviews, though.

03:02:38.290 --> 03:02:38.851
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something else.

03:02:38.951 --> 03:02:39.831
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to get into it now.

03:02:39.872 --> 03:02:40.352
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of time.

03:02:41.010 --> 03:02:48.509
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an easy topic if we want to talk about that when we're not recording.

03:02:49.508 --> 03:02:53.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then we're going to turn off the mics and say see you next week.

03:02:53.591 --> 03:02:54.091
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

03:02:54.531 --> 03:02:57.313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

03:02:57.853 --> 03:02:58.554
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you guys.

03:02:59.254 --> 03:02:59.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week.

03:02:59.815 --> 03:03:00.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, everyone.

03:03:01.055 --> 03:03:03.897

03:03:04.357 --> 03:03:07.659
