00:00.000 --> 00:19.360
Tonight, March 18th, 2012, a new handheld will let you experience an old system all

00:19.360 --> 00:20.520
over again.

00:20.520 --> 00:25.760
Diablo 3 finally gets a release date, and one fan goes to the feds over a controversial

00:25.760 --> 00:32.760
video game ending.

00:55.760 --> 01:04.160
It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but I'll be guiding you over the next few

01:04.160 --> 01:05.840
hours with my co-hosts.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.880
First off, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
How are you?

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
Hi Rob.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.880
What?

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
Hi.

01:12.880 --> 01:17.200
I see you're wearing a red shirt tonight.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Yes I am.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
With a Star Trek logo.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Yes I am.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
So you're just waiting to get shot.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.200
No, it's engineering.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
I see.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
So you're safe.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Yeah.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.920
No falling objects on Jamie tonight.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.240
No, usually just, you know, the core will overheat and they'll have to close down engineering

01:31.240 --> 01:33.520
and someone will fall into the antimatter.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.520
So that won't be me.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.440
But you can't mix the matter with antimatter.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.120
No, you kind of do that.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.520
Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki, joining us every week.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
Hello.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
How are you, Loki?

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
I'm fine.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
You've got your Vita out.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.520
Yes.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.520
Playing Vita.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.240
Well, I'm trying to have my Vita see my phone so it can tether to it.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.520
So I can download some, actually no, downloading over 3G would be really fucking slow.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.520
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.840
Yeah, it would be very slow.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
Yep.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
Never mind.

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
Skip that.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
Yeah.

02:05.840 --> 02:06.840
That's what I thought.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
Alright.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
We have a guest tonight.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
You know, a lot of folks were asking, how are you going to celebrate episode number

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
450?

02:10.840 --> 02:14.520
And I was like, I didn't realize that was a landmark number, but okay, 450.

02:14.520 --> 02:20.060
But things worked out just really ironically and just, you know, funny things happen sometimes.

02:20.060 --> 02:23.980
Where we have a guest tonight who's joining us on the program for the first time since

02:23.980 --> 02:29.480
2004, but he's a name that should be familiar to all you guys.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.800
It's our webmaster VX Jason XV is here tonight.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
Hi, Jason.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
Hi, Olarme.

02:34.800 --> 02:35.800
How are you?

02:35.800 --> 02:37.280
I'm exhausted.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.420
Buses are doing nothing for upwards of a day is very tiring.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.420
Go figure.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.420
You're not much of a flyer.

02:42.420 --> 02:43.420
You're a, you're a busser.

02:43.420 --> 02:44.540
Not anymore, unfortunately.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.840
So I get to deal with the day or multi day trips.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.480
Well, I, now that they take nudies of you at the airport, I can understand another,

02:51.480 --> 02:54.200
another very good reason why I decided to stop going to the airport.

02:54.200 --> 02:59.280
Where your hesitation comes from, like, you know, some people want to charge for those.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.960
Uh, so let's see.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
It's been about eight years.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
How have you been?

03:02.960 --> 03:09.320
Um, I've been older, I guess, since you put it in those wonderful terms.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.080
I've lived in three different States since the last time I was on the show.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.960
I moved out of New Mexico to Arizona around the middle of 2000.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.680
And then a couple of years later, moved out to Colorado where I've been for about the

03:19.680 --> 03:24.760
last five, bought a house and things are, you know, things are progressing in the life

03:24.760 --> 03:25.960
kind of way.

03:25.960 --> 03:31.120
When a dark Tetsuya interviewed me, I mentioned that in the last year I've actually been a

03:31.120 --> 03:35.400
part of a podcast of my own called the Ask Different Podcast, plenty of a Apple nerdiness

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
and whatnot.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.280
Probably kind of similar, same extent.

03:38.280 --> 03:43.120
We just talk about what's interesting and any particular newsworthy items or if we really

03:43.120 --> 03:46.700
want to delve into a specific topic, we'll, we'll spend some time and talk really detailed

03:46.700 --> 03:48.040
about something in particular.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.760
And you have an amazingly sexy radio voice.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.880
So I, I, you know, and you know, I say that with all, you know, I, I love you, but not

03:54.880 --> 03:58.760
like that, you know, but you do have an amazingly sexy radio voice.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.120
And uh, you know, I'm, I would think that podcast would be great to listen to you guys

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
still doing it.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
Or did that stop?

04:04.120 --> 04:07.520
We, we, we've been off for the past couple of weeks primarily because I've been on this

04:07.520 --> 04:09.880
trip and then one of the other co-hosts have been sick.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.200
So it hasn't been working out so well.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.720
But the last episode was just posted, should have been the first week of the month or just

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
before that.

04:16.720 --> 04:21.520
And it's been, it's been regular since, uh, the start of winter, at least we had a little

04:21.520 --> 04:25.320
winter hiatus, but it's been regular since it's been taking its fiber.

04:25.320 --> 04:31.120
I don't know if you heard, but there was a new iPad announced really San Francisco Apple

04:31.120 --> 04:35.520
store was a zoo this weekend and surprisingly has nothing to do with St. Patrick's day.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.960
Did they even have any left?

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960
I didn't ask.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.000
I, I'm not, I'm not on a spending money trip, unfortunately.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That's all right.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.880
I, uh, I did, I was commenting on your little iPad set up though, cause you had a little

04:44.880 --> 04:47.840
Bluetooth keyboard and you, you are an Apple nerd.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.000
I am absolutely an Apple nerd anymore.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.880
It's kind of a culture shock to come in here cause I'm surrounded with a bunch of things

04:53.880 --> 04:57.000
that aren't white or silver or Chrome and slick.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.320
I refuse to conform.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.960
This is, this is also temporary housing too.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.480
So we don't plan to stay here forever, but anyway, um, let's see.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.320
So let's talk a little bit about kind of like your history here on OLR.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.400
So you, the last time you were on this show, just put it in perspective, we were still

05:13.400 --> 05:19.400
a show primarily about music, video games and like, you know, DDR, beat mania, Parappa,

05:19.400 --> 05:20.520
all that stuff.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.120
So you still play in music games?

05:23.120 --> 05:26.940
Um, occasionally every once in a while, it's usually one of those things where if somebody

05:26.940 --> 05:31.960
we know is over that has never heard of them before, we like to, uh, I have a homemade

05:31.960 --> 05:36.180
pop and music controller, full size, you know, two, two ratio and whatnot.

05:36.180 --> 05:40.040
And so we throw in one of the versions and play some hard songs and they get a kick out

05:40.040 --> 05:43.520
of this loud, clacky game with an oversized controller.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.280
Um, I try to keep up on the two DX console releases.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.220
Unfortunately, the arcade that did have a machine nearby, uh, went to Utah in the past

05:52.220 --> 05:53.220
couple of months.

05:53.220 --> 06:00.080
So some of the arcade avenues have disappeared for me, but, um, I, I try not so much DDR

06:00.080 --> 06:03.820
as much as other things and it's, you know, it's still interesting cause I still adore

06:03.820 --> 06:04.820
the music.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.600
I still listen to it any chance I get.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.480
Even in the new two DXs, you forgive the music cause I, I'm, I'm kind of not a big fan of

06:11.480 --> 06:12.720
where Bahmani music went.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.560
It's not as good as it used to be in my opinion.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.000
Video game music, music in general follows a flow with me.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.980
I have to have an association with it.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.920
And as of Empress, I don't have an association with it anymore.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.040
So no, it's not as interesting to me.

06:25.040 --> 06:29.080
There's a couple of gyms here and there, but if you ask me to pick a favorite, I would

06:29.080 --> 06:32.280
probably go back to sixth, eighth style.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.840
Back when it was the classics, uh, you were a moderator on DDR freak.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
I was.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.000
I think technically I might still be listed as one DDR free closed.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.760
I don't know if you heard, I know I was still listed as one and I hadn't looked at the site

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
in years.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.600
So highly active moderator as well.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.960
Well, I mean, I even, I told them, I think it was about three years ago when I was kind

06:53.960 --> 06:57.480
of saying that I'm not going to be around the site as much anymore because I just don't

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
feel relevant anymore.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.680
I don't feel that I'm relevant with it anymore.

07:00.680 --> 07:05.580
Um, and I, I guess I heard that that was happening and maybe I did hear that it closed down,

07:05.580 --> 07:09.680
but not going to the site anymore and seeing the page means that it doesn't really, you

07:09.680 --> 07:10.800
know, it's not any different to me.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.800
I was going to be there to look at it.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.880
I think it's still there, but the forums are all, it's cool.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.920
And the forums were the last great hurrah.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.800
I think that and the machine locations, which I think kind of got dusty.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.180
So I don't think, you know, they're really doing pretty much all the hardcore Bemani

07:24.180 --> 07:27.800
nerds as far as I know, unless there's other sites I'm not aware of are on Bemani style

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
at this point.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Bemani style.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.680
Aaron in Japan is still very prominent and zenisivanishur is the trendy name of the week.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
I know that.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.680
No, I know that.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.680
So, but they've been around a couple of years.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.680
I know them.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.680
Yeah.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.680
So, okay.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.800
Um, gosh, what else do I ask a man who hasn't been on the show in eight years?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.440
Let's let's talk about eight years ago.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.840
You and I went to E3 together and dear friends.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.840
That's right.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
Oh gosh.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
Yes.

07:50.840 --> 07:51.840
That first dear friends.

07:51.840 --> 07:52.840
Last time I was on the show.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.680
Nobu was still part of square.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.600
That was, that was the night.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.560
And I know I've told this story on the show on many times, but that was the night where

08:00.560 --> 08:01.560
we were surprised.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.560
Remember this case?

08:02.560 --> 08:06.480
I don't even like you and I got tickets or I think I bought tickets and you bought one

08:06.480 --> 08:07.480
or so.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.120
I don't even remember how we did it, but we, you and I ended up going to this thing together

08:10.120 --> 08:15.840
and we sat four and five seats down from Nobu who crossed by us multiple times to get to

08:15.840 --> 08:16.840
the stage.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.760
The punchline is we're sitting there in our seats where we're the very last row of the

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
orchestra section.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
Right?

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
So, I mean, we kind of walk in there.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.480
We're like, okay, we might not be front and center, but from like an acoustical standpoint,

08:27.480 --> 08:28.840
we're like right in the center of the room.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.840
This is going to be the best place.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.200
We're not the, we're about four seats away from the very, very center of the room, but

08:34.200 --> 08:35.520
we're like really close.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.520
But we do notice like four seats down, the seats are blocked off with caution tape.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.840
And we're just kind of thinking like, oh, okay, well, you know, these seats, uh, maybe

08:42.840 --> 08:45.880
they're broken or, you know, something happened, but they don't want people sitting there for

08:45.880 --> 08:46.880
whatever reason.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.520
The MC something for the, uh, for the actual venue, something like that, something like

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
that.

08:51.520 --> 08:55.640
So finally Nobu Imatsu comes out and the only way we know this is that he kind of, you know,

08:55.640 --> 08:59.240
he peaks out and he's, he's not really dressed in a suit and tie.

08:59.240 --> 09:04.240
He's dressed like, you know, in a robe, he's pretty easy to spot and just everybody stands

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
and applauds him.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
This is before the thing even starts.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.240
They'll stand and they start applauding him and like, we're standing, we're applauding

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
too.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.360
We're like, oh, he's, he's walking over this way.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.720
Oh, he's walking, he's walking closer to us.

09:13.720 --> 09:19.880
Oh, oh my gosh, he's right in front of me and I need to move so he can get to his seat

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
that's blocked off.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.960
And so that was like our, our brush with greatness right there.

09:24.960 --> 09:31.240
Cause you know, obviously the man, I mean Final Fantasy was the music for so long.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.820
So just kind of being able to have that as part of the experience of, oh, going to a

09:34.820 --> 09:36.680
concert all about the music was amazing.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.440
Believe me, I've told that story my fair share of times to a nerd that would appreciate it

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
as well too.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.700
And it's funny cause that wasn't even the section that you wanted to buy tickets for

09:43.700 --> 09:44.700
in the first place.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.280
You wanted to be one more section up and they were completely sold out.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.800
So you're like, okay, let's, let's upgrade then and not downgrade and orchestra section.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.720
Yeah, let's do it.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.440
I was like, well, yeah, cause at that time, a, I was 20 year old with no responsibility

09:57.440 --> 09:58.440
whatsoever.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.560
B, it was kind of like, you know, why not?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.700
Is like how many times are they going to do a concert like this?

10:03.700 --> 10:06.120
We didn't know tour or anything like that.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.600
Now you and I didn't go to more friends after that.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.120
More friends was not as good.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.840
Sadly, they had a lot of problems with that venue, but anyway, we will, we won't dwell

10:13.840 --> 10:15.640
on the negative, just the positive.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.640
But that was that the only E3 you ended up going to?

10:17.640 --> 10:19.720
I've only ever been to 04.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.360
I don't think I've even been back in the state since 2004.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.960
And again, to put it in perspective, the big thing they showed off that year was the Nintendo

10:26.960 --> 10:32.000
DS, not the D, not the DSI, and Pokemon XD.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.480
They had a very big corner of that.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.480
I remember.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.480
And how was E3?

10:35.480 --> 10:40.920
Uh, Oh God, I don't even remember E3 to be completely honest that, I mean, that was one

10:40.920 --> 10:44.260
of those things where I came out and it was, you know, finally putting faces to names of

10:44.260 --> 10:45.260
so many people.

10:45.260 --> 10:49.640
Cause it was the big, uh, the, the four of us in the room here now we're a part of it.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.040
See, I flew out with DDR freaks.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.920
So there was a whole bunch of people whose names I know and, uh, talked with, uh, frequently

10:55.920 --> 11:01.880
I can finally be in person with, um, E3 was for, for a gamer.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.960
It was fun because there was plenty of things to look at and get your hands on.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.720
And G4 was still prominent back then.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.960
They had the orange booth last that year, if you remember, and all the, all the college

11:12.960 --> 11:17.140
kids running around interning for them and whatnot.

11:17.140 --> 11:21.760
I'm trying to think of one specific thing about the show that was exciting and minus

11:21.760 --> 11:26.480
the Konami booth, which is kind of a given and the fact that square had a humongous final

11:26.480 --> 11:29.240
fantasy, final fantasy 11 was prominent back then.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.240
Wow.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
Wasn't even the MMO of that.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.240
Wow.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
Did not exist at that point.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.040
If you can believe it, they might've been showing the early stuff about it.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
I don't remember.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040
It was too long ago.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.120
You even PVP'd at E3.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.400
Oh, that was the year I won the computer.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
Yeah.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.840
The old show computer was one in a final fantasy 11 event.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
Yes.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
I did.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
I won.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.840
I won the thank you square for the old computer.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.840
Although we don't use it anymore.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.840
Let's see what was in there.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.440
The gizmondo I think was still being phantom.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
Yeah.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.440
Yeah.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.960
The Phantom that they, they hadn't relegated themselves to a keyboard yet, but the Phantom

11:59.960 --> 12:03.760
was still very prominent there right behind Konami as a matter of fact,

12:03.760 --> 12:06.960
I will never forget the experience of walking in there the first time.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.480
And the very first thing I saw at E3 was Konami's booth and the big game they were doing that

12:11.480 --> 12:14.800
year was silent Hill for the room.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.560
That was the coolest set up I'd ever seen.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
That wasn't that awesome.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.600
And it was just kind of like, wow, it's like I'm at the state fair, but it's all about

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
video games.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.640
It was a silent Hill four and metal gear solid three.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.640
Wasn't it?

12:26.640 --> 12:27.640
Yeah.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.640
They kind of had both going on.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
Yeah.

12:29.640 --> 12:33.240
But I just remember the big set up with all the little light in a room with eight or so

12:33.240 --> 12:42.520
systems and it's a room and you're in it and you're playing the room, which I still, I

12:42.520 --> 12:46.160
started and speaking of this, since we're talking about that game specifically, I had

12:46.160 --> 12:49.840
a little silent Hill marathon week, uh, a while ago.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.920
I replayed through the first three.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.040
I replayed the first one.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
I've done that before.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.420
I played two and three, started to get to four and um, I guess it worked that time cause

12:58.420 --> 12:59.420
it kind of creeped me out.

12:59.420 --> 13:02.900
I wasn't, uh, I couldn't actually make it through that game.

13:02.900 --> 13:07.040
Just the, the pace and the ambience and whatnot got to me for some reason.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.160
And I actually didn't wind up making it through that one.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.740
I'll have to try again someday.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.680
You know, funny we bring up silent Hill and all that.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.720
Um, I don't know if you guys realized the new silent Hill game just came out this past

13:15.720 --> 13:16.720
week.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
Really?

13:17.720 --> 13:19.800
It told the silent Hill downpour.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
I did.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.280
I was at fries the other day, just randomly spending time where we're walking up and down

13:24.280 --> 13:25.280
looking at video games.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
I'm like, what's the silent Hill game?

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
Oh shit.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.320
They released a new silent Hill game.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.960
I totally forgot about this.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.960
Yeah.

13:31.960 --> 13:36.740
Silent Hill downpour came out and uh, Shane is sending me private messages here apparently.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.680
And this is like a tiny spoiler, but not really.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
It's not a story.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
Story spoiler.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.960
It says that you totally get to visit Henry's room from silent Hill four as an Easter egg

13:45.960 --> 13:47.880
and it's still locked from the inside.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.440
So I guess they're throwing in little, little throwbacks to the other silent Hill games,

13:52.440 --> 13:56.280
even though silent Hill four, the room was not supposed to be a silent Hill game when

13:56.280 --> 13:57.280
it started.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.340
That's why it feels so disconnected from the rest of them.

13:59.340 --> 14:04.080
Silent Hill form was original silent Hill four was originally a game called the room.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
I'm confused.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Not to be confused with the movie.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Yeah.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.080
Cause that would have sucked.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.920
Um, no, I'm confused with the fact that.

14:09.920 --> 14:15.520
So was his room supposed to be in silent Hill, like the, like the actual room part.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.760
I mean, cause I don't get it.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.880
I mean, I remember there was the portals to silent Hill, but what's his room supposed

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
to be?

14:21.880 --> 14:25.080
Do you know how many years it's been since I played silent Hill in the room?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.080
Would it be eight by chance?

14:26.080 --> 14:28.400
I would have thought that this would have stuck with you.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.400
I mean, no.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.480
Uh, anyhow, I'm just trying to figure out, it was all a dream.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
It was all dream.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
All right.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.600
Uh, let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.760
You always talk a little bit about how is your gaming week and what video games you've

14:41.760 --> 14:46.400
been playing, whether it be new or whether it be eight years old, um, dark soccer.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.560
Hi, how are you?

14:47.560 --> 14:49.120
How was your gaming week?

14:49.120 --> 14:56.360
Uh, I have another 85 and she's a hoe bag dealer.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.600
Um, she, she's a hoe bag.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.420
I'm dressing her as slutty as possible.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.420
So you're a blood elf.

15:02.420 --> 15:03.420
Yeah.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.420
And wow.

15:04.420 --> 15:10.800
Um, uh, of course, I honestly thought we were talking about saints row or something like

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
that at first.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.680
I, I kind of fell off that.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.720
I should have known better, but I, I fell off some, you know, there's a, there's a big

15:17.720 --> 15:21.840
reveal coming tonight about Mr. Pandaria because the, uh, which is the next expansion panda

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
people.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.840
I don't know if you've heard, but the next expansion deals with walking, talky pandas,

15:25.840 --> 15:27.380
and there was a press event last week.

15:27.380 --> 15:32.320
The embargo lifts at midnight tonight, so there's going to be huge information from

15:32.320 --> 15:33.720
the new tomorrow.

15:33.720 --> 15:39.260
We can only hope that the worlds of saints row and world of Warcraft have collided, especially

15:39.260 --> 15:44.120
the fuzzy wuzzy panda bears, but there have been some early leaks.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.760
Some of the, you know, when they have an NDA for a week, inevitably somebody is going to,

15:47.760 --> 15:48.760
it's too hot for their hands.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.760
They got to let it out.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.740
So we've seen what the female pandas look like now.

15:51.740 --> 15:56.240
They look like, like red pandas, although some are saying that could just be one coloring.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.680
I think it's just a coloring.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.980
And then, uh, some of the videos that show off, like some of the dungeons, I got to say

16:00.980 --> 16:04.300
that temple, the Jade serpent looks amazing.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.260
So can't wait to get in some of those new instances.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.260
I looked at it.

16:07.260 --> 16:13.560
I thought it was pretty cool, but, uh, I tried to play some more star mine, but I'm actually

16:13.560 --> 16:14.840
stuck on the puzzle.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.180
So that's really about it.

16:18.180 --> 16:22.500
And I watched Scott Pilgrim again for the 50 millionth time on St Patrick's day.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
What possessed that?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
We were bored.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
That's good.

16:25.500 --> 16:30.600
I also learned, um, a new game is called how not to blow up the house with a pressure cooker.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
Good idea.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.360
My first time using a pressure cooker made corned beef.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.360
Yeah.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.360
It was epic.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.360
Under pressure.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
All right.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.240
Um, I played a few things.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.080
I actually, it's kind of funny.

16:43.080 --> 16:50.800
I'm thinking of going to, uh, just like dedicating a month to playing PlayStation games.

16:50.800 --> 16:56.580
Cause I like realize I have all these games on my PS3 that I'm just not playing and not

16:56.580 --> 16:58.520
enough trophies.

16:58.520 --> 17:03.200
That is true trophy level is quite, quite small at this point.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.120
Uh, but no, it's like a, you know, a little big planet too.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.680
I have to play through that still.

17:07.680 --> 17:12.920
I have infamous that I got from the whole fallout from the network being down, um, that

17:12.920 --> 17:18.480
the play through, um, and I'm sure there's some other games I want to go back and play

17:18.480 --> 17:22.880
through resistance one, two, and three actually, cause I played through one all the way and

17:22.880 --> 17:24.360
I love resistance.

17:24.360 --> 17:28.440
Resistance was to me when you compare resistance and halo three resistance by far way better

17:28.440 --> 17:29.440
game.

17:29.440 --> 17:34.680
Um, but I kinda, I want to go through two and three and play through those, but before

17:34.680 --> 17:39.600
I get the beat of one, so anyways, so stuff I actually did play, I played, um, journey.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.780
I bought that game.

17:40.780 --> 17:43.280
It's amazing game, very short, but who cares?

17:43.280 --> 17:44.920
You can play through it a bunch of times.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.680
Um, and it's just, it's a beautiful game.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.120
It's one of those games that like I had people over, I'm like, Hey, you got to see this game

17:50.120 --> 17:51.760
cause it's really beautiful.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.180
So and the big spoiler last week I was trying to hide, but it was brought to my attention

17:56.180 --> 17:58.520
from Bobby that it's revealed in the trailer.

17:58.520 --> 18:04.680
So oops, my bad, but it's a multiplayer game and you don't like I did, I knew nothing about

18:04.680 --> 18:09.600
journey going into it, but when I say it's a multiplayer game, you can't talk to that.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.440
There's no, it doesn't work like other online games.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.280
You have one emote and that's the little chirp that you do.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.640
You can't type, you can't talk.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.080
You don't even know who it is that you're playing with and you might think, God, that

18:21.080 --> 18:22.080
sounds basic.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.080
You don't know until the end.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.760
Well, yeah, yeah, I will show you their, their little, I keep wanting to say gamer tags,

18:26.760 --> 18:29.960
but PSN IDs or whatever they're called at the very, very, very end of the game.

18:29.960 --> 18:30.960
Yeah.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.520
But until that point you have no idea who it is and you can't really communicate and

18:33.520 --> 18:37.680
you might think, God, that seems so basic, but at the same time it's brilliant in its

18:37.680 --> 18:38.680
simplicity.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.680
Isn't it?

18:39.680 --> 18:40.680
Yeah.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.280
Because even like, why do we hate to play games online these days?

18:43.280 --> 18:48.960
Fag, fag, fag, stop being such a fag, you play with a fag, it's noob fag.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.780
Like that's why I can't play games online.

18:50.780 --> 18:53.040
Like it's just, I have to mute everybody.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.960
But the fact that Journey kind of scales it back and you have this experience or whatever

18:56.960 --> 19:01.560
with somebody else where you communicate through this like new method of communication, the

19:01.560 --> 19:03.120
little chirping is neat.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.200
Anyway, I didn't mean to dominate your conversation, but I had to get that out since last week.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.500
It was pretty cool because you don't really know what's going on.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.880
The game reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, just like even the art style with

19:12.880 --> 19:17.160
some of the characters that you meet later on, not trying to spoil anything, but, um,

19:17.160 --> 19:19.200
they just reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus.

19:19.200 --> 19:24.200
But yeah, it's a really fun game.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.520
Really beautiful game, it does a very good job of conveying emotion, I guess, through

19:28.520 --> 19:30.520
the whole thing.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.760
But yeah, it's definitely worth, I think, the 15 bucks to pick it up.

19:34.760 --> 19:40.600
I played, let's see, aside from the PlayStation 3, I played some stuff on the Vita, mainly

19:40.600 --> 19:45.840
just I went back and played a little bit more Motorstorm RC.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.680
Little kind of frustrated, the controls and that, because I'll be doing a perfect lap

19:49.680 --> 19:54.440
and then I'll run into the AI character or I'll run into a wall because I can't see it

19:54.440 --> 19:58.160
well enough because of the camera sucking.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.720
So that's a little annoying, but I did manage to top out all my friends on the leaderboards

20:03.720 --> 20:07.160
there, at least for all the tracks that I've played, I still haven't played through the

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
whole game.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.840
And I do like how it's like, oh, this track's not unlocked yet, and you can hit it and it

20:11.840 --> 20:14.760
says buy, and you can buy the unlock to unlock all of them.

20:14.760 --> 20:19.700
Why would I waste my time doing that, you know, seriously?

20:19.700 --> 20:24.080
One thing I'm noticing about the Vita is that it is moving closer and closer to Facebook

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
games.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.720
In some of the games I've played, I'd say I don't like that one bit.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.760
Like it's really like, press this button to buy it right now.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.760
You don't have to.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.760
Get your recharge right now.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.320
You don't have to, and that's the best part about it.

20:35.320 --> 20:39.000
Why would I unlock all the tracks in this game that would defeat the purpose of playing

20:39.000 --> 20:41.160
the game if you did that?

20:41.160 --> 20:44.560
It's like you're paying money and it's like, oh, I'm done with the game now.

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
So you know, whatever.

20:45.560 --> 20:50.100
It doesn't take that long to unlock everything, you just play through the tracks.

20:50.100 --> 20:55.240
So I did that, and you know, it's still, it's an alright game still.

20:55.240 --> 21:01.200
Noticing that some of the tracks are starting to repeat, which is kind of okay I guess.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.400
And now this is kind of funny.

21:02.400 --> 21:09.160
I played the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita, except the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita

21:09.160 --> 21:15.960
is their E3 2011 demo that they had, which isn't really a demo at all.

21:15.960 --> 21:23.000
It's just a demo of a, the engine, the concept, I'm not really sure what the fuck it's supposed

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
to be.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.800
It's basically, it's just shots of the car, like it's panning around the car.

21:28.800 --> 21:34.600
And if you touch the screen and drag your finger across, it sort of tweaks the music

21:34.600 --> 21:40.240
a little bit, and if you hold the L or R buttons, it'll kind of like remix the music a bit.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.240
And that's it.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.760
And then like, I was like, oh okay, this is kind of neat, you know, while they're talking

21:43.760 --> 21:44.760
about the game.

21:44.760 --> 21:49.720
It's all, you know, the end of demo, I'm like, where's the racing?

21:49.720 --> 21:51.760
Where the fuck is the racing?

21:51.760 --> 21:54.120
Ridge Racer 10, showroom.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.400
It's just, there is no fucking-

21:55.400 --> 21:58.360
Press X to unlock the racing for only 100-

21:58.360 --> 22:02.280
No, seriously, they're like, buy the full game, I'm like, I'm not even sure what the

22:02.280 --> 22:03.800
full game is.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
There's nothing here.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.480
Oh, that's funny because there's nothing in the real game either.

22:07.480 --> 22:11.120
Hold on though, to be devil's advocate, Loki, it's Ridge Racer.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
You fucking know what the game is.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.080
Like if you don't know by now, what is this, like the 10th or 11th Ridge Racer game?

22:16.080 --> 22:19.960
If you don't know what Ridge Racer is by now, I can't fucking help you.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.480
Well here's a spoiler, okay?

22:21.480 --> 22:25.400
First off, the spoiler is that Ridge Racer for the Vita sucks.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.400
Now I know that it's going to be a shock to some people-

22:27.400 --> 22:28.400
How dare you?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
It sucks.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.520
And here's the even funnier part.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.640
There's no new tracks in it.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.840
They're all from Ridge Racer 7 from the PlayStation 3.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.600
All of them, all three of them that are included with the game.

22:38.600 --> 22:43.360
Oh, and you get another three if you purchase the game right away, you know, because you

22:43.360 --> 22:46.400
need to have Ridge Racer, and you get another three tracks.

22:46.400 --> 22:52.320
Or you can pay another like $7 to unlock some more tracks and cars.

22:52.320 --> 22:57.520
Now I've heard the argument that, well, you know, really a lot of the cars that are in

22:57.520 --> 23:01.760
these games are just kind of reskins of other cars and stuff like that with different stats

23:01.760 --> 23:03.920
and you know, whatever.

23:03.920 --> 23:09.160
It's not really, you know, these three cars you can upgrade and keep unlocking stuff or

23:09.160 --> 23:10.160
whatever.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.920
Once again, you know, we kind of talked about this last week with on disc DLC and stuff

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
like that.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.320
It's the illusion of it, okay?

23:19.320 --> 23:26.080
Now a game that has three cars versus advertising game that has 200 cars, like I think Ridge

23:26.080 --> 23:29.480
Racer was an R4 fucking amazing game.

23:29.480 --> 23:33.560
I'd rather have that on my Vita because that was just awesome and there was tons of tracks

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
and cars.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.920
And yeah, and I understand that, you know, you can race the tracks backwards from the

23:37.920 --> 23:38.920
get go.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.880
Yeah, it's a stupid way to, you know, say you have double the amount of tracks that

23:42.880 --> 23:43.880
you do.

23:43.880 --> 23:48.560
But since you can't really, you know, have one and a half tracks in the game, you know,

23:48.560 --> 23:50.400
they're going to have to count three full tracks.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.000
Have you ever heard of a game that sounds so perfect for the rental market?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.400
It's not perfect for the rental market.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.720
It's perfect for a demo.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.000
That's it.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.920
That is a demo right there.

24:02.920 --> 24:07.120
If they wanted, like, you know, to put that game out for free and then have the extra

24:07.120 --> 24:11.000
cars, that would be, I don't think anyone would be really complaining about it, that

24:11.000 --> 24:14.640
it has only three cars, but it's free and you get to play Ridge Racer.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.760
And then if you want to buy additional cars, no one would balk at that.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.880
They would, they would probably, I'd probably buy it.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.280
I'd probably, well, I wouldn't buy it because it'd be free, but I would pay the extra, you

24:24.280 --> 24:28.520
know, the extra money, you know, to maybe download some extra tracks and stuff like

24:28.520 --> 24:30.040
that if it was free.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.040
But it's not.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.600
It costs $25, which they consider a discount.

24:33.600 --> 24:38.000
It's not a fucking discount because there's plenty of games that are out there for $29.99,

24:38.000 --> 24:44.360
and considering that a full game is only $10 more, or even, you know, kind of a not so

24:44.360 --> 24:49.720
full game but it's Touch My Katamari was the same price, and I consider that a better experience,

24:49.720 --> 24:55.200
although not by much, but at least there's actual content in there.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.280
It's just, I don't understand.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.520
And why was the game delayed?

24:58.520 --> 24:59.880
It still sucks.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.600
It still has like frame rate problems.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.360
Weren't they doing graph, oh okay.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.920
They weren't, yeah, they were supposedly doing graphic updates and stuff like that, it was

25:06.920 --> 25:09.400
supposed to run better, and it still sucks.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.040
It's like, what were you doing?

25:11.040 --> 25:12.040
Womp womp.

25:12.040 --> 25:16.400
You don't even have to like, I don't even know, they have all the geometry still for

25:16.400 --> 25:19.760
the tracks because they were in Ridge Racer 7.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.360
You didn't do anything.

25:21.360 --> 25:25.880
Fuck, just upgrade the graphics from the PSP version, it would have been way better.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.640
Alright, anything else you want to bitch about for your gaming week?

25:29.640 --> 25:35.080
Uh, I played Call of Duty 4, and we're playing with some GPD mods now, which is fun, so we

25:35.080 --> 25:40.840
have what we call Ninja Mode, or the, what is it, Ninja Games that I host because I have

25:40.840 --> 25:45.480
the mod in my system, so when I host it, it allows us to run really fast and jump really

25:45.480 --> 25:49.560
high and it's actually kind of fun with a few people, but then we still play legit games

25:49.560 --> 25:51.480
and I still own all this.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.960
Catching up on some of our comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, the

25:54.960 --> 25:57.040
chat is talking about Journey a little bit.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.780
Tigerclaw says, the only thing that would make Journey better would be music from Journey,

26:00.780 --> 26:01.780
and Randy-

26:01.780 --> 26:03.360
Wrong, you know, honestly I don't think it would.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.540
Well hold on, because Randy piggybacks on that and says, if you play Journey while listening

26:06.540 --> 26:09.960
to Don't Stop Believin' on loop, it totally syncs up.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.780
Now as much as I love Journey and all Journey jokes aside, it should be noted that the soundtrack

26:13.780 --> 26:19.740
for the game is pretty frickin' sweet, like it's a great, like, you know, ambience soundtrack.

26:19.740 --> 26:26.240
But if you want to rock out while you play an ambient, artsy game, okay, sure, pick Journey.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.280
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
Ah, that's it.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.320
Then let me go to Jason, since you're here tonight.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.360
Jason, what kind of games have you been playing?

26:36.360 --> 26:42.400
The ones where you serve customers and get money for it, by which I mean not really.

26:42.400 --> 26:49.920
No, I've kind of been in a slump for the past month, gearing up for this trip and just kind

26:49.920 --> 26:52.640
of working a lot.

26:52.640 --> 26:57.000
Well now, I know you brought your 3DS with you, because our 3DS is mated when we weren't

26:57.000 --> 26:58.920
looking and did the whole StreetPass thing.

26:58.920 --> 26:59.920
What kind of DS game?

26:59.920 --> 27:02.480
I don't know if you played any on the bus on the way here.

27:02.480 --> 27:07.760
I surprisingly didn't do anything on the bus on the way here, except for sleep and occasional

27:07.760 --> 27:08.760
music.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.720
But for what it's worth, when I picked up my 3DS, I have the same set of games then

27:13.720 --> 27:15.000
as I do now.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.920
Those would be Bust A Move Universe, I think is the 3DS version.

27:20.920 --> 27:28.760
Bust A Move, Star Fox 3D, On Green of Time 3D, and two more that I probably have never

27:28.760 --> 27:29.760
touched because I don't...

27:29.760 --> 27:32.320
Oh, Mario Land 3D, can't forget that one.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.400
And at this point, probably a fifth game that I've...

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
Mario Kart?

27:36.400 --> 27:37.400
Not yet.

27:37.400 --> 27:44.440
Mario Kart, I've really wanted to, but that was right after I lost my job, so I didn't.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.640
That's alright, don't worry about it.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.160
I was gonna say, are you excited about the Kid Icarus game?

27:49.160 --> 27:50.880
Let's say economy wasn't a factor.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.520
I've never played the original Kid Icarus meaningfully.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.120
Well, okay, here's the thing though.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.600
When did the original Kid Icarus come out, 1984?

27:57.600 --> 28:02.140
So it's been about 20-something years since that game came out, a damn near 30.

28:02.140 --> 28:07.020
So you know, they're having to market this new Kid Icarus game at people who have never

28:07.020 --> 28:09.380
played Kid Icarus, it's okay.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.520
So does it look interesting?

28:12.520 --> 28:15.840
I've not been looking at the news.

28:15.840 --> 28:20.680
It's kind of funny because I haven't been nearly as connected in the last couple of

28:20.680 --> 28:25.600
days as I have been, as I usually am when not traveling, and I've seen that everybody's

28:25.600 --> 28:29.920
been posting links to trailers and all of the hype and whatnot surrounding it, but I

28:29.920 --> 28:33.760
actually haven't watched the trailers.

28:33.760 --> 28:38.000
It'll come out, I'll watch the media, right now gaming in general in the midst of all

28:38.000 --> 28:41.120
this is kind of off my radar.

28:41.120 --> 28:45.000
I guess there are three things that I can say I've been playing.

28:45.000 --> 28:53.640
On the road to 200.6% in Castlevania Symphony of the Night, whenever I get completely frustrated

28:53.640 --> 28:59.320
with grinding out those stupid little blocks that are underwater, above water in the upside

28:59.320 --> 29:04.040
down castle, whenever I get frustrated with that, I go to Serious Sam 2 and then get frustrated

29:04.040 --> 29:09.280
with that in about 10 minutes, if that, because all of my saves exist in the rooms where you

29:09.280 --> 29:11.680
have to survive for as long as possible.

29:11.680 --> 29:16.000
I got sucked into stupid YouTube today watching one of those Castlevania Symphony of the Night

29:16.000 --> 29:20.520
long playthroughs because her classic game of the week had a long playthrough video and

29:20.520 --> 29:22.720
you know how like when you go to, and I was looking at it on YouTube, and you know how

29:22.720 --> 29:25.960
like when you do that, it's going to show you related videos on the side.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.920
Well, I saw Castlevania Symphony of the Night and I was like, Ooh, I want to watch some

29:29.920 --> 29:30.920
of that.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.480
And I watching, watching, watching 30 minutes later.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.480
Shit.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
I need to go to the grocery store.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.080
That's how Dan puts himself to sleep is watching long playthroughs.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.000
There's a ton of long playthrough videos out there.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
My God.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.880
And that's exactly why he has a new one for every night.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
Yeah.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
And there's like a huge community out there.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.360
He and I will just watch those instead of movies.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
I'm serious.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.360
No, that's, that's awesome.

29:52.360 --> 29:56.240
I want to see the long playthroughs for Ridge Racer, Vita.

29:56.240 --> 29:59.800
I'm sure after that 30 seconds, I'll be ready for some more.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.800
Tiger Claw corrects me.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.800
It was 1986.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.800
All right.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
My, my bad.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.560
It's 26 years then.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.560
It's been 86.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.560
All right.

30:07.560 --> 30:12.600
Uh, well, if that's all you want to share about your gaming week, then I will talk about

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
mine.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.360
Although I got to admit mine isn't, I don't have a variety of games like I usually do.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.120
I've been playing two games this week.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
Two.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.480
Bass Effect and Journey.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.480
You're pretty close.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.040
I, I even put Journey aside.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.160
I meant to play it more, but I can't stop playing Journey.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.680
I play WoW of course, cause I have a rating group.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.400
So I have to kind of play that at a set time every week.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.400
But when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, I'm playing Mass Effect.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.720
Not Mass Effect 3, mind you, Mass Effect 1.

30:36.720 --> 30:37.920
Hopefully you heard last week's show.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.920
I'm five years late to the party and I said, I'm going to start from the very beginning.

30:41.920 --> 30:48.580
And I just want to say, because I can do this, you know, on a podcast and you know, we don't

30:48.580 --> 30:50.360
make any money off this show or whatever.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.960
We don't answer to anybody but the listeners and ourselves, right?

30:53.960 --> 30:57.360
I totally misjudged this game five years ago.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.440
And it's something I'm sure we have all done.

30:59.440 --> 31:04.700
You see a little bit, you, you hear a snippet of a song and, oh, that album sucks.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.840
Or you go to a restaurant one time in the food, foods battle.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.160
This place sucks.

31:09.160 --> 31:13.580
I'm pretty sure in retrospect, when I saw somebody playing Mass Effect for the first

31:13.580 --> 31:19.280
time and I even, I remember playing it a little bit myself and kind of going, this is, I think

31:19.280 --> 31:24.180
it was when I was on one of those planets, driving that stupid car up over mountains

31:24.180 --> 31:29.840
and running into the buildings, not on easy combat mode and getting shot the hell up by

31:29.840 --> 31:36.760
the aliens, which is like the two parts of the game that I hear are fixed in two, especially

31:36.760 --> 31:38.640
the car parts and all that.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.240
And you know, now that I play Mass Effect 1 and I'm not afraid to play it on casual

31:42.240 --> 31:43.840
mode, it doesn't bother me at all.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.760
Like I actually really enjoy the combat and like flinging, flinging things around like

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
they're, you know.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.480
I thought you were going to say flinging poo, flinging poo and so forth.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.600
And I got to say, I am really sucked into the story too.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.120
The story is so fucking good.

31:59.120 --> 32:04.320
Like it's just like, it's like I'm watching an episode of Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica,

32:04.320 --> 32:07.400
but I am choosing the outcome I want.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.920
And like, I'm seeing so much about like, oh God, I've got to play this again because I've

32:10.920 --> 32:15.920
got to see how it plays again when I'm a bitch, because you know, you can be the nice guy

32:15.920 --> 32:17.960
or you can be the bitch, right?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.840
So there's so much I want to explore.

32:19.840 --> 32:25.480
I have, I have to admit, you know, who I think would love Mass Effect that it hasn't been

32:25.480 --> 32:30.640
playing it, Jamie, I really think you need to give this game a chance.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.640
I do.

32:31.640 --> 32:32.640
I'll borrow it when you're done.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.640
All right.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.400
This, this, well, here's the, well, cause the whole, like, you know, I know you're not

32:35.400 --> 32:36.400
big on controllers.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.200
I would urge you to check out the PC one because I just think the depth of the story, cause

32:40.200 --> 32:46.600
you like science fiction and all that stuff and I just think it's 1999, but I got it for

32:46.600 --> 32:48.080
12 used at Dimple.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.680
I'm thinking PC though.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
Oh, PC?

32:50.680 --> 32:51.680
Just wait for steam sales.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.680
I'm sure.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
Yeah.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.680
It's 1999.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.680
If anybody still has any steam coupons or anything.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.120
Um, yeah, you never know.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.120
But anyway.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
Yeah.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.760
But anyway, uh, I just got to say, I think you would be really into this cause I know

33:02.760 --> 33:06.920
you like a good story and I just, just the whole fact that I think you would try to like

33:06.920 --> 33:09.320
romance certain characters.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.640
See what happens.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.640
I don't know.

33:11.640 --> 33:15.600
Just, you just, I could just see you like, I could see, like my minor Merrill obsession

33:15.600 --> 33:16.600
for dragon age too.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.960
Well, yeah, I could cause it was even even miles high.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.440
I could see you talking to the guy and kind of romancing the guy, but then you'd be like,

33:22.440 --> 33:24.360
I like this cool Darth Vader chick.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.000
I want to romance her.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.200
That would probably be me.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.200
See?

33:29.200 --> 33:34.280
So I, I, I have to say, I am surprised you're not, and Jamie, don't be afraid to set it

33:34.280 --> 33:35.280
to casual.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.280
You still get achievements and all that.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.800
And then the combat isn't a big deal in the first person stuff.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.120
I don't care as long as I don't hurt myself playing.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
Yeah.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.560
So, but anyway, uh, yeah, so I got to say that I, uh, I'm really enjoying it.

33:45.560 --> 33:50.120
I've already bought mass effect two because I'm waiting for when I finished mass effect

33:50.120 --> 33:53.800
one because I'm apparently not super, super, super far from the end.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.440
I probably have about five more hours to go.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.560
My character's level 33 or 34.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.760
So yeah, that's, that's been my gaming week mass effect and lots of it.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.600
Alan beat it on PC.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.780
He just beat it today.

34:06.780 --> 34:10.040
So I'm like dying to talk about it with him, but not until I beat it too.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.440
So hopefully that'll come Monday or Tuesday.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.440
We'll see.

34:13.440 --> 34:17.440
How can you, how can you be in that close of proximity to someone and not have an ending

34:17.440 --> 34:18.440
spoiled?

34:18.440 --> 34:21.920
You know, what's funny cause he plays in the back room, the, the computer room.

34:21.920 --> 34:26.560
Cause he's playing on PC and I play out here on the three 60 and so I kinda, I can see

34:26.560 --> 34:29.840
what he's doing and I kind of look over his shoulder a little bit, but you know, I'm just

34:29.840 --> 34:33.740
like, Oh, he's in a base or Oh, you know, he's, he's in the planet in the car or whatever.

34:33.740 --> 34:37.280
And then, you know, he'll come out and he'll tell me, Oh, did you know if you do this,

34:37.280 --> 34:41.440
you can do this and this and this, you know, you know, you know, in that cute way.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.280
So all right.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.560
So yeah, that was my gaming week, lots of mass effect.

34:46.560 --> 34:53.920
Um, let's talk about housekeeping, visit our websites, www dot orange laundry.com of course

34:53.920 --> 34:57.120
is our main website, which is graciously hosted by Jason.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.520
And I should also say designed by Deke man.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.720
He deserves a shout out to, he does great work.

35:01.720 --> 35:06.680
Um, and in the upper right hand corner is the, uh, um, extended play box.

35:06.680 --> 35:11.760
I almost said now playing extended play box flashback to PHP, new, right.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.920
Hey, also what we were doing eight years ago.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.480
And you can find the Facebook there.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.760
You can find Google plus there.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.720
You can find just the steam community.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.080
If you are playing mass effect on PC and want to talk to others through steam, you can do

35:23.080 --> 35:24.080
that.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.560
And so a good times, all that stuff at orange launch radio.com.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.360
All right, let's get into gaming news.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.480
There's been been quite a bit of gaming news this week, so Loki's going to start us off

35:31.480 --> 35:32.480
tonight.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.220
Um, so, uh, good news.

35:34.220 --> 35:38.880
If you're an achievement whore, they're going to raise the gamer score allotments for Xbox

35:38.880 --> 35:39.880
live arcade titles.

35:39.880 --> 35:44.880
Now, right now it's currently 200, but that's going to double to 400, uh, with a maximum

35:44.880 --> 35:50.200
of 30 achievements possible instead of 20 also, uh, downloadable content.

35:50.200 --> 35:57.480
Um, they're going to allow, I guess, um, more, uh, gamer score to be added with, um, a hundred

35:57.480 --> 36:04.360
or I guess a hundred with up to eight achievements allowed per quarter, um, with maximum of four

36:04.360 --> 36:05.840
packs allowed over time.

36:05.840 --> 36:10.400
So they're going to allow you to add a lot more gamer score to all that stuff.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.120
And this will take a place, I guess, uh, it's going to start, uh, with titles coming out

36:14.120 --> 36:18.520
between April 1st and May 31st.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.520
I'm kind of surprised.

36:19.520 --> 36:24.680
This is, uh, this is such a problem that there's so many restrictions for Microsoft's.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.560
They're not retail partners, but you know, they're still, they're still going through

36:28.560 --> 36:30.560
the entire Microsoft process.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.800
And it's not like, it's not like indie games can throw in achievements or anything.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.200
Just wait until indie games are allowed to throw in achievements.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.020
I think that will always be off limits.

36:39.020 --> 36:43.780
I think Microsoft has tried to kind of protect the achievement system a little bit, but they

36:43.780 --> 36:47.000
do and they don't like in some ways they do, but in some ways they've been really lazy

36:47.000 --> 36:51.040
about it because you know, there's some games like wasn't like the avatar, avatar, last

36:51.040 --> 36:52.040
airbender.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.040
Yeah.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.640
The last airbender, not the, um, uh, blue people movie, but the avatar last airbender

36:56.640 --> 37:00.160
apparently had just easy achievements where it's like literally press X as fast as you

37:00.160 --> 37:02.180
can get a thousand gamer score.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.080
Like really, really.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.760
So some of it seems to kind of slip by, but otherwise, you know, Microsoft's been very

37:07.760 --> 37:12.340
much about like, they don't, you know, they've, they've bombed people's scores to zero when

37:12.340 --> 37:14.720
they suspect that they're like cheating and all this stuff.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.720
Like they're very protective of it.

37:15.720 --> 37:20.760
It's real easy to cheat if you want to, but it's, I mean, they're going to notice.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.240
So you just don't do that.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.720
Hey, look, I achieved all of my achievements in about five minutes.

37:26.720 --> 37:31.800
And if it's not by avatar, then, uh, well, I mean, you can just, you just mod your, your,

37:31.800 --> 37:38.080
uh, you know, actual, um, your user account on your system, and then you can add games

37:38.080 --> 37:41.420
that you don't have never played and just give yourself a thousand achievement points.

37:41.420 --> 37:44.880
But I mean, they're going to notice that, Oh, your, your gamer score jumped by a hundred

37:44.880 --> 37:45.880
thousand.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.440
That's a little odd.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.440
I will never forget.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.000
Speaking of getting banned by, from Xbox live because of achievements and all this stuff,

37:52.000 --> 37:56.400
I will never forget the time I was playing dance, dance revolution universe on Xbox 360

37:56.400 --> 37:57.480
for the first time.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.920
And I got the message from strip club DJ.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.520
Does anybody remember that name on Xbox 360?

38:02.520 --> 38:05.320
He was the guy that had like the most points ever.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.800
And like, he sent me a message like, are the achievements in that game are hard to get?

38:08.800 --> 38:13.240
Apparently I was, I had bought the game on release day and I was playing it so much that

38:13.240 --> 38:15.720
I had more achievement points than anybody on that game at that point.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.040
And you could see that on some of the community sites.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.240
So he was sending me messages like how hard are the achievements?

38:20.240 --> 38:23.760
So like, you know, asking me questions, I'll just never forget that because that struck

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
me as funny.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
So anyhow.

38:25.760 --> 38:30.840
Well, what do you think though about the arcade games going up to 400 points?

38:30.840 --> 38:36.560
It's you know, in some ways it's achievements, whatever, but in other ways, you know, since

38:36.560 --> 38:41.680
the, the downloadable games are getting more expensive, they are becoming more richer,

38:41.680 --> 38:42.680
richer experiences.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.000
Like it's not, it's not ports of time pilot anymore.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.880
You know, we're getting games like limbo and we're getting HD remixes.

38:50.880 --> 38:54.680
Not the time pilots, a bad game, but yeah, now we're getting, you know, other stuff and

38:54.680 --> 38:59.760
a lot of the greatest games to come out are download braid, you know, there's the portal

38:59.760 --> 39:02.800
was a standalone game, you know, for download and stuff.

39:02.800 --> 39:06.660
There's so much good stuff that, you know, it kind of deserves to be bumped up a little

39:06.660 --> 39:07.660
bit, I think.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.880
So, all right.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.880
So there you go.

39:10.880 --> 39:16.960
Uh, the achievement points are going to be going up, uh, what might be going up or down?

39:16.960 --> 39:17.960
I don't know.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.620
Is Capcom stock depending on a street fighter cross Tekken and how this has been received

39:21.620 --> 39:27.520
and on the three 60 not so well, as we mentioned last week on the show, a four player co-op

39:27.520 --> 39:32.700
mode is not on the three 60 version, even though it's there in the instruction manual

39:32.700 --> 39:36.900
and it's there in the PlayStation three version, just so you know, that's when you and a friend

39:36.900 --> 39:43.260
go online or you and a friend or local, you go online and take on another pair of people.

39:43.260 --> 39:48.600
And uh, it was addressed by Tomaki Ayano, the assistant producer of the game in a Capcom

39:48.600 --> 39:52.960
unity blog statement throughout the, excuse me, throughout the development process.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.460
There are times when new features are added and we added a lot of them.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.480
And there are also times where we have to make tough decisions regarding things to cut.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.800
This was one of those times this mode is supported in the PlayStation three version.

40:03.800 --> 40:07.760
However, since we tackled that earlier and found the architecture of their system to

40:07.760 --> 40:10.720
be more conducive to implementing it.

40:10.720 --> 40:15.880
So at first we thought they were full of shit because you know, there's other games that

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
you can play co-op.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.600
Like it wasn't the first excuse you can't go co-op and go online.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.600
Yeah.

40:21.600 --> 40:26.200
But now it seems like a matter of it's too, it was too hard and we had deadlines to meet

40:26.200 --> 40:28.760
or Sony paid us a lot of money.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.760
I don't know if it's that.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.960
Well, I mean, you never know if stranger things have happened.

40:31.960 --> 40:37.560
That may be true, but then you should create a second manual for the Xbox three 60 version.

40:37.560 --> 40:41.080
Still is saying, that's just poor, you know, Hey, uh, this mode's available.

40:41.080 --> 40:45.760
Oh, but it's not, it really seems like to me it was a deadline thing.

40:45.760 --> 40:49.400
But it's still very poor taste, it's false advertising.

40:49.400 --> 40:53.520
I understand that, you know, that you had to work on all that DLC that was going to

40:53.520 --> 40:54.520
be on disc.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.040
So, you know, that might've taken some extra time.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.880
I would have traded kick for comp mode.

41:00.880 --> 41:04.720
It's really stupid that that's even, you know, Oh, it was too hard.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.240
I don't know how to program well enough.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.760
It was so hard.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.000
I mean, come on.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.880
I mean, this is something that's in a lot of games saying, you know, I think halo call,

41:14.880 --> 41:15.880
I don't know about Call of Duty.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.680
I know Borderlands had, you know, you can do split screen and then go online and play

41:19.680 --> 41:21.240
with other people and stuff like that.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.440
Moral combat had it.

41:23.440 --> 41:24.720
It's just, that's ridiculous.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.920
Oh, well, we didn't know how to do it.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.720
Well, I'm sure if you asked Microsoft, Hey, how do you do this?

41:30.720 --> 41:32.560
They would have probably told you how to do it.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.080
Speaking of Microsoft allowing and not allowing things, frankly, I thought that was pretty

41:37.080 --> 41:41.560
much a required feature for any co-op game to be certified and released for the three

41:41.560 --> 41:42.560
60.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.920
Uh, no, I don't, I don't think it was.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.720
Um, I mean, I've seen, obviously not cause that happened.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.320
I've seen plenty of games where you don't have to have cause sometimes, you know, doing

41:51.320 --> 41:58.160
split screen, um, not every, there's not enough screen space after you split it in half.

41:58.160 --> 42:04.720
Um, well, what I want to know is, you know, since this is not on the show role, um, so

42:04.720 --> 42:07.800
what's everybody think about the doubt, their whole DLC plan?

42:07.800 --> 42:10.600
Oh, I thought I was supposed to do that here too.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.600
That's all right.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.600
Yeah.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.720
The DLC plan, uh, what, 20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall, right?

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
Yeah.

42:16.720 --> 42:19.720
20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall.

42:19.720 --> 42:24.760
Um, and they're going to have costume packs as well, which I think was another $13.

42:24.760 --> 42:28.040
I want to say it's 13 different packs for a dollar or something like that.

42:28.040 --> 42:33.200
Well, the release about it really felt like it was trying to butter up the community.

42:33.200 --> 42:37.760
Like they knew that there was this big backlash about it and it really read to me like, Hey

42:37.760 --> 42:41.200
guys, it's not going to be as bad as y'all were thinking.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.720
LOL at you thinking it was going to be five bucks each character.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.720
We're not doing that guys.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.200
Oh no, we're not complete assholes this time.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.360
We're just pretty big assholes.

42:50.360 --> 42:55.340
You know, it's just there, there's still a percentage of us that we're not completely

42:55.340 --> 42:57.960
assholes about this stuff.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.720
And you know, that's, that's great and all that, you know, they're saying that it's going

43:01.720 --> 43:07.320
to be $20 for, you know, all the characters, except there's a problem.

43:07.320 --> 43:13.360
It's not all of the characters because you do remember that even though they are PlayStation

43:13.360 --> 43:21.240
exclusive, you know, uh, Pac-Man and bad box art or troll mega man is, um, still on the

43:21.240 --> 43:23.040
disc for an Xbox 360.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.720
So that means there's still going to be one more piece of download content that they're

43:25.720 --> 43:30.360
going to have available to, uh, you know, get access to those characters.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
In fact, here we go.

43:31.360 --> 43:34.240
I'm going to pull this up right now so we can, what'd you say last week?

43:34.240 --> 43:37.640
Like Cole is on the 360 disc, which is ironic.

43:37.640 --> 43:43.920
No, Cole's not on the 360 disc, but the Pac-Man and, um, uh, both Pac-Man and bad box art

43:43.920 --> 43:45.920
mega man are on the disc.

43:45.920 --> 43:51.400
Uh, so yeah, anyways, here's what it's going to end up being, uh, April 3rd, they're going

43:51.400 --> 43:53.720
to have alternate costumes go on sale.

43:53.720 --> 43:59.560
Those are going to set you back a dollar each, or you can buy all of them for $13.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.480
Um, then they're going to release some free colors.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.480
Oh, thank you.

44:03.480 --> 44:06.960
There were, there were some free things they were trying to look at all this shit.

44:06.960 --> 44:11.240
You're going to get for free costumes and gem slots.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.760
And then this is the pay stuff, you know, characters free stuff.

44:14.760 --> 44:15.760
Yeah.

44:15.760 --> 44:19.720
And then, uh, I guess in April, they're also going to do a free tournament support update,

44:19.720 --> 44:24.520
and they're going to be adding some, uh, three new assist gem packs.

44:24.520 --> 44:29.640
So they're, I guess they're going to be selling those, um, or something, I don't know, um,

44:29.640 --> 44:34.800
which a total of, uh, 60 gems to selection pool, I guess, um, but yeah, those 12 characters

44:34.800 --> 44:38.480
already on disc will not be unlocked until the fall.

44:38.480 --> 44:42.400
Meanwhile, hackers are already been playing with them online.

44:42.400 --> 44:47.560
So wait, can I go online at three 16 and suddenly I'm playing against somebody who is Blanca

44:47.560 --> 44:48.840
or one of the locked characters.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.840
Yeah.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.840
They basically, what they do is they, they swap all the assets and art and stuff like

44:53.840 --> 45:00.200
that and character data for the DLC characters and they move it to one of the regular characters

45:00.200 --> 45:01.200
in the game.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.200
They kind of flip flop stuff.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.240
So, uh, but yeah, fantastic.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.240
And job cap.

45:06.240 --> 45:10.000
Oh, and, and, and on top of all that, you know, cause you're going to have to pay $20

45:10.000 --> 45:13.840
for that or you know what you get by the Vita version, which is probably gonna be like 40

45:13.840 --> 45:14.840
bucks.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.120
So it's cheaper and has more content.

45:16.120 --> 45:19.120
Let me read some comments from a hit stun in our chat room at chat.org.com.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.600
He has a lot to say on this hit stun says street fighter cross tech and online kind

45:22.600 --> 45:23.600
of sucks anyway.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.600
I'm glad I didn't buy it.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.920
The game is clearly unfinished.

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
Wait until fall.

45:26.920 --> 45:27.920
It'll be better.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.920
$20.

45:28.920 --> 45:35.640
I fucking called it, um, making this an $80 game, but I'm thinking not by fall.

45:35.640 --> 45:36.640
Wait until fall.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.640
Yeah.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.320
Because in the world, cause the price will drop inevitably to try and get the extra sales

45:41.320 --> 45:46.480
for Christmas and enough updates and the Vita version is going to be out.

45:46.480 --> 45:50.280
And I'm telling you guys it's on the disc because they're going to repackage it and

45:50.280 --> 45:54.800
just throw in codes that will allow people to unlock the characters for the 60 bucks.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.560
You're going to get it for free in the fall.

45:56.560 --> 45:57.560
Here's the thing too.

45:57.560 --> 46:02.480
Remember how they said they're not going to do like a special, um, you know, arcade edition,

46:02.480 --> 46:03.920
gold edition, whatever.

46:03.920 --> 46:07.200
Let's just assume that they've sold quite a few copies.

46:07.200 --> 46:12.200
I mean, we're going to say that they're going to sell a million copies probably on, um,

46:12.200 --> 46:13.200
on each system.

46:13.200 --> 46:17.680
Uh, let's just say, cause that, I mean, that's a pretty safe bet considering now to that.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.200
So the greatest hits additional come out.

46:19.200 --> 46:23.040
They won't really say anything, but it'll include the DLC characters on disc or something

46:23.040 --> 46:24.040
like that.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.760
And they'll, they'll drop the price cause they've done that with like what Call of Duty

46:27.760 --> 46:31.880
just had a rerelease for black ops and modern warfare two with the DLC or at least the first

46:31.880 --> 46:33.880
DLC pack, um, included with it.

46:33.880 --> 46:37.280
Now I don't think it's on disc, but it's still code with it.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.360
And I mean, midnight club LA has done that.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.040
I mean, there's plenty of other games that have done that.

46:41.040 --> 46:46.720
I think mass effect, um, had DLC on the disc, uh, for, or included at least a voucher or

46:46.720 --> 46:51.520
something like that when it was re-released, so I could see them doing this.

46:51.520 --> 46:56.000
I'm probably just going to get the Vita version to be honest, if I get it, I don't know at

46:56.000 --> 46:58.400
this point as a, do I need another fighting game that badly?

46:58.400 --> 46:59.960
Yeah, maybe not.

46:59.960 --> 47:06.320
So do you think they got it out in this state in order to allow people to prep for Evo?

47:06.320 --> 47:09.420
Give enough people to get it set so that it can be played as a part of Evo and people

47:09.420 --> 47:12.840
to get their strategies down and actually learn the game to participate in it?

47:12.840 --> 47:16.160
No, I think they just released the game now, so it would make this financial quarter.

47:16.160 --> 47:21.480
I think that's, at the end of the day, they wanted it in this fiscal year.

47:21.480 --> 47:25.480
I think the fan community doesn't mean shit in this circumstance, it's just a convenient

47:25.480 --> 47:26.480
perk.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.280
I think you're right about the fiscal year thing, because really, what have they had

47:29.280 --> 47:30.900
during this last fiscal year?

47:30.900 --> 47:34.800
They had Dead Rising 2, um, you know, off the record in that kind of thing.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.200
The Resident Evil 3DS game.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.320
Yeah, but that's a 3DS game.

47:39.320 --> 47:45.360
I mean, I don't think that's, that's like a, that's kind of niche, that's not a big

47:45.360 --> 47:46.360
revenue for them.

47:46.360 --> 47:50.960
Um, you know, they didn't have any Resident Evil games.

47:50.960 --> 47:53.960
There was no Resident Evil games last year.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.400
Was it Gold Edition last year?

47:55.400 --> 47:56.400
No, I don't...

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
What system?

47:57.400 --> 48:01.600
It was Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.020
I don't know if that was last year.

48:03.020 --> 48:05.280
That may have been last March, but that was still a re-release.

48:05.280 --> 48:14.120
Um, I guess they had Street Fighter, oh, Marvel, um, was it Marvel vs. Capcom 3, they had that.

48:14.120 --> 48:18.280
But still, that, I don't think that did that, I mean, it did alright, but it wasn't like

48:18.280 --> 48:20.280
big, big, big numbers.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.720
I don't know.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.480
Alright, well, we'll see, um, it'll be interesting when the sales numbers come out at the end

48:26.480 --> 48:27.480
of the month.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
I'm looking forward to seeing those.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.320
Meanwhile, let's move on with some more gaming news.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.320
Dark Soccer.

48:31.320 --> 48:34.680
Well, this is hopefully something a little bit happier.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.520
In fact, I want this more than I want a Vita.

48:37.520 --> 48:42.760
I want it more than a 3DS, because I love everything Neo Geo.

48:42.760 --> 48:47.480
And there's a new Neo Geo portable coming out, the Neo Geo X.

48:47.480 --> 48:53.000
And it is going to come with 20 games already built into it.

48:53.000 --> 49:01.160
And it's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with SD card expansion, AV output, and like I said, 20

49:01.160 --> 49:02.160
games already included.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.360
Which I probably own most of them.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.640
Including Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars, Cyberlip, Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury Special,

49:08.640 --> 49:12.640
Football Frenzy, Kingdom Monsters, The Last Resort, League Bowling, Magician Lord, awesome

49:12.640 --> 49:17.800
Metal Slug, even more awesome, Mutation Nation, NAMM 1975, Samurai Shodowns, Sengoku Super

49:17.800 --> 49:23.040
Sidekicks, King of Fighters 94, which was the best, Ultimate Eleven, Top Players, Golf,

49:23.040 --> 49:24.520
and World Heroes.

49:24.520 --> 49:27.280
But when is Windjammer is going to be available for it?

49:27.280 --> 49:28.280
Really?

49:28.280 --> 49:30.960
Oh man, I adore that game.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.840
Baseball Stars is the saving grace in that list for me personally.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.560
That was a, whenever I came across a multi-cap with that in it, I was pretty happy, but Windjammer

49:37.560 --> 49:38.560
was so fun.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.560
You know I have that game.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.560
The cartridge.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.720
I heard that.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.680
It's fun.

49:44.680 --> 49:51.200
So they don't have a price up on it yet, but it's going to be distributed by Tomo in North

49:51.200 --> 49:54.520
America, and that's for the limited edition.

49:54.520 --> 49:59.360
In Europe it will be released by Blaze.

49:59.360 --> 50:05.620
It better be cheap, because I can tell you right now, that looks just like a reskin Dingu.

50:05.620 --> 50:06.620
Because the Dingu...

50:06.620 --> 50:08.200
The Dingu ate my baby!

50:08.200 --> 50:10.640
Not that, not a Dingo, a Dingu.

50:10.640 --> 50:15.560
A Dingu is basically, it was like an emulation device, and it had all the same features and

50:15.560 --> 50:18.320
looked exactly the same as that.

50:18.320 --> 50:22.680
And it played Neo Geo games, of course you have to have the ROMs form, but it played

50:22.680 --> 50:26.680
Neo Geo games and it, I swear to God, the thing is just a Dingu.

50:26.680 --> 50:30.080
It looks exactly the same.

50:30.080 --> 50:32.240
And the Dingus, I think they're under $100.

50:32.240 --> 50:35.760
So if that thing is over $100, eh, not worth it.

50:35.760 --> 50:38.680
You can make the same argument for the FC Ultras, right?

50:38.680 --> 50:42.640
The portable, what was it, SNES, NES, and I think maybe even Genesis in a more recent

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
version?

50:43.640 --> 50:46.480
If you could put a Blackberry phone on it, would it be a Dinguberry?

50:46.480 --> 50:51.000
No one wants to put a Blackberry phone on anything.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.980
Cue sad trombone.

50:54.980 --> 51:00.100
And to go back to what you were saying, you're curious about the sales for Street Fighter

51:00.100 --> 51:06.560
Cross Tekken, the first week's sales, Street Fighter Cross Tekken in the US, $240,000 on

51:06.560 --> 51:10.280
the PS3, and $117,000 on 360.

51:10.280 --> 51:15.040
Oh, that's interesting that it's doing so much better on PlayStation 3, I guess the

51:15.040 --> 51:16.040
word got out about the modes.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.760
Well, considering that the PS3 seems to be the better version with more characters in

51:19.760 --> 51:22.960
there, and it works, and it has all these features.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.960
Interesting, okay, alright.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.160
I also found out something really weird just now.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.640
Those sound like good numbers though, yes Starfire.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.640
That I hadn't realized.

51:29.640 --> 51:33.000
Ragnarok Online is hitting their 10th anniversary.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Wow.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Old.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
And it's still going.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Just saying.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
And to celebrate the 10 year anniversary, they're banning everything.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
It's older than well.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.320
I apologize because I left the room for a quick minute, but are you going to get one

51:47.320 --> 51:49.400
of these little Neo Geos?

51:49.400 --> 51:50.400
I don't know.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.400
I want one.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.400
I don't know.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.520
It sounds like a tiny screen.

51:54.520 --> 51:57.580
Because I mean, seriously, all of the games on there, the ones that I would want to play

51:57.580 --> 52:02.600
are ones that I likely already own either on Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket Color, or a

52:02.600 --> 52:03.600
Neo Geo.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.560
3.5 inches is the same size as an iPhone.

52:06.560 --> 52:09.880
And iPhone isn't fun to play certain games on.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
Certain games.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.240
But this won't just be a touch screen.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.240
Big difference.

52:13.240 --> 52:16.720
Games that are designed for the iPhone are great on the iPhone.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.680
Games that they try to port from frickin' Playstation to the iPhone are not so great.

52:21.680 --> 52:27.600
It's okay with some of the arcade games, like X-Men played just fine, and Espa-ga-ba-ba-ba-bluda

52:27.600 --> 52:31.200
too.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.520
Robot Unicorn Attack plays really, really well on the iPhone.

52:34.520 --> 52:35.680
See, that was made for the iPhone.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.680
The Dingo doesn't...

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
No it wasn't.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
It was made for Flash.

52:38.680 --> 52:39.680
Oh yeah.

52:39.680 --> 52:43.600
It almost looks like it could be an upgraded Dingo, because the Dingo doesn't have a 3.5

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
inch screen.

52:44.600 --> 52:51.000
It's only 2.8 inches LCD, but I mean, it has the video out and everything, and it looks

52:51.000 --> 52:52.600
goddamn the same, so...

52:52.600 --> 52:54.160
It's a Super Dingo.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.680
It could be a Super Dingo.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.520
Alright.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.920
More gaming news, Loki.

52:59.920 --> 53:03.000
Alright, let's not talk about the Dingo anymore.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.760
Quick before I make another bad joke.

53:04.760 --> 53:07.080
God, we don't want to do that.

53:07.080 --> 53:11.000
Baldur's Gate is coming back, and they're doing an enhanced edition.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.340
It's going to be coming out this summer.

53:14.340 --> 53:22.720
And of course Baldur's Gate was produced by Wizard of the Coast, or I should say Atari

53:22.720 --> 53:27.220
is publishing it, but it's based off the D&D stuff.

53:27.220 --> 53:32.280
And the enhanced edition is going to be kind of like an HD remake.

53:32.280 --> 53:36.720
They're also talking that they may be doing Baldur's Gate 2 as well, which is kind of

53:36.720 --> 53:38.000
neat.

53:38.000 --> 53:47.280
But yeah, not much more I guess is kind of out about it right now, but it'll be pretty

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
cool.

53:48.280 --> 53:52.080
Just to put it in perspective, these are some legendary PC games, and funny enough, I believe

53:52.080 --> 53:55.840
the original was done by Bioware to kind of bring things full circle.

53:55.840 --> 53:59.360
I don't think they own the rights anymore, I think that's why they're getting this now,

53:59.360 --> 54:03.800
but yeah, I'm interested.

54:03.800 --> 54:09.020
I remember vaguely playing the old ones briefly, but I never, I didn't play them start to finish,

54:09.020 --> 54:11.900
so I'm definitely interested in this.

54:11.900 --> 54:12.900
Take a second look.

54:12.900 --> 54:13.900
What about you, Loki?

54:13.900 --> 54:14.900
Is this something you might be interested in?

54:14.900 --> 54:16.800
I never played the original, so meh.

54:16.800 --> 54:18.920
Nah, not interested.

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
Alright.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.240
Well, maybe this is something that will interest you, Loki.

54:22.240 --> 54:29.520
I don't know if you're a fan of Diablo, but Diablo 3 finally, finally has a date, and

54:29.520 --> 54:32.980
in case you've been living under a rock or something, and you don't ever check Twitter

54:32.980 --> 54:39.960
because everybody was reporting it like it was news, May 15th 2012 is the date.

54:39.960 --> 54:43.400
Let me tell you some other things maybe you may not have caught, you know, besides just

54:43.400 --> 54:44.800
the date news.

54:44.800 --> 54:50.000
It is an international launch, so the game is going to be available in many different

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
countries all at the exact same time.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.060
You can digitally pre-order the game now, meaning I guess you download the whole darn

54:58.060 --> 55:02.400
thing to your computer, you can pre-purchase it now, and you'll be ready to play when the

55:02.400 --> 55:03.400
game goes live.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.840
I'm just asking for someone to crack that.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.240
Well, you know, Blizzard's done this before with some of their other games.

55:07.240 --> 55:11.860
I think they leave a few crucial pieces of the puzzle out, because, you know, before

55:11.860 --> 55:15.840
the game unlocks, you know, the launch day, you'll get a patch that's a couple megabytes.

55:15.840 --> 55:20.240
So I think they conveniently leave some important things out, and don't forget, Diablo 3 is

55:20.240 --> 55:22.820
going to require that constant online connection.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.600
Very controversial.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.720
So maybe that's part of how they're going to keep people out of it.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.640
That all has to be cracked.

55:28.640 --> 55:29.640
We'll see, we'll see.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.480
Well, it was easy enough with the Ubisoft games.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.480
Who knows?

55:33.480 --> 55:34.480
Who knows?

55:34.480 --> 55:35.480
Uh...

55:35.480 --> 55:36.480
I don't think that's a very fair comparison.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.480
Yeah, well...

55:37.480 --> 55:38.480
Blizzard and Ubisoft.

55:38.480 --> 55:39.480
They're not...

55:39.480 --> 55:40.480
Well, see, here's the thing.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.240
Blizzard's claiming, anyway, they're not doing it for DRM.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.820
They're doing it for the...

55:43.820 --> 55:47.000
They don't want people cloning the items and all that, like all the item distribution

55:47.000 --> 55:48.680
is going through the servers and all that.

55:48.680 --> 55:49.680
I'm just saying.

55:49.680 --> 55:50.680
All right.

55:50.680 --> 55:51.680
We'll see.

55:51.680 --> 55:52.680
We'll see.

55:52.680 --> 55:53.680
I know what they're saying.

55:53.680 --> 55:54.680
Hackers gonna hack.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.920
So we'll see if people get into this before May 15th, but it didn't happen with Starcraft

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
2.

55:58.920 --> 55:59.920
I don't know.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.440
Is that rule 35?

56:01.440 --> 56:02.680
If it exists, it's hacked?

56:02.680 --> 56:04.760
Yeah, well, you know the old saying, haters gonna hate.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.100
It's just like, hackers gonna hack.

56:06.100 --> 56:07.900
It's the same thing.

56:07.900 --> 56:11.740
We always talk about this company says, this device is unhackable.

56:11.740 --> 56:12.740
Hackers gonna hack.

56:12.740 --> 56:13.740
Huh?

56:13.740 --> 56:15.740
Master's gonna bait.

56:15.740 --> 56:17.560
Yes, master's gonna bait.

56:17.560 --> 56:18.560
Dingus gonna...

56:18.560 --> 56:21.720
All right.

56:21.720 --> 56:25.540
By the way, if you want to get your free copy of Diablo III for signing up for the World

56:25.540 --> 56:27.240
of Warcraft Blood Pact.

56:27.240 --> 56:31.080
Actually, they call it something else, annual pass or something, but basically you're signing

56:31.080 --> 56:36.100
your life away to Blizzard saying, yes, Blizzard, I will pay you penance for a full year and

56:36.100 --> 56:38.280
you will give me a flying horse.

56:38.280 --> 56:41.520
You will give me a beta access to panda people, pandaria.

56:41.520 --> 56:43.320
I want to sign up.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.160
And you get your free copy of Diablo.

56:45.160 --> 56:49.520
Well, Dark Soccer, if you want to sign up, you got to do it before May 1st, because that's

56:49.520 --> 56:53.760
the day the deal is done and you will not be able to do that anymore.

56:53.760 --> 57:00.320
Also, if you feel like it, you can get the collector's edition, $99.99 for Diablo III

57:00.320 --> 57:01.320
collector's edition.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.360
That would only be in stores though, just so you know, because it's kind of hard to

57:04.360 --> 57:06.280
do a online collector's edition.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
Yeah.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.600
You can't download a specially crafted USB drive through your computer.

57:10.600 --> 57:13.800
That would be a little difficult, but you could get fairy wings for your character,

57:13.800 --> 57:17.160
which apparently is part of the deluxe pack-in collector's edition.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.160
There you go.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.160
All right.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.960
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us next in gaming news?

57:21.960 --> 57:27.920
Well, in other news, there is a very happy news for all of us Portal 2 fans.

57:27.920 --> 57:32.200
They won the BAFTA for the British Academy.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.560
My God, it's been a year and it's still winning awards.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.240
Well, they beat out Skyrim.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.240
Skyrim got nothing.

57:38.240 --> 57:39.240
Wow.

57:39.240 --> 57:40.240
Yeah.

57:40.240 --> 57:44.560
So- For you, Portal 2, you go, Portal 2, and none

57:44.560 --> 57:50.780
for Elder Scrolls V. Well, basically, the other, yeah, the big

57:50.780 --> 57:57.440
rivals that it had was Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and Deus Ex.

57:57.440 --> 58:08.960
And it won, I believe, three awards for design, for story, and it looks like game of the year.

58:08.960 --> 58:15.340
So as far as others that won, Battlefield 3 won the public vote, so it had the game

58:15.340 --> 58:20.320
award of 2011, and the BAFTA for online multiplayer and audio.

58:20.320 --> 58:22.840
But that's like the people's choice award, and you know, who-

58:22.840 --> 58:23.840
But it's still-

58:23.840 --> 58:24.840
Who watches that?

58:24.840 --> 58:26.440
It's still, it's pretty, well-

58:26.440 --> 58:27.440
I'm kidding.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.440
It is a big deal.

58:28.440 --> 58:33.080
But Portal 2, you know, I just think it's funny that Skyrim got nothing, and Deus Ex

58:33.080 --> 58:35.440
also got nothing, which was supposed to be a pretty good game.

58:35.440 --> 58:36.440
Oh, yeah.

58:36.440 --> 58:37.440
Oh, yeah.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.160
And, oh, it only took about five seconds, and there's your joke.

58:39.160 --> 58:43.120
Sturlok says, Skyrim took an arrow to the knee.

58:43.120 --> 58:47.160
No, no, no.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.160
It deserves more.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.880
The arrow to the dinghy in about a minute if you make that joke again.

58:50.880 --> 58:55.800
It deserves more than them.

58:55.800 --> 59:01.920
And Acidic Vampire, now this is a great joke, Acidic Vampire asks, was the award a potato?

59:01.920 --> 59:04.280
A potato.

59:04.280 --> 59:07.280
So here's what won.

59:07.280 --> 59:14.180
Batman Arkham City won for action, artistic achievement was Rayman Origins, debut game

59:14.180 --> 59:15.760
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet-

59:15.760 --> 59:18.240
Oh, I heard a scoff over there on Rayman Origins.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.920
All I have to say, play that on a Vita.

59:20.920 --> 59:21.920
My god.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.920
It is gorgeous.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.920
Is so-

59:24.920 --> 59:27.440
Portal 2 and best game.

59:27.440 --> 59:31.960
Design was Portal 2, family was LittleBigPlanet 2, game innovation LittleBigPlanet 2, mobile

59:31.960 --> 59:39.640
and handheld was PEGL HD, go fig, online browser was Monstermind, online multiplayer Battlefield

59:39.640 --> 59:40.980
3.

59:40.980 --> 59:41.980
This is cool.

59:41.980 --> 59:47.520
Music, LA Noire, and performer Mark Hamill as the Joker, which was his last time playing

59:47.520 --> 59:48.520
the Joker.

59:48.520 --> 59:49.520
Yes.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
In Arkham City.

59:50.520 --> 59:55.960
For sports and fitness, Connect Sports 2, for story, Portal 2, strategy, Total War Shogun

59:55.960 --> 01:00:03.200
2, BAFTA wants to watch award TikTok Toys, and game award of 2011 was Battlefield 3.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.000
At least PopCap took mobile and not something by Zynga, I don't know what the eligibility

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.200
is, but I'm fine with PEGL winning a mobile award.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.080
Now, apparently with Valve going up to the podium so many times and making speeches,

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.040
they actually dedicated one of their speeches to Bethesda, the makers of Skyrim.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:28.240
It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal, you get nothing, you lose, good day

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240
sir.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.320
Well that's very unsportsmanlike of them, that was a pretty rude speech.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.320
I love Gene Wilder.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.680
I know, we're not hating on them, before you send in the angry, Skyrim is a good game,

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.120
you should not make fun of it, I know Skyrim is a good game, it's a great game, it's a

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.120
phenomenal game, it's a buggy as fuck game, but it's good.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.220
It's just, for me, Portal 2, oh my god it was like perfect, so I'm happy to hear it's

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:55.000
winning all these awards, even overseas.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.180
Alrighty, let's travel around the world and check out some games that might win awards

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:05.880
next year, or maybe not, let's see what releases are coming out this week around the world.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.040
We'll start with the US, Loki.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.000
Absolutely, no I'm just kidding, there's actually stuff coming out this week, Ninja Gaiden 3

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.280
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, including there's even a fancy version that's not necessarily

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:27.600
made by Tecmo Koei, but it's from, was it, oh man I can't remember the publisher for

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600
it.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.920
Anyways, it just comes with this really cheesy move sword attachment that you can swing around

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:41.480
with because the target audience for Ninja Gaiden is going to be someone that's interested

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.920
in crap that attaches to your move controller, or even playing with the move controller in

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920
that game.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.200
Because we haven't had enough projectiles breaking TVs, now we have a mock sword to

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.600
do it with.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600
Exactly.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600
Recipe.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.540
And then, of course, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.760
this week as well, a game called Gogo's Crazy Bones.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.220
I'm guessing based off of a toy, I'm not really sure.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.520
Let's see, we also have Dirt 3 The Complete Edition, which is going to be re-released

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:24.440
with Dirt 3 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Armored Core 5 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360,

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:31.840
Silent Hill HD Collection on PS3 and 360, Pampered, or Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Resort for the 3DS, oooh!

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.840
Got it pre-ordered?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.800
No, I don't have that one pre-ordered, but let's-

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.960
Please tell me more about what it, Pampered Pets, Polly picked a pack of pickled pepper

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
pampered pets-

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.400
It's Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort, it's where you put sunglasses and bows on,

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.400
like, animals.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.400
Wasn't that a really bad episode of Pokemon?

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.960
There is an audience for this.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.360
I just want to point out, this goes back to an argument, it's convenient we have a guest

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.360
on the show who hasn't been here for about 8 years, because I'm about to do an argument

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.960
that's about 5 years old.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:13.840
It astounds me that we can get Polly's peppered pickled pals and pampering game, but we can't

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840
get President Cat.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.400
The fuck is wrong with this country?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.200
It's this country, and that's what the fuck wrong with it.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.200
That's not all.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:30.480
In case Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort is not for you, let's ride Best of Breed 3D

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480
for the 3DS.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.960
That's right, it is a horse racing.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.280
Does that come with a move attachment in your butt?

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.280
It is not.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.720
Let's ride.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720
For the Kinect-

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.680
Instead of friending your butt, it'll ride your butt.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:52.600
Kinect Rush, a Disney Pixar adventure on the Xbox 360, and then of course, let's see, rounding

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:58.880
things out, Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai for the PC, and Kid Icarus Uprising

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.800
for the 3DS.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.080
That's it.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.560
Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.880
On the 3DS, there's a brand new 3DS.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.600
Okay, it's not a reskin or anything like that, it's just a new color, but Cobalt Blue will

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.080
be available from March the 22nd in Japan, so if you want Cobalt Blue, there you go.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.280
In Hikari Shinwa, Palutena no Kagami comes out on March 22nd in Japan.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280
Anyone know what that is?

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280
Huh?

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
Huh?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
That's-

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280
That's Kid Icarus.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
That is, that's their version of Kid Icarus.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280
So there you go.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.080
Apparently, there's also some 3DSs coming out in pink and white.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.240
I think those colors already exist, but now they will have Mario 3D Land as a pack-in

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240
game.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.960
So those will be out very soon on the 24th in Japan as well.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.040
Let's go over to the Vita and see what the Vita's getting this week.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.720
Little Busters, converted edition.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.320
Is that like Little Deviants?

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320
No.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.120
That's definitely not Little Deviants.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.280
These girls look like Deviants of a different sort.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.120
But Little Busters is, you know, another one of those anime-

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.120
Dating sim!

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.080
Yeah, probably.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.180
And let's see, what else is coming out?

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.760
Checking quickly on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.200
PlayStation 3, quite a bit.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.440
Devil May Cry HD Collection.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.360
Fallout New Vegas, the ultimate edition, Ninja Gaiden 3, regular and collector's edition.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:26.160
A-to-Teki Yugi Mugen Souls comes out this week from Compile.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160
Wait a minute.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.160
Compile!

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160
Compile's back?

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.680
Compile never went away.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.160
Who made Guardian Legend?

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.960
Compile?

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.400
I thought they were not around anymore, because that was the reason we weren't getting a new

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.800
Guardian Legend game.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.500
You can get- Compile made other games.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.160
I thought they broke up years ago.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.800
Hold on, let me do some research.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.960
I need to know if Compile is back and making this game, which actually looks kind of cute,

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.520
because it's like anime babes, but there's definitely like these action-y sequences,

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:05.800
and then there's this whole little like, uh-oh, you might see my naughty bits if they weren't

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.380
covered in secret tape.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.320
They were famed for developing shooters and puzzle games such as Alest and Puyo Puyo.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:19.680
Following the bankruptcy of Compile in two- okay, that was 2002, site was up until 2007,

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:26.480
where it redirected to Compile Station, owned by D4 Enterprise, Inc., and, uh, company spun

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:32.680
off Milestone that had arcade shoot-em-ups, and Compile Heart hopes to revive the Compile

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:38.640
brand name with the assistance of former Compile employees like Puyo Puyo creator Mu Nhatani.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.960
Okay, so apparently Compile has been- And they made the Spriggan game.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.680
Compile- I've heard of Compile Heart, so Compile has been to the moon and back, so, um, okay,

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.840
now- So bankruptcy wasn't necessarily the end of

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.840
the company.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.720
Well, can I just, just for a moment, moment say, I'd like to please compile, if you're

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.040
listening, consider, you know, it's been what, 26 years and we're getting a new Kid Icarus

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.040
game?

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
I think the time has come for us to get a new Guardian Legend.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
We need a new Gartic.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
Gartic?

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040
They need to- Gartic 3.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040
You know what they need to do?

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040
What?

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.480
They need to release Gartic and Gartic 2, because we didn't get Gartic over here.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.480
Right, no we didn't.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.480
We got the second one as the Guardian Legend.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.560
That's the MSX game, right?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.920
So they need to do, like, the Gartic special edition, and then give us Gartic 3.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.560
Oh, amen to that.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.440
I will drop the President- I need to bust out that MSX emulator.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.960
I will drop the President Cat thing right now for that.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:35.760
I would give, um, a square inch of my flesh, probably from my left arm, in exchange for

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.260
Gartic 3.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.160
I'm telling you, the Guardian, I know we talk about it a lot on this show, for those of

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.720
you that haven't heard a lot of OLR in the past, the Guardian Legend is, like, the greatest

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.280
8-bit game you probably missed.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.320
But here's, like, the other big games that they did.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.320
They did Xanac.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.320
Oh yeah.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.320
Alest, which, um, I have Robo-Alest.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:08:00.400
Gunhead, Spriggan, and there's also the big Spriggan anime too, remember?

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.280
But they did that for PC Engine, and then there was, like, um, they did a few Dungeon

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:11.160
Crawlers, like I said, Pio Pio, and, uh, Golvalius, do you remember that?

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:17.520
They also did two pinball games for the TurboGrafx-16, can you guess what they were?

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520
No what?

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.760
Wait, Tur- Alien Crush, and Devil's Crush.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.920
Oh shit, those are some big games.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:32.800
Blazing Lasers, uh, Choplifter, Ghostbusters, um, we said Gartic, uh, Lode Runner.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.440
And this is all Wikipedia, so you know it's true.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:43.760
Well, you can, they did M.U.S.H.A., uh, Power Strike, uh, R-Type, the Sega 3 R-Type, the

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.760
Mark 3, sorry.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.280
This could be a compile lovefest all night long, but, what?

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280
And, Shadowrun.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280
Oh wow.

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280
Compile's great.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.760
Anyway, so compile, now that you're back together, um, we have a new project you can

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760
get on.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.760
Gartic.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760
Gartic.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.720
Alright, uh, 360, also gets the Devil May Cry HD collection, again this is Japan, don't

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.840
forget, the Kinect Rush, Disney Pixar Adventure, Ninja Gaiden 3, Collectors, and Regulars Edition.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.640
There you go, let's go to the UK.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.440
Uh, send me a ticket, I wish.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:22.120
Okay, as far as stuff that's out in the UK, on the 21st is Rayman 3 HD, on the 22nd we

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:27.760
have Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Wing Commander Saga The Darkest Dawn, and yesterday, all

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.520
of the, um, the last two being on PC.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.840
On the 23rd, Armored Core 5, Kid Icarus Uprising, Ninja Gaiden 3, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond,

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:43.240
Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City, and Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240
Bleh.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.120
Oh, that's it.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.360
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.880
week, but first, some stories on new things.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.840
Alright, um, let's talk a little bit about Kickstarter.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.520
I know, you're probably sick and tired of hearing about Kickstarter, but, you know,

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:10.360
Double Fine's Kickstarter just finished, um, with 3.3 million dollars.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.960
That's a lot of money for Kickstarter.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960
And for them.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:19.160
Um, but yes, uh, way more than they were hoping to get with the, you know, 400,000 being the

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160
goal.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.800
Um, and of course, you know, they're gonna be, uh, doing a lot of extra content because

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800
of that.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.960
Um, and of course, you know, Schaeffer, or Tim Schaeffer was quoted saying, I don't wanna

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.920
say this is the end of the whole game industry as we know it.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:41.680
It's not, it's not, um, but, you know, it's nice that they don't necessarily need publishers

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.240
to make games like this, cause honestly, who would greenlight a public, you know, an adventure

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.320
game, an old school adventure game, um, nowadays.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.200
It's something that they don't think would sell.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.900
But I think also maybe success of these types of games might convince publishers that these

01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.960
types of games still do alright.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.440
Just kidding.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.240
Um, and if you're looking, if you maybe missed out on the whole funding of the Double Fine

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.720
adventure and you're still wondering, hey, where can I throw my money for an extended

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.800
pre-order on something, uh, Wasteland 2 has a Kickstarter, um, going for it now.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:23.320
Now Wasteland is kind of, I would say like the inspiration for the Fallout games, um,

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:31.400
they were hoping to raise, um, $900,000, uh, for, you know, their game and of course already

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.720
have hit that goal and then beyond that and they still have over, um, you know, almost

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:45.120
a month left to go and, uh, now of course, um, they're looking to, um, you know, see

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.720
if they've got, you know, they can reach $1.5 million and they're going to add more, um,

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.600
content to the game and that kind of stuff.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.020
Also porting it to other, um, platforms like OSX and that kind of stuff.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.220
So, um, you can check out Kickstarter for that and some other projects.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:08.580
Hopefully though not contributing to the very vague, poorly misspelled, um, MMO project

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.280
from some strange millionaire who seriously looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.080
and Repus, so, uh, maybe avoid that one.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:28.240
All right, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, um, is this a trend we like seeing in gaming?

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.620
Um, I mean, it's, it's, I don't see why we, why we wouldn't like it.

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:40.160
I don't really see what the downside is other than, you mean, it's one of those things like

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.640
if you don't want to support it, then you don't support it.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.000
It's no one's forcing you to do, you know, put down money for it.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.240
However, I see a couple, you know, things that are kind of wrong with it.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:56.200
I mean, cause one basically Kickstarter, a lot of it, people are contributing, not necessarily

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.160
because they support a project because they want the goodies that they get from, you know,

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160
donating.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.260
They have different levels of money that you put down and you get different rewards based

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.260
on that.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.120
And that's what people want to do with it.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.440
Um, you know, I know I've only contributed to one thing so far, which is, you know, a

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:16.680
video project done by Freddie Wong because I love all of his videos.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.040
But you know, I get, you know, with that a, you know, Blu-ray copy of the movie, a signed

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.040
poster by the, you know, the cast and that kind of stuff.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.720
So there are little things that are kind of neat from it, but at the same time I just

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.160
support, you know, the guy and his work and stuff.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.360
But some of these, you know, games, a lot of the, um, things from the Kickstarter are

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.200
like, okay, you get a copy of the game.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.260
So it's like a guaranteed sale right there, um, or guaranteed pre-sale if you will.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.360
But some of them are like, you know, ridiculous amounts people are contributing, like $10,000

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.080
or, um, you know, a couple hundred dollars.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:55.520
There's one I saw for a, uh, it's a third edition for some, like a book called High

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.040
Score, which is talking about classic games and stuff like that.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.360
I have that book.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.640
And they're trying to put out a third edition of it.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:08.280
And for the $250 level, you can have dinner with a bunch of these like classic game people,

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:16.000
everyone from Peter Molyneaux to, uh, uh, what's his name, the guy behind the Sims series.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Will Wright.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Will Wright.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Yes.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You can have dinner with him.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.960
Um, just a bunch of really, you know, classic developers.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.040
Shit, I'd do that just for the experience maybe.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.040
I don't know.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.440
I'm a little eh on Kickstarter.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.480
Like the only things that bugged me about it is a people need to realize Kickstarter

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:38.880
gets 5%, which I, I re they got out of money to they, what, Hey, America's about the capitalism.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.720
They came up with a great idea and they're taking their share.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.880
You can't fault him for that.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.720
But like that, you know, I personally would not like to use Kickstarter for that reason.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.520
But the other thing that, that really bugs me is that some of the projects, and I'm not

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.600
going to name names, but one in particular that I saw in there felt really ex exploitative

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600
to me.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.020
Like it was just exploiting for money for things that I would argue you don't need that

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.500
kind of money for.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.120
And this type of record was being broken like 10 times over, which props to them for having

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.760
that kind of audience that would just give and give and give and give that kind of money.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.080
That's that's wonderful.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:22.560
Um, but I just think the money would be better spent on charity, but that's me.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.920
I just think you have to be very careful about what you're donating to and think really hard

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
about it.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920
Think really hard about it.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.880
But Rob, I would just always thought, you know, how much better would this show be if

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.680
we had a swanky office?

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.040
Not don't go there.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.720
Don't don't start stuff.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.320
I mean, I could just throw one of those up and say, who wants to support me?

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.960
And but that's, but you see, here's the thing.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.080
As much as you could do that, that's when Kickstarter starts to get a little ridiculous.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080
You know what I mean?

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080
It's easy.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.080
That's the point.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.760
It's the, uh, it's the online equivalent of standing out on the street corner with a tin

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.560
can begging for change.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.200
I mean, I don't think any of us want to see it turn into that.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.720
So yeah, I mean, here's what I would think.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:08.840
And granted, I think it would be kind of cool to do a Kickstarter just for funding like

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.840
merchandise.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:14.120
Cause a lot of times, like, you know, if you're merchandising for like even say like our show

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.320
or something like that, it costs money to make t-shirts and stuff and whether, you know,

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.080
that way it's almost like a pre-sale for merchandise.

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:27.800
You know, I mean, that would be the only intent for it, but, um, I don't know, that'd be the

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800
only thing I could see.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.920
You know, if you want to donate the proceeds, you could do that, but, um, I mean, that's

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.360
the only, cause I mean, you're basically using, that's what people use it for anyways, is

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.720
merchandise for a lot of it.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.400
Um, and some of which I really wish I'd gotten in on, you know, like Cards Against Humanity.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.720
Fuck, I love that game, but I really wish I had gotten in on that Kickstarter so I can

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.440
get full set of the cards.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.840
Have you seen Ryan's custom pack?

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.760
Have you seen the pack that we play with at home?

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.280
Uh, the custom pack?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280
No.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.040
It's, we, you, you know, the fact that they release the PDF of all of the cards in the

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.040
set.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.880
We, um, and the whole reason why they do that is because if you missed what amounts to limited

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:15.240
scale printing and you are particularly savvy, Ryan printed up a pack of her own and we have

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.320
a bunch of custom ones that we made for our own purposes, a couple of custom blacks, and

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:23.840
then everybody that we know, like everybody that we could really throw in a good joke

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.000
about has their name on a card as well.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.560
And she's happy to, you know, pay materials and then we'll get a deck out to you.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.160
Well, no, we, I've printed my own and we've been playing with it, but it's weird though

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.560
cause they're like little crackers.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.700
Yeah, she didn't, the PDF is in a really nasty square.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:43.840
We made them general, like, uh, like actually apples to apple side cards because she knows

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.280
how to put it together to be able to do that kind of thing.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.180
I would have done that, but you know, at the time I was under time, I had to print them

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:53.180
out and cut them up during watching a Rift Tracks version of Twilight.

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.320
So I had limited amount of time, I couldn't, you know, go tweak in the PDF and stuff, but

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320
hey, who cares?

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.960
It's, you know, they're, they're fun to play with.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.000
But yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.440
There's a lot of that stuff on there that's really cool.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:08.040
Um, you know, they have like a really elaborate Catan board one time, it was all laser etched

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.200
wood and stuff, but it was like $300 for a full fucking set.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.000
But yeah, there's a lot of game projects on there that are worth, you know, supporting

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.320
if that's your thing, but also, like I said, crazy guy that looks like Jabba the Hutt and

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320
a rapist.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:26.880
Um, you know, there's a bunch of people on there that maybe I shouldn't support him.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.880
I mean, the guy had...

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.480
You also said that on Bobby's show, so...

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.080
I just want to nail it home.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.240
He looks like Jabba the Hutt crossed with a rapist.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.880
The OLR podcasters, podcastees have no idea what you're talking about if they didn't listen

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.880
to Bobby's show this week.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.160
I think I mentioned it earlier.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.960
There's a guy who won the lottery.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:48.400
He won $43 million, and he wants to create an MMO created by gamers for gamers, blah

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400
blah blah.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.740
But the thing is, creating an MMO is really fucking hard.

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.960
This guy thinks that he can do it because he's played games for like 30 years, and,

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.520
you know, I hate to use a cliche of like, oh, he looks like a gamer, no, but I mean,

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.480
seriously, the guy looks like he just crawled out of his mom's basement.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.480
I mean, just...

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480
So kind.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:13.520
But seriously, though, the thing about it, though, is if you look at it, there's no real

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520
details to this.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.560
He just keeps throwing out stuff.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.740
Well, you will get a special mount at level one, and blah blah blah.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:25.240
It's like, dude, you're talking about garbage.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:32.400
I had a guy I used to deal with that had big ideas like this, and it was just like, dude,

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.200
you don't have the smarts or the means to do any of this stuff, so I think that people

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.860
are just pissing away money.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:47.620
I know a lot of people are donating a dollar so that they can make fun of him on his actual

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.240
page and stuff, so I don't know.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.560
Let me read some of the comments from chat room.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.820
There's a lot of talk on this topic at chat.orangelandradio.com.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.920
Tiger Claw says, C, Loki even agrees.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.220
OLR needs a Kickstarter.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.220
Think about it.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.480
Better equipment, better mics, and maybe a tricaster?

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:10.120
Raginator says, do a Kickstarter project so we can experience OLR and 7.1 surround sound.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:16.160
As nice as that is to think about, I'm going to be honest, I would feel guilty taking your

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:23.160
money if I couldn't guarantee that 100% of it went into improving the show directly for

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.960
you guys somehow.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960
And I don't know.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.000
We'll think of ideas, I guess.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.640
I'm sorry.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.500
One idea I didn't think about before is the idea about funding the t-shirts or something

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.640
in advance would be a good idea, I have to admit.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640
So let me put it this way.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640
This is the one I was talking about.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.360
It's called Your World.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:50.940
It's a video game project by Elwood Bartlett, and he's got $20,000.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.920
People are funding this already.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:58.080
Of course, he's never going to hit the goal of $1.1 million, but it's fun.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.360
People are going to throw it in, but here's some of his...

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360
It's horribly misspelled, too.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.160
Like here, pledge $100 or more.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.880
Reward number one, two, and three, access to special VDOR selling items for those who

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.000
donated via Kickstarter.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.560
Special authenticator to protect your account.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.280
VDOR, spell check your goddamn shit.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.280
I mean, seriously.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.280
All right.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280
Other comments from chat.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.280
Bochi Kawa says, Kickstarter really is just a way to funnel donations.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.640
OLR would need one because of the listeners.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.040
We are the ones that would support OLR, and we would be the ones to donate, but there's

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.640
a lot of Kickstarter projects that nobody has the slightest clue about, and someone

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.700
a couple thousand miles away would appreciate some money going to a thing they like.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.720
Which Akdeft also kind of follows up with, we have already helped OLR before without

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
Kickstarter.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720
And that is very true.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:49.540
You have to remember, remember my DIVA fit a few years ago when the computer broke?

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.760
The Orange Mountains Radio listeners sent a fucking new computer to us, and that is

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.720
like the best, one of the best thing, if not the best thing that has ever happened from

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.720
doing this show.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.000
I mean, that just, I can't tell you how that felt to just be like, oh my God, they sent

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.560
a computer so we could continue to do the show.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.680
It was just an amazing feeling.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.680
Yeah.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.680
So anyhow.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:17.720
Really, all, all that we would have to do if anyone wanted to donate anything is just

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720
set up a PayPal.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.720
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.720
Easy.

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720
All right.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.040
Last, last word on Kickstarter, anything?

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:32.560
I mean, I won't post a picture of the guy, I'm just saying, you know.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.560
All right.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.560
Uh, Jet Set Radio HD.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.880
It didn't need anything to fund this.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.760
Sega just finally decided to bring it out.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.760
What a good idea.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.520
So Jet Set Radio, everybody's been asking, what about the soundtrack?

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.760
Are we going to get to keep Rob Zombie?

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.080
Are we going to get to keep Chibomato?

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.600
The answer is no, but there's, okay, hold on.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.700
It's not that bad because there will be about half of the tracks from the North American

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.240
version will stay in the game.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.200
Same with the European version.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.840
They did try to re-license the music, but of course, cost availability, some of these

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.200
labels that the music was originally on aren't even around anymore.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.240
So it just couldn't happen.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.400
Now all the Hideki Naganuma songs that were in the original, those stay, because those

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.180
were created for Sega, so of course those are staying.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.680
There are a few licensed tracks that will return.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:24.820
The Guitar Vader songs have been re-licensed, Electric Toothbrush, Reps, BB Rites, those

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.240
songs are coming back, and a few more.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.720
So there will be some songs that are going to return in the Jet Set Radio HD, but Rob

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.320
Zombie, Chibomato, those songs will not be coming back.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.420
But I still think that's pretty cool.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.780
They got to salvage some of it, and at least it will retain that same feel.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:48.600
Also don't forget, higher resolution, widescreen to play, 60 frames a second, and two analogs

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.680
sticks.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.280
Jet Set Radio HD.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280
I know I'm excited.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280
How about you, Dark Sock?

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280
Are you going to get this?

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.760
We might, but I'm also thinking about starting a Kickstarter for when I have a kid to see

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.200
who contributes the most money and wants to pay for the baby's name.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.160
Oh my gosh, I don't, you can't sell that on Kickstarter.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160
Yes I can.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160
Oh no.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160
I can put it on eBay.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160
No.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160
Alright.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.160
No.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.280
Let's take a time back to when games were a lot simpler.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.840
There was no Kickstarter.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.160
Just blowing on the cartridge a lot.

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.040
This game sure involves blowing and sucking.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.880
It's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.440
It also involves farting stars.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:38.920
And that is Kirby's Adventure, also known as, let's see, Hoshi no Kirby Yume no Izumi

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.200
no Monogatari, which was Kirby of the Stars, the story of the Fountain of Dreams.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.400
Wait, if you listen really carefully, you can hear act-deaf squeaking all the way from

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400
Mexico.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.400
Because he loves Kirby, I know that.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.280
I love the music, though.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.840
This game just makes me happy.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.080
It's a pink little puffball.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.880
I'm so pissed off at Nintendo of America for what they do to poor Kirby.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.120
They make him look angry in every, you get the Japanese version, Kirby's happy, hi, I'm

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.120
happy Kirby.

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.320
Anything in America comes out that's got Kirby's face on it.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.320
Mean Kirby.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320
It's angsty.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.320
It's hipster.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:20.080
He was happy before he was angry.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.520
What does he have to be angry about?

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.520
He's so cute.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:34.000
So Kirby's Adventure was the second and last game that used Kirby's original design.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.080
The first one was Kirby's Dreamland.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.920
And also the first one that made him pink.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.600
Because the first one he was black and white.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.800
So yeah, this was a platformer.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:53.280
It came out March 26, 1993 in Japan and came out in America on May 1, 1993 and in Europe

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.360
on December 1, 1993.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.760
This came out when I was a junior in high school.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.680
Actually no, I was a senior, nevermind.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:11.160
Anyway, so it was super, super cute and it was actually out on, what?

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.560
Comments from chat.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.560
Just move on.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.560
It's not appropriate for me to repeat.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560
What?

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.560
No.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.560
It's not appropriate for me to repeat.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.560
Bitch.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.560
Okay.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.560
Addressed to the chatroom, not you.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:29.640
So it came out on the virtual console on February 12, 2007 and in Europe on February 16, 2007

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.560
and in Japan on February 27, 2007, so we actually got it ahead of Japan.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:40.800
And of course it was one of the 12 inch masterpieces that was given in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:44.320
There's also a 3D classics version on the eShop.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:50.240
So basically the story, Kirby wakes up from his after lunch nap and he didn't have any

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.240
dreams.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240
What?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.240
God it's awesome to be Kirby.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.240
I'm just thinking.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.520
He gets to take a CS to after lunch, it's great.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.000
And he learned that King Dedede has stolen the star rod.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.520
Fucker.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.240
Which is the source of power to the fountain of dreams and he broke it into pieces.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.240
So you have to go get it and you have to go to Wispy Woods.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.000
And remember I had Kirby's Avalanche.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So when you...

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Wispy Woods.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I know.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.760
Paint Roller, Mr. Shine, Mr. Bright, Cracow, Heavy Mole and Meta Knight.

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.560
And one for himself, King Dedede had.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.040
So basically you have to go through seven worlds, battle enemies, mini bosses, bosses

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.980
and you have to get the star rod put back together.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.600
Now here's where it gets fun.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:37.600
As we all know.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.600
What?

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.600
Nothing.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.640
Just this game makes me laugh.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640
It's cute.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.640
It's adorable.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.680
You're sitting over there saying names like King Dedede, he took the star rod and he broke

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680
it up.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.320
It's like I'm listening to a four year old describe something.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.320
It's great.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320
No, I'm not.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.080
Should I do my 12 year old girl voice?

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.080
Oh my God.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.080
Yes please.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.080
So anyway, the game's a platformer.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.680
Shut up.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.200
So you've got regular levels, a boss fight and a warp star door.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.520
You guys, King Dedede took the star rod and broke it.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.080
Oh noes.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.040
You sound extra gay.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.080
Just letting you know.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080
Not like a 12 year old girl.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.400
Sorry, that was my impression of the Kony guy in the videos that are on TMZ.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.160
Ugh, I'm so sick of that.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:35.040
Anyway he can run and jump and he can attack and dodge enemies by side tackling and he

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.240
can fly by inflating himself, meaning he holds his breath until he floats into the air and

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.380
then he can basically get as high as he can.

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.240
He gets high y'all.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.960
You gotta be high to enjoy this game.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960
Shut up.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960
This game's awesome.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.960
Oh it is.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:50.960
It is.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:51.960
I'm on TV.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:52.960
You need an STFU right now.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.960
Let me finish.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:54.960
But when he's flying he can't use his other abilities.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.520
He can exhale and this puff of air after he exhales, apparently he has death breath.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.000
Cause when he goes...

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.720
Enemies die.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.000
And anyway, his big ability is that he can inhale.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.320
So he sucks enemies and objects into his mouth and then it stays into his mouth until he

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.240
spits them out.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:25.240
I quit.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.240
I quit.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.240
Bye.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.240
No.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.240
Let me finish.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.240
God you people are dirty.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.240
It's a game for six...

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.240
Look.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.840
UFO catcher Kirby.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.240
He's fucking fat.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240
He's a fat bitch.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240
Anyway.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240
But fluffy.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:50.240
So anyway, he can spit them right back out and do damage or he can swallow them.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.240
He swallows or spits.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.240
There, I said it.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240
Are you happy?

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240
Yes.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.680
Rob is red in the face.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.000
He is as red as my shirt, y'all.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
But he can swallow them too and he copies their abilities.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.440
Like he can spit fire if he swallows something that spits fire.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.480
So he swallows them and absorbs their DNA a little bit?

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:17.420
He can also use his drop ability, but he can't inhale anything while he has a special ability.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:25.560
So when he uses up the special ability, he farts a star or he poops a star.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.760
So I like the flying bouncy star.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760
The special power-up.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:34.660
It's just, it's so cute.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.000
So actually I'm going to read a quote on here about the visuals.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
This came from IGN.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.080
By 1993, the programmers of the world have learned to unleash every last ounce of power

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:47.320
hidden inside the original Nintendo system.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.600
Mario's Adventure was one of those late generation games and probably the best of them.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:59.640
So basically this had, you know, pseudo 3D, different visual effects, it had rotation,

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.680
parallax scrolling, six megabit game, it was the largest, one of the largest games ever

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.340
came out on the NES.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.620
And I do believe this was the last game that came out on the NES.

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:11.620
Next to last.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:12.620
Next to last.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:13.620
Wario Woods.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.620
Wario Woods.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:15.620
Yeah.

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:17.520
Wario Woods was in the box, by the way.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.900
So yeah, there were different remakes.

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:24.920
Don't bring box into this or I'm only going to laugh harder.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.140
Do not make me redownload the Vuvuzela app, okay?

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:33.860
So now this was re-released on the Game Boy Advance and it was called Kirby Nightmare

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.000
in Dreamland.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.260
And the name that it came out as in Japan was Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi Deluxe, which

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:49.000
was Kirby of the Stars, the Fountain of Dreams deluxe block, there you go.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.800
The Nightmare in Dreamland had cooperative two to four players, so you could play as

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.700
different colored kirpies.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.920
It had really good reviews.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:05.140
It was given a 9.5 out of 10 by EGM.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.900
GameSpot gave it 7.3 out of 10.

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.180
So it's been- Fuck GameSpot!

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.980
I know, right?

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:17.860
Also, this is a little bit interesting, there's a French version of the game in Canada, which

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:24.660
makes this the only French-only NES released in North America.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660
Le Kirby.

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:26.660
Le Kirby.

01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:34.260
The, um, also the soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21st, 1994, and had vocals

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:39.460
by Mako Miyata in the story.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:43.540
This is the first game that I know of that actually has a pinball spinoff, and it was

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:47.620
actually my first Kirby game was Kirby's Pinball for the Game Boy.

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.260
Was that on Game Boy Basic?

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.260
Yes.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.340
What about the Pokemon pinball game, was that on-

01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:53.340
That wasn't before Color.

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340
That was Game Boy Color, yes, yeah.

01:32:54.340 --> 01:33:00.300
You know, the first pinball game that I ever played on a handheld was, or on a console,

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:05.260
and I'm con- including handhelds, was Gator's Revenge on the old Game Boy.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.220
Yeah, I was gonna say, that was the first, that was my first pinball game too.

01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:13.460
Uh, although I think I rented Pinball's Quest before, or Pinball Quest before that, but

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.460
anyway.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.460
Pinbot was also great.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:18.460
Well, one thing that was funny is that when we had a pinball party at the house, we had

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.460
a jackpot in the house.

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:23.260
No, we had Ride-A-Pinbot dancing up the nest with Pinbot right next to it.

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:24.260
Nice.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:25.260
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:26.260
Um.

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.260
Okay.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.800
We need a new, like, not to distract from Kirby and the cute music that's in the background,

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.940
but we could use, like, a great new pinball game from Nintendo, because they gave us some

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:34.940
awesome ones.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:38.300
There was the Kirby one, even though it was PAL, but it's a second party.

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:43.020
Uh, there was the Metroid pinball game was great, the Pokemon pinball games were outstanding,

01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:44.020
I love that game.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.420
A rumble pack and a Game Boy cartridge.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.620
Yeah, it was great.

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.620
So we need a new one.

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:52.220
You know what, I want that new, um, well, it's not new new anymore, but the Kirby game

01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:56.100
that came out on, um, DS.

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.780
That's like, it's like ten Kirbys.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:58.980
You can borrow it if you want.

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.300
I would love to borrow it.

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.500
It's the Kirby draw one, where you can and I have it.

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.020
Yeah, I really wanted to play that.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.020
You can borrow it.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.020
I ain't playing it.

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.020
Alright.

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.020
Thank you.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.020
You're welcome.

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:10.020
See, something good came of all that laughter.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.020
See?

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.020
Laughter brings healing.

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.020
Rob's no longer bright red.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.020
Alright.

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.020
We'll have to calm down a little bit.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.020
Alright.

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:18.020
Plenty more OLR to come.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.020
We're not done yet.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.900
We've got, uh, more news coming at you.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:24.620
We're gonna talk about some really controversial things in the next half, so you wanna stick

01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:28.020
with this and, uh, get your say in in our chat room if you're listening live.

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.020

The first ever OLR.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.020
Pants off, dance off.

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.020
Oh.

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.020
Just kidding.

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.020
Oh, I was gonna say.

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.020
That's news to me.

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.020
Who knows what other surprises.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:46.020
It was a surprise for 450, Rob.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.300
Who knows what other surprises Dark Soccer has in store.

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:57.980
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:06.940
Live on this Saturday evening, March the 18th of 2012, with the 450th episode of our show.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.380
And we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in just a little bit.

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.980
Hope you all had a good St. Patrick's Day, those of you that, you know, decided to do

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.980
something.

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.500
I don't know if it's just because, like, I'm getting old now or whatever, but I didn't

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:17.620
really do anything yesterday.

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:21.700
Did you guys do anything to kind of celebrate, like, you know, going out to the bars and

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:25.180
getting blitzed was awesome when I was 21, but now, like, last night I was like, I'm

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:26.180
too tired.

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:30.020
I got woken up by bagpipes for the first time in my life, as far as I'm aware.

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.020
Oh, that's right.

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.020
Because you were in San Francisco.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:33.540
You were right by the Metreon.

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.540
Yes.

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.260
There was a huge parade taking place down Market Street.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:40.500
I was just right on 4th with an earshot of the Metreon.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:46.140
And there were a lot of air horns, screams, bagpipes, the occasional siren, and probably

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.140
some other sounds.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.820
I was too tired to actually parse at the time.

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.620
The only instrument that sounds like cattle being beaten to death?

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.220
Hey, now, don't hate.

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.220
I like bagpipes.

01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.620
But anyway, let's talk Metreon, because you reminded me you were right by there.

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.940
Remember when the Metreon used to be, like, nerd heaven?

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:08.580
Remember when the Metreon actually had something more than just a movie theater in five or

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.580
six?

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.740
Did you know that the Metreon had gone through some changes?

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740
No.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:18.900
It was very surprising coming out here, because I heard of all of these, like, classic video

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.020
gaming staples that I was in the immediate vicinity of that aren't there anymore.

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:27.460
Pier 39 doesn't have, Mel told me what the place was called, I completely forgot what

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.460
it was all of a sudden.

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.780
I forgot what it was called, I just remembered the DDR tournament we did live from there,

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.780
and that was a good time.

01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:32.780
Yeah, the Pier 39.

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.780
B3.

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:37.660
B3 was the tournament, but I don't remember the name of the arcade.

01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.660
Man.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.660
Pier 39 had a nice place.

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:45.380
Metreon was, as best as I understand, like, the original DDR tournament location.

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:50.620
When there was a, whether it did or didn't have the first US DDR arcade, it was kind

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:51.620
of the staple of everything.

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.500
My first DDR tournament was at the Metreon, yeah.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:55.500
Yeah.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.180
So tell me about, in Metreon, you know, this isn't just about music games, but Metreon

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:03.060
was the home of the Sony store, the official Sony store, for a long, long time.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:07.340
So tell me about not knowing any of this, and what you felt when you walked into the

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:10.540
Metreon for the first time in eight years.

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.540
For the first time ever, in my case.

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540
Oh, oh, yes.

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.540
We didn't go there.

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540
Oh, okay.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:19.900
No, the Metreon, it's, it's, I kind of expected it as soon as I looked outside, walked up

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.900
the, walked down the street towards it and saw what was going on.

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:25.460
There's a huge chunk of the Metreon that's just closed off, because apparently they're

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.500
renovating like well over half of it.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:31.660
So you go in on the ground floor, and there was just a food court and a couple of places

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:36.660
there, and it directed you to the, there were ticket booths for the IMAX there, and then

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.860
there were stairs escalators in the elevator to get up there to go see a movie.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:41.860
And that's...

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.860
Oh, they didn't even have the crane games?

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.060
I saw Nightmare Before Christmas there twice.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.460
There might have been something in the movie theater, I saw a couple of machines.

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.460
It's an IMAX.

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:50.460
Yeah.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:53.660
Well, in the, on the third floor, that's where the tilt used to be, and then, then for the

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.220
longest time, there was just nothing but crane games in the, like, space next to it.

01:37:58.220 --> 01:37:59.220
Interesting.

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.220
That's all.

01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:03.340
If there was anything in there, it was probably those, here, get a, get a thing of candy,

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:06.140
a winner every time, something ridiculously basic.

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:09.980
A rumor is that Target is going into Metreon, which actually, well, that actually would

01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:12.580
be a big deal, because in San Francisco proper, there's no Target.

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.420
The closest Target is in, um, Daly City, which is a little bit south.

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:19.180
Anyway, uh, go to our chat, I'm at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:20.940
We have Porkchop is in our chat room tonight.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:25.940
Porkchop is Irish, as in Ireland, as in staying up until three in the morning to listen to

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:26.940
this show.

01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.540
And Porkchop says, I'm Irish, and I did nothing.

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:30.420
It's a gigantic mess.

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.020
I, I can't say I blame you.

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.020
I did the same thing.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:37.260
Uh, Technus in our chat room says, isn't Pier 39 a tourist trap now in San Francisco?

01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.260
It always was.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:39.260
It always was.

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.940
Or am I thinking of something totally different?

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.420
No, it's just, it, it hasn't changed.

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.460
It always has been a giant tourist trap, but I will say this, the fresh donuts, I hope

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:47.460
those are still there.

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.460
Yes.

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.460
It smells the donuts.

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:53.260
There was that little donut bag stand, which I was very tempted to do if I hadn't eaten

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.580
just before going there.

01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.580
Fucking amazing.

01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.580
I probably should have done it anyways.

01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.540
They smelled so good each time I walked by.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.540
Oh God.

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:00.540
Oh God.

01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:01.540
In the cookie place.

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.980
I had friends from Connecticut that wanted me to send them donuts from Pier 39.

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:05.820
Oh, in the chocolate place.

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.340
It's like all kinds of chocolate and it has the boost chocolate.

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.780
Did you go to the saltwater taffy store?

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.140
No, I did not.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:14.820
They have- I passed through a whole bunch of stuff and stepped inside and looked at

01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.660
a couple of places, but no, I didn't get in there.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:22.540
My two favorite places actually is Treasure Isle, the, uh, the big Celtic store and the

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:23.540
sock store.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.540
All right.

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:28.540
Well, we could reminisce about San Francisco and memories and when the metronome was cool

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540
and all that.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.860
Although it is still a good place to see movies, so I'll give it that.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.100
Um, I know you didn't end up doing that, but the, uh, the little nature and Martin Luther

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.460
King Memorial Outdoors was actually really nice walk.

01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.460
Really cool park in the back.

01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:45.180
The weather held up enough that walking around town was, was not, you know, miserable being

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.140
rained on, being blown over, anything like that.

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.980
And that was a, it's a, it's a really nice little property in the middle there.

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.620
Moscone, Yerba Buena, and all those.

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:52.620
Yeah.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.620
Yeah.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.620
All right.

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.300
Well, let's move on back to some games, uh, as much as we can talk about the outdoors.

01:39:56.300 --> 01:40:01.540
Let's get back to some video games with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories that,

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.140
uh, don't fit in anywhere else.

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.260
All right.

01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.620
Let's talk about Ridiculous Bundles.

01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:13.420
Um, Steel Battalion, known for, you know, it's not exactly cheap prices, um, in the

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:21.860
past, but they have a brand new, um, I guess it's available in Japan right now, um, for

01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:28.900
35,000 yen or 420 US dollars, uh, via Capcom's online shop.

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:37.180
You can get a Steel Battalion, um, bundle that includes a backpack, um, a helmet, a

01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:45.860
jacket, patches, uh, soundtrack to the game, and, uh, I believe an art book.

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:46.860
That's right.

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:52.140
You can dress up like the character in the game with an actual helmet and looks like

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:56.260
bomber jackets, um, for $400.

01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:01.020
It's a little ridiculous, but then again, they used to have a $200 controller.

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:07.340
I bought Dan the full controller when it was $300 for the old one.

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:10.460
I mean, that's something that was kinda necessary.

01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:13.020
It has the huge red button.

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.300
I love the eject button.

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.300
That was pretty fun.

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.060
Now, could you play the game without that controller?

01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.060
I don't know.

01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:21.060
You're the wrong guy.

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.540
Actually, I think that you could.

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.340
If you could, it was a very stripped down experience, needless to say.

01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:26.340
Yeah.

01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:32.780
Also, they also made, um, made, uh, mods for the full unit to make it a more compact unit.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.460
But did they make any mods to make the compact unit as it was a huge unit, like a battle

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460
tech booth?

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.760
We're talking about units.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.340
By the way, you know who has two of those controllers now?

01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:43.340
You.

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:44.340
Yep.

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.340
Yeah.

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:50.160
Uh, Skyrim's gonna be getting another update pretty soon, a 1.5 patch that's gonna add

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.700
a bunch of kill cams for things that don't have kill cams right now, including ranged

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:59.020
attacks, also, um, melee, or, or magic spells.

01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:04.220
And they're gonna be adding some new melee combat, um, moves and animations as well.

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.960
So it's, uh, kind of enhancing a bunch of stuff.

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.820
More ways to decapitate people.

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:09.820
Hooray!

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:10.820
Exactly!

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:11.820
It sounds awesome.

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.620
And also, they're gonna be, um, you know, adding some fixes, hopefully, once again,

01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:23.540
to that stupid blood on the ice goddamn mission or quest that I'm on that doesn't fucking

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.540
work.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:30.700
So they're gonna try to fix it again, and, and props to Bethesda's blog for allowing

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:34.780
me to put in my age, you know how, you know, you have the age gate or whatever.

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.900
Happy 130th birthday, Loki!

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.900
I know!

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:41.780
Let's just, like, the 1800s, it's, like, awesome.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:48.020
Uh, but yeah, so they're gonna be fixing some other bug stuff, um, as well on top of the

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.020
added features.

01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:52.180
But hey, all that's for free!

01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.660
So suck it, Capcom!

01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.740
Free shit, it's awesome.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:02.820
Um, and then, last but not least, uh, God of War has a demake that's available on PC,

01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.220
if you wanna check it out.

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:11.940
It is, uh, the Bit of War, and it looks like, almost like Rygar or something, um, but, uh,

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:18.980
yeah, 8-bit demake, and it's available on the website armlessoctopus.com.

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.620
But really, when you think about it, if an octopus doesn't have any arms, how can it

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:24.620
really be an octopus?

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:28.220
Just saying.

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:32.700
I can't even put together in my head what that would make it, uh...

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:36.300
I mean, I can think of other, eight other things it could possibly have, but that's

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:39.820
just, that's just inappropriate, okay?

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:40.820
Inappropriate.

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:41.820
Alright.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.320
That never happens here.

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320
Moving on?

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320
Moving on.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.300
Um, an 8-bit MMO is set to be released.

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.300
That's actually the name of it.

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.300
8-bit MMO.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:51.300
Um, kinda interesting.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.300
It, it's, I looked at the trailer, and it struck me as kinda Minecraft-y, in that it's

01:43:55.300 --> 01:44:00.580
very, like, create your own environment, but it's an MMO where the users create everything.

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:01.580
It's all user-generated.

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:06.220
They have what's called a grief protection system that's supposed to protect your stuff

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:11.060
from getting fucked up, um, so, it's under construction, you can actually play it now,

01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.060
it's free.

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:15.140
8bitmmo.net, and some people are having a lot of fun with that.

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:20.540
Um, a fan-made Wing Commander game is gonna be allowed to go forward.

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.880
This is actually kind of a surprise, usually, uh, companies kinda put the clamp down on

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:30.020
things like this, but EA is allowing the creators of Wing Commander Saga Darkest Dawn to move

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.020
forward.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.420
However, EA does not officially or unofficially endorse the game.

01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:40.180
They had to clarify that, uh, they did get the lawyers and everything to sign off of

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.180
them, so that's, um, kind of shocking, but.

01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:46.020
So unfortunately that means you're not gonna get a Wing Commander remake any time soon.

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:50.100
Yeah, that doesn't bode well for official Wing Commander stuff, but hey, this fan thing

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:51.560
sounds like it's gonna be awesome.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.300
It's free, first off, yay!

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:59.940
Uh, 50 missions, 2 campaigns, 60 voice actors, I wanna be a voice actor, uh, dozens of Terran

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:03.420
and Kilrathi spaceships, 70 cutscenes.

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.380
It takes place after Wing Commander 3.

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:08.660
Uh, I'm assuming it's gonna pretend that that movie never existed.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:13.740
Cause if you're a true fan, you're just gonna ignore that movie.

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:16.380
Who has actually seen that movie in full here?

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:22.420
I've seen parts, and all I remember is Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard of Scream fame.

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:29.860
I, I'm very ashamed to admit this, but long going far away, no, no, I've never spent a

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:30.860
dime on it.

01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:34.940
Um, long going far away, it was like the weekend Fox movie or whatever.

01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:38.220
I was having an absolutely lazy day and I can honestly say I watched the thing from

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:42.180
start to finish and I really wish I couldn't.

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:47.840
I prefer to think of Matthew Lillard from Hacker's fame.

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.020
That upgrades his status.

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.220
Just like, uh, Johnny Lee Miller who would next be seen in Dark Shadows.

01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.180
It's gonna be awesome, alright.

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:57.740
Anyhow, which by the way, internet, stop hating on the Dark Shadows trailer.

01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:58.740
Stop it.

01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.800
It's weird.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.460
It's weird but it's suppo- okay, if you look at it as like-

01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:03.460
Is it Tim Burton?

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:04.460
I mean, cause it's-

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:05.460
Oh yeah, it's Tim Burton.

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.460
Okay, yeah, that makes sense then.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:10.980
The old show was a little bit cheesy and it's all 70s and stuff cause it's supposed to be

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:11.980
like the old show.

01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:17.620
And in the context of the fact that right now everybody's all about Twilight and shit,

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.980
it's actually really funny.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:21.100
Like I just- I don't know.

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:22.100
People need to let it go.

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.100
Alright, anyhow.

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:26.500
Uh, Rhythm Party, fun game on the Xbox 360.

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:30.300
If you're a Bamani fan, you probably haven't heard of this, which is strange to me because

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.340
it's right up a Bamani fan's alley.

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.140
It's a great Kinect game for Bamani.

01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:38.420
I liked it way more than I thought I would, as I said previously on the show.

01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.980
And there's some more DLC.

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:44.100
If you are sick of the song list being too tiny, you can get three new songs this week

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.580
in Rhythm Party song pack four.

01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:51.260
The Sunbeam by Desrow is one song.

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:55.140
Inside Your Mind by Limahl.

01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.580
Wasn't that the band that did the Neverending Story?

01:46:58.580 --> 01:46:59.580
Yes it was.

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.740
That was the band that did the Neverending Story.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.140
Now in Rhythm Party with Inside Your Mind.

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:08.460
I don't know if that's a new song or an old song or what because I only thought they ever

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460
did one song.

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.140
But here's the third song.

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:16.300
If you've ever played Bamani games ever, you know this song.

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:21.660
Bag by Revenge is the third song that you can now play in Rhythm Party.

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.500
Yeah, Bag, what?

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:25.500
You hating on Bag over there?

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.900
It's just weird.

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.100
I think it's great.

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:35.140
I was actually trying to see if I had a clip of Bag.

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:38.260
Just for the people that don't know.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.660
Where's my old music folder?

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.580
Speaking of being woken up by bagpipes.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580
Right?

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:47.940
It's kind of appropriate for the time of year, isn't it?

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.300
Perhaps that's exactly why they chose to release it this week.

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:51.300
Perhaps.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.300
Perhaps.

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.300
What 2DX game was Bag in?

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.300
There it is.

01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.300
Eight.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.300
Or nine.

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:57.300
Wrong.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.300
Ah, it's hard.

01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.300
Here it is.

01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.300
2DX.

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:01.300
I'm sorry.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:04.300
Imagine flailing your arms and legs to this.

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:14.980
Now when did this come out, because this would be totally appropriate for like yesterday.

01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:15.980
Tuesday.

01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:16.980
It came out Tuesday.

01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.140
Ah, well then perfect.

01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:19.380
Totally appropriate for yesterday.

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.380
Yep.

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.380
So there you go.

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:22.380
Actually, you have to see this though quickly.

01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:26.580
I know this is terrible radio, but let me show the YouTube here real quick.

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.500
Because somebody actually puts together the, it's not Konami, but some fan puts together

01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:34.940
all the DLC stuff into these videos on YouTube.

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.420
And you have to see the animations for Bag.

01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.780
They will blow your mind.

01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.780
Hold on.

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:40.780
Here's.

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:41.780
Wait, that's inside your mind.

01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:42.780
Here's Bag.

01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:46.660
Like, look at all the little dancing sheep in the background.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:50.780
And then as you're dancing, little bagpipes get attached to it.

01:48:50.780 --> 01:49:04.100
I feel like an entire Beatles album just invaded my brain complete with LSD and George Harrison's

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.420
obsession with the sitar.

01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:06.700
I had no look at this.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.420
I have just been schooled on my eighties pop music by Zena Core in our chat room.

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.700
I seriously had no idea ever of this.

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:16.160
Zena Core says, Rob Limahl is the singer.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.460
The band was nameless as far as anyone cares.

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.220
So it was a studio band or something that I had no idea, but well, if you want to know,

01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.220
oh, I closed the window.

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.220
All right.

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.220
If you want to know the song, go YouTube it.

01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:28.220
All right.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.420
Uh, or download, download the pack already.

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.420
Dark Sakura, rapid fire news for us.

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:36.700
Uh, how about some stuff if I can get back to the window.

01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:37.700
Okay.

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:38.700
Thank you.

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.300
Um, Sonic four is going away.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:45.700
No more episodes after episode two and everyone cheers.

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:47.060
Yay.

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.260
Because it wasn't very good.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.100
But maybe volume two will be better.

01:49:52.100 --> 01:50:00.080
So next thing, rumor Shenmue one and two HD finished going to Xbox live arcade and PSN.

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.940
It's uh, an anonymous source reported it to gamerzines saying that it was going to be,

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.940
uh, it's been completed for over a year and it's pending release, but that doesn't say

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:11.940
it's true.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:16.280
Rumor, which is a really good album rumors.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.040
So how about some rock band, three tracks they're coming out.

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.380
How about it?

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:25.500
There will be, um, two tracks for men at work that will, uh, be in the rock band music store

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:29.980
overkill and down under and Carlos Santana's smooth.

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:34.380
Ooh, that should make some people need new pants.

01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.660
And then, uh, not really that song got played out.

01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:39.940
Well, yeah, but for people who like playing pro guitar mode.

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.940
Okay.

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.940
All right.

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.940
I'll give you that.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.940
I'll give you that.

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.300
I can't imagine that would be kind of hot.

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:50.180
And um, so anyway, the tracks are going to be a buck 99 and there is of course, like

01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:58.620
I said, pro upgrade available, um, for smooth for 99 cents or 80 Microsoft points, which

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:02.300
is funny because actually on the way up here, I was listening to the lonely Island and the

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:06.340
Santana DVX song came up and that song's funny.

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.340
All right.

01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.460
We're going to transition back into some longer news here.

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:10.780
The mailbag is coming up in a minute.

01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:14.940
A mailbag at orange on traded.com FUs of the week and your calls soon.

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:16.780
Uh, no frugal question this week.

01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:17.780
Sorry.

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:19.220
I I'm going to be totally honest with an out of town guest.

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.220
I forgot to do it today, so, uh, we'll bring it back next week.

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:23.220
Sorry about that.

01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.220
Loki.

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.220
All right.

01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:31.660
Um, let's talk a little bit about mass effect and I mean, come on.

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:36.700
I mean, seriously, people that are fans of mass effect, this is a little ridiculous.

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:43.540
Um, apparently a mass effect three fan has complained about the ending of the game, but

01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:47.140
didn't necessarily complain to Bioware or EA.

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:55.060
They complained to the federal trade commission and uh, yes, apparently a Bioware form user

01:51:55.060 --> 01:52:04.480
named El Spico, uh, went to the FTC to file a false advertising complaint at EA and also

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:12.300
filed a complaint with the better business Bureau and you know, his, uh, you know, reasons

01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:16.460
for it after reading through the list of promises about the ending of the game that they made

01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.020
and their advertising campaign and PR interviews.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.500
It was clear that the product we got did not live up to those claims.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:28.060
This is not something, um, I was happy to do, but after the terrible ending that there

01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:32.580
was no way, um, there was no way that the product had been advertised to me.

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:38.620
Um, and the lack of any kind of response from Bioware EA to address this, I felt this is

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:41.420
my only recourse.

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:46.760
And he'll be returning his copy before the end of the 30 days, uh, three a return policy.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:56.580
If the ending has not been addressed by then, fucking really, I know people are stupid.

01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.940
There was another, there was more recourse for him.

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:08.180
I didn't like any of the prequel movies for star Wars, but did I go up to, uh, George

01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:14.020
Lucas when I was in the same room as him and demand my money back while I was eating meatloaf

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.020
prepared by his staff?

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:18.580
No, no, but they totally did that on clerks.

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:19.580
The animated series.

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:20.580
It was really fun.

01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:21.580
That was great.

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:27.940
I want my $8 that show totally dates that show too.

01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:28.940
It's only $8.

01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:33.440
Uh, as far as video games though, having there been video games in the past that have had

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:37.740
shitty endings, like, um, I dunno, like ghouls and ghosts or, uh, you know, I was just watching

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:40.940
these Zelda two adventures of link long play through today.

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.140
That kind of had a shitty ending.

01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:47.700
If you think about it, like the curtain falls before you can see Lincoln, Zelda kissing

01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:50.860
or embracing or whatever it is they're doing bony boning.

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:55.460
So yeah, but look, okay, look, look, I'm not trying to compare like mass effect to Zelda,

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:58.940
the adventures of link, although both are great games and I don't know the ending of

01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.940
mass effect three.

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:03.660
I am really trying to save myself because I am experiencing the games for the first

01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:07.560
time, but I'm kind of thinking, okay, from what I've heard about it, the thing I've

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:11.860
heard or the way it's been explained to me without spoiling it is that mass effect is

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:14.380
very much about the story decisions you make on along the way.

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:17.860
And if you choose to go paragon or renegade or somewhere down the middle, and it really

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.980
seems like the ending kind of doesn't fucking care about how you played the game for the

01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:22.980
past three games.

01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.540
And so it sounds like kind of that disregard there really kind of irritated people so that

01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:32.660
I can kind of see where it's irritating, but are people really letting the last 15 minutes

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.300
just totally like ruin the entire franchise for them?

01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:40.020
Because like, even, even if the ending at this point is like, like just fucking goat's

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:45.540
a man comes out and chose me as asshole, like I'm still going to be like, the rest of the

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:48.260
game up until that point was so fucking rad.

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:52.020
I would still recommend this, you know, what happens is he ends up on a roof.

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:57.820
He calls tech support and they tell him to jump off the building in order to wake up.

01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:58.820
What if that was the ending?

01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.820
Then you'd be really pissed.

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:06.740
Hey, as long as it's got some cigarettes in there, I am all good.

01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:11.580
But you know how many movies and how many TV shows or especially TV shows like, and

01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:14.620
one I mentioned on Bobby show before it was the sopranos, right?

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:17.820
The sopranos was a hugely popular show on HBO.

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:19.580
Lots of people love this for seven seasons.

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.260
And then the ending was really bad.

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:25.260
Like I don't know if you guys know about the ending, but it was just fade to black.

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:27.060
It's just really bad ending.

01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:28.380
It didn't ruin the series.

01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:34.580
At least the ending isn't commander shepherd's son driving off with a tranny.

01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:36.780
I'm sure a lot of people don't catch that reference.

01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:37.860
That's from nip tuck.

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:44.380
That's the last episode is like, what actually the last season was kind of what yes, I watched

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:46.620
all of that series.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.100
I don't know why.

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:52.680
So I mean, sometimes, and some people would say that battle star Galactica had a terrible

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.680
ending too.

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.100
I liked the ending of battle star Galactica.

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.740
I mean, there's only so many ways you get into show like that.

01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.260
I thought it was a great ending, but you know, some people don't agree with that.

01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:07.080
So the nice thing about mass effect is that they can release something for DLC later or,

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.180
you know, I know BioWare swears up and down.

01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:14.740
It'll be the last game, but you guys like fucking really you're going to buy that right.

01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:16.780
Halo three was going to be the last halo game.

01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:19.020
Remember that, you know, there's ways they can do.

01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:23.540
And I, you know, again, even if it ended with the entire universe imploding, like God came

01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.720
down and smited everybody, whatever it is, that's so terrible.

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:32.500
Even if that happened, there's no reason they can't do prequels side stories.

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:36.820
You know, the characters before they joined up with shepherd or just in another part of

01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:41.060
the galaxy or from the enemy's perspective, there's a million things they could do with

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.060
mass effect.

01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:45.120
Still, even if they chose to go to another developer, granted, it probably won't be as

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.220
good if it's not a BioWare game, but you never know.

01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:50.860
Once again, though, they can't give into this kind of bullshit.

01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:53.500
This is the ending that you guys decided on.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:58.140
Obviously there is much thought to the ending of a trilogy of a game series that's been

01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:00.180
just this massive game.

01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:03.420
Yeah, pun intended, I guess.

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:09.300
But you can't just give in because some people complain about the ending to something.

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:11.140
You can't please everybody.

01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.140
And so what?

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.380
So you hated the ending of the game.

01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:15.940
Well, that's that.

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:21.700
I mean, but if you give into this, then any game that you put out, both, you know, BioWare,

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:26.780
any publisher, you're gonna have people there like, I don't like the ending, I'm gonna complain

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:30.900
to the FTC, I'm gonna complain to the better business bureau because I need you guys to

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.460
change the ending to how I want it.

01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.620
Well, no, I want the ending to be like this.

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.620
Fuck that.

01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.620
You know what?

01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:40.380
If you're so bent over the ending, just write some fan fiction or something.

01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:42.020
That's what we used to do back in the day.

01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:45.980
If we didn't like something, we fanfic'd it.

01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:47.180
And we liked it.

01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.860
Get off my lawn.

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:54.820
I seem to remember not liking any of the Stargate shit TV series endings.

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.820
You know what?

01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:59.300
I loved Stargate all up until like midway through season 8.

01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:02.180
That was right before the Ori, wasn't it?

01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.980
Yeah, it was right after the replicants.

01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:04.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:06.820
But did it ruin the first seven seasons?

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:09.380
Well, the first seven seasons did have some pretty crappy writing.

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.380
Alright, well, bad example.

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:13.980
But for the most part, for the most part, I looked back on them fondly.

01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:20.300
I mean, I own seasons 1 through 8 box sets, so I can't say I didn't like it, but I found

01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.420
myself wanting to change a number of things.

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:29.620
I think the reason why people are really mad to kind of get here is something I said earlier.

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:33.140
They could fix the ending through DLC, just like they did with Fallout.

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:36.700
And I think people feel like, ah, you had me by the balls here with a shitty ending

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:41.020
and you're going to make me pay 10 bucks to get the real ending, although you all know

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:44.620
you're going to YouTube it.

01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:48.300
But half of all of this outcry everybody already has anyways.

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.740
And that part of it, I can sympathize a little bit with that.

01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:55.780
That is kind of shitty to like force me to get more DLC.

01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:57.820
They also, they change endings all the time and stuff.

01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.820
I mean, look at, you know, for example, I Am Legend.

01:59:01.820 --> 01:59:07.460
They're changing the end of that movie because they're going to make a sequel.

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:11.940
So let's just assume that they kill off Shepard or something like that at the end of Mass

01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:12.940
Effect 3.

01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:13.940
I have to say something.

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.940
I have to say something about I Am Legend.

01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:17.500
They changed it from the original ending anyway.

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:22.980
Well, I can't believe that they changed Titanic, where now the boat's not going to sink, so

01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:23.980
that way they can make a Titanic.

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.980
What?

01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.980
I'm joking.

01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:32.740
And it transforms into a 50-foot robot, 50-foot robot.

01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:36.460
I don't, for the record, I don't care who the spoils were because the movie's been out

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:41.980
forever, but in I Am Legend, it turned out that all the vampire things, which I believe

01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:48.460
was in the book, were all sentient and trying to rescue the one that he was keeping in captivity.

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.460
Yes.

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.180
They, they, they address that.

01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.460
But they didn't end it that way.

01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:54.220
Well, they did in the director's cut.

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.220
Well, okay.

01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:56.220
The director's cut.

01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.980
See, it would make sense to take that to go with.

01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:00.220
Ooh, great point from Tiger Claw in the chat room.

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:01.220
Portal had its ending changed.

02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:02.220
Portal 1.

02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:03.220
It didn't have its ending changed.

02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:05.220
It had its ending extended.

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:06.220
Enhanced.

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:08.460
Well, but it was an important scene.

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:13.100
It was just straight-up new content and console gamers, well, you heard the news.

02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:14.660
What the, what am I thinking?

02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:19.820
Yeah, that wasn't, that wasn't like, oh, GLaDOS didn't actually blow up.

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:20.820
For the record, actually.

02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:21.820
I'm sorry to everybody.

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:22.940
I just spoiled that too.

02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:29.740
For the record, the, it was actually texted into the, as the original ending, because

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:38.660
you can find a, a bit of programming code for party retrieval bot, and the little model

02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:41.380
that they used for it was actually already in the game, because if you go into third

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:44.820
person mode, you can actually see whatever it is that's dragging her off.

02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:47.820
And they had, all the, all the data was programmed in.

02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.660
They just didn't use it.

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:54.820
So going back in with DLC, they were able to use the original ending that they had mined.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:55.820
Just saying.

02:00:55.820 --> 02:01:02.620
A lot of, a lot of stuff like that, this is why I, I don't ever look at any ending as

02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:08.340
canon until they've said, that's it, you know.

02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.420
Or until the studio goes out of business.

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.060
Or at least they have no choice.

02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:13.620
That's why I have no more cube movies.

02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:18.960
All right, well, anyhow, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this situation because my

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.500
thing would be all like, well, if you don't buy, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but

02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:24.980
too late, you already bought it.

02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:31.420
And I'd like to pitch, or I should say recommend a title based on your, your joke there, Titanic

02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.900
2.

02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:40.620
There is a game coming out very soon, actually, that is, oh, what the fuck is it called?

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:43.140
It's Titanic something.

02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:48.740
It's basically the maiden voyage of the Titanic 2, and you're solving a mystery because there's

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.660
a bomb on the boat.

02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.660
So it's like Titanic.

02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:52.660
Is that like Speed 2?

02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:56.180
It's like Speed 2 and Titanic 2.

02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.580
It's Titanic Mystery, that's what it was.

02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:58.580
Does Sandra Bullock be in it again?

02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.740
All right, I think it's like Titanic Mystery is the name of the game.

02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:02.740
We NDS.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:10.540
All right, anyhow, I think we need to move on with more stories, but seriously, going

02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:15.620
to the feds to complain about the ending, like, look at your life, look at your choices.

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.780
There's other things to be mad about.

02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:20.820
There's some people that call the SWAT team on somebody if they're beating them in Call

02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:26.740
of Duty, so I mean, they should be lucky it's just the feds, and they call in a nuke strike

02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.740
or something.

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.620
Honestly, honestly, probably, you know the response that they're going to fucking get

02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:38.180
from the feds is going to be, yeah, we're pretty upset about it too.

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.820
That's going to be the response that they get.

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.860
It's going to be chirp, chirp, chirp.

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:47.140
Yeah, we fucking hated the ending too.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:50.540
All right, look, moving on.

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:55.380
Usually this game won't have a shitty ending, but I will say the TV series from what I understand

02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:59.780
loves to do twists and turns and has been causing some fan controversy.

02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:01.700
I have sadly not watched any.

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:04.780
I have not watched the show either, but I've heard a lot of good things about it.

02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:08.940
I'm not big on the whole zombie stuff, but again, then again, apparently I misjudged

02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:12.260
Mass Effect all these years ago, so someday I'm going to have to sit down and watch The

02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:17.020
Walking Dead is a show that a lot of people are really into right now, and of course,

02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:20.500
when something gets big, there's the inevitable game that comes out, and you may or may not

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.980
remember, Telltale is the ones doing the game.

02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:27.620
Of course, Telltale does a lot of the adventure games, the Jurassic Park, you know, the Monkey

02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:29.060
Island reboot and all that.

02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:33.340
So The Walking Dead will be out in great Telltale fashion on every fucking platform you can

02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.340
think of.

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:37.380
Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, PC, Mac, iOS.

02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:39.140
First episodes coming out in April.

02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.340
There will be five episodes in total.

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:46.180
They will each be regularly released after the first one comes out, so I don't know if

02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.740
that's one a month, one every three months, whatever that's going to be.

02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:50.740
Uh, there you go.

02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:55.620
Telltale, the only company that understands episodic content and does it right.

02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.620
Yeah, thanks Gabe Newell.

02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:00.900
Oh yeah, right, because the Half-Life game.

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.540
Because he harped on, episodic content is the way of the future!

02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:05.460
I see what you did there.

02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:07.540
Although Steam is a great place to get these games.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.180
Very true, that's where I have Back to the Future.

02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:14.320
Walking Dead will also be available on Facebook!

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:18.540
Now it's not the Telltale game, don't get that confused, but here's the deal.

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:27.020
The social game developer RockYou is doing the Walking Dead social game, I'm sorry, published

02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:30.340
by RockYou, developed at Eyes Wide Games.

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:35.100
You're going to set up and maintain base camps, you send out scouts to scavenge for supplies,

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.000
and there's also some combat naturally.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Now you know what would be cool?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.100
I will say, this does, in theory, this would be a great game, like if I could have a little

02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:46.240
zombie camp, and I could send zombies to destroy Dark Sakura's people.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240
That would be fun.

02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240
No, you couldn't do that, you know why?

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240
I don't play Facebook games.

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:55.660
I'll click on it when you're not home, when you're not watching and logged in.

02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:56.660
No way.

02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:59.940
Fine, then who plays like every Facebook game that's out there?

02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:00.940
Somebody I know.

02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:02.900
People who aren't me.

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.020
Somebody I know on Facebook.

02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:08.100
X-Link, X-Link will be playing it.

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.220
I'll kill X-Link's zombie camp.

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:15.260
Alright, Shane, Shane likes the Walking Dead, he'll be curious enough to try the game, and

02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:17.260
I will destroy his people, it will be fun.

02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:18.260
Alright.

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:24.180
Yes, Porkchop, there was a Dexter game that was mostly a point-and-click adventure, and

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:28.900
a kind of a 3D version of an old point-and-click adventure game.

02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:29.900
Dexter the TV show?

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:30.900
Yeah.

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.900
Hmm.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:32.900
It was, it was, it was okay.

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:35.580
It had a, it could have been longer, how about that?

02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:36.580
You know what?

02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:37.580
More than three or four cases.

02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:38.580
Telltale did a CSI game.

02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:41.180
That was another thing that they did, based on the show.

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:45.780
I hear, now I don't really, you know, I don't even watch the show, I just didn't have a

02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:49.380
real big interest in the CSI game, but I hear it wasn't bad, so.

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:50.380
How old was it?

02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:51.380
Wasn't that like, six?

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.380
Probably about five years ago.

02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:54.700
I mean, the show's been on for what, nine years now?

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:58.500
I seem to remember that X-Play, or perhaps even Extended Play at the time, reviewed it

02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:02.780
and said that it was not quite as polished as it should have been for such a, such an

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:03.820
investigative game.

02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:06.060
I think I'm thinking about the same thing, I might be wrong.

02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:09.020
Yes, but we can't always trust reviews, as we're gonna learn later in the show, that's

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:10.020
for sure.

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:11.020
Alright.

02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:14.580
One thing we can trust is your emails, I think.

02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:18.740
Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungerated.com, and DarkSakura dives

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:21.820
in or sends her zombie squad in, to pull out the emails.

02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:23.260
Eugh, sticky.

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.900
And read them here on the show.

02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:25.900
It's a little sticky!

02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:28.420
Mailbag at orangelaungerated.com.

02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.420
That's not email.

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:33.380
Ugh, well, it would help if it would actually let me read it.

02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.580
Ugh, come on.

02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:38.580
Well, we'll just listen to that.

02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:39.580
There we go!

02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:40.580
Now it's working.

02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:41.580
Now it's working.

02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:44.260
Well, no, it wasn't letting me get to the screen, so whatever.

02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:45.260
No problems.

02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:46.260
Pfft.

02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.260
Bitch.

02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:51.820
So, um, greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.980
I know that you just added a new show segment, and I've been thinking of a new segment for

02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:57.060
a while now.

02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:01.500
I'm the guy who isn't keen on cursing, so in order to balance out the eff-us of the

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:05.260
week, what about the love-us of the week?

02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.260
I'll start.

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:11.500
I have a big love-u to people who are genuinely friendly during disc golf games, and want

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:13.180
to help you become a better player.

02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:17.860
Another example from Loki would be, would sound something like, a big love-u to Nintendo

02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:21.980
for always going out on a limb to create new and exciting IPs without rehashing anything

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.980
prior.

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:23.980
This one he has for me.

02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:24.980
Okay.

02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:28.580
A big love-u to World of Warcraft for rainbow unicorns that make me feel shiny.

02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:34.260
Rob, I have a love-u to all the podcasters who take the time to leave us good reviews

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.300
on iTunes and for listening to us every week.

02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.740
I'm gonna verp from all the cuteness.

02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:41.740
Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.

02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:45.380
We have done a thank you, I think is what we called it, but we have kind of done a thank

02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:46.380
you of the week.

02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:54.460
Um, you know, when we're feeling charitable, but it happens once in a great while, but

02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:00.460
I do say a genuine love-u or thank-u to everybody that leaves us nice reviews on iTunes.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:07.500
When I'm truly not in a pissy mood, I do nice things, you know, but I'm female.

02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:08.500
I don't care.

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:09.500
I didn't even have to say it.

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:10.500
All right.

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:17.500
We are full of loving stuff for the two and a half hours.

02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:18.500
Okay.

02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:21.500
Um, this is from Rob.

02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:25.700
The fabled art of video game exhibit at the Smithsonian is now open.

02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:31.300
I haven't gone yet because all of the opening day talks were booked before I checked.

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:35.440
It is running during Otacon if people want to make the drive from Baltimore to DC.

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:40.700
In Baltimore, I like to take the Metro from I-95 in Greenbelt, Maryland rather than try

02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:42.900
and park downtown.

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:44.540
If I lived there, I knew what that meant.

02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:47.280
Oh, I think he's just giving people directions.

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.060
They have all these funny terms for roads out there that I've just like the greenbelt.

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.860
You don't, what's that?

02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.860
He attached the letter from the Smithsonian.

02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:56.860
Nice.

02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:58.860
It says open now through September 30th.

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.520
It felt like this day would never come, but it finally did in the art of video games exhibition

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.520
is open to the public.

02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:07.380
I hope you can make it to see the show in person, but if not, check out the photos of

02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.500
the final installation on Flickr.

02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.440
I actually really love to see that.

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:15.380
That's what it's Washington DC where it's the Smithsonian or derp.

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.380
Yeah, right.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:20.680
Um, you know, you step out on the line and you see the, I didn't have like a traveling

02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.980
Smithsonian dick that sits sticking out of the ground made of marble.

02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:27.180
I've been to the Smithsonian before many years ago.

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.180
I was 17 years old.

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:29.180
You know what the big exhibit was?

02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:30.180
You know what?

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:33.100
So was I, but you know what the big exhibit was the year I was there.

02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:38.900
Uh, the Enola Gay, they had the actual plane, you know, that was used in world war two and

02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:41.420
all that was very, very strange.

02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:43.540
Did you say world of war two?

02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:44.540
I said world war two.

02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:45.540
I'm pretty sure.

02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:46.540
All right.

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.420
Then I said world of war two and I meant to say world war two.

02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:49.420
Anyhow.

02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:54.700
Well, to finish, um, on here, it says, uh, one of the best parts of the exhibit exhibition

02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:58.500
in my opinion is the interviews with video game artists, designers, developers, musicians,

02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.500
writers, and scholars.

02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:01.380
Um, yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it.

02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:02.820
So yeah, pretty cool.

02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:08.420
I, um, I don't have the link to, uh, the flicker on here, so I would suggest seeing if you

02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.340
can find it.

02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:12.220
And last email if you're ready.

02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:16.780
Well, not into sports games and not interested in the canceled Ubisoft game.

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:23.820
For some reason, the pronunciation of Adidas, how you, you said Adidas.

02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:25.300
The rest of the world says Adidas.

02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.300
Adidas.

02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:28.100
I've, I've, I've said Adidas before.

02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:29.100
Okay.

02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:30.420
Well, he said it sounded odd.

02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:32.620
I'm more used to Adidas myself.

02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.100
Where does the other pronunciation come from?

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.100
I'm sure I've heard of it.

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:36.100
Heard it that way before.

02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:40.300
That comes from Robert M. Adidas was when they would call it was what the corn song

02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:41.300
was called.

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.300
Yes.

02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:43.300
All day.

02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:50.980
I dream about, all right, forget it.

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:55.060
Like that's the one like rage metal song I'm going to admit to liking here on the show.

02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:58.240
But yes, I used to have a college radio show back in the day and we'd play stuff like that.

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.860
So we, and the song was called Adidas.

02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:01.980
Like that's how you pronounce it.

02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:05.300
So now whenever I see that, like I can't help, but say it that way.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:09.500
Even though I know everybody says the company is Adidas, but consider it a funny pun.

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:13.300
I don't know.

02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:14.300
That's audible blinking.

02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.100
You never heard the corn song.

02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:18.980
I don't like corn.

02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:21.580
Not even in a tortilla.

02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:22.580
Actually I'm allergic to corn.

02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:23.700
Did you know that?

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:24.700
Are you really?

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:25.700
No, I didn't.

02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:26.700
I am allergic to corn.

02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:27.700
I can have it.

02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:30.100
The more processed it is, the easier I have a time having it, but pure corn will make

02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:32.260
my lips swell and my throat itch.

02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:33.260
All right.

02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:34.260
Is that it for emails?

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.260
Yes.

02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:36.340
Little known fact, everybody.

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:38.180
Now you know something about me.

02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:42.460
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.980
I might say this name wrong here since I love pronouncing things wrong here on the show.

02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:50.980
Delighter, Delitter, Delighter in our chat room says all day I dream about sex song of

02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:53.500
my life.

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.420
You and every man and a lot of women too.

02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:57.420
So there you go.

02:11:57.420 --> 02:11:58.420
All right.

02:11:58.420 --> 02:12:01.340
Time's nothing.

02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:02.340
All right.

02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:06.220
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.900
Or if you want, the thank yous of the week.

02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:09.900
Fuck that.

02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:18.500
I mean, poo, poopy poo poo.

02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:25.220
My FU goes towards, um, I'm still going to include daylight savings time as being involved

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:30.300
with this FU, but it goes for this crazy ass insomnia I've been having.

02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.600
And then when I do fall asleep, of course I can't wake up in the morning.

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.940
I have been sleeping on average until noon.

02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.060
Not on purpose.

02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:42.340
If I don't set an alarm, I just won't wake up.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.100
And Dan had to wake me up.

02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:49.660
And then I found out that I was just really, I've just been really, really tired.

02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:51.780
Just haven't been feeling great.

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:54.780
And even doing my yoga this morning didn't help.

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:56.740
Today has just been a day of exhaustion.

02:12:56.740 --> 02:13:03.700
However, I would like to give a thank you to the SF Market on Florin Road in South Sac,

02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:07.260
which is usually a very scary part of town, but I found something wonderful and delightful

02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.260
there.

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:14.460
Apart from mochi and salt and a chocolate salt pokey.

02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:17.580
They had Cafe Du Monde chicory coffee.

02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:22.660
The only other place I've purchased this before was in New Orleans at the Cafe Du Monde.

02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.260
So it just made me really homesick.

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:29.660
And the weather here today, the weird ass weather we've been having, reminds me of Alabama.

02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:30.660
So I've been doubly homesick.

02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:35.420
I really, really, really want to get back to Alabama and visit everybody before, you

02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:38.700
know, everything blooms and the humid hits.

02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:40.700
Very sad.

02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:41.700
Loki.

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:50.340
Uh, I guess, uh, fuck you to the people, or I should say, I think it's the California

02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:55.980
Transportation Department or something like that for not painting lines on the freeway

02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:57.660
and scratching out.

02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:59.820
There's like four sets of scratched out lines.

02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:02.300
I don't know where the fuck the lanes are 50 on the way here.

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:03.300
Huh?

02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:04.300
Oh my God.

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:05.300
In the rain.

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.300
It makes all the other lines transparent.

02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:10.740
It's just like, I don't know where the fucking lanes are because they're just going and they

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:11.740
don't go straight.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:16.860
Yeah, it's doing it on 82 where they're doing repaving on 80.

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:21.900
And when we had that really bad rain on Friday night, and I'm saying bad for California because

02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:23.260
people in California don't know how to drive.

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:24.260
I know.

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.260
I know.

02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:31.300
Um, coming from South Sac all the way on, um, from 99 to 80 was just torture.

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.780
So yeah, I, I get ya.

02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:35.140
It's just like, I'm like, am I in the lane?

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:36.980
Which, which lines did I follow?

02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:37.980
It's just ridiculous.

02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:38.980
So fuck that.

02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:43.460
Um, Jason, our guest, do you have anything you want to give angst to?

02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:48.820
F you to California weather this weekend, this is a shitty weekend to visit.

02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:49.820
I'm so sorry.

02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:51.940
It's been, it's been rainy.

02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:54.020
We drove through Hale on the way up here.

02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.540
It's been windy as all hell.

02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:58.540
It's been a, it's not fucking sunshine and beaches.

02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.640
I left Alabama weather.

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.860
I left nice Colorado weather.

02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:06.120
Like it was literally just cleaning up the day that I got on the bus and it's kind of

02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:09.540
been miserable since we got here, including the actual bus trip out here.

02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:14.420
Other than that, F you to the screens and God only knows what other sounds at all hours

02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:16.420
of the night in downtown San Francisco.

02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:20.860
I'm probably never going to get used to that, but you know, that's, that's pretty much it.

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.860
All right.

02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:25.380
I will, I will indulge the email from earlier and I will start off tonight with a thank

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:26.380
you.

02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:31.380
I would like to say thank you to the tortilla lady at Denio's farmers market because the

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.620
pumpkin tortillas are amazing.

02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:34.620
So thank you.

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:35.620
Thank you.

02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:36.620
Tortilla lady.

02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:42.860
F you to the pistachio dude, because your pistachios kind of tastes like vinegar.

02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:43.860
Serious stuff, guys.

02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:44.860
Serious stuff.

02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:45.860
All right.

02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:46.860
Um, more gaming news.

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:48.780
Your calls are just a little bit away.

02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:50.340
One eight seven seven game OLR, but not yet.

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:51.820
We still have some news, some big news.

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:52.820
Loki.

02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:53.820
All right.

02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:59.300
Let's uh, let's talk a little bit about, um, this kind of ties in a little bit with the

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:02.140
whole kickstart thing, but we'll get to that obsidian man.

02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:07.500
They cannot catch a break this week, um, or even like it looks like the past year, but

02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:08.780
let's start off with obsidian.

02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:12.860
They've been hit with some layoffs and of course obsidian's working on the South Park

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:16.100
RPG that's going to be coming out, um, later this year.

02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:22.660
They also worked out on a fallout new Vegas, so, um, and apparently they have had to let

02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:30.960
go and they've, um, lost approximately 20 to 30 people and, um, they also have another

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.580
project canceled.

02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:36.380
This time is supposed to be for a future next gen system, uh, which I believe is the new

02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:38.580
Xbox system.

02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:45.020
And uh, also I guess, um, you know, there are some people that let go of one that started,

02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:50.620
uh, the day before and one that, you know, started the week before.

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:55.060
And um, so yeah, that, that kind of sucks.

02:16:55.060 --> 02:17:02.100
Um, also they've had, uh, an Xbox Live Arcade title that they were working on, um, a new

02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:10.100
original IP, uh, that has been put on hold as well and, uh, that kind of sucks.

02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:16.180
Um, the other thing too, which, um, I didn't see, well, I think we'll get to it a little

02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:22.340
bit later, but, um, they, uh, they may be going to a Kickstarter actually.

02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:23.340
It's kind of cool.

02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:29.300
There was this opinion piece that was written on Kotaku and it was kind of interesting talking

02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:33.860
about Kickstarter and the fact that, you know, some of these studios just can't catch a break

02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:37.840
because of all this publisher bullshit, whether the publisher's, you know, not greenlighting

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.100
something because it's a genre, like an old genre that they don't think is viable anymore,

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:47.780
or if it's just, you know, kind of this really experimental type of game or that kind of

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:52.140
stuff where that they can actually cut out the publishers if they go to Kickstarter and

02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:53.580
get their projects funded.

02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:58.580
Not only will it kind of get funded by Kickstarter, but the, especially lately with, like, these,

02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:03.660
you know, Tim Schafer stuff and the whole, uh, Wasteland 2 thing, that, you know, it

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:08.160
gets a lot of press and people get, you know, you know, behind it, plus, you know, a lot

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.880
of this, you know, independent games, a lot of them are getting a lot of indie coverage

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.300
and, like, grassroots, you know, efforts through Facebook and Twitter and, you know, those

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:22.820
get picked up by, you know, the gaming blogs and whatnot.

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:27.700
So it's kind of interesting and, um, so I wonder if we will see a lot of people turning

02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:34.500
to Kickstarter, especially some of these companies that are, like, can you imagine, like, if

02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:39.380
Grin, for example, started some Kickstarters for different projects that they were working

02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:42.580
on that would have been, well, I don't, obviously-

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.900
Oh, that new Strider game we talked about a couple weeks ago.

02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:49.900
It's a silly Strider, but, you know, they could go to Kickstarter to, um, get some of

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:54.540
the stuff, well, I don't know if they would be able to pull out a Strider, but, um, you

02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:59.420
know, make some really awesome games and maybe they would have been able to do some of that

02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:00.420
stuff.

02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:04.700
You know, it kind of sucks that they're working on a lot of good stuff, but, um, so yeah,

02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:09.100
that's one good thing, I guess, that Kickstarter can provide is, you know, an avenue for some

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:13.660
of these game genres that publishers think are dead.

02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.660
I love SSJ100Matt's idea in the chatroom.

02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:19.200
We should do a list list of what Kickstarter game funds we would give money to.

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.980
We should have- we will do that in a future episode.

02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:27.420
So, um, you kind of two different directions there, um, Obsidian, I want to start there,

02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:31.620
um, good news or bad news for the South Park game, like, I was looking forward to it and

02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:35.300
now I'm kind of like, uh-oh, I mean, hopefully it's far along in development where these

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:36.300
won't matter.

02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:39.140
I don't think it's- I would think that they have a bigger team than 20 or 30 people working

02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:43.420
on it, and it's not just programmers or developers and that, you know, it's not just programmers,

02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:44.820
but it's just, like, kind of across the board.

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:50.860
They're just making cuts at the company, um, and I think we may touch on why they might

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:55.820
be making cuts on that stuff in a little bit, but, uh, it's just, you know, they have to

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.700
trim the fat, I guess.

02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:03.540
Um, Kickstarter, um, again, kind of like we were saying earlier, there's just- there's

02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:07.140
a lot I worry about with Kickstarter where it's just gonna be too much, it's gonna get

02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.700
saturated and, you know, I don't think everybody needs to get on board with it, but I like

02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:13.460
the comparison you give with the grand.

02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:17.460
See, now, Kickstarter, I'm not sure exactly how it works, if it has- a project has to

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:22.860
be fully funded or not, because that one, the guy I was referring to as the Jabba the

02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:29.980
Hutt Reapus guy, um, he quoted saying that they have to make 10 grand to get money.

02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:32.740
They have to basically- 10 grand is the bottom limit.

02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:37.980
I've seen some Kickstarters for $500, though, so I think it's just- I don't think Kickstarter

02:20:37.980 --> 02:20:38.980
sets that.

02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:39.980
I think they're setting it for their project.

02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:41.660
Maybe it's a percentage or something, I don't know.

02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:42.660
It could be.

02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:43.660
Yeah, it could be.

02:20:43.660 --> 02:20:45.660
It could be a certain percentage, depending on how much you get.

02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:50.500
Alright, well, there's some more stories that somewhat tie into this, and one of them is

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:57.900
this interesting piece that's out there, and this is a particular piece that was on YouTube,

02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:03.240
and then Kotaku wrote up an article on it that basically kind of went to talking about

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:08.700
these points about video game reviews, and the whole video just kind of, you know, it's

02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:13.100
a lot of the stuff I think we've kind of heard before about the reviews are bought, basically.

02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:17.620
I did watch the whole thing, and a lot of- I think there's some of their facts are straight,

02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:19.860
some of them are kind of eh, you know.

02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:22.000
Let me go through some of these bullets here.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.940
Video game publishers see game reviewers as marketing tools.

02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:26.260
Yes, that's absolutely true.

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:29.560
Well, they see game reviews as marketing tools, for sure.

02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:33.060
Publishers sometimes allow positive reviews to be published before negative ones.

02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:34.060
Absolutely.

02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:37.300
Publishers sometimes require game reviewers to not mention certain plot or technical details

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.780
in exchange for being furnished with an advanced review copy.

02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:41.140
That is fact, yes.

02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:43.980
Publishers might not want to advertise on an outlet that slams their game.

02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:46.160
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:49.660
Critics are often at a loss for insightful ways of describing what they found objectionable

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:53.540
about a game they don't like.

02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:55.260
I can see that sometimes, yeah.

02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:58.660
Yeah, I can too, based on the way some people react to it.

02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:01.620
Reviews are banal checklists.

02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:03.540
I think some are.

02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:08.540
Especially ones not written by professional gamers.

02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:12.700
I think a lot of the ones that you see, and I'm not slamming every, but a lot like in

02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:19.020
the community newspapers and stuff, are the press release reworded.

02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:21.420
Some that I've seen.

02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:24.800
Game reviewers may not know that they're biased, but if they knew they were biased, would they

02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:26.980
tell us?

02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:28.980
I'm sure that they would, they have to seem unbiased.

02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:31.420
I think some know they are biased, personally.

02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:34.820
All these positive reviews from biased reviewers lead the public into accidentally playing

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:39.140
bad games.

02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:44.620
Playing bad games or buying bad games, I think is, you know, I mean, so what?

02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:48.620
If you play a bad game, it's not like you can, you know, contract herpes or something

02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:49.620
like that.

02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.100
I mean, I don't see, it's like, oh my God, I played a horrible game.

02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:54.020
I need to, like, hide in the corner.

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:55.020
I mean, who cares?

02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.460
So you play a bad game.

02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:57.460
Brain herpes.

02:22:57.460 --> 02:23:01.500
I mean, because someone, once again, it's someone's opinion, just because they like

02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:02.940
it, doesn't mean you're necessarily gonna like it.

02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:06.020
You remember the Gamefly commercials and the Epic Rage?

02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:07.540
Oh yeah, it's stupid.

02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:09.700
That's the point they're pushing in those commercials.

02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:11.060
Here's the last one.

02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:16.740
Legislators are happy when this mess results in pro-American games topping the charts.

02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:18.420
I think that's a little much.

02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:19.700
That seems a little much.

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:21.180
That's the stretch bullet right there.

02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:22.900
That's the, we need to pad this up to one more.

02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:23.900
Okay, here goes.

02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:24.900
No, no.

02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:33.980
Um, now, I, I think that whole embargo thing is starting to get overboard.

02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:38.560
And I would really only trust a site that refuses to sign them, even if they get the

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:39.560
reviews late.

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:42.860
Like, that's one thing I'm happy, even though I don't have the time to play every game,

02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:46.440
I don't do this for a living or whatever, I can give you my honest opinion on games

02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:52.100
because we don't sign those, and we don't get these games for free, I mean, very, very

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:54.180
rarely have we gotten them for free.

02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:57.820
And you know, we've spent our own money on them, so, you know, we can kind of tell you

02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:58.820
from that perspective.

02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:01.340
Got like two games from publishers.

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:05.260
Not that I'm saying OLR is the authority or that we're somehow better than all of the

02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:08.340
rest of this, but I'm just saying, I like that, you know, because there's plenty of

02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:12.260
other podcasters out there that are in the same boat, and that's why I kind of like hearing

02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:19.100
the opinion of quote-unquote real people when it comes to games.

02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:20.640
Let's also kind of take a step further.

02:24:20.640 --> 02:24:24.460
There was another story this week that talked about how reviews can really be kind of screwing

02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:31.100
up the industry, and that is this whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores.

02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:35.460
Not user Metacritic scores, Metacritic scores from established critics.

02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:38.780
And Obsidian was going to be, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you heard about this story,

02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:42.460
but for Fallout New Vegas, Obsidian, you know, it wasn't Bethesda, it was Obsidian that kind

02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:47.380
of did the port of it or whatever, did the, you know, newer, New Vegas part of it.

02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:53.340
They would have been given a bonus if an 85 plus score was on Metacritic.

02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:57.380
So if the game got an 85 plus on Metacritic, they would have got a big bonus.

02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:58.380
You know what it got?

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:04.300
An 84 on Metacritic, and so no bonus.

02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:10.740
Just the whole thing of paying or giving incentives for good reviews just totally makes me think

02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:11.740
of the government.

02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:17.320
And also, here's the other thing too, is Metacritic, how exactly, first off, how exactly do they

02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:20.820
... who is an authorized person?

02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:23.940
Who is an actual, like, site reviewer or whatever like that?

02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:27.420
If we put a review on our site, is it gonna show up on Metacritic?

02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:33.540
I believe it's similar to Rotten Tomatoes where you have to have so many reviews under

02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:39.940
your belt and you have to have some type of... you're either a member of an association

02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:41.420
or you have some type of degree or something.

02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:44.420
I don't know, I haven't looked at the rules, but I did look them up for Rotten Tomatoes

02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:48.380
once and it was something like that at the time, which was several years ago.

02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:56.820
So that leads into discussions about why are game developer bonuses based on review scores?

02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:58.460
I thought it was about the sales.

02:25:58.460 --> 02:25:59.460
Exactly.

02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:03.560
It should be about the sales because a game can totally get great reviews.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:09.580
Mad World, for example, or... I'm trying to think, there's a lot of niche games on

02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:10.580
... pretty much.

02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:14.640
Okay, let's look at these RPGs that are coming out on the Wii.

02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.300
They're getting great reviews, but they're not gonna sell well.

02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:21.380
It's just because it's a niche audience that it's reaching.

02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:26.180
And so why are they basing it on reviews?

02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:27.620
So a game gets good reviews.

02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:31.860
It doesn't mean people are gonna buy it.

02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:36.540
And lastly, some news came out this week that we already kinda knew and that was this whole

02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:39.820
... it was a result of the fact, I don't know if you guys heard, but Giant Bomb got bought

02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:42.620
by CBS Interactive, which owns GameSpot.

02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:46.860
The ironic thing about that is that one of the big personalities that kinda started Giant

02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:51.920
Bomb, Jeff Gerstmann, well, he made Giant Bomb because he had to leave GameSpot.

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:54.020
They basically sat him in a room and fired him.

02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:55.340
Why did they fire him?

02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:59.140
At the time, a lot of people were saying it's because he gave Kane & Lynch a bad review

02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:02.380
and they were big sponsors of the site at the time.

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:08.080
And sure enough, it came out that it wasn't specifically the Kane & Lynch review because

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:13.620
another thing was referenced about the Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction review

02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:14.860
from Sony.

02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:20.740
But basically GameSpot's editorial management basically sat him down and said that he couldn't

02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:24.300
be trusted as an editorial director.

02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:29.000
Couldn't be trusted with the people that are paying for ads on their site.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.780
That's absolutely ridiculous and completely unfair.

02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:36.940
Now, who is to blame at the end of the day for this whole cycle?

02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:38.940
Who is to blame?

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:40.820
Corporations.

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.380
You.

02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:44.140
You are to blame.

02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:50.060
If you've ever filled out a comment or a survey thing that said, why did you buy this game?

02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:52.060
Review from what website?

02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:57.380
If you did that, you are partially to blame.

02:27:57.380 --> 02:27:58.380
Think about it.

02:27:58.380 --> 02:27:59.380
I don't think I've ever done that.

02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:00.380
I'm just saying.

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:03.780
I know what I'm saying it in a way that's gonna catch people off guard a little bit,

02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:05.440
but I want you to really think about that.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:11.060
I mean, why else do the companies feel like they can get away with this?

02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:16.860
I think we as the users have to kind of rise up and demand more transparency.

02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:24.220
I think we need to support sites that will not support embargoes and this stuff and not

02:28:24.220 --> 02:28:26.140
let the publishers do the talking.

02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:27.140
It's the same.

02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:29.460
It's practically the same thing as lobbying, you know.

02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:30.460
Oh yeah.

02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:38.500
Or politicians who take, you know, sponsorships from major corporations, it's the same thing.

02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:42.500
You know, they're basically getting paid, so of course they're gonna put in a good word.

02:28:42.500 --> 02:28:48.060
Or in the case of, you know, the politics analogy, they're gonna lean their vote towards

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:51.620
the interest of the people they're paying their, you know, lining their pockets.

02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:57.500
So support independent radio websites.

02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:01.540
I really mean it, because this kind of stuff's only going to continue.

02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:04.060
And don't vote partisan.

02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:07.580
All right.

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:08.580
Moving on.

02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:09.580
Did I have anything else?

02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:12.540
I think I got all the little pieces of that story, because there was quite a bit there.

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:13.540
Yeah.

02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:14.540
So.

02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:15.540
How about something happy?

02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:16.540
How about something happy?

02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:17.540
Okay.

02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:20.420
Well, I'm sure I've made it no secret that I am a huge fan of Cracked.

02:29:20.420 --> 02:29:22.500
I love Cracked.com.

02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:26.580
And they actually posted an article that really made me stop and look at it that I wanted

02:29:26.580 --> 02:29:27.580
to share with everybody.

02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:30.620
And, you know, so full credit to Cracked for this.

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:35.420
I'm, you know, not trying to step on toes, so this goes to Mike Cooney, Eddie Rodriguez,

02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:37.980
and Steve Hanley, who wrote the article.

02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:38.980
Shout out.

02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:40.460
I'm just saying, because it was really good.

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:44.100
It's six acts of real-life heroism made possible by video games.

02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:45.100
So I'm just gonna go over it real quick.

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.100
Okay.

02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:47.100
And then I'd like to get everyone's thoughts on it.

02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:48.100
Mm-hmm.

02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:49.100
Okay.

02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:52.820
And really, it's actually the first three on the list that really stuck with me.

02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:59.820
There was the one where online gamers saved a guy from killing himself.

02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:04.460
There was an autistic, it says, a Canadian teenager made the news after helping an autistic

02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:10.900
youth online who was showing serious signs of depression to the point of hinting at suicide.

02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:15.500
So he didn't know where he lived, only had his gammer tag, but he contacted the police

02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:19.620
and contacted the kid over Xbox Live and they talked him down.

02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:20.620
Wow.

02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:23.300
He was showing concern for another human being.

02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:26.860
I don't, that's a good thing out of Xbox Live?

02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:27.860
That's astounding.

02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:29.700
Well, there's more on that, too.

02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:31.380
His parents didn't even know.

02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:32.380
Wow.

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:34.980
Someone who lived 1,500 miles away noticed.

02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:41.500
So it's another sign, too, that you basically, I don't think in a lot of cases, once your

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:44.700
kid's out and going to school, I don't think parents really know their kids as well as

02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:51.100
they think they might, not in the ways that I think they can really relate to, not as

02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:54.920
much as somebody within their own peer group, you know what I mean?

02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:57.860
And I think that someone needs to be careful and look at all the signs.

02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:00.180
You put yourself in their shoes.

02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:03.100
And then this one now, this one I thought was really neat.

02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:04.100
This is that Evony game.

02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:11.140
I know, I kind of scoff at the game, but there's a guy with muscular dystrophy who, his house

02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:16.540
caught on fire while he was playing a game, and he couldn't get out safely because he

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:19.860
had muscular dystrophy, it was wheelchair-bound.

02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:25.840
And his friends in the game called the police department and the fire department and helped

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.460
him get out of his house.

02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:28.460
Wow.

02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:29.700
So there's that.

02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:34.220
This one, this is the number five on the list that I thought was pretty cool.

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:39.820
A guy who had been playing Medal of Modern War, oh, never mind, they just-

02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:40.820
Medal of Modern Warfare?

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:44.980
It was a little name that they came up with, but he had actually been playing America's

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:45.980
Army.

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:46.980
Which-

02:31:46.980 --> 02:31:47.980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:50.020
I watched the medic training on that one, and it's pretty-

02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:53.660
Well, it's an army recruitment game at the end of the day, yeah.

02:31:53.660 --> 02:32:02.660
I mean, but he, what happened is that he had encountered a car crash where someone in an

02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:09.340
SUV flipped upside down and the car was spewing smoke, and he actually used the medic training

02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:16.580
from the game to help the guy, basically the person in the accident lost like two fingers

02:32:16.580 --> 02:32:21.540
and was gushing blood from his head, and he bandaged the hand, raised it above his head

02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:23.420
to stop the bleeding, and bandaged the guy's head-

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:24.740
Oh, my God.

02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:33.660
And contacted EMT, all from knowing, and he credited it to the medical training in America's

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:34.660
Army.

02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:35.660
Wow.

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:38.740
So, and then this one was actually pretty cool, and this is a World of Warcraft one,

02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:39.740
so this one-

02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:40.740
And he was immediately drafted.

02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:41.740
I'm just kidding.

02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:45.300
This one, this one hits a little close, because you'll know what I'm talking about.

02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:46.300
A little glimped?

02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:47.300
Okay.

02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:52.220
A 12-year-old Norwegian boy was walking with his sister and got attacked by a moose.

02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:55.220
Yeah, a moose once bit my sister.

02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:57.420
Ghost crawler promised me a moose.

02:32:57.420 --> 02:32:58.420
Okay.

02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:04.700
His sister was 10, and the moose started to charge him, male moose probably in season,

02:33:04.700 --> 02:33:12.300
and so the little boy taunted the moose away from his sister and played dead.

02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:14.620
And he credited it to World of Warcraft.

02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.700
To taunt and feign death.

02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:17.700
He said, if you've got-

02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.820
Well, now, hunters can't taunt.

02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:20.820
Let me finish.

02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:23.020
This damn kid doesn't know what he's talking about.

02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:25.020
Let me finish.

02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:33.540
But he said basically is that his brain translated it as aggro, and it was an aggressive animal,

02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:37.940
so he grabbed his attention, because an aggressive animal is going to go to the thing making

02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:40.620
the biggest noise, the biggest threat.

02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:47.300
And then he said he played dead, he feigned death, and the moose sniffed at him, nudged

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:52.420
him, and walked off, left him and his sister alone.

02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:53.420
Pretty neat.

02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:57.780
And the other ones on here, now those are like the big three for me on these, because

02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:03.900
the other ones are about how they're helping stroke victims recover by improving hand-eye

02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:05.900
coordination.

02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:09.860
There's another one here about a web browser game that people have used to discover two

02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:15.100
planets that's- Let me see if I can't get the name of this called.

02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:21.860
It's Planet Hunters, which basically chooses them to monitor light emissions, and it'll

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:27.180
do a certain thing when a planet crosses through a particular star's path, and players have

02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:30.340
discovered two planets that way.

02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:33.820
There's another one on here about helping stroke victims recover.

02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:39.860
One of them got really excited, but it turned out it was just Bluto.

02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:46.100
And then- Thank you, I'll be here all week.

02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:52.740
They used the skills of a 14-year-old boy who invented a procedure, this is for a science

02:34:52.740 --> 02:35:00.740
fair project, of using a controller to do internal stitches, where you'd have to use

02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:02.420
a robot for it.

02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:07.780
And now you kind of have that with Kinect, if the Windows commercials are to be believed.

02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:16.140
But it was using a surgical device called an endostitch, and it's used to sew up patients

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:24.240
after a hysterectomy, but he was using that same procedure only with a video game controller

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:25.240
for medical purposes.

02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:28.260
But I want to go back to the first three that I listed.

02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:33.940
Those are, instead of just applying what you know from video games, those are saving people's

02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:34.940
lives.

02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:41.140
I mean, when you have a bear come in your thing, you're told to play dead, but he specifically

02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:44.780
said that he needed to taunt the aggro away.

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:45.780
From his sister, yeah.

02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:54.600
And, you know, I've run into, like, I had a case when I was playing PSO, where I actually

02:35:54.600 --> 02:36:02.140
got really sick and was given some advice from just a random person in there who happened

02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:05.020
to be an EMT.

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:08.660
And it took care of me from being nauseous, I didn't have to go to the hospital.

02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:13.100
I think I told you about that, like, yeah.

02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:16.460
You know, I've had plenty of friends that were going through really hard times that

02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:20.740
just, you know, being friends with them online has kind of kept their head above water so

02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:22.660
that they have a support network.

02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:28.300
You know, but the one that really struck me was the guy getting the, you know, the medical

02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:29.300
training.

02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:34.740
And I watched the video, it's actually, I've had emergency training before, and it's more

02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:39.460
in depth than what I did in my first aid classes.

02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:44.500
So I'm just pretty amazed at that, I mean, what do you think of, I wanted to bring this

02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:48.140
up because people say, oh, video games make you violent, meh.

02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:51.300
Well, obviously, I know that that's not true, and, you know, I've heard of some of these

02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:52.860
good things before.

02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:55.260
There's sometimes a dark side to these MMOs.

02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:59.040
You know, we heard about the, you know, kidnapped across state lines and all that.

02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:03.340
It's nice to hear some of the good stuff, too, about how technology, I think it's more

02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:09.020
technology is saving lives, and, you know, gaming is that technology, some of it.

02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:12.780
So I don't know, how can you argue with the good news here?

02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:14.660
I mean, it's good stuff.

02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:23.340
I just really wish that more, like, more mainstream news sources would really focus more on advertising

02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:28.140
stuff like this instead of just finding sensationalist stories that give everybody a bad name.

02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:30.380
Speaking of supporting independent media.

02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.380
Exactly.

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:35.900
Yeah, and this is, wow, stutter-tastic.

02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:40.760
This kind of thing, it's exactly the kind of thing you want to hear, because it's people

02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:47.020
that are applying any kind of knowledge that's at least rooted in some kind of truth.

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:49.660
It's such, yeah, they have a weird association.

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:51.620
I learned about it from a video game.

02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:52.620
Big deal.

02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:53.620
As long as you've learned.

02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:54.620
Good for them.

02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:58.220
They did something fantastic with a little bit of knowledge bestowed upon them.

02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:00.900
You know, I actually did learn how to drive through Ridge Racer.

02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:02.140
No, big-

02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:08.700
And it's funny that you say that, because when I was starting to get towards the age

02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:15.220
of learning driving, about to go to driving school, my grandpa, one of my grandpas, would

02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:19.140
give me a hard time because I would talk about driving video games.

02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:25.380
And it's like, I think I probably went a little bit above and beyond in a sense that I don't

02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:30.220
want to, I think I may have one time said, I don't want to drive, you know, video games

02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:33.100
can't kill you, so I would rather do that instead.

02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:37.540
But at the same time, it's like, I went in there and I wasn't scared of driving.

02:38:37.540 --> 02:38:39.980
I wasn't, it wasn't new to me.

02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:43.060
I've been in my parents' car plenty of times.

02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:45.380
Yeah, you pick up things like this.

02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:46.380
Well, great.

02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:49.860
My whole thing was that I always had problems cornering because I was learning how to drive

02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:54.900
in a boat pretty much, you know, an older large vehicle.

02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:59.020
And it was, because you know how wonky the original Ridge Racer steering was and how

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:01.580
you had to be super careful with your cornering.

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:07.020
It was while playing that game that it clicked in my head what I was doing wrong in the car.

02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:08.500
And I never had a problem cornering.

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:09.500
Never.

02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:10.500
All right.

02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:14.500
Well, you can ask Ron about that when I managed to make that turn off off the Bay Bridge to

02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:17.500
going to Treasure Island in my Lancer and drifted.

02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:19.180
Ah, all right.

02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:20.180
Let's move on.

02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:21.180
I'm trying to get to call.

02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:22.180
So we have some time for calls.

02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:23.180
Loki quickly.

02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:24.180
All right.

02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:25.980
I will be super quick.

02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:29.980
So let's talk a little bit about Peter Molyneux.

02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:35.640
Well, not Peter Molyneux per se, but Peter Moly-doe.

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:42.060
It's the parody account that's on Twitter that comes up with all these weird like game

02:39:42.060 --> 02:39:43.060
ideas.

02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:47.800
Like for example, you control a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during winter.

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:51.980
You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses.

02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:53.740
So similar to the OLR dream games.

02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:54.960
Yeah, something like that.

02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:57.220
Just really weird stuff.

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.340
Here's the funny thing.

02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:04.620
Someone has convinced him that he should do a game jam where independent developers out

02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:10.120
there will create games based on these crazy ideas.

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:11.460
And that's what's going to happen.

02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:20.220
Actually going to Moly Jam 2012 is set to run, I guess, March 31st and or through April

02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:21.220
1st.

02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:30.740
And actually a few cities, San Francisco and Brighton also that has expanded to now a few

02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:40.300
more cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Melbourne and New York.

02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:47.380
And of course, what's even more interesting about that is Peter Molyneux is actually going

02:40:47.380 --> 02:40:49.820
to join in on this as well.

02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:52.380
Now that he's got some free time.

02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.460
Good for him having a sense of humor about the whole thing.

02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:58.260
And he's actually, it's kind of funny, is some of the ideas like for example, there

02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:05.700
is a post by the Peter Molyneux that he's all, my first mobile game will be free, but

02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:11.140
if you pay a little, then the NPCs will be extra nice and compliment you more while playing.

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:14.140
Peter Molyneux responds, that's not a bad idea actually.

02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:17.620
And so, you know, just like, you know, funny things like that.

02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:20.740
And this one's another funny one.

02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:24.380
Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment.

02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:28.860
Your baby would act as a torch, rocking the baby intensifies the glow, et cetera.

02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:36.060
You know, just like, that just makes me think of the crying scene for Max Payne.

02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:39.520
But the whole thing is, you know, he has these really weird ideas, but there's actually some

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.340
funny ones that he came up with like the bullying, the RPG or whatever that had bullying as,

02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:47.620
you know, the combat system or something like that.

02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:51.300
And so they're gonna make some of these things, including that rabbit one, they actually have

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:52.880
a video of that.

02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:59.460
And yeah, there's actually some people that are, you know, interested in doing that.

02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:04.580
They're saying that, I guess they're, I'm trying to see if there's any other really

02:42:04.580 --> 02:42:05.580
big guys.

02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:10.820
The people behind it right now, the organizers, Anna Kipleness, Brandon Sheffield, Patrick

02:42:10.820 --> 02:42:21.140
Klepec, which I think he was from Joystiq, Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Joe Kowalski, and

02:42:21.140 --> 02:42:24.380
Edward Paris.

02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:31.420
So it's interesting, and of course, if you're interested in this, you can check out, well,

02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:37.400
you can follow, or check out Vox Games, or you can follow, I think they've got a website

02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.660
for this already, let's see here.

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:45.380
I know some people that are participating in this, so it's gonna be fun.

02:42:45.380 --> 02:43:02.420
Yeah, well, first off, you can check the fake Twitter account for, it's Peter Molydeux,

02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:12.060
and they have a Google Docs page, but you can just look it up, it's Game Jams Fun Time,

02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:13.860
Fun Times.

02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:18.700
So yeah, check it out, and then of course, you know, I think they're gonna be adding

02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:21.500
like an actual webpage and stuff for this at some point.

02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:26.940
Alright, I got one more story for you guys, and I'm gonna make this real quick, because

02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:31.880
this is something that has been going around for forever, and just will not go away, and

02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:34.460
that is that there is no new Xbox this year at E3.

02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:37.540
I could've sworn this was already reported on, but it made the rounds on the gaming blogs

02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:39.420
again this week.

02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:43.920
Some folks that are close to, I guess, Bloomberg, are insisting that Microsoft's gonna introduce

02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:46.660
a new console in 2013.

02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:52.840
It'll be at E3 next year, but Bloomberg Magazine was told by David Dennis, who's a group manager

02:43:52.840 --> 02:44:00.120
of PR at Xbox, 2012 is all about the Xbox 360, so stop the rumors, there will be no

02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:02.740
slick new Xbox lube until 2013.

02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:05.160
There you go.

02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:06.160
That's the final word.

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:08.300
Well it makes sense, they've got stuff to show off this year, next year will be when

02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:09.300
they unveil it.

02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:13.500
Alright, we are gonna open the phones, so call now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:18.200
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is

02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:22.900
OrangeLoungeRadio, and damn that's fast, it's already lighting up, we got a call, hi you're

02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:24.660
on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:25.660
This is Shane.

02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:28.180
Hey, you're fast, you like know when we're gonna open it up, what's up?

02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:31.060
I know, it's like I was given advanced warning or something.

02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:34.100
Something like that, well what's on your mind tonight, what do you wanna talk about?

02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:37.260
What do I normally talk about?

02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:38.260
Mass Effect.

02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:43.380
Yes, that is my second best favorite thing in the world, so let's talk about that.

02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:47.140
Okay, since you're pissed off that I didn't give you credit for getting me into Mass Effect,

02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:50.780
which was basically that you were pouting and whining and crying and threatening not

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:53.540
to be my friend anymore unless I would play Mass Effect.

02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:59.260
Which that's a lie, I think I just bombarded you with me talking about it, I don't think

02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:01.220
there was pouting or crying.

02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:02.220
There was a little bit.

02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.580
You need to convince Jamie that she should play it too.

02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:07.300
Jamie, it's gonna, it'll change your life.

02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:09.740
Buy me a copy.

02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:10.740
We're all poor.

02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:11.740
Me too please.

02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:12.740
I'm broke.

02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:17.540
Alright, we're pressed for time tonight, so what do you wanna say about Mass Effect?

02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:22.620
Well as I sit here just exiting out of Mass Effect 1 that I was just playing, and in

02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:32.740
my N7 t-shirt, I would probably like to say that I am on the side of the retake Mass Effect

02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:36.220
3 movement, which is give us a different ending.

02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:37.220
Oh, why?

02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:39.580
You didn't go to the government, did you?

02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:43.220
No, I'm not stupid, I joined a Facebook group.

02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:46.260
Well, that's activism of the 21st century.

02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:50.140
Alright, so at least you're not totally crazy, you're in the same crowd.

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:54.020
So without spoiling, why is the ending pissing everybody off?

02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:59.020
It's pretty much for the reason, well, the good reason that it's making everybody angry

02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:04.100
is that, like you said earlier, everything you've done up until the last 10 minutes of

02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:08.180
the game does not matter based on these endings.

02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:10.820
I don't care if it's not a happy ending.

02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:16.820
I didn't really expect it to be happy endings, but I expect an actual ending that makes sense,

02:46:16.820 --> 02:46:23.180
not some Matrix crap or something stupid like that.

02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:30.740
And I'm also part of the group of people that believe one of the endings that you get, if

02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:35.060
you do really well with all the extra stuff in the game, you get like an extra 10 seconds,

02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:40.860
and that leads to this entirely different theory about all the endings and that this

02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:45.300
one that you may consider bad is actually leading up to a real ending that they have

02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:46.540
not given us yet.

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:49.400
And I will pay for DLC if they do it.

02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:52.340
So what is the point of joining the Facebook group?

02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.340
What do you want?

02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:54.460
What do you want out of all this?

02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:57.940
I want a DLC ending.

02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:03.300
Like I could see if somebody is not invested in the series, the endings are probably fine

02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:04.820
for them.

02:47:04.820 --> 02:47:12.660
But seeing as how I really like everything about the story and my Shepard's journey,

02:47:12.660 --> 02:47:16.780
they didn't end it like they kind of promised they would.

02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:21.900
And I'm not going to be like, I'll never buy one of your games again, but I will be like,

02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:26.800
I'll pay for DLC for you guys to make it right.

02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:28.660
Do you think that you should have to do that though?

02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:32.940
Do you feel like maybe you're being exploited a little bit for your money because you're

02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:33.940
so into this?

02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:36.200
No, I don't think so.

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:38.740
I think they just had a screw up.

02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:39.740
That's it.

02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:44.260
And I'm reading what a SIG vampire says, I'm just ignoring it because it doesn't, that

02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:49.020
part doesn't matter in one and two and when you end a trilogy and they promise that everything

02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:54.740
you've done up until the point is going to shape your game and it doesn't, that's where

02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:57.340
it's stupid.

02:47:57.340 --> 02:48:01.700
But complaining to the government over it's pretty stupid too, you got to admit.

02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:04.780
No, I definitely agree with that.

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:08.520
Now you sure, you sure there's never going to be another Mass Effect game?

02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:14.340
They said, again, you know, who knows what Bioware is really thinking sometimes, but

02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:18.180
they said if they ever did another game, it would not take place after three, you'd have

02:48:18.180 --> 02:48:21.180
to take place before or during three.

02:48:21.180 --> 02:48:27.460
And I don't know for a game like this, I don't understand why I'd want to play something

02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:31.680
that takes place before the Mass Effect one through three and that definitely don't want

02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:37.540
to play something that takes place during three unless it's just extra DLC for three.

02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:43.680
So yeah, I can't see them doing a four that takes place after three, especially with what

02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.740
the endings do right now, currently.

02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:48.940
All right, well I got to wrap up to get more calls or any other thoughts you want to get

02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:49.940
in there?

02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:53.260
Um, I had one and then I forgot it.

02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:55.300
Yeah, I forgot it.

02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:56.300
All right.

02:48:56.300 --> 02:48:57.300
That's right.

02:48:57.300 --> 02:48:58.300
Right.

02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:59.300
You forget.

02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:00.300
All right.

02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:01.300
Whatever.

02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:02.300
All right.

02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:03.300
By the way, Alan beat Mass Effect one if you didn't hear it.

02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:06.460
I know I talked to him on life journal about it already on it.

02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:07.460
All right.

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:08.460
Yeah.

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:09.460
I better let you go.

02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:10.460
So we get more calls.

02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:11.460
All right.

02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:12.460
Bye.

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:13.460
One eight seven seven game.

02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.460
OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio.

02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:15.460
You're laughing over there.

02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:16.460
Jason.

02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:19.580
Oh, just the, just, just the, just what's happening.

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:20.580
Just the conversation around you.

02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:21.580
Right.

02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:22.580
All right.

02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:23.580
We got another call.

02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:24.580
Hi.

02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:25.580
You're on orange launch radio.

02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:26.580
Who's this?

02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:27.580
What up guys?

02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:28.580
It's cynical for me.

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:29.580
Okay.

02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:30.580
See how you doing?

02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:31.580
Hey, I'm good.

02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:32.580
Xenocore.

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:33.580
I had no idea about that.

02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:34.580
Eighties music, by the way.

02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:35.580
Thank you for sending me straight on that.

02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:36.580
Yeah, no.

02:49:36.580 --> 02:49:37.580
Oh, good.

02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:38.580
What's up?

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:39.580
What's uh, what do we have the phone?

02:49:39.580 --> 02:49:40.580
Oh, the phone call to tonight.

02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:46.060
I only caught the second part of the previous caller, but, uh, as far as the, the ending

02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:48.180
and mass effect, it's, it's just piss poor.

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:53.340
I mean, literally Bioware has written much better content than that.

02:49:53.340 --> 02:49:57.580
Uh, again, trying to keep it spoiler free cause I'm, I'm making my way there, but what

02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:01.060
is it about the ending that's so irritating is it, would you say it's kind of the same

02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:04.580
thing that's been brought up before that no matter what you do, you're kind of getting

02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:06.220
the same shit at the end?

02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:13.700
True, but they could've even covered it by not giving you the actual choice just by picking

02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:17.940
something that you did in the past and it would auto pick that choice when you got to

02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:18.940
the end.

02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:22.900
So it actually, something you did had some sway over what happened, but the way they

02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:24.060
did it, it was all erased.

02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:28.860
It was all used for filler and considering the quality of writing that Bioware usually

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:33.640
puts out, surely their writers are a little bit better and coming up with summation better

02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.780
than that.

02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:39.540
So are you into the DLC conspiracy where you're getting something real, but for a low, low

02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:41.100
price of $10?

02:50:41.100 --> 02:50:44.900
Why would you pay for a product that's been trashed already?

02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:48.860
If you give me another 10 bucks, I'll actually finish it and put it together for you.

02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:53.060
No, if it said some assembly required, that's the way you're selling it.

02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:54.060
Cause it worked for Bethesda.

02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:58.900
Well true, I mean, I'm not saying they're not going to make money if they do that either.

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:04.160
That product was so good in one and two, it's almost guaranteed to make money with the DLC.

02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:05.160
It's guaranteed.

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.220
I mean, people are already asking for it, like, give me DLC, just finish the story the

02:51:09.220 --> 02:51:10.220
way we want.

02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:13.380
So they probably will, they'll charge 10 bucks and they'll get their money.

02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:17.380
Interesting, Shane is sending me a private message with this comment, maybe you want

02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:18.900
to respond to this, I don't know.

02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:23.780
He says the other thing he forgot was, it's about the precedent it sets demanding DLC

02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:24.780
endings.

02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:29.060
Also, how even though it had a terrible ending, it didn't ruin the journey or the game.

02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:33.100
Did the ending ruin Mass Effect for you?

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:37.700
I was watching a roomie play it, and it guaranteed I'm not buying it in a Mass Effect 3.

02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:41.340
I see, okay, so you just kind of saw it through somebody else, but that's okay, I mean, certainly

02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.340
you can get Mass Effect 3.

02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:45.840
Well, I mean, I saw enough of stuff on the internet without seeing all the trailers to

02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:51.200
know that if I got to that ending, because the game isn't that difficult, it's not like

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:55.960
the ending of Rygar to where getting to the ending is the feat itself because the game's

02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:58.460
so damn hard, few people actually see it.

02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:02.340
Well, to use the Sopranos comparison again, I didn't watch the whole series, I saw an

02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:05.620
episode or two, but even I know the ending of that sucked.

02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:12.260
True, true, I respect the way they did it, and even if, it's not so much the endings

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:17.900
they provided, it's just the way they came to those endings, the user has no, half the

02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:19.420
work you do is erased.

02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:24.420
God, I never play video games to completion, ever, ever, so if I beat Mass Effect 3, that's

02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:29.460
a big if, but if I beat Mass Effect 3, that in itself is going to be like a noteworthy

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:36.260
thing for the journal, you know, like, I beat a video game, because my ADD usually kicks

02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:40.500
in 20 hours before this point.

02:52:40.500 --> 02:52:43.820
Some point I will finish Final Fantasy 13 too, I swear.

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:44.820
Squirrels!

02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:46.860
Seven, in my case.

02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:55.140
Oh, but I don't finish seven, because speaking of shit endings, alright, hey, SSJ100 Matt

02:52:55.140 --> 02:53:00.220
says Bioware trolled you all, did Bioware troll us, Xenocore?

02:53:00.220 --> 02:53:05.320
Exactly, exactly, I'm convinced something must have happened corporate wise, maybe they

02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:10.180
ran out of time and they rushed the ending, or something smells fishy as far as the development

02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:11.740
to why the game is the way it is.

02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:17.860
If the DLC conspiracies is true, then EA trolled us all.

02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:19.740
That's not too far fetched either, so.

02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:22.540
Alright, well Xenocore, anything else before we let you go?

02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:24.380
No, that's it, y'all take it easy.

02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:26.940
Alright you two, have a good one buddy.

02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:27.940
Alright, bye.

02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:35.060
877 game OLR, username on Skype, chat, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:36.060
What is that?

02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:37.060
You're having a fun night, Rob!

02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:41.780
I'm having like the burpiest night in the history of OLR, this is, what did I eat?

02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:46.860
I had, I had Mongolian BBQ, because I took, I took to a new place, there is a new place

02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:48.860
downtown called MongoMongo.

02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:50.940
I need to go there.

02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:51.940
Yes you do.

02:53:51.940 --> 02:53:52.940
It was good.

02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:53.940
Alright.

02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:54.940
Let's take a call.

02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:55.940
I gotta be fast.

02:53:55.940 --> 02:53:56.940
Hey.

02:53:56.940 --> 02:53:57.940
Hey Sky, how's it going?

02:53:57.940 --> 02:53:58.940
It's Legend Zaku here.

02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:00.020
Hey Zaku, you got through.

02:54:00.020 --> 02:54:01.020
What's up buddy?

02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:05.300
Yeah, it's been a long time, I don't know if I've actually called this year so far,

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:10.620
I may have done it in January, but yeah, I'm just like touching back on what you know,

02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:15.120
what you mentioned already with like Tim Shaver and Kickstarter and just like all these, all

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:21.700
these devel, all these like pop, developers that are basically, yeah these uh, these video

02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:28.220
game shops that apparently, because of the way the business works, that you know, sourcing

02:54:28.220 --> 02:54:35.000
out to Kickstarter might, it might open new avenues, but at the same time, it's, it breaks

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:40.140
the mold of the way that whole business has, you know, publisher, the whole video game

02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:44.580
industry has like switched in the past 15 or so years.

02:54:44.580 --> 02:54:49.820
Like back in the days of NES and Super Nintendo, it wasn't really about like pumping out sequels

02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:54.320
that quickly, it was about creating like games that would be memorable and that would just

02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:56.020
be pushing the envelope.

02:54:56.020 --> 02:55:01.880
Nowadays you have companies like Activision and to an extent EA just short, just thinking

02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:02.880
with a short sight.

02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:03.880
Well, hold on, hold on.

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:06.340
In other words, taking a franchise and just milking it out.

02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:09.060
You want to know one interesting thing I read today that I didn't realize?

02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:11.180
Like thank you Wikipedia, I learned something new today.

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:15.440
You know, even though I wouldn't say this is necessarily an example of milking it out,

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:20.180
it's certainly Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link on the Nintendo Entertainment System,

02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:21.660
nine months after the original.

02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:23.780
I mean, talk about a quick turnaround.

02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:26.820
Well, I mean, those are exceptions, but you also have to take in the ones that, you know,

02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:32.100
the ones that have grown up in my childhood, you know, stuff like Super Mario World, the

02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:33.100
Sonic series.

02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:34.100
In Japan, by the way.

02:55:34.100 --> 02:55:36.460
Even the first early titles of the PlayStation.

02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:40.200
Those were like groundbreaking in the sense that they, they push, you know, they push

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:43.240
the game styles into a different direction.

02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:47.060
Then you have like, then nowadays you have companies like Activision, for example, that

02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:48.460
only live by the quarter.

02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:53.620
Like, you know, they milk Call of Duty and they see that as something where they can,

02:55:53.620 --> 02:55:55.620
you know, make money in the short term.

02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:56.620
Milking is destroyed.

02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.100
This is where the bean counter perspective comes into the industry, which so far has

02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:04.380
been a fixture of it for quite a while now.

02:56:04.380 --> 02:56:10.260
So, you know, in other words, instead of like actual video game developers, you know, brainstorming

02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:14.740
ideas, you have like, you have the suits, for example, that just do, you know, they

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:18.900
have research and they have numbers in which they can create, you know, facts out of anything

02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:23.740
as a means of creating ideas in which they can, you know, they can milk.

02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:28.500
Milking franchises, though, like, as like Guitar Hero was destroyed by the milking,

02:56:28.500 --> 02:56:31.060
you know, like, so it hasn't always been successful.

02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:35.340
The whole video, the whole rhythm music game genre is pretty much on its last throws because

02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:36.340
of that.

02:56:36.340 --> 02:56:41.060
It wasn't until Guitar Hero that it, you know, after it went mainstream, it basically fizzled

02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:42.060
out.

02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:48.420
Like, this is like everything before that time, like during when Konami still had a

02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:54.900
handle on that genre, it was still pretty underground, but it wasn't going away any

02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:55.900
time soon.

02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:59.220
You know, they were still milking out, I mean, they were still sending out new titles and

02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:00.220
so forth.

02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:05.500
But, as I said, once you bring something mainstream, that's one of the, you know, it's one of

02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:08.540
the vulnerabilities right there.

02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.540
Alright.

02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:12.740
I have to wrap up, I have to wrap up because we're supposed to be done at 9.15 tonight,

02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:16.260
but quickly, any like final thoughts on this?

02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:21.140
I'm pretty certain that the video game publishers have like a cabal with the reviewers to the

02:57:21.140 --> 02:57:26.980
point where, at some point, the feds have to get involved, thinking that you may have

02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:32.460
like a case where these publishers are paying their way, not through like official channels,

02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:39.580
but under the table in terms of a paying for like reviews or any of that type that might

02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:40.580
be...

02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:41.900
I want them all dragged through the courts!

02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:44.020
I want mud flung on them!

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:49.580
Sony got busted for astroturfing for the PSP a few years ago, for actually like posting

02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:55.620
it through another, through a supposedly, you know, real actual user, or an actual blog

02:57:55.620 --> 02:58:01.700
post that turned out to be fake, it was mostly, you know, marketing posts without disclosing

02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:07.820
whether or not they had like a, that they were actually, you know, part Sony.

02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:08.820
Alright.

02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:09.820
I gotta wrap up.

02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:10.820
Thank you so much, Zaku.

02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:11.820
Have a good one.

02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:12.820
Have a good one too.

02:58:12.820 --> 02:58:13.820
Later.

02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:17.820
Sorry, I couldn't give him more time, but I'm supposed to be wrapped up by now.

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:21.180
Thank you guys so much for getting, those of you that were able to call through on Skype

02:58:21.180 --> 02:58:22.180
tonight.

02:58:22.180 --> 02:58:26.740
If you didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but do send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:58:26.740 --> 02:58:30.940
I did not mean to ignore the Twitters tonight, let me just quickly get through some of these

02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:37.140
at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Ramaditya Knight sent us some NES soundtracks to check out,

02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:38.660
and so I'm gonna check those out.

02:58:38.660 --> 02:58:44.420
Dragon Fighter, Shatterhand, Final Mission, some pretty good picks in there.

02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:49.820
Eric RPG sent us a link to a Kickstarter, but this is for a JRPG that looks like it

02:58:49.820 --> 02:58:50.820
could be interesting.

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:54.660
It's called Americana Dawn, and definitely looks like kind of the old retro.

02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:58.420
I don't want to say like Super Nintendo, but maybe a little more like PlayStation era,

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:00.140
like RPGs.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:04.620
So that's pretty cool, and for $7 you can put an NPC in the development room.

02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:07.580
So if this looks like something you want to support, there you go.

02:59:07.580 --> 02:59:10.780
They've raised well over half of what they're supposed to get.

02:59:10.780 --> 02:59:14.400
They're only trying to get $2,700, so that's pretty cool.

02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:16.980
So good luck with that.

02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:18.320
Tiger Claw sent us a few links.

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:21.180
I'm not gonna be able to super duper have time to get into these.

02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:22.980
One of these is about the Pong Developer Challenge.

02:59:22.980 --> 02:59:26.380
I actually think we touched on this last week because there was some controversy about this

02:59:26.380 --> 02:59:33.180
whole thing, about how the rights were being sold over to Atari, but I got an email on

02:59:33.180 --> 02:59:37.100
it this week too, so I guess they're still pushing it, and I haven't really heard any

02:59:37.100 --> 02:59:39.120
clarifications from Atari.

02:59:39.120 --> 02:59:44.860
The other one has to do with the Tiger Claw sent me Mass Effect 3 and the Gay card.

02:59:44.860 --> 02:59:52.020
I want to read this in more detail and probably talk about it at a later time, because obviously

02:59:52.020 --> 02:59:54.060
this is an issue I would be interested in.

02:59:54.060 --> 02:59:59.980
I think some people are unfairly, there's some people out there like, I don't want Shepherd

02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:00.980
to be gay.

03:00:00.980 --> 03:00:03.620
Why does Bioware have to make everything gay?

03:00:03.620 --> 03:00:04.620
Well you know what?

03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:06.820
Why does everything have to be one way or the other?

03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:10.940
One thing I really like about Mass Effect is you have the freedom to do what you want

03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:12.860
or not do something.

03:00:12.860 --> 03:00:13.860
Hello?

03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:14.860
So.

03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:15.860
Anyhow.

03:00:15.860 --> 03:00:20.100
I will read that more later.

03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:24.660
SJ100Matt sent us a link about Chinatown Fair Arcade reopening, but I think that was covered

03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:25.660
in Rapid Fire News.

03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:27.020
Did we cover that at some point?

03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:28.020
No.

03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:29.340
Oh, I thought we had that linked.

03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:33.300
All right, well, Chinatown Fair Arcade rumored reopening, there you go.

03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:36.340
And that's it for Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:37.980
Call me when Arcade Infinity reopens.

03:00:37.980 --> 03:00:38.980
Yeah, right?

03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:42.020
Talking about things that disappeared in the last couple years.

03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:46.460
Yeah, sorry about all the closures coming to California.

03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:50.540
We need to wrap up and get out of here for the night, but we need to get our final thoughts

03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:51.540
first.

03:00:51.540 --> 03:00:53.180
Jason, thank you so much for being here.

03:00:53.180 --> 03:00:57.180
And thank you, of course, for hosting our website, as you so graciously have, for the

03:00:57.180 --> 03:01:00.300
past probably about eight years that you've been doing the website.

03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:01.300
Thank you.

03:01:01.300 --> 03:01:02.720
You know, I really, really appreciate that.

03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:07.180
And I don't think the listeners understand, without you, there wouldn't be fucking web

03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:08.920
space to download shows.

03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:13.340
There would be a place, you know, Live 365 or something like that to go to, but outside

03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:14.340
of it.

03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:15.340
No, no, no.

03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:16.340
Oh, the horror, the horror.

03:01:16.340 --> 03:01:19.140
It's kind of medium to listen, but beyond that, you know, I do what I can.

03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:22.980
I've enjoyed the ride, and why the hell stop it?

03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:24.080
So why do we need Kickstarter?

03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:26.960
We have generous people like Jason who help us out with what they can, you know, help

03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:27.960
get us.

03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:29.300
I need Kickstarter to recoup costs.

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:30.300
Come on, guys.

03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:31.300
No, no, no, no.

03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:32.300
All right.

03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:34.660
So, Jason, final thoughts tonight?

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:35.660
Kirby Superstar.

03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:39.100
All right, Loki, final thoughts tonight?

03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:44.260
I hope there's not a size limit to Excel files, because the one I'm using right now to make

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:48.060
a editor for Grand Theft Auto Maps is 65 megs now.

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:51.780
I think 65,535 rows is the most you can have.

03:01:51.780 --> 03:01:52.780
That's rows.

03:01:52.780 --> 03:01:53.780
I'm talking about file size.

03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:54.780
Oh, good luck with that.

03:01:54.780 --> 03:01:58.540
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:01.580
And my final thought is Cool Whip.

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:02.580
Yay!

03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:03.580
Cool Whip.

03:02:03.580 --> 03:02:04.580
Yes, Cool Whip.

03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:05.580
Cool Whip.

03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:06.580
All right.

03:02:06.580 --> 03:02:10.060
Thank you, guys, so much for downloading and listening live to our program.

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:11.300
We really appreciate it.

03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:12.780
You know we do it for free.

03:02:12.780 --> 03:02:17.660
We don't ask for your money, although maybe I'll get talked into the Kickstarter thing.

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:18.660
I don't know, though.

03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:19.660
I kind of doubt it.

03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:21.020
But we'll see.

03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:22.100
I do say this, though.

03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:26.100
If you enjoy what you've heard, please tell somebody about the show.

03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:27.400
Help spread the word.

03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:29.300
Help grow our community.

03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:33.020
This is a no embargo zone, and we give you our honest opinions.

03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:34.020
Actually, we did sign one.

03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:36.660
We signed one once, and we got burned by it.

03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:38.340
It wasn't about reviews, though.

03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:39.340
That's something else.

03:02:39.340 --> 03:02:40.340
I'm not going to get into it now.

03:02:40.340 --> 03:02:41.340
We're out of time.

03:02:41.340 --> 03:02:48.980
It's an easy topic if we want to talk about that while we're not recording.

03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:49.980
Okay, then.

03:02:49.980 --> 03:02:53.620
We're going to turn off the mics and say, see you next week.

03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:54.620
We'll be back.

03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:57.860
Thank you, guys, very much for tuning in and supporting the show.

03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:58.860
We love you guys.

03:02:58.860 --> 03:02:59.860
Have a great week.

03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:00.860
Bye, everyone.
