00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 25th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
A classic arcade game will come to Xbox Live Arcade with Kinect controls

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Amazon stopped stocking one release from this month

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And could games soon carry a warning similar to cigarettes?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And we're live with the 451st episode of our show for this

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
March the 25th of 2012

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming culture and all that good stuff

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
With my co-hosts, first off, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How are you?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Um, hungry

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hungry?

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Are you about to participate in the Hunger Games? You're so hungry?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Shut up

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Or the Hungry Hungry Hippo Games?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
No I'm actually not hungry because I had broth but I will be fasting every Sunday now

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Now is this a religious thing?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
No

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Well you never know, it's worth the shot right?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
It's for my health

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Okay, like a new, I don't want to say new craze but

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
No it's not

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
It's something I've been debating doing for like the last year or so so now I'm actually doing it

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
So I'm assuming you've done the appropriate research and all that good stuff

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Yes

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Just letting the listeners know

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
So

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
It's not something you're doing on a whim

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
In a month I will be discussing my results

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Are you incorporating any exergaming into this?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Same stuff I'm always doing, I do yoga like every day

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Mhm

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
So

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Alright, also say hello to definitely not fasting, Techmaster Loki

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Funny you used to say that actually

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
My wife wants me to do that too starting after

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Do you think your wife may or may not have been influenced by a co-host on this show?

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
No she did that because she had to not eat for a couple days for procedures she just had done so

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
She's like well if I can keep doing that I can lose some weight

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Well this is dangerous territory though

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No fasting actually isn't bad for you

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
It's a gaming show we're getting way off topic but this is much different than you know some people don't eat

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
I mean it seems like with this fasting thing you're still eating some and it's a scheduled thing

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
You're still eating some nutritional value things

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
It's just not a lot of the other stuff

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It's basically just cutting out you know

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
And part of it for me that I really like about it is that I have a full 24 hours where I don't think about food

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I have been more productive I've gotten so much stuff done

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
And honestly I felt super energized after I was done with my first one

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
That was Wednesday from 3 o'clock p.m. to Thursday 3 o'clock p.m.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Went to yoga that night felt great

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
And it really is kind of crazy it's just sort of like my energy level shot way up

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm just trying to draw a clear line between what you're doing and what someone with a mental disorder who doesn't eat does

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
But I'm just trying to make that distinction clear

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
A person with a mental disorder would just not eat

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You know completely not

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Or maybe do like what was her face on the Partridge family Susan Day

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Who ate nothing but carrots and turned orange

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
That happened to me when I was a baby

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Well yeah it's beta-carotene

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It's different when you're a baby

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah but I mean I'm saying that you know there's people that will just you know do all the stuff

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
And this is really something that I've put research into and read a bunch of different stuff

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And I'm doing what I do with anything

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I try it for a month

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I see how I feel

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Check my health

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And this is someone who used to get blood tested every six months so

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Just want to make that clear for the listeners

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Especially if it's your first time listening

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Just want to make that clear

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
There's a clear difference here

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm not stupid

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Alright

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Loki sorry to cut you off but

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Wanted to make sure the listeners understood that

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
But you are you are clearly indulging in a feast tonight

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
With your bacon and garlic pizza

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I call that a meal but you know

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Alright you can join us live here

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
We are of course live tonight Sunday night

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
So we're always here Sundays at All Games Radio

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
www.allgames.com

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Although as he mentioned tonight he's going on a brief hiatus for the next two weeks

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So you'll just have to tune in right at 6 o'clock for the next couple weeks

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Because we'll be on there at All Games Radio

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Again www.allgames.com

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
We also always have our chat room with us

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
If you want to join us and chat with us throughout the evening

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And some folks are coming up with cute little names

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Fitness Lounge Radio from ActDeaf

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
And Diet Diet Revolution there from Hitstun

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
There you go

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Alright

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
We're going to get into some gaming news

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
And how our gaming weeks were and all that

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
But usually we have a little kick off topic here at the start

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And I want to talk about this tonight

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Because this is what lots of people

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Lots of people are talking about

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Facebook is any indication

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
It's like everybody's freaking talking about this

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And that's that movie The Hunger Games

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Which is announced today

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Best non-sequel opening ever

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Best, it beat Twilight

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Which can't be bad news

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I personally have not seen the movie myself

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I haven't read the books or anything

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm interested in seeing the movie

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Mostly because all my friends are like

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It's so good, it's so good

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And I'm not going to hate something just because it's good

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Loki you're doing it, did you go see it?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm not sure the wife took you to see it

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
What did you think?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
No the wife didn't take me to see it

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I had tickets to see it

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh sorry, how dare I?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
It was free

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Free popcorn

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It was alright

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
My wife had described it as Battle Royale meets Twilight

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
As in there's boyfriend, girlfriend, garbage

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And people killing each other

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
The best description I read on the internet was

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Battle Royale for soccer moms

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It's not really, no

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
I mean they don't really touch on the whole relationship stuff that much

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's just kind of briefly there

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And it actually is part of a plot point

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It's not necessarily, without spoiling too much

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
They try to work up the whole relationship thing

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
To get more sponsors, to get more perks

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
In the actual games themselves

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And so that's kind of why they're doing it that way

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
But it's not even like that big a deal

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
But I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh my god it's Battle Royale

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Although I do have to say that the filmmaker

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Must have gone to the Michael Bay school of camera work

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Because that shit was shaky all over the goddamn place

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I would rather you not mention that evil person's name

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Oh does this have to do with a certain Ninja Turtle?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Shut up

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I want to make this clear too

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
It was not bad

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
And Woody Harrelson's in it

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
That's always a pleasant surprise

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Because Woody Harrelson's character is awesome

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Before the Battle Royale, or excuse me before, oh boy

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Before the Hunger Games fans shoot me down with a bow and arrow

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I want to talk about the Battle Royale thing

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Because I do think people are running a little far with this whole comparison thing

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Because, hello, Battle Royale's like 12 years old

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
It's based, it's a completely different kind of book

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
That's very political in nature

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Of course they're going to time the re-release with what's going on here

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Because of the distant similarity

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
But my whole thing is that, you know, well for one

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
There was what? There was Logan's run

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
There was the Stephen King novel back in the 70's

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
You know, there's been other stuff about this type of topic too

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
And, how can you go Battle Royale and Hunger Games

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Or like the same movie and Hollywood doesn't

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
How can you say that?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And turn your head away from the fact that we have this

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Julia Roberts Snow White movie

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
And Chick from Twilight Snow White movie

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Coming out within literally three months of each other

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Going on over here

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
To which I hear the trailer for both were being played before the Hunger Games

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And I'm like, how can you fucking sit there and compare the Hunger Games to Battle Royale

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
When this shit's going on?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
No, they did not have the Mirror Mirror trailer

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But yeah, I'm well aware of Mirror Mirror

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
At first I thought they were the same movie

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I'm like, man, that first trailer was really dark

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But this one makes it look like a comedy

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm really confused with what's going on here

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Right?

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
But, uh, yeah, it's just, um, it's a little bit dark

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
I mean, it's not as dark as Battle Royale

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I mean, there's killing and stuff

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
And they have kind of the same stuff

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
There's alliances and, you know, that kind of thing

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
But I think Battle Royale is a lot darker

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I mean, it's a little bit similar where they, you know, pick people

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
You know, fight to the death and stuff like that

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But at the same time, it's just, it's a little weird

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't know

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Gamer Girl in our chatroom says Logan's run is getting a re-release too

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And that's not really surprising

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Anything remotely resembling the Hunger Games is gonna come back

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Because, again, it's the biggest non-sequel ever

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
It has come to take Harry Potter's place for a few years in Hollywood as the young adult

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Because ain't no one gonna admit they like Twilight

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Next year we'll see The Long Walk and then another Lord of the Flies

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
That's the Stephen King novel I was trying to think of

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
They'll adapt that

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
That shit is getting green-lit

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Then we'll get an American Battle Royale

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I hope not

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I hope not

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
The next one's gonna be Andrew's Game

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
That's gonna be the next big one that's gonna be coming out in a year from now

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
By the way, you know, Logan's run came out the year I was born

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh, really?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Wow, that's an old movie

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You set yourself up for that

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm telling you right there

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Ready Player One?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You finish that shit

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
That is gonna be box office gold right there

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Here's what I really wanted to talk about

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I didn't want to be at Hunger Games podcast tonight

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
What I really wanted to talk about was

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Again, biggest non-sequel ever

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And they kinda knew this was gonna happen, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Where's the video game?

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Now, before you write your emails and chatters

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Yes, I'm aware of the iOS video game

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
That's the whole indie developer collaboration

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I've played it

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
It's pretty sweet

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But it is a very simple game

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
That is a light, tight

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I mean, it's fucking free

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And it's got a pretty cool soundtrack

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It's worth looking at

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
But it's not a video game based on the movie

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It wouldn't work

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
How so?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
How so? Because there's not really anything you could do

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
You play as a character and you go and kill other kids

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean, do they really want a killing kids video game?

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Ten years ago on this show, we used to love Battle Royale

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Remember when we all first saw that movie?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
We had the paper play stuff

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
And we said, there is no fucking way this movie is ever coming out in America

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
They are not gonna do it

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And now they are

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
You can't put kids killing kids on the screen

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Not in this day and age, ten years ago

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
In the wake of Columbine

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And the reason why Battle Royale is coming out

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Is because the mainstream studios wouldn't bring it out

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And I think it's either Anchor Bay

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Or some Hong Kong movie distributor

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
That's actually putting it out over here

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's not necessarily some mainstream

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
It's not like Warner Brothers or Lionsgate

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Or something like that

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
It's putting it out here

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
But it wouldn't work

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
It's so much smaller scale

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
It wouldn't really work as an action game

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Or a stealth action game

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Or something like that

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Because there's only twelve

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Or twenty-four kids originally in that

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And it's just not

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Whereas Battle Royale is a little bit more free form

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
It's just hunting people down

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
And stuff like that

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
It just wouldn't really work

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Now the later movies

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Or later books would work

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I was just about to say

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Maybe, now without spoiling

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But I understand the later books

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Are more of a

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Her against the government type of piece

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Put it very plainly like that

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So maybe that would translate better towards a video game

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, that might work

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Go to our chatroom

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
At chat.orangelinesradio.com

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Stan says

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I would love to see an American Battle Royale movie

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
With Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and all them assholes

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Shoot each other

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Except, wait a minute

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
There wasn't a lot of shooting in Battle Royale

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
There was some, but not a lot

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
There was plenty of gunfire

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I thought most people died from explosives

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And there was some

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Like I remember

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Meetsco got a hold of the thing

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
And then dude went all out with the automatic gun

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
And

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Alright, so there were no guns in this movie

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Which was my complaint

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm like, okay

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Because spoiling

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, I don't know if I want to spoil

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Don't, let me read another comment from chat

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Derek Gage in chat says

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Titanic was a sequel?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Hold on, I said biggest opening weekend

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Remember, Titanic made all its money

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Because it was number one at the box office for like

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
What, four or five months?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Because

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
A lot of people were going to see it multiple times

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I'll admit, I saw Titanic in the theater three times

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I didn't

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I saw it once on VHS and I wanted to kill myself

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's not that I loved Titanic

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
But you have to

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I realized my dad was very into Titanic stuff

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Way before the movie

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I remember watching a National Geographic special

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And I was like seven years old, way before the movie

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And I went to see it with him

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Then I went to see it with some other friends in college

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Because a bunch of them hadn't seen it and wanted to go

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And then I ended up seeing it one other time

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Really cheap for some reason

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And you know, it was

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It was a good movie

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
But I won't see this 3D re-release

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I will not see the 3D re-release

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But it's James Cameron doing 3D

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That might not be bad

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't care

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So anyhow

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So you're saying the Hunger Games

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
video game didn't happen because it's not possible

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Even though it wouldn't be good

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It would seem like there's all these

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
video game movie games that come out

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Although, not a lot lately

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Right? They never did a video game

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
for The Dark Knight

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Right?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
One had been cancelled or something like that I think

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't think any had been announced for this

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
new Batman movie, which you think would be a perfect

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
tie-in

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Surely they've got to be doing an Avengers game, right?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
No, at least not that I'm aware

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
There's a Facebook game

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
The next movie game that they have coming out

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
is Madagascar 3

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Did the movie video game genre die?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
No, see in the month of May

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
You have Madagascar 3

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
from D3

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
You have two from Activision

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Men in Black

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and Battleship

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
The movie based off the board game

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
The video game based off the movie

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
based off the board game

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And we will still not have our Liam Neeson

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
saying E5

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Liam Neeson's awesome

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
My problem with the movie

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Spoiler!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Even though it's not out yet

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
He dies! And I don't fucking

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
care about the rest of the movie after he dies

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
He needs to be there punching

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
aliens in the face

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Just get out of the fucking battleship

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
He doesn't need the goddamn battleship

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You can just punch him in the face with a goddamn broken bottle on his hand

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I can't believe you would ruin Battleship the movie

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh yeah, that

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Who cares? So what? He dies, big deal

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Honestly, Battleship the movie

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
is like Independence Day

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
You look back at Independence Day

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I loved the movie, but it was fucking ridiculous

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
It made no sense, it was just ridiculous

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
This is true

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
But you know what? It's a fucking

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I saw Independence Day

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I think the second, the third, and the fourth

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And maybe the fifth

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I saw it like four or five days in a row

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And it was great

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
every time

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Did they make a video game out of Independence Day? I don't remember

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Yes, they did on the Playstation 1

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And it was fucking terrible

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It really was

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
AcidicVampire in chat says

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I hope the Battleship movie climaxes with a strategic battle

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
in the style of the board game

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Me too, that's the only way you could convince me to see it

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Liam Neeson and Rihanna

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
sit down and they go to town

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
on a game of Battleship

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I don't even care, I think it's gonna be awesome

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I mean, it's such a terrible

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's a movie you go into and you know

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
what it is, it's just explosions

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and nonsense, that's Michael Bay for you

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Explosions and nonsense, if that's what you want

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
then you go see that movie

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And that's what I want, so I'm gonna go see that movie

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And I'll see The Avengers because that looks awesome

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But I

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
do need to catch up on the Avenger

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
movies, you know, leading up

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
to it because I've only seen Iron Man 1

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I have only seen, you and I are in the same boat

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh my gosh, you and I need to

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
get together and do this because

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I have only seen Iron Man 1, that's it

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I haven't seen any of the others

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
None of them, didn't see Thor, didn't see

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Captain America

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It's not that I, I'm not hating

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I just, seriously, last year

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I did not go to the movie, I didn't go to the movies at all

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
last year, you had a kid, I'm lazy

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I saw Thor, Thor was good

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I didn't see the second Iron Man movie

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
because it's just pretty much

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
How's that a bad thing?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Drunken asshole

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That Robert Downey Jr.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
No, that's fine, that's fine

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I own it, I just haven't bothered to see it yet

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It's sort of like I wasn't excited

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I liked the first one

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And I saw Hulk

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Even though it's, you know, not the same

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Dude, I think it's like, same universe-ish thing

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Which, honestly, I really wish they had had Edward Norton

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Really wish they had Edward Norton

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
He was so good

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You met the other guy, right?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, I have, he signed my Xbox

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But man, I, Hawkeye

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Black Wolf in Chat says

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
You guys did notice in the first Battleship trailer

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
that the bombs were in the shape of Battleship pins, right?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Yes, I did

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I didn't notice that

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So are there any other big movies this summer

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
that I'm not thinking of

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
that might have video games made out of them?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Seems like there was a lot of stuff coming out this summer

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Um

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I'm trying to think

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
No

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I honestly don't remember what the summer lineup is this year

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I mean, other than Batman

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and the new Snow White movie

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Which

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I don't know, looks

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
alright, I'm gonna have to go see it though

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
My wife wants to see it

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Alright, look, we'll start to talk more about the summer stuff

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
when it gets closer to summer

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
For now, let's talk about right now

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
this week, the types of video games we've been

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
playing this week in a segment we call

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
How Was Your Gaming Week? DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
My gaming week was

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
retro

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We bought Bust-A-Move 2

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
as in Puzzle Bobble

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Arcade Edition for the PlayStation

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
My husband and I actually

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
had a fairly even match in playing

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
even though I'm usually the

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
much better player

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Um

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
We also picked up

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Taito Legends for PS2

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and so

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I have that on Xbox One

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
And so a lot of this afternoon was spent with

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
my husband screaming at Rainbow Islands

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
and screaming at Super Kicks

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
and then playing the hell

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
out of Rastan

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
And we also decided

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
that the biplane shooter

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Tokyo sucks

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And while this wasn't

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
we have video games related

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
to the series, but I have to say

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
that watching

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
the Evangelion 2.22

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
really is kind of depressing

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
but awesome

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Just saying

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Awesome, so it sounds like it was a bit of a retro day

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
with the Taito stuff

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
There's a series that had its ending changed

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
If you want to talk about

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
partially from fan complaint

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and partially from the creator wanting to

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
expand on it more

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And it made no fucking sense

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And guess what? They're redoing the whole thing now

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
in a series of movies

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Alright, before we get to Loki's gaming week

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
from the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Some folks in the chat are naming

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
some other possible

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
titles. Tiger Claws says

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
maybe they should make a video game on Prometheus

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
That's supposed to be a pretty big one, right?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Well technically there's the

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
colonial marines which is coming out later

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
this year, so that could tie into

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Prometheus

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Infidel names one that I

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
particularly am looking forward to seeing

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That would be pretty awesome

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm looking forward to that one

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Platinum Games putting it together, that'd be awesome

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Meanwhile, your gaming week, Loki

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
So let's see, this week I didn't play a lot of games

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I played

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Call of Duty briefly

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
because I was only working for three days this week

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The rest of the time

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I've been just working

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
working in Excel

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Why would I try to program something

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
in Excel? Because I'm weird like that

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So, I like

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
programming it

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
No, it's not a secret, it never was

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It was, um, I'm making a map editor

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
for Grand Theft Auto IV

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It actually works, it's just fucking slow

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
because it's in Excel

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
In Excel

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
How does a map editor in Excel work?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Meaning you draw it out in the little cells?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
No, no, no, it's like

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
basically it opens

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
a format, it's like a

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
WPL, it's a placement list or something like that

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
You can

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
import stuff I make out of

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
the Simple Native Trainer

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
which is a trainer in the game, you can spawn

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
objects, move them around, place them and stuff

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and you can export those to a file

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and dump them into this and then I can save them as

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
the actual map files that are used by the games

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Huh

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I can actually

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
paste the hex code in there

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
from, you know, you open up the file in the

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
hex editor and dump it in there and it'll actually

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
read everything and, you know, you can also save

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
it as that and it'll

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
do that fun stuff

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
But it works, and it's weird because

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
the editors that they have

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
out there now are broken, they don't really work

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
well, so the fact that I'm making something very

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
inefficiently, it works

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
and that's all I care about, is the fact that it works

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Because I don't know how to program

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
in C Sharp or C++

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
or whatever, I could

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I could, you know

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
learn how to

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
do that, but it just, for some reason

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
my mind can't wrap around that, yet complex

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
stuff in Excel I can do that

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's weird, like

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Ridiculous formula, I mean

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Let me put it this way, my Excel

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
file, I had to go, I had to convert it to

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
the new format because I was gonna try to make it

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
compatible with everything else, it ended up being

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
75 megabytes

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It's huge. Will it work in open office?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Uh, no. Open office doesn't

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
really work that well for this

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So, that was that

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And then, kind of a weird

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
It's not weird

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Something I'm doing, as I mentioned before

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Mark Ruffalo's signed by Xbox before

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
and a couple other people have as well

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
So, now I have this Xbox that I'm kinda

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
using, it's almost like an autograph book

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I get celebrities to sign it, you know

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I don't know if people always consider these

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
people celebrities, but

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Like, this week I had, we had a visit

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
from Duff Goldman

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
from, you know, Ace of Cakes

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Duff Beer? No, not Duff Beer

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
From Ace of Cakes, or, you know

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Charm City Cakes, you know, really cool guy

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
So, I had him sign my Xbox

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
He must have went like, I'm a cake maker

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Why am I signing an Xbox?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
He thought it was cool. Of course, he could see the other people

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, he thought it was cool, I'm like

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Oh, cause he wasn't really doing

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
signing of stuff, and I'm like, well hey

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Can you sign my Xbox? He's like

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Sure, who else has signed this

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
so far? I'm like, here's Orlando Bloom

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Here's Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Thornton. Christopher Thornton is kinda

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
He's a

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
director, and he's not really a

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah, I mean, Orlando Bloom, that's

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
pretty awesome. That's almost like one of those like

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
you know, when they auction off the giant

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
like, you know, quilt

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
that every celebrity under the sun has signed

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
for a charity, it's like you're building one of those

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
for like D-list celebrities

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Well, it's not even, I wouldn't consider

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Orlando Bloom or Mark Ruffalo, who's starring

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
as the Hulk in the Avengers

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
B-list. Whatever, fine

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
But, I mean, it's just, I had

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I have signatures from a bunch of different celebrities

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
at my work, like a bunch of posters

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
but they're sitting in a pile on my desk

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
and collecting dust, like I have

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
William H. Macy

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
and I had

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Oh, who the hell is

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Jeff Goldblum at one time

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
He's just, that guy is

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
fucking weird

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
He is, like, you know how quirky he is

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
and like everything, like movies and stuff

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
He is like that in real life, he's just weird

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Just like this really

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
strange, off the wall

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
type guy, but you know, it's just like

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
stuff like that, I had

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Rob Schneider sign a copy of the animal

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I had on VHS

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
He was wearing a weird cowboy hat at the time

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
too, that was kind of funny

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
But yeah, like, you know, we met before

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
he died, you know, we met

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Patrick Swayze

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
So that was kind of cool

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I like to get pictures

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Well, yeah, I get pictures

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
too, but you know, I just

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I figured, because I like

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I keep my Xbox in better shape

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
than those posters, so the way I figured

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
it's more of an honor to sign this

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Xbox than it is

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I can't, I mean

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
this guy is a big geek

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
He was talking about totally geeking out

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
at, like, LucasArts and

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Skywalker Ranch and stuff like that when they went

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
and made the cake there, and, you know

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Did he also try to fling meatloaf at George Lucas?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Hey!

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
But, uh, you know, so

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I think that, I'm sure that

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
he plays video games, I'm sure that

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
he thought it was cool, so, whatever

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I like Derek H.'s counter about Mark

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Ruffalo's celebrity status, Derek H. says

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Well, Ruffalo is Bruce Banner

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
A few hundred computers are playing the Hulk

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That is true True facts

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
True facts, alright

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Fair enough

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Anything else you want to get out of there for your game?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Ummmm

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I think that's all I've played

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
No, I tried playing a little bit of the Mario

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Portal game, the Mario

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
game, and it's weird, I mean

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I can't play that on my laptop, because it's

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's an art piece Yeah, it's just

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It doesn't play very well with, like, a touchpad

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I'm just, I'm not

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
very keyboard mouse, so it's very

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
awkward for me to play that Oh, yeah, yeah

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
So, it's just, um,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
yeah, it's a little weird

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Alright, well, that's it

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Then my gaming week, um

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
As I mentioned earlier, I tried that new Hunger Games

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
on the iPhone Sorry, sorry, sorry

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
One, uh, I'd like

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I did play one game

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
a lot this week, actually, I completely forgot

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Um, Super Stardust Delta

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Oh I love that game

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's actually really awesome That's right

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Our buddy, uh, Brad from Pod Culture

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Yes, he hooked me up with the code, and I've

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
been playing the crap out of that, and it's actually

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
a really fun game Yeah? Because I'm thinking about

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
getting it It's definitely worth it

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It's very fun I still never cashed

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
in my 3G thing I never

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
did either That feature on my Vita

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
has literally gone to waste, I think I have till the

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
31st to do something with it, or you lose it

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
or something like that, so I gotta make sure I get that taken care of

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
You know, who cares

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I think, well, they have the GPS, though, with

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
the, um, 3G ones, so

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, that's kinda helpful, but

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah, I mean, I just can't use

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
3G, I don't know

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Alright, if you're finally done

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I'm done, sorry Alright, my gaming week

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Quickly, before I talk video games, I need to talk

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
board games, because I went to a board game

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
party yesterday, it was actually a lot of fun, and I got to

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
play some new board games, and one of them that I really

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
really really really liked was called

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Seven Wonders, so I'm sure some of you

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
board card game enthusiasts will know this game

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
and, um, you know, not that I think

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
they should turn every game into an

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Xbox game, but some of them have worked rather

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
well, right? Like, um, you know, Ticket to Ride

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
and Catan and all that, right? So,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
um, I would like to see Seven Wonders

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
because that was, I had a lot of fun playing that game

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
that was cool They have a game called Seven Wonders

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
it's just one of those, a match three games

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh, that's not even the same thing

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
this is a more, it was kinda like

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
it actually, to me, felt, and

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Alan made this comment too, like, the stages

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
of the game are similar to, like, civilization

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
it's resource

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
collecting, and then you can kinda

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
head yourself into technology

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
or military, or

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
like, what I would call cultural

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
types of points, you know, you can kinda

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
it's, it's either really inspired

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
by civilization or kinda right down that same line

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
but you know I love Civ, so I like

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
this game too

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
and, uh, some

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
other friends of ours came

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
over, we played Dominion again

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
which I think I've talked about that on the show, but that's a card game I really

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
enjoy, that would be really hard to pull

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
off on a console though, I think that's something you really have to play

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
in person because there's so many ways you can kinda mix and match

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
the different cards and the expansions and all that

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
so yeah, I've been playing, like

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
tangible games this week

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
crazy, video games though

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
haven't been short on those

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
last week I talked about how I have

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
suddenly, just

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I wanna say out of the blue, but not really

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
like Shane from Hoard House

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
kinda, like, we'll just say

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
he berated me into playing these games

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
but it worked, the games are really good, Mass Effect, right?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
beat Mass Effect 1

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
now, I realize a lot of you might be going

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
yay, golf clap

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
for you, you beat a game that came out

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
five years ago, but really think about

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
that statement if you've been listening to Orange House Radio

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
for any length of time

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I had the attention span

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
to beat a game, playing it

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
start to finish, that is

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
a huge endorsement I think for the game

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
so yes, I beat Mass Effect, and what did I do

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
when I beat Mass Effect? I put in my

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Mass Effect 2 disc that I picked up last week for

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
twenty bucks, and I started on Mass Effect 2

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
so I'm about nine hours

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
into Mass Effect 2

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and now I'm going to go home and start

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Mass Effect tomorrow

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
yes, and now Jamie is taking my Mass Effect on Xbox

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
and she said she's going to check it out

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
however, she understands

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
she hasn't until the time I beat

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Mass Effect 3 to finish

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
it, because then I want to play Mass Effect 1

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
again as a renegade

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and as a woman, so I can have

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
lesbian romance

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I'm just going to start off as a woman, because I play every game as a woman

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
because, it's fun

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
so

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
have you played Saints Row the Third yet?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
me? tons

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
no, I haven't, because we don't have

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
a system that I can play it on right now

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
unless someone would like to lend me a copy of it

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
don't you have, I have the

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
361 from you still, right, so

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
you want to borrow the 361? sure

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
alright, I'm going to give it to her

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
alright, I forgot you even had it

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
well there you go, alright

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
so

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
yeah, I've been playing Mass Effect 2

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
again, I don't know

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
how constructive it is for me to review

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
a game that's about 2 or 3 years old

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
but, what? one question from AcidicVampire

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
who did you choose to bang?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I did not bang anyone

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
in Mass Effect 1, because

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I am waiting for Mass Effect 3

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
because I know who I want to bang

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
and I know that they're not bangable until the third game

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
so, let me put it

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
this way, I made a very

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
important choice, I'm keeping this

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
spoiler free, I made a very important choice

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
in the first game

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
that will set it up so that in the third game

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
this person will be around

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
for me to bang, and I will bang them

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
lots

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
so that's, I'll just

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
leave it at that

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
let's see, what else

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
now I'm off track here, oh yeah, Mass Effect 2

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
the game's a few years old, but

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
it's, it's, it's really good

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
it's really, like the story, everything

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
is like, just a step up

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
in the storytelling and in the voice acting

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
and everything, like it's not that the first game was bad

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
but the second game is just even more, I have like

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
laughed out loud at the game

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
there's a particular character I just got

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
into my little squad that, like, literally

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
made me laugh out loud with what they were saying

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
it was, it was, it's awesome

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
the graphics

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
are a step up

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
they got rid of the Mako stuff

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
thank god, planet scanning's

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
a little derpy, that gets a little bit old

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
really fast, but whatever, the hacking's

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
better, the combat

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm still, I still have

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
mixed feelings on, like I know a lot of people

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
generally agree that combat in 2

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
is better than combat in 1, but

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I will agree it's more fast paced

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
because you can kind of map skills to buttons

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
so you don't have to bring up the menu

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
and you can kind of do things that way, but

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I don't know, like, I kind of find, I don't like the way

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
that, just, enemies keep coming out

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
in waves and waves and waves

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
and you're kind of just, like, stuck in one spot

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
gunning them all down

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
at least that's the way I kind of find them doing it

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
just kind of gunning them all down until the way's finally over

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
and you can kind of move into the next room

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
like, I feel like the first game kind of made you

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
it was a little more Metal Gear in the way that

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
the enemies didn't just run out until they actually

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
saw you, so I

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
kind of, like, it made the

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
conflicts a little more consistent

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
but don't take that

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
as a harsh gripe on the game, I mean, it's a

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
really minor bitch, it doesn't take away

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
from the experience of the story

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
that I'm really, really, really enjoying

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
so

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
there you go

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
um, let's see

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
uh

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
what else have I been playing, what other game I want to mention

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
uh, on the Vita

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
ModNation Racers Road Trip

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I played on the Vita for a little bit

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
it's okay

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
you know, it is what it is, it's the

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
PlayStation 3 version condensed down for the Vita

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
the graphics and everything

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
are, you know, pretty good

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
they look like they do on the PlayStation 3

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
the track editor

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
I was very impressed that it's pretty much all there

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
you can import all the stuff

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
from the PlayStation, which is pretty impressive

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
and, you know, you can, therefore

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
build up a pretty, pretty good library

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
of stuff, the only problem with

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
ModNation Racers is

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
they stripped out everything

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
online about the game

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
the only thing you can do online on the Vita

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
version is, like, have ghost racers

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
and you can download other people's tracks

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
but you can't do races online

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
which is kind of an

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
important element of custom

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
it's because a lot of these games

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
are just not able to do

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
that's why you get a lot of this asynchronous

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
multiplayer garbage

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I mean, you can do ad hoc

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
in the same room, and do it that way

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
but it just, I don't know

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
it really feels lacking

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
and I'm kind of sitting here going

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
this racing game gets kind of basic

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
after you play it for a while

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
like, yeah, there's some interesting

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
power-ups and things they do, but

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I mean, at the end of the day, I'm just like

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
this game gets kind of old

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
so, I mean, at least

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
it's only 30 bucks, I rented it through

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I have an account with a game rental

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
company, and so I got it through a rental

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
but I think it's a worthy

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
rental, I don't know if I would pay 30 bucks

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
for it, if you really like racers

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I'm sure you're getting a lot of objects for it

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
through the, you know, passing

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I need some, check into Nier while you're here

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
because I need some of those objects

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
so, you know

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
we're going to talk about this later, because there's a story

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
coming up about LittleBigPlanet

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Kart or whatever

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I kind of, you know, everyone

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
the trailer looks cool, but it kind of

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
made my heart sink when I heard

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
by the creators of ModNation Racism

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
like, ugh

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
because their load time is fucking terrible

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Yeah, the load time's really bad

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
but see, I

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I was really surprised

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
at how much the online

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
piece being missing really hurt

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
the game, because I wouldn't call

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
the one on the Playstation 3 a basic bitch

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
tracer, because the community

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
element kind of saves it

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
because there really is just a

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
stronger sense of community in the Playstation

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
3 one, and you can really get these random

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
organic experiences

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
in the Playstation 3 one that just feel

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
very forced and very

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
vanilla on the Vita one, and that's

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
the problem with it. I mean, it's

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
impressive that they otherwise got

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
most of the Playstation 3 one

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
in there, I hope

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
LittleBigPlanet didn't get neutered this way

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
but then again, LittleBigPlanet, you could

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
play LittleBigPlanet online, but it wasn't as

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
key to that game

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
you know, I think LittleBigPlanet Vita will be alright

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
See, here's my question though, is if they

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
if they did that, though

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
you know, if it's really neutered, I guess

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
on the Vita version, do you

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
have the PSP version? Because I think

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I got that as a PSP version

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I'm wondering if it was neutered on there too

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
or if they had

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
online gameplay on the PSP one, but they're just

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
like, ehhh, the Vita

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
we're not gonna worry about writing netcode

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
God, that's work, so let's just

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
forget about it. Nah, I haven't played the

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
PSP one, or if I did, it was a long time ago

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
so I don't remember. Maybe they have some sort of

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
weird like, stipulation where you

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
can only have

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
multiplayer like, um, in your

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
game if you can play it over the 3G

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
or something, because I know only

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
right now there's two games that

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
have actual, well, three games

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
that actually have online multiplayer

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
and those are all the ones that have online passes

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
the Hotshots, Golf, Wipeout

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
and MLB 12

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
are the only games

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
I don't know if Unit 13 does

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't think that did though

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
but those are the three

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
and possibly four games that I know of

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
right now that actually have, you know,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
multiplayer. Um, now

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I'll say this, I don't want to

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
totally bash out Monday's Racers because I don't think

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
it's a bad game necessarily, and

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
we have to remember it's a launch title

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and for a launch title, it's surprisingly

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
decent

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
you know, I say that, you know, it's a

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
strong launch title for

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
the Vita, but it's not as

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
strong as say, Luminous

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
there's some of the other choices that are out there

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
um, or what also kind of

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
shoots this game in the foot a little bit is that

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I have to say that free MotorStorm

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
game they put out last week

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
it's kind of a

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
better racing experience for me

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I mean, maybe because it was free, but

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
and it was more like Ironman

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
off-road racing

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
which I really enjoy that style, but

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
well, see, the thing is, like, I'm kind of

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
embracing a little bit more of the

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
online, or not even online, some of the

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
digital stuff now

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
um, thanks to some of these offerings

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
the fact that, well, the fact that the Michael Jackson

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
game was free was kind of fun, but um,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
you know, the, the

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
MotorStorm game is pretty awesome, and

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm actually thinking of thinning out

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
my collection, because I have four games right now

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
in cart form, and I'm probably

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
gonna, well, Lil Deviance is gone

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I mean, that game looked like terrible, terrible shit

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
um, and actually

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Rayman, um, Origins

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I'm probably gonna get rid of, because

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm just not playing it, not that it's

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
a terrible game, it's not a terrible game at all

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
it's an awesome game, but it's just

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm not finding myself playing, or

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
wanting to play that game, so, I don't know

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I'm just now catching up

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
on some of the, uh, comments from chat

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
AcidicVampire says, the characters

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
in Mass Effect 2 are some of the best

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
characters in any video game

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
you know what, I gotta say

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
although I haven't played enough of

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Mass Effect 2 to really say

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
that's true or that's false, I

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
can see so far where that is

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
probably a true statement

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
because there is some strong characters in

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
part 2, like even, and it's

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
it's so funny I'm sitting here saying that, because

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
as I keep saying this about 2, I feel like I'm

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
bashing 1, but I'm

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
not, it's just that 1 set the bar

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
pretty high, and 2 actually

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
exceeds it, in almost

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
every area, so

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
pretty neat

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
and Shane says, picks

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
of Kaiden put him over to actually trying

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
the series out, that may or may not

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
be true, just saying

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I deny these allegations

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
alright, that's enough about our

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
gaming weeks, let's get into some gaming news

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
after I quickly mention some housekeeping

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
so check it out at orange lounge radio.com

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
let's get into gaming news, Loki

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
well, there's rumors that Sony is

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
shutting down one of their first party

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
developers, Zipper Interactive

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
who just put out the

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Evita game, Unit 13

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
um, they may be

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
gone, um, apparently

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
there's been some chatter for several days

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
about an impending closure

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
and the possibility of cancellations

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
of a current project

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
of course Sony hasn't made a comment on it

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
and besides, you know, Unit 13

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
they're of course the ones behind

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
SOCOM, US Navy Seals, and

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
MAG, so they

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
kind of know they're shooters

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
but, I don't know

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
maybe is this because they can't really compete

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
with, say, Call of Duty

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
or Battlefield, maybe this is why they're

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
kind of letting them go, and I don't know, restructuring

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
who knows

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
hmm, well

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
it's never good to hear about Studios

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Closing, but

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I mean, wasn't SOCOM still a pretty

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
strong series, or did I miss something?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Um, I don't know how well SOCOM

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
4 did, um

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I would have thought that they would have

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
you know, tried to, well maybe

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
they tried with MAG, maybe that was the whole thing

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
is, um, you know, they were trying to

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
you know, do something with that, but

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
maybe it just didn't really

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
work out, also

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
also, but it also is a rumor

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
also, the other thing

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
might have kind of hurt SOCOM 4

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
was the fact that SOCOM 4 launched right

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
before the whole Playstation Network

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
black out there. Oh, that's right

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I thought I remembered there was something

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
that kind of like about SOCOM 4

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
that was like, iffy in the community

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
that's right, that's what it was

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
the fact that it came out the week they took

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the network down for like a month

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
yeah, that probably didn't help

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
no, but interesting

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
that all this time later, something

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
happens. I'm also surprised

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
if that, in spite of that, they didn't try to

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
relaunch SOCOM for the holidays

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
or maybe they did, and I just, you know, that's not usually

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
a series I follow, so, but I

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I'm surprised there wouldn't be like a SOCOM 4

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
game of the year edition

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
since that's what they're all called

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
or SOCOM 4 Platinum Guns edition

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
or something, that comes out at the end of the year

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
to try and relaunch it. I'm surprised

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
too, I mean, um

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I don't know, I didn't think SOCOM 4

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
is a bad game, it, I think it got

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
pretty good reviews, it's just

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
um, I don't know

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
maybe it's just not enough room right now

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
maybe they're focusing on something else

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
maybe, maybe, maybe they're just getting rid

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
of these guys because they're going to have someone else working on SOCOM

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
who knows, maybe, um

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
you know, I don't know who, um

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
you know, the team behind resistance, what

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
they're working on right now, maybe they're going to be working

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
on a new SOCOM game or something like that

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
or kill, the team behind Killzone

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
you know, maybe they're free now, because Killzone

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't know, well actually

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Killzone might do alright

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I think that if they went the route

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
of, with SOCOM that they

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
did with, just recently with Killzone 3

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
where they released a multiplayer

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
kind of, as free and then had people play

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
it and then you can, you know, kind of

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
free to play almost, with uh

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
you know, where you pay 15 bucks if you want to play the full

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
um, or level up fully

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I think that might be a way to go with SOCOM

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
because, you know, actually free to

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
play would be perfect for a lot of games

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
but, it might help it out

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
especially since people like military first person shooters

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
and free is an awesome

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
amount of money for something

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
alright, well we'll see

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
what develops with that over the next

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
few months, I'm sure by E3 we'll see

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
what they're up to or not

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
um, meanwhile over in

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Xbox territory there is yet another

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
arcade promotion going on

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
so it seems like Xbox

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Microsoft and all of them have found success

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
in these, you know, summer of arcade

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
what's the winner one called? Block Party

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
right, so

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
since it's so successful, let's do it quarterly

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
let's do another one, alright, so now we have

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Arcade Next starts

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
on April 18th

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
gotta say though, there are some pretty big

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
you know, titles here, Trials Evolution

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
is the first one, that is actually really big

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I mean, you saw what their, Trials is a big

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
deal right, well yeah, but the level editor

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
in this thing is like little big planet-esque

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I mean, it's like, you can make all

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
sorts of things, people made first person shooters

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
using that level editor

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Bloodforge on April 25th

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Fable Heroes on

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
May 2nd, now that is not the

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
it's not on Rails Fable, that's the

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Mario Party Fable, right? That looks alright

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
it's kind of like a little bit Mario Party

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
crossed with Castle

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Crashers, I guess, alright

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
interesting, and then

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
obviously this is the huge one

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
the big one, May 9th, Minecraft

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
is gonna be 1600

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Microsoft points and

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
it should be noted too that because

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
of the recent change in the gamerscore

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
for Arcade, all of these games

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
will now offer the 400 gamerscore

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
it's not gonna be, cause April's the month

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
they're starting that, right? So all these

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
games will now have, you know, 400

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
gamerscore instead of 200 available

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
to you. I mean, I'd like to try

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Minecraft out, you know, again

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah, I kinda wanna give

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Minecraft a second chance, I don't really wanna

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
pay 1600 points for it, only to be

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
as, if I'm disappointed

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
in it, but all the Xbox

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
yeah, they come with demos, so I'll

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
let everybody cross your fingers

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
that the Minecraft one's really good

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
cause I wanna give it another chance

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I do, so we'll see

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I am kinda curious about Trials, I kinda skipped the first

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
one, but it sounds interesting

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
they showed another one, there was a picture I saw

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
where, I think it was the devs that did

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Limbo, did a level that looks

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
like Limbo in Trials

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
That's awesome

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
I do wanna point out the price of the

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
other games, Fable Heroes will be 800

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
points, that's about 10 bucks, all the others

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Evolution Bloodforge, 15 bucks

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
So that's the pricing for those games

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Now what we haven't heard about, I have

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
not heard anything about what you get

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
if you buy all four games, because remember

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
that was an important part of the promotion

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
for Block Party and Summer of Arcade

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
is like, buy all four, get

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
400 points in the mail or something

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
like that, right, or get 1200 points

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
or get a game for free, you know

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
depending on what promotion it is, but yet

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I'm not hearing anything with this

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So this is just straight up a

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
send out

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
a press release to all the gaming sites and get

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
the games or exposure, right

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Get an ad in the magazines

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It's still a while away, I mean they could always

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
announce something, that's true, there may be something coming out

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
later, even if

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
it's something derpy like

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
something for your, I keep wanting to say

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
your me, but for your

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
avatar, like a little next shirt

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
or something, I mean even if they throw something

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
like that in there, there'll be people that

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
give it a shot just to have that

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
you know, so we'll see

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Not very many people, but

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
there will be people

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Never know, Derek H in chat

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
says, does that mean Minecraft is the highest

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
price Xbox Live arcade game

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
ever? No, the penny arcade

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
game was also $1600

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I think there's a couple of those too

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Well, some of them you may consider

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Xbox Live Arcade and some you may not

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Remember, some games are released not as

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Xbox Live Arcade, but as actually

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
those games on demand because they don't fit

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
within the

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
you know, constraints of the file size

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
True, and one could argue that

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
you know, a game that didn't get

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
released here, like wasn't there that Japanese

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
import shooter that you could

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
only get through on demand

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Right? Well, there was

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
original Crysis, two Crysis I think

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
it was HD or something like that, they had

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
come out, I don't remember if that was

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
20 bucks, I think it was at least 20 bucks

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Yeah, but I mean

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
if you wanna count just strictly what's

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
in the category of XBLA

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
then it ties for most

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
expensive game ever, yes

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Don't get me wrong, they're probably gonna try to

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
inch that up a little bit, but

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Yeah, there might be DLC that'll bump it

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
up a little, especially in a game like Minecraft

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
it's possible

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
the question is, will they go there?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
So, alright, let's move on

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Dark Sakura

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, we've discussed this till we

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
were blue in the face, but

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Effect 3

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
We don't like the ending

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Well

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
BioWare's listening

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I don't know why, but they're listening

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
and

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
the co-founder Ray

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
and I always mispronounce his name, Musica

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
has said that they are

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
actually going to work to

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
answer those open-ended questions and give

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
closure to the fans

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
and describe

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
the fan feedback as

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
incredibly painful

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
So basically everyone

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
bitched and they're putting out some DLC

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
to

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I guess expand more on

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
the ending, but he's saying

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
and this is a quote, our first instinct is to defend

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
the work and point out the high ratings offered

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
by critics, let you critics know

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
but out of respect to our

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
fans, we need to accept the criticism

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and feedback with humility

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
So they're basically

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
they're like, uh, well

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
sorry you didn't like it, we're not gonna

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
change that much about it, but maybe you'll like this

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
That's

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
what I can tell

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I guess the only thing

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
to do is wait and see

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I think it's a terrible idea

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I've calmed down

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
a little bit on the idea

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I still don't think this excuses

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
certain behaviors of certain people

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
on the internet, namely those that are

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
harassing the employees of BioWare

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
that's totally fucking unacceptable

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I don't give a fuck how much you've spent

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
or invested in the Mass Effect series

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
some of the vile shit I've read on the

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
internet about the creators of the

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
games, like seriously

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
fuck off

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
those people need to

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
and I mean this

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
they need to get a life

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
like, they literally need a life

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and the guy

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
who took it to the government and all this

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
stuff, that was ridiculous

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
the whole, I don't think this is on the show

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
roll later, so the whole using

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Child's Play

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I think went a little bit far

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I think maybe somebody was good intentioned

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
with that whole thing, but at the end

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
of the day, people were calling Child's Play

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
saying, how much do I have to donate

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
to get the ending changed?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And Child's Play's like, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
whoa

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
What are we here?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Are we an organization that's supposed to

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
help you get

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
your beef with game publishers

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
resolved? Or are we an organization

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
trying to bring joy into sick children's

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
lives? And so they

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
came out with a clarification that if you do a

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
fundraiser for Child's Play, Child's Play

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
is the cause, there is to be no

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
other cause, Child's Play is the cause, and I say

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
bravo to that

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Now

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm not as harsh on that because I realize there might

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
have been good intentions there

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
but unfortunately some people

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
aren't smart

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I don't know how else to put it

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
But like what you just said

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
and this is why I'm

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
just scared of what this kind of

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
precedent says. How much money do I

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
have to pay for them to change the ending?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And that right there

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
How much money do I have to pay for them to

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
change the ending? Really? Are people

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
actually asking that question? Funny enough

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Go ahead, Jamie. I was gonna say

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
that right there is America

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And I was gonna say, funny enough,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Loki, that's the part where

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I become okay with this because although I've been

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
bashing all these things, I realize the vast

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
majority of people out there

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
that, you know, probably went to go

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
click like on the page or have said a nasty

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
tweet about, God that ending sucked or whatever

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I realize the vast majority of those people

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
aren't, like, insane, like some of the

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
other people I just mentioned

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
But, you know, if they're gonna

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
put it out there, like, if BioWare does

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
a DLC ending, I will buy it and I will

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
support it, I'm kinda like

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
alright, then fine

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
At least you'll have the choice

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
if you want to invest that money or not

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And it's like, if people want to buy it

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
then fine. It's a weird

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
weird precedent, and we were just

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
talking about this a little bit with Bobby before us

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
here tonight, and I was mentioning

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
about Final Fantasy 7

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
A lot of people hated that ending

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
too, and if that game came out today

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
a lot of people were probably doing the same thing

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Like, wow, two of the characters were just fucking

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
missing in the ending. But, once again

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
though, it's so what that ending had

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
So what if it was a terrible ending for Final Fantasy 7?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
People bought Final Fantasy 8

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
People bought Final Fantasy 9

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
People bought Final Fantasy 10, they bought 10 too

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
They probably bought 11

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
They bought 12, they bought 13

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Did it really hurt

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
the sales of those because they didn't like the game?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Now, Loki, nobody bought Final Fantasy 11

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, don't send the hate mail

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
But there were a lot of Final Fantasy

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
fans that did

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
reject 11, but there were enough that embraced

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
it that gave us 14

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
When that shit goes free to play

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
When that shit goes free to play, watch how many

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
fans reject that

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Anyway, back to the topic here

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
DLC is something

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
that is in the industry now

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
that we didn't have so many years ago

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and in a way, EA being

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
one of the biggest DLC whores

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
in this industry, kinda

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
has themselves to blame for this mindset

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
that they can fix the ending

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
through a patch, or they can fix the ending through

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
DLC. EA kind of

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
invented that mess

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Well, maybe they didn't invent it, but they perfected

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
it, let's say. They did start the

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
online pass, did they not?

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
So they've figured out how to milk all the extra

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
dollars for a video game, so in that capacity

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
EA kinda has

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
themselves to blame for the fan backlash

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
because if this were 10 years ago

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
fans wouldn't be saying

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
this because there wouldn't really be anything they could do

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
about it. They would have to just, you know,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
write on their live journals

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I don't like the ending. What they should do is just fucking

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
shut the hell up, and

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
get over it, because you know why?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
They're like, oh, well I spent

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
how many hours playing this

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
series, and I'm so

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
disappointed at the ending. Fuck you!

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
The developers spent how many fucking years

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
putting these games together for you?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
You know, what about

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
their time? Well,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
devil's advocate, I'm not

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
agreeing or disagreeing with you, but just to give you another perspective

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
that's on the internet, there's a lot of talk on the

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
internet that the ending was changed at the last

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
minute, and that the writers of

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
the original ending were basically shafted

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
because I guess there was a leak

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
that had ruined it, or I mean

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
I wasn't following the Mass Effect series then, so I don't know

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
much about this, I'm just hearing it second hand,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
but I guess there was a leak that spoiled the first ending

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
so the creator kind of

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
made this new ending

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
if the

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
internet is to be believed, literally pulled it

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
out of his ass, and that's the ending

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
we have, because they wanted

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
to get back at the spoiled leak, I

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
guess.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That doesn't make any sense.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Just saying.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
And also, like, I take, you know,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I have a problem with the fact that

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
all these people hate it, and

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
like, you know, the game reviews and stuff, and granted, everyone

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
is, you know,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
open to their own opinion, but

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
a lot of the game reviews have been really positive

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
for it. I didn't hear anyone

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
saying- Why's there not letting a 15 minute ending, or

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
even if it's an hour ending, ruin

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
what is otherwise- Exactly!

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
That's how everybody should take it, instead of just

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
being so god damn focused on

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
the last 15 minutes of the game.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Sg100Matt has some pretty strong words in our chatroom

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
at chat.orangelandraday.com

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Let the artist paint the picture and write the

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
image they want. Gamers aren't

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
entitled to nothing. Just sit back and enjoy

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
the ride. If you don't like the ride, get the fuck

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
off it. Exactly! And you don't have to

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
purchase the next game, but see, I think that's why they did it.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Two reasons. One, so they could possibly

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
sell more DLC, because, you know,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
the publisher's like, yeah, yeah, you

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
should make a new ending. We'll give you a little

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
bit of money, and we're gonna make a lot of money in

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
return. And it, you know, appeases

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
the fans so that when Mass Effect 4

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
comes out, because you know there will be a Mass Effect 4,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
that they will buy it.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I just think this whole sense of entitlement

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
thing that's going on in this country

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
is probably the most ridiculous thing

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
to ever happen. It's a truly

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
modern phenomenon, and

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
people really need to get over themselves

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and realize that, you know,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
it not being what you want

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
or not getting what you want doesn't mean

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
that it's a complete affront to you

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
in particular. You know, that it's

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
they're doing this on purpose!

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You know.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Stop being a baby.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
If people are suggesting that they would

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
troll the fans because

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
one of the endings leaked, that doesn't

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
make any sense at all, because

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
if there's a leak coming from your company,

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
it's from within your company. Why would

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
you, well damn those fans, they

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
know my ending, I'm gonna make a terrible ending

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
instead! That'll show them, they'll

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
see that it's completely different and that

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
there's no possible way that it was a leak.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I mean, that makes no sense.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
That sounds like fanboy speculation.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
It's going to be interesting very

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
much to see the impact that this has

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
on an inevitable Mass Effect 4.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
And yes, fans, I realize

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
that apparently they have

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
said there's not gonna be any more Mass Effect,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
but seriously, you

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
can fucking believe that, seriously.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Yeah, there wasn't gonna be any

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
more Halo after Halo 3 either.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
You know, they'll

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
find a way to do Mass Effect 4.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It may not be called Mass Effect 4.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
The series will

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
continue. It's too fucking big

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
to not.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
It might not be Bioware, so you

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
may really not want it to happen, but it'll happen.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Somebody will do it.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
So, anyhow,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
why don't we move on?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
We can probably talk about this all night, and I'm sure we'll

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
get some emails and calls on it later.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Mailbag at orangeonshady.com if you want to send your

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
thoughts, or we'll open up the phones later in the show.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But for now, how about some more stories? Loki.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah, so, Disney

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Interactive announced Disney's epic Mickey 2.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
The Power of 2.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Um...

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I was really hoping for The Power of Love, but

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
you know, that's...

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
The Power of 2.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
The Power of 2.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Um, you know, as all the

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
kind of, um,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
rumors were, uh, it actually

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
is gonna feature both Mickey Mouse

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
And, um, Oswald's

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
gonna be AI controlled. Um,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
of course,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
when other people are not around. Otherwise, it's, you

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
know, I guess it's jump-in

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
co-op, so that's kinda cool.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
And then it will also be on PlayStation

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
3 and Xbox 360

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
on top of the Wii version, and the

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
PS3 version is supposed to support the move, which makes sense

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I mean, because they're just gonna port the controls over from the Wii

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
onto the PS3 version.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Um, it looks neat.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
I watched the trailer for it. I mean, I didn't play the

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
original game, which is kind of, you know, a fault

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
on my part, because it looked

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
like a pretty awesome game. Um, maybe

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I'll check it out, you know, on the 360

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
when it comes out. Um, I'm just glad

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Disney Interactive is making something, because

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
for a while there, they didn't have anything since

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
like, Disney Universe, and I was like,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
damn, did they just go away or something?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I mean, I was getting worried,

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
but, um, well,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
yeah, they had, uh, the split second

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
was, uh, is that?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Yeah, the split second was the Disney game.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And that studio got

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
obliterated, didn't it?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Yeah, that's unfortunate. There's another movie

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
tie-in game, Brave, has a movie coming up.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Okay, but you know,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I expect the kiddie games

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
to all get tie-ins. Those are usually the first

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
ones to have, like, the movie tie-in.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Well, there wasn't really anything for Twilight, unless you count

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
the scene at Twilight. Konami, way

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
to go, Konami. What in the fuck

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
would a Twilight video game be? Seriously,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I f- I can't believe

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I'm about to admit this on the radio, but I

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
saw Breaking Dawn Part 1, it's the only

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Twilight movie I've seen. In my

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
defense, in my

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
defense, put the hate mail down, in my

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
defense, it was with Rift

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Tracks, which I think is the only- It was a party we hosted.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
It was the only tolerable way to see. It is the

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
only way to see those movies. But my

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
God.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Where was the plot in that movie?

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
It was literally, like, 30

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
minutes of them fucking and

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
being on the beach, and like,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I love you, and I love-

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
we're gonna be together, and

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I'm like, oh my God,

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
people paid a lot of money to see this in the

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
theater. You would pay $50

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
for a video game for Breaking

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Dawn Part 1? The fuck

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
would you do? I would love

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
to see a game that was controlled

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
very much like Dragon's Lair.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It was just, like, left to right.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Be emo

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
to the left. Be emo to the right.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Sulk

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
to the right. Sulk to

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
the left.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Sparkle. Prevent

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
this wedding from becoming her hallucination

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
by pressing A repeatedly

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
to stop them from turning into vampires. I think it would

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
be kind of funny. I mean,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
someone has to have the sense of humor to do that.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Ugh.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Anyhow.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Oh, and the 3DS

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
is getting the version as well.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Power of Illusion, which made me think of

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Castle of Illusion, so maybe

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
that's a good sign?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Um, that is interesting.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Epic Mickey. We've known about

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
this for a while from some of the leaks. I know we've

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
talked about it on the show before, but putting

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
all that aside, are we

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
surprised it's actually happening?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Or no? Because Epic Mickey-

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
It sold well. Yeah? Yeah.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I guess maybe for those of us that

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
focus more on our 360s. It had a lot of neat

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
stuff in it. It did. I'm not saying it was

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
a bad game, but the Wii

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
only thing really kept it away from the hardcore.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah, and see, that's kind of

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
that I think was the reason why

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I didn't play the game, was remember the original

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
concept art for, you know,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Epic Mickey, where it's gonna be

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
really fucking twisted and dark. It was like

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
if, you know, not necessarily

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tim Burton, but like, you know,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Guillermo del Toro, like,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
put out a version of Mickey Mouse that was

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
like fucking

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
the game, right there. It was just

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
really crazy and steampunk and all

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
this stuff. And then we got the version that

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
came out in the Wii, and they just kind of like

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
you know, kind of washed all that-

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I mean, there was still a lot of dark stuff in there,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
but it wasn't anywhere near like this

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
adult Mickey game that was supposed

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
to be coming out. It was kind of like, oh, it's

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Mickey saving the land. Well, you can't

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
have a truly adult

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Mickey game. Well, why

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
can't you have a- okay, let's put it

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
this way. Not an adult game, but a very

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
very dark, dark, dark,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
dark, dark Mickey game. I think Epic

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Mickey's about as dark as you're gonna get.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But, you know, it's the Disney image.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You don't want to associate Disney

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
with dark things. And I'm

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
talking the company and Mickey Mouse as a whole.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Disney does some

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
dark-ish- I mean, you could call

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Alice in Wonderland a little bit dark.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Tron even is a little bit dark. Well, Kingdom

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Hearts kind of goes a little bit dark with stuff.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But even Kingdom Hearts is a little bit kitty.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And I don't- I love Kingdom Hearts.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But I'm just saying, like,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
touching on more of, like, you know, just having

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the stuff be all really twisted.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Anything that's dark that comes out of Disney

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
really comes from Touchstone or

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
whatever their movie arm is. You know, they-

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Fine. Buena Vista or whatever it's called.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
We'll just have it produced by Touchstone Interactive

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
or whatever. Make up a company.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Who knows? Who knows?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Alright, um, I-

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I'm glad they're doing PlayStation 3

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and Xbox as well.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I think it'll be- you know, because the Wii-

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
The Wii's on its way out, especially with

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Wii U coming out this year. I'm glad they're

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
stepping it up to the other systems. It really is

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
on its way out. I mean, there's literally

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
hardly any games coming out at all

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
for the Wii. Oh god, worse.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
A page right out of the

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
23rd Magus Jokes book. You ready for this one?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Brad from Pod Culture in chat

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
says, adult Mickey?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Are you fucking goofy?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
At least they got his main laugh.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
If you want to, uh-

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Uh, Ray Genator

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
in our chatroom says, Sky, please tell us

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
you were either drunk and or high

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
when you saw Twilight. No, I was- I was

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
neither drunk nor high. I was

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
fat. I was eating pizza

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
at the time, so I was fat.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
But I was not drunk or high.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Do you think pizza

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
contains things that'll get you wasted?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I don't know. Alright.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Twilight, even

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Riff Trax couldn't make that movie

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
good.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I have friends

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
that love it. They swear

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
it's only for the guilty pleasure. You should really question your friendship

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
with them. No, no, because they're close

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
friends of mine, but it's like, oh my god.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Alright, you know what? I have my things

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
too. Not everybody understands Rocky Horror

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Picture Shows, so whatever. Rob, I like

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Xanadu. Yeah, you are

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
a little weird. Shut up!

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Just being honest.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Alright. I'd like

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
to- speaking of Xanadu,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
you know, some of the animation in Xanadu was done

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
by the guy who made this game. Yep, Don Bluth.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Dragon's Lair.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Dragon's Lair's coming to Xbox Live Arcade!

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And I think a lot of us, when we

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
hear that, stop for a minute and say,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
oh, it isn't on Xbox Live

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Arcade. It's like the one fucking platform

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Dragon's Lair isn't on. Because I could

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
get it on- oh god, I could

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
get it on DVD,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Blu-ray,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I could get it on my iPhone,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I could get it on the PlayStation. Sega CD.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
This game has

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
been on everything CD-based.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
However, when the early versions were out,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
the best version was on the CD-i.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Why is that? Because it was the full version.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I didn't realize the other ones were cut down.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah, the Sega CD one

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
especially was missing scenes and everything.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Oh wow, I guess they maybe couldn't fit it.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Well, I doubt this one will be missing scenes or

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
whatever, but the Xbox Live Arcade

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
is getting a version, and there was kind of a

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
leak that let people know that

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Dragon's Lair was on its way out.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But Digital Leisure, who

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
is publishing the game,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
kind of gave away a

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
little surprise about this.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
This isn't just Dragon's Lair

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
as you would normally play Dragon's

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Lair, but you can also

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
play with Kinect.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Think about that for a minute.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Dragon's Lair came out

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
in what, 84, 83?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
It was definitely the early 80s when this game came out, right?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
They've gone back to this

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
game that's damn near 30 years old

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and put Kinect in it.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
There's

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
several ways you can look at this. You can go

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
well, I mean, they've put it out

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
so many other times they had to do

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
something new to it. Or you

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
could look at it and go, they're

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
ruining my childhood in

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
front of my eyes.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
How do you feel about this?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I especially want to know Dark Soccer

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
because you like Dragon's Lair. What do you think about

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Kinect support? I'm indifferent

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
about it because I'm not going to buy it.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Seriously, how many other versions

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
of Dragon's Lair do I own?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
You know,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
it kind of would be like

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
for all the people who like...

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Actually, I can't

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
think of a

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
benefit on this.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You know, people who may not

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
be able to use a controller

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
or

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
maybe people with no arms.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
They can use their feet.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Well, to be fair, you would have

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
to, like some of the motions they're talking about are

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
raising your hand up to grab the rope.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So unless you can trick the Kinect to think your foot

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
is your hand, which maybe is possible,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
or use something else.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I don't know. You're right. There could be somebody with

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
a disability where they can't use a controller.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I don't know how many

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
people would fit into the category of

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
can't use a controller can use these Kinect commands.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Maybe they have no hands.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Maybe they're

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
missing fingers. Now you're stretching.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Well, I'm just saying that

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
they put it out there for a reason.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Someone's gonna probably like it

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and pay for it. Not me.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I just don't care.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Let them do whatever they want

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
to with it. It's not costing me any money.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Stan in our chat room says, oh no, does that mean you can put

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
your face on that guy's face?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dirk the Daring, you mean?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Let's hope not.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Let's really hope not.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Hackdeft says,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Dragon's Lair plus

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Kinect. Why did they think this was a good

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
idea? I don't know.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I guess they're...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Props to them trying to do something new.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
That's about the nicest thing I can say.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
They're trying to make it a party game, a social

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
game. I mean, cause it's

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Dragon's Lair. You gotta do something

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
to... Oh yeah, when I think party, I think

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
bust out Dragon's Lair.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Well, depends on what kind of friend you have.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I guess that's true. I mean, it's just, they're

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
just trying to mix it up. You don't have

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
to play it that way. They're not forcing

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
you to use Kinect in this game, so

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
who cares? It's an additional feature.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Why are you complaining about additional features?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
If you think it's stupid, you don't have to use it.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Alright, let's move

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
on with some more gaming news. So, release dates

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and Classic Game of the Week are still coming up, but first,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Dark Sakura.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I got your news. I got your news

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
right here. Um,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
apparently exposure to Violet video games

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
has been linked to aggressive behavior.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Warning. Shut up!

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Well, it's not true, but still.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah, there is

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
another bill

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
that wants to

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
label any game

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
that's E or

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
higher than exposure

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
to Violet video games has been linked to aggressive

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
behavior. E or higher?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
That would be all games.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
That would be almost, like, I can

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
think of maybe, like,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
two games that

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
had the Y, the youth rating on it.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Well, that's old. It's EC nowadays.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Whatever. Whatever it is,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I can think of maybe two games.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Well, this

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
was sponsored by, uh,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Frank Wolf, who is

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
the, uh, Republican representative for Virginia.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
So, people in Virginia remember

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
who not to vote for.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And Joe Baca,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
who is a California

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Democrat, people in California,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
don't vote for this guy.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Um, who basically

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
wants, they call it the Violence

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and Video Games Labeling Act.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And, I mean, basically,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
they've done this before. They did it in 2009,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
which was for T and up.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
They're just not giving up.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And it's already been proven to be unconstitutional.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So, I don't know what they're

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
thinking. You know, there's a

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
saying that doing

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
the same thing multiple times

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
in a row and expecting different results

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
is insanity.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Well,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
they're insane.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
People, don't vote for them.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I just, it's

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
kind of insulting in a way.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Because it's like, have these guys ever played a

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
video game in their life? Because

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
really, like, you're talking E-rated

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
video games. So, like,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I don't know. I'm trying to look at some of

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
the games I have over there that are rated E.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Bloom Blocks

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
is gonna lead to aggressive behavior. Fucking

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
blocks! You know, I will say this

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Mass Effect 2 led to some aggressive behavior last night.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You should have seen me playing some Bust-A-Move earlier.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Super Mario Brothers Wii

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
will lead to aggressive behavior.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Imagine

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
babies. Forza. Sing Star Abba

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
will lean to aggressive behavior.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Forza. Well, here, basically,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
this is what they said about the last

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
time they tried to do this.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Is that, basically,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
that the Supreme Court

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
found all of the data lacking

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
and unpersuasive.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And really, even these own studies,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
if you go and read them, they contradict themselves

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
because they also bring up

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
that violent movies,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
or any movie,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
causes the same reaction in a child

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
already predisposed

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
towards it. It has just as much

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
influence as a movie, as a

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
book, as songs, as anything

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
audio-visual.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So, this guy's just, these

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
men are, they're clearly insane.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
That's the only thing that can say it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Again, doing the same thing over and over

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and expecting different results is insanity.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
On a tangent here for a minute,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
speaking of politicians who don't understand

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
video games, did you hear the latest in the

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Lee Lin Yi saga? Oh, what?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
He,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
well, this is, this is actually, this is the interesting

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
thing, is that this is a bill that you look at and go,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
yes, we do need this.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Remember, Lee Lin Yi was the guy in California,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I want to say Democrat out of

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
San Francisco, who was trying to pass

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
the bill on violent video

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
games not being able to be

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
sold at the store,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
but it was

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
very vague as to what made a violent video game

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
because it didn't tie into ESRB or whatever,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
and, you know, blah, blah, blah. They lost

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
at the Supreme Court level. State spent like a

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
million bucks defending this law that the dude wrote.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
We're all sitting here saying, vote his ass out,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
right? Because that's, he didn't win

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
mayor of San Francisco, so they didn't get

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
elected for that, but

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
he wrote a bill this week that

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
actually you look at and go, okay, now that

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
makes sense. That's technology he does

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
understand. He authored a bill in California

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
which will make it illegal

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
for employers to ask you for your

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Facebook password, because you might

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
have been hearing the stories this week, the

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
nightmare stories about people that went into job interviews,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
and the interviewees were like, okay,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
log into Facebook for me

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
so I can check out what you're really like.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And everybody's like, wow, that's an

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
invasion of privacy. Employers shouldn't be

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
able to do that. And so, yeah,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
you know, Facebook has come out and said, don't do it.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And now Lee Lin is going to make it illegal

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
in California. And I was kind of like, well, that's

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
a smart man. Oh, wait, no,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
it's him. He's,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
he's all right. Gotta read the fine text

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and I'm sure he's got violent video games

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
stuff. It might be getting in there. You're gonna look for it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
You know, I actually posted

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
a comic on my Tumblr

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
yesterday that was

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
a woman that in interviews is like, okay,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
well, you've passed all of this. Now,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
let me see your Facebook. She's like, let me see

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
yours.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Oh, yeah. That's what I would say, too. I probably wouldn't

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
get the job, but would you want to work for a company

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
that does that? I don't know. It's tough because

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
in this day and age, people really, really

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
need jobs. And it's kind of

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
gross. It's just gross that

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
employers are exploiting that. It's

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
gross. I think employers

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
that do that should be called out. I think

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
we should have a list of employers that are

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
violating the privacy of their employees.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And create two Facebook pages.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I know.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I know, right? Or just say, I don't have one.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
They won't believe you.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
They won't believe you. They'll search for you, but

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
if you use a fake name on the internet,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
it'll be hard to find.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And honestly, anyone can read my

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Facebook page. I don't care. Don't post anything

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
private on there anyways. I don't care. I mean,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
my mother and my rabbi are on my

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Facebook. So, really.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
But you can see where not everybody would want

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
their employers on their Facebook. You know what I mean?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
It's just, for me, it's a private

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yes, I have co-workers on

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Facebook, but it's, you know, my choice.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I don't want him on my Facebook either

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
because I just don't want him

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I don't want to talk to him on Facebook.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I don't really care.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
around the world and check out what is coming out

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
in a gaming store near you. We'll start with the

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
US. Ah, slowing down a bit.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Go, go crazy bones on the

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Nintendo DS. I'm sure that was delayed to this

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
week. Melee to aggressive

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
behavior. Those crazy bones.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Damn them. Supremacy

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
MMA for the Playstation Vita.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
That's coming out this week

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
as well. Myst

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
on the 3DS. It's in 3D

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and it's Myst.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yay. That game's awesome

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
fifteen years ago. You know, I have a

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
parody of that game called Pissed. I remember

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
that, actually. Yeah.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I never played it. I just thought it was funny. And I

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
can guarantee that there's a hundred percent more

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Myst in that game than there is in the

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Silent Hill HD collection.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
see what you did there. Country Dance

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
All Stars for Kinect.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Dance

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
to country music.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Warriors Orochi 3 on

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Xbox 360.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And then Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
on Playstation 3 and Xbox

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
360 this week, including collector's

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
editions if you really need a collector's

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
edition for a golf game.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Sure, why not. The Capcom

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Digital Collection on Xbox 360, which is a

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that are already

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
out there.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And maybe

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
or maybe not this week because

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
no one seems to have the answer for it. Ridge

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Racer Unbounded possibly coming

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
out this week. Possibly delayed to who knows

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
when. Because even Namco doesn't

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
know. So

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
possibly this week.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Alright. Going to

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Japan. Are we good to go to Japan now?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Alright. So going to Japan. Yay! We're going to Japan.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
On the Nintendo 3DS

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Japan this week. Probably a

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
big release some of you might care about.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
This might be worth importing to some of you.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Distance gets released on the

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan on the 29th.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Remember you can't import

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
from the 3DS unless you

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
have a Japanese region 3DS.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Right. It is not region free like the original

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
DS was, right? Yes. So

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
well if you want to get a Japanese 3DS

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
there is specifically a Kingdom Hearts

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
3DS that you

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
can get. It's like a black one

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
that kind of looks nice. Like a little

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
like inscription of Disney. I don't know if that's like

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
a sticker they put on it. But it looks

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
like a picture. It looks like an inscription.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Oh okay. So it's

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
a little more permanent so that's good.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So that's kind of your big release

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
and that's on the 3DS this week. But there are some

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
other games coming out of Japan this week.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
On the Playstation Vita

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
there's Pro Yakyuu Spirits

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
2012. O Tumao

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
To Sevanen no Himigimitachi

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Shin Osamamonogatari.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
That is coming out from

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Konami this week. I don't know

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
if this is a series I recognize

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
on the Vita.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
It's like a chibi

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
character role playing game.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
When I saw the people at first I was

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
like oh it's like Suikoden but it's definitely

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
not. It's too cartoony to be that.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Something a little different

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
there. But that's from Konami which is a pretty big

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
publisher in Japan.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Going to the

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
consoles real quick. Let me take a look at the

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Xbox 360. Japan

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
gets Duke Nukem Forever.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Stay away

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
from it. It's horrible.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Root Double Before Crime After

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Days. Mahjong Dream Club

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
on the 360. And lastly

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
on the Playstation 3 this week. Grand Theft

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Auto. Episodes from Liberty

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
City. Gets like a price reduction.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Duke Nukem Forever is out there as well.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
The Silent Hill HD Collection makes its way

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
to Japan. Idol Master

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Gravure For You

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Volume 6

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
comes out this week on the Playstation 3.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So there you go. Your Japanese releases.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
How about

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
UK? We do have a few.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
For the UK releases

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
we have on the 28th

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
we have Wrecked Revenge

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
on the 29th

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Silent Hill HD Collection. On the

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
30th Silent Hill Downpour

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Naruto Shippuden

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Ridge Racer Unbound

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Warriors Orochi 3

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Awesome.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Alright.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Let's do a couple more stories and then the classic

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
game of the week. Loki?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Alright.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Apparently

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Ubisoft is hoping that

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
they can get rid of their DRM

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that they have on PC.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
According to a recent interview

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
with Eurogamer

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Chris Early, who is the

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Vice President of Digital Publishing at

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Ubisoft, talked about

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
some of their anti-piracy

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
measures and how

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
it's a tricky balancing act.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Basically

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
they were talking a little bit about

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
how

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
it's kind of

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
leniencing some of their customers

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and that at the same time

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
they don't want to put

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
they're having

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
a hard time convincing

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
themselves to not

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
put DRM on their PC tiles because they know

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
they're going to get pirated so they're trying to find

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
kind of a balance where

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
they can offer enough value in a game where

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
people will want to

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
buy it legitimately without having to

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
worry about DRM.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Kind of the same thing I think was at

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
CD Projekt Red was going through with

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
The Witcher 2 and stuff like that where that game was

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
really pirated and they're like

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
listen we're not doing DRM anymore.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I think that's mainly because it kept

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
failing in their pain to put DRM in there

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and so you might as well recoup some money.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
But

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
right now they're saying

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
the question is with enough ongoing

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
content development, content release,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
engagement at the community level, we can

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
create that kind of MMO value system.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I think we can.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
As the rest of the

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
game industry continues to evolve the more

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
you hear about cloud gaming

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
the more you hear about companion gaming

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
the less pirated game

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
the less

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
pirated games should work in all of that

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
environment. So basically they're

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
trying to

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
make it work here. Well cloud

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
gaming I mean they're basically making it where you don't

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
have any of the content you just kind of access it

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and then the MMO stuff

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
just kind of more it sounds like

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
a lot of pay to

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
purchase, pay to play stuff.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Right. It's kind of like

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
they're trying to enrich it

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
by giving it more

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
to download. It's almost

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
like the Mass Effect 2 thing I'm going through

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
right now. I got a copy of Mass Effect 2 for

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
20 bucks, brand new. I'm like, fuck yeah

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
sweet, a copy of Mass Effect 2.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Almost got pissed as hell when I saw it

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
came with a free code for the Cerberus network.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Expires January 1,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
2012. And I just bought it

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
off the shelf at Fry's, brand new.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But I tried using it anyway

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
it still worked. So crisis averted

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
right. So by the way

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
pro tip, those codes might not

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
actually expire when they say they do. Just throwing it

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
out there.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
But the other thing I wanted to say is that

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I find that now I'm being

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
told, oh I have to buy the $7

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
DLC because it

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
will change some things in 3 and then there's other

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
DLC. I might have to drop another 20

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
bucks in DLC to get the full experience.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
So they're still going to get

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
40 bucks out of me for the whole game even though

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I thought I was getting it on sale. What they

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
really should do, and like I was saying before

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
with the whole Killzone 3 online

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
thing, how that was free.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That's how you get people interested in

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
your game. You put that shit out there digitally

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
for free. Just, you can

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
even do it like a demo. And then

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
you add content and you're basically free

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
to play. You're free to start playing it but then

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
you pay for additional content. Or you

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
can get everything boxed together. And then

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
is that like the whole idea that Ridge Racer

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
on the Vita would be awesome if it was

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
free?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I wouldn't go as far as saying it would be awesome

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
but it would be a lot easier to

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
swallow that, okay yes there's only 3

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
tracks and 5 cars because this is the free version

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
of the game. Versus the $30

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
version of the game. Well there's the Motorstorm.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
The Motorstorm game is free and they have

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
a lot of DLC for it. Exactly.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That's kind of a perfect example there. Although that

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
DLC you don't really need any of it. I mean

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
because it's just cars that change the appearance

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
of your cars. Which since you're not really

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
racing anybody

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
anyways, um

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I don't really see the point of making your

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
car look different. Considering that I don't think

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
they handle any different. But whatever.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
You know you can do that. And that

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
DLC though is anywhere from like a quarter

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
a pop to like a buck.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I mean which is something like

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
a quarter. I'm not even going to blink at that.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I mean that's nothing if I really felt like

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I should buy it. But I mean

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
you know like do that with like the next

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Call of Duty game or something like that. Imagine

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
a free to play Call of Duty game where you can

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
level up to say like

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
rank you know 20 or something like that

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
then oh you gotta pay

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
to you know rank up even further.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I think people would be all over that

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
shit. It would be

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
it would be immensely successful.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Um and I knew this comment

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
was coming in the chat room. AcidicVampire says

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Sky just drop the money for it.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Mass Effect 2's DLC is worth it.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
All the Mass Effect fans are joining in.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Infinel says you don't really need the weapon armor

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
DLC and Shane says yeah forget it

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
just get the story stuff. I'm like alright

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
yeah yeah you guys made your point but

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
you know and Mass Effect 2

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
is kind of one game out of

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
a lot that I would be willing to do that for.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I mean again I actually

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
it held my attention long enough to beat it.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That says a lot right there. So

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
alright.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
When you get around to it I may have DLC

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
codes for you for Mass Effect 3.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Nice! For some

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
of the pre-order stuff. I think I still

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
have some left over. Send those my way!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Save one for when I borrow Rob's.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I love that Jamie

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
is already resigned to the fact that she's gonna

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
have to play the whole damn series. Oh and hey if anybody

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
needs any of the ganky codes

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
for Saints Row the Third I think I have like

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
200 of them still so

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
send me a direct message

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
on Twitter. By the way

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Mass Effect fans in chat especially

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Shane. Do I get like a big

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
old high five or a big old cookie for

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
paying it forward to Jamie where

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
now she's taking my copy and she's gonna

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
get sucked into this? Of course

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
she might come on the show next week

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
and go I hated it.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You guys are stupid. You know what? I think

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
right there that's a perfect example of how they

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
should be treating games instead of saying oh

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
well we want each person to play an online pass.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
They should be fucking encouraging people to get

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
people to loan that game out so that people try.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Not necessarily the full version of the game but

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
like say hey this person played a demo

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
that's owned by this person like you can

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
send it to them and if they play it and they

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
like it or something like that you get a kickback

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
or something like that. That is the fucking way

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
That's a good point because if I loan her

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Mass Effect 2 she might have to go buy the

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
DLC for herself.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Maybe. I mean we're making a lot of assumptions

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
here but. Well I think they just need to

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
rethink how they're you know

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
doing this. How they're approaching everything

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
and if they could just grasp

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
these wonderful ideas you know they could make a lot of money.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Alright.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Hitstone wants to know if any of those codes are for PC.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
No. Oh.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Sorry. PS3 and 360 only.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Wah wah wah wah. Sorry.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Alright. One more

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
story for you guys. Look it's a slow news week

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
so I'm gonna let this story through.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
In a more busy news week it would have been cut but

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
we needed something so I'm gonna

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
go ahead and address these rumors about Grand Theft

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Auto 5. Supposedly

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
from an ex-Rockstar employee

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
on the GameSpot

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
forums so

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
big fat grain of salt

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and I'm doing this instead of Loki

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
so that Loki can sit here and go

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
it's bullshit or oh it sounds like it's

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
legit.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Number one. There will be

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
one protagonist character. One

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
character alone. Albert Da Silva

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
is the name. Half Hispanic

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
man who was once a part of a crime city.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Crime family in Vice City.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
True or false? I don't know.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
You're not very fun to play with.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Sorry. Multiplayer will hold

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
32 people on the Xbox and

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
PlayStation 3. Unknown

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
about PC. Just like

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Red Dead Redemption you'll be able to form

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
gangs. They're not ranked through XP

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
but through reputation.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Well we know that to be true

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
already but I think a lot of that is

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
just speculation. I think all this is

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
speculation. They don't know.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Alright.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Yeah I think a lot of this seems like educated

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
speculation to me when I read it too and I don't

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
know a dick about Grand Theft Auto. I don't know if it's educated

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
speculation but. Number

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
three. The map is about five times as large

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
as the Grand Theft Auto 4 map and the

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
city of Los Santos takes up just

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
under half of this area. So it's bigger than

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
two Grand Theft Auto 4 Liberty Cities.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Again, safe bet.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Um.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I don't know if they can do it like that.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I mean it could be bigger because

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I think the Red Dead Redemption map was pretty big

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
but I mean it's a lot of it's just

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
fitting in textures and fitting in

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
the maps themselves. I mean

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
the object placement formats and stuff like

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
that it's pretty small

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
but it's when you get all the different textures in the

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
game. So I don't know if it's going to be five

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
times as large. I mean it's going to be pretty big.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
But I

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
don't know. I just assume it's going to be larger.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Cars and guns are customizable

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
to an extent. For an example you

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
can customize a gun to have a suppressor on it

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
and you can install nitrous into cars.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I thought you could already do that in Grand Theft Auto.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Uh.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
They used to have that in San Andreas.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Not necessarily the

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
suppressors but I mean that would be a nice feature.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I don't know if that's going to be

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
legit or not.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Alright let me get to some of the other

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
good stuff because this is getting

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
boring already. Radio stations

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
now do traffic reports that are actually

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
correct. So if you don't know what route to take

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
you can check the traffic reports on your phone or on the

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Radio 7. The in-game TV

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
has more channels. Again that seems like a safe bet.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
But once again though

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
those in-game TV channels are

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
fucking huge as far as the files go.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
They're Bic encoded

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
or Bink encoded videos

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
that take up hundreds of

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
megs. I mean if they're going to fit

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
that shit on a disc they're going to have to do some sort of

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
compression or something because as of

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
right now on 4 in episodes

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
from Liberty City they're not

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
compressed at all besides

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
you know what the actual

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
encoder does but

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
that's why there's not that many stations

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
on like episodes from Liberty City

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
because they can't fit it on the disc.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
The protagonist

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
can take drugs which will have

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
some effects but smoking weed

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
on the streetwalk will lead to getting a one

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
star wanted level.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
That's like Saintsboro

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
one shit. I mean I don't even

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
know if I can go with that. I'm bored

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
of this story already so here's the biggest one.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
The game is due in May 2013.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
A more specific date has not been

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
decided because the game is still needing six

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
months to be fully developed. They

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
will have a playable demo at E3.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
That's again speculation

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
because we already know with their

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
we already know the next quarter game is going to be

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Max Payne 3. We already know what the

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
fourth quarter game is going to be which is going to be

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
well it's not necessarily the Rockstar but Take 2

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
which is going to be NBA 2K

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
NHL 2K if they actually put one out

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
this year and of course you know the big

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
big big one is

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
you know Bioshock Infinite

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
so of course that stuff is going to be

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
coming out and so you got to figure

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
you know it's going to be

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
first or second quarter and you know

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
estimating they've got

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
maybe they've got some other 2K stuff

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
oh shit I completely forgot

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
of like you know

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
XCOM is still in there somewhere

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
and

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
then I want to say like the

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Summer Games probably

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Spec Ops they've

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
still got in there somewhere in June I

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
believe

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I don't know a lot of it just sounds like

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
speculation and you know

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
unfortunately because I do follow

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
a lot of Grand Theft Auto

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
communities and stuff there is like one person

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
each week saying oh I've heard something

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
from a random you know

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Rockstar employee yeah and they're going to make

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
these educated guesses so that if they're close

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
then yeah people say hey I said it first

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
and then if they're wrong then no one will

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
remember. People have a need to be first

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
sometimes. Exactly.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I love some of the comments in our chat room

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
chat.orangessantria.com Porkchop

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
what a delicious handle in the

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
chat room says why would anyone

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
waste time watching TV in Grand Theft Auto

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
when you can go out and stomp hookers? We actually

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
did watch a lot of the TV when

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Dan was playing it. It was funny.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
You're boring. You should be killing more hookers.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
SHJ100Matt

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
says what Grand Theft Auto 5 really

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
needs is the SimCity Action News

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
reporter just saying

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
God I love your topical sense of humor

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I really do because it gives me an excuse

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
to play a clip from SimCity Action

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
News

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
is

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
picking up cars and buses

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and throwing them hundreds of yards

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
as he moves closer to the SimCity Action

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Studios which means

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
that this is Carol Davenport signing off

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and getting the hell out of here.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Give her an Emmy. Give her a goddamn Emmy.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Lifetime Achievement

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Award.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You see...

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Let's give her a series on Bravo.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Jurassic Park had just come

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
out that same year. So that's funny.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Let's go back to a time

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
when

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
video games were less complicated

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
and didn't require full screen

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
videos and all that stuff

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
in a segment we call the classic

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
game of the week. Yay!

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
is great. You kids

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
need to stop playing

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
your Grand Theft Auto 5s and your SimCity

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Action Newses

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and you need to check out this

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
awesomely classic game. What is the classic

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
game of the week? Today's classic game is

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Star Fox.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Yay. Fucking great choice.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Which came out of Starwing

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
in Europe and Australia because there was

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
a trademarked game that came out

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
like in

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
when the hell... 1983.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Can I just say I'm really hating the ads

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
on YouTube these days. Sorry. It's alright.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Not your fault. I didn't want

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
to hear emo bands singing first while I'm trying

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
to get some Star Fox action going on here

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
in the studio. We're the emo band

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
singing about Star Fox.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Our lives suck

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
cause we don't have Star Fox.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Anyway.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Star Fox

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
is a

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
rail shooter that used

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
3D polygon graphics. It's the first Nintendo

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
game to use full on polygons.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And it was powered by the

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Super FX chip which was basically

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
a co-processor so that it could handle it.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So uh

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
the characters were all designed

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
by Takaya Imamura

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
based off of Kemono

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
characters basically

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
from old I believe 16th

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
century Japanese art.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
This is pretty cool. You know basically

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
anthropomorphic characters.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
What? Somebody in chat asked

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
if they could do a barrel roll so I slapped him with a fish.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Okay cool.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
At any rate

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
God this music is so epic. I love the first

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
level music. The soundtrack was so

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
fucking good. Turn this up a little bit. Sure.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
This is like seriously my favorite music in the game.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
What the

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
planet music? The very first

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
level. Oh yeah the music

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
here. The canaria level. The whole

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
take off sequence and all that is awesome. Let's

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
listen here for a minute here.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Thanks. Emergency.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
This brings me so much

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
worries.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Seriously the most epic

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:13.000
music ever right here.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Shut up Falco.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Shut up Slippy.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I swear I spent the whole game going

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
freaking hate Slippy die

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and shut up Falco. That was me

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
the entire time I was playing this game. Seriously

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
this music just invokes the

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
world.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Fuck yeah.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
For a Japanese game sure.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Anyway it

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
involves Fox McCloud

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
who is the leader of the Star Fox team

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and they

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
have these ships called

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Arwings which

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
are really floating polygon

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
things and they're pretty cool.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And you've got thrusters and

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
retrorockets that let you speed up

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
slow down and you've got

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
bombs and

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
pew pew laser things.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
You hear the pew pew noises?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Pew pew pew pew.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
So anyway

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
you've got

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
a little bit different thing

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
with your

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
in the damage on here. You've actually got

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
an energy shield that controls how much

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
damage you can absorb before the craft

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
destroys. So you can bump

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
into stuff and you take some damage

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
and don't just immediately explode.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Sometimes if your

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
wings clip against certain obstacles

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
they'll break off and it will affect

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
the handling of your Arwing.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Which was pretty innovative I thought

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
for a game of it's time.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
The other thing that was interesting

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
about this is that it didn't have a difficulty

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
selection after you

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
finished the first stage you actually

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
would pick a path

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
that you could go on.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And so you could pick the easy

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
option, the normal option, or the hard option

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
depending on which path you took.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
So you could mix and match your game

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
anyway and it had multiple

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
patterns. You know kind of like

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
an outrun.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You know how you can pick your different

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
paths and outrun. Oh yeah an outrun

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
you can pick your path but kind of once you

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
start going one way it's like you can't

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
really change it too much.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You can kind of slip back into something.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
If you go left the first time you'll

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
never do the stage all the way at the bottom of the map.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Right you know that kind of thing.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
The same thing was done in After Burner.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Yay Sega. Anyway.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So you also have

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
your wingmen. You have Peppy Hare, Slippy

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Toad. Sucker.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And Falco Lombardi who I hated

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Falco so much.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And it was kind of

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
cool because if you accidentally shot one of

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
your guys you wouldn't hurt them

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
but they would say hey

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
what are you doing shooting at me?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I'm Falco and I suck.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Hey I suck at these things off my toes.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Yeah you actually have to um

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
save your wingmen from being attacked by

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
other enemies too which was

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
almost always slippy.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
So yeah

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
so you have to help them so that they'll always

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
be there with you and you even have the

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
little flying formation thing which is pretty cool.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
So anyway

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
um

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
there were a few

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
really neat things with this too. Like I said

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
it was using the um

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Super FX chip. It actually was

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
based off on

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
there was a prototype on the NES that was called

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
NES Glider that was

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
inspired by a game called Star Glider

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
and then they brought the prototype to the SNES

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
and once they uh

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
they actually uh hired

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
um a company to create

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
the Super FX chip so that they could have

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
the 3D graphics in there.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
It was actually a lot

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
harder um a lot more

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
powerful than the SNES

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
uh processor. There was a joke going

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
around that the um

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
SNES was basically just a box to hold the chip.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Pretty cool.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
So um the main game

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
uh was designed by Miyamoto

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
and um Eguchi

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
and uh like I said the characters were designed

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
by um Imamura

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and that awesome music was by

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
um Hajime Hirasawa so

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
awesome music. We've got so many different

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
good versions of that song too.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Um

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
It was also stated

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
by Miyamoto that he wanted to use animal

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
characters since he didn't want to

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
do conventional sci-fi with

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
robots, monsters, and superheroes.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And uh so that's how

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
it came about.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
So um moving

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
a little bit uh forward

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
there's secret levels in the game.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Did you ever do any of the secret levels Rob?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I did. Wasn't it the thing where you had to shoot the little

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
planet and the little planet that would pop out

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
for like a half second? You had to do something?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And then you had to shoot it in the eye?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
There were, okay. If I remember this

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
correctly cause keep in mind it's been a while since

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I've done it. To get to the um the black hole

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
level you have to shoot

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
these um like

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
rings that there's a little central

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
part. Is this the slot machine level?

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
That's the slot machine. I think that's the slot machine.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Yeah

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
is that going from the easy one to the

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
This video is somebody actually doing it. So

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
we'll uh. No that's the first one.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
The slot machines

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
later on. Let me fast forward

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
the video a little bit then. Where's the slot machine?

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Oh no that's the one.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
That's the slot machine one.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Yeah I think somebody

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
accesses it here cause here's the

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Yeah that's the slot machine.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Okay anyway let me

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
There was one where um

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
where you uh

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
have to shoot these certain rings a certain

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
way and then fly through the center of the explosion

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
and then this ugly ass planet

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
pops up that looks like um

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
you know it kind of looks like the moon from

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Majora's Mask. It looks like a troll

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
face to me. To me it looks like

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
the moon from Majora's Mask.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And um you have to

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
shoot it or fly into it or something.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And so you get to go to the first

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
um black hole and the

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
black hole basically if you

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
whatever different ring pops up in the black

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
hole if you fly through it it warps you

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
to that level. Shut up Slippy.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Anyway.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
The other one which is one that we were talking about

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
a moment ago is you get there from

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
asteroid field course three.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Is um

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
called out of this dimension.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And it plays um

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
different music as you go

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
through it um you actually have to shoot down

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
paper planes.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
At first. And then the boss plays um

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
different parts. One is from a

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Japanese folk song called Yuki.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Um the chorus from when the saints go marching

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
in and lightly row.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
And uh you shoot parts of the machine

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
like the arm to cause

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
the spinners on the slot machine

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
to go. And basically um

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
when you land

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
on three sevens

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
um then you defeat the machine

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and it explodes. And then you

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
actually fly through the ending credits

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
of the game and then the end shows up

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
but all the letters are flipped around. So you have to keep shooting

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
the letters and when it finally lines up the different way

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
it um basically just

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I think starts you over.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
It ends the game. Imagine that.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
It's not just a clever title.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
No this

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
crazy mode seven.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Ooh mode seven. And FX FX.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And FX exactly.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Wasn't there only like one other game that had the FX chip in it?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
That would be Stunt Race FX.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I think there was one more.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
There was a robot game.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Oh yeah there was. You're right. And keep in mind there's the

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Star Fox 2 prototype.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
That of course

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
we never saw.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Now the one I'm going to talk about next is actually

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
one that our friend Melody

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
used to have a copy of.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And that was the competition version.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Which is the Super Star Fox weekend competition one.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Where uh they had

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
a limited time play

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
and there were two thousand copies made

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
and she said she sold hers.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
There was um you know we had

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
a number of Star Fox games come out since then.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Star Fox 2 was in the works for Super Nintendo.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Um

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
though um the head programmer said

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
that they actually finished the game.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Um there was

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
uh Star Fox 64.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
There were

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
um there's actually ROM dumps of

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Star Fox 2 that were from different stages

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
of development. And someone

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
actually translated it and made um

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
a patch for it.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
There is Star Fox

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
on the GameCube that was Star Fox Adventures by

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Rare. We had

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Star Fox Assault for the GameCube

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
that was done by Namco.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And it was a third person shooter.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
There was Star Fox Command that was on the DS.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And now there's um Star Fox makes

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
appearances in a micro game in Warrior

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
where Smooth moves.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
And um you fight

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
basically the Nintendo robot

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
who has a huge munga zapper.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
that's it.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Alright. A true classic.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Star Fox. Again

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
one of those games I had to go

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
she's never done Star Fox before? I know.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I had to go really? I've never done Star Fox before?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So yeah. So yeah

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
200 episodes into this or what?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Also funny.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
The Starwing logo uses a completely different font

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
than Star Fox. Just saying.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Now some folks in chat were like

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
boy Nintendo really ruined this franchise.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
You know some of the Star Fox Adventures of course

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
was not very well received and

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
you know I think people liked Star Fox 64

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
enough. Um and a lot of

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Star Fox 2 kind of went into that but uh

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
yeah Star Fox Adventures wasn't really

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
pretty. So that's too bad.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Anyhow we are going

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
to take a quick break but don't go anywhere. We got

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
more Orange Lounge Radio to come. Things that might

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
actually be better than Star Fox.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Alright maybe not but they're still

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
pretty good so stick around. We'll be right back after this

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
We are live with episode number

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
451 for this.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
March the 25th of

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
2012. Um I know we

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
can't play these live break songs that we do

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
um on the podcast but we were playing some

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
music from the DDR days and

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
by coincidence I happened to pick

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
songs that were both from Dance Dance Revolution

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
third mix Korean.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Um and man I miss

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
those games. I miss DDR back when it was

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
so good and like that

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
that community and everything we had and the songs

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
were like legit. Like not everybody

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
ever understood the songs. I'm sure some of you

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
listening to the show now probably go

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
really you guys kind of like that music but

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
like there is just something about DDR music. I can't

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
explain it. I can't put my finger on it but man

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I miss those days. But

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
oh well. It was

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
actually asked um by

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Technus who was played at a third mix

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
machine that was not a Korean version.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Me. Um they had one here

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
locally somewhere didn't they? Well they did.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
The one that I played at I think it was

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
AX2000. Mhm. Was

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
um a Japanese third mix from

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
uh Arcade Infinity. Ah.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Nice.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I did hear I think

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
that they're trying to restart Arcade Infinity

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
in another location. Or like something

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
like it. So that's cool. I hope it

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
happens. We'll see.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Alright anyhow let's get back into some gaming news

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
with some rapid fire news.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Uh some quick stories for you guys. Loki.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So uh we've

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
heard about LittleBigPlanet Karting

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
um which was you know

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
leaked out of the

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
uh what was it

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
uh PlayStation

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
event. PlayStation event. PlayStation event.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
What the hell was it called? Uh

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
uh

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
uh I can't remember. Anyways.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Uh you know

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Loki uh PlayStation event

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
basically uh is gonna be coming out on

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
the Vita and PlayStation 3.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Uh not surprisingly enough though it's

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
actually being done by

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
um United Front Games

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
who are the developers behind

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
ModNation Racers.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So they kinda have a little bit of experience

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
in you know

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
play, share, create racing games.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Although

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
at the same time that makes me

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
a little worried because

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Well maybe they'll take some of the feedback from the last

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
one and make it better.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
You know. Maybe.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Hopefully. Um

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I mean the trailer looks neat. They have

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
a trailer out for it now. Um

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
So it has potential. I'm just really

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
sad that Media Molecule is not

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
having a

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
like you know really

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
a lot of

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
feedback on it. At least I hope that

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
they do. I don't know. It didn't really say.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Um

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Destination PlayStation. That's

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
what it was. Destination PlayStation.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Um

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So yeah. They're gonna be doing an Adventure Time

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
game for Nintendo DS.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And it's being done by

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
WayForward. Um. Who have

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I guess they were behind

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Uh

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Some new. Oh what was it?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I'm trying to remember games they put out.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
The Henry Hatsworth game.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Um. They had that come out.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Um. So that was not a bad

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
game. And I haven't really said

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
too much about what the game is.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Although the creator of the show

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
um

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
actually posted some really funny

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
like animated gifs. So

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Neat.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I'm sure the game will be pretty

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
awesome. The show is pretty cool.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
It's a great cartoon.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
And last but not least

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
they announced that Max Payne 3

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
is gonna have kind of a

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
new feature for the multiplayer. They're

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
gonna have what they're calling crews

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
and now what the Max

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Payne 3 crews are are kind of like these

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
multiplayer clans that you have

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
that you can um play

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
through the game and

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
uh kind of um create these

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
uh crews or clans

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
through the social club. The Rockstar Social

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Club page. And what's

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
kind of neat though is when you create

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
your clan in Max Payne

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
3 you'll actually be able to transfer it to

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
when that comes in to play the actual multiplayer

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
and that. So it's kind of like a cross game

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
clan

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
crew or whatever you want to call it.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Um. Which I think is kind of cool.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Cause they're definitely doing a lot of social club

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
um interaction with the game

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
and I know like in the past when I used

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
to play a lot of Grand Theft Auto 4

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
and I really am sad I don't play a lot of

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 now but

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
you know last week or so

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
actually this is kind of one thing that we

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
didn't talk about but on the

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
hacking scene for Grand Theft Auto 4

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
they released online scripts for

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
um for multiplayer.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
So you're gonna see a lot more hacking

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
shenanigans on Grand Theft Auto 4

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
um if you're playing that online

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
which is kind of sad cause I

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
legitimately had a really high rank on

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
that game um but unfortunately

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
you know now anyone can game it to

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
you get the top of the

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
leaderboard so it's kind of

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
over and done for now.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Um but 5 man I am looking

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
forward to playing 5 multiplayer

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
for sure from day 1 but uh

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Max Payne 3

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
not much interest in that game.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Cause it's not Grand Theft Auto.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Alright

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
well moving on to some other games

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
uh kind of in the same

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
category as Grand Theft Auto another Rockstar game

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
uh L.A. Noire

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
is getting a touch controlled

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
version um

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
OnLive of course put out some

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
various tablet apps

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
um and Rockstar is doing

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
a touch version of L.A. Noire

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
making this kind of more of a

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
touch screen friendly game or an iOS

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
or whatever phone it is game.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Um OnLive says those controls are now

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
available so you can play L.A. Noire

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
with OnLive Mobile

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
and uh yeah you can uh

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
swipe across the screen to do

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
some motions I guess you don't need to use

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
virtual buttons or a wireless controller

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
or any of that. Uh you do need to

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
buy L.A. Noire if you want to play it

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
uh or you know and have an OnLive

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
account and all that but it is interesting that they actually

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
kind of adapted it. However, however

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
there are free trials for all the games and the Online

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
client is free. So you can check it out

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
for free. Okay that's good to know.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
So if you want to see if this is up your alley.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
I don't know if L.A. Noire would work in touch

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
motion for me but okay.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
The problem is it's L.A. Noire.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
The interrogation parts will be fine but it's

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
the rest of the movie. I got bored

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
with that game really fast.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Alright moving on Final Fantasy 13

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
2 um you know what's funny

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
is that I didn't finish 13

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
2 and part of the reason I wasn't able to do it is because

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I got sucked into Mass Effect. Well

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
worlds can now collide on March

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
27th. They've announced that there will be

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Mass Effect 3 DLC

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
for Final Fantasy 13 2.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
What? Yes it's

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
true. It's not as big as you think

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
though. It's just that now Sarah and Noel

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
who are of course the big two uh characters

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
in the game are going to get

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
N7 armor

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
that they can dress up in to make them look like Mass Effect

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
characters and although there's a part of me that

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
goes that's stupid. There's another part of me that goes

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
but that's really awesome.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
By the way Mass Effect is not the only

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
kind of you know game hopping

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
that's going on. Assassin's Creed

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Revelations outfits are supposed to be on their way.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And that's I believe only in Japan right now.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Right I don't think a date has been announced

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
for the US. It'll eventually

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
happen though. Yeah. Uh

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
what else is interesting I think this is

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
really interesting

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
um Final Fantasy 13 2 got some other

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
DLCers getting some that

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
throws the game back to Final Fantasy

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
6. Don't get too

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
excited it's just a couple of the characters

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
but if you played 6 you'll remember

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Ultros right

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Ultros was the octopus and the annoying

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
little bastard. He has the

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
little jokes and everything. Uh

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Typhon is the other one. Is it Typhoon or

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Typhon is the other one. I'll say Typhoon.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
But uh is the other

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I only see 1-0 so whatever.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Uh but is the other character that will be available

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
as well. Uh this is

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
more of one of those arena fights and if you beat

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
them in the arena then you can use them as your monsters

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
cause you know your third person can always be a monster.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So I thought it was kind of funny that

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
they kind of went back to the

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
past with that so that's pretty cool.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
So there you go. Uh

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
no announcement when that is out in the US

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
March 27th in Japan however.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
So probably soon thereafter.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Um

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
this is just you know kind of unfortunate

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
but um some of the promotion

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
for Street Fighter X Tekken caused

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Yoshinori Ono to need medical

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
treatment which is um unfortunate.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Uh the producer of course

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
he's the producer of the Street Fighter series

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
and you know this new direction they're

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
going in here. He was at a

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Street Fighter X Tekken event in South Korea and he

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
just collapsed. He had to go to the hospital.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Uh they did post Capcom on

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
their Street Fighter blog. Immediately after

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
a Street Fighter X Tekken event in Asia

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
the physical condition of Street Fighter X Tekken producer

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Ono-Chin, that's the nickname

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
he goes by, rapidly deteriorated

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
and he collapsed. He was taken to the hospital and he

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
is currently not coming into work.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Luckily it sounds like something that's

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
easily treatable.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Luckily it also sounds like he didn't suffer

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
from exhaustion the same way that that one

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
guy did that's all over THC. I was just

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
gonna make that joke.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But uh

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
yeah it's not something to really joke

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
about in this guy's case so too bad.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Hope he feels better.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Yeah that's sad. However you might feel

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
about the game aside um

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Well both did suffer exhaustion

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
while handling their fight sticks.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
So for a game

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
coming out in Japan called

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
well actually I think it's coming out here too. It's by

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Platinum Games

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Anarchy Reigns.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Famitsu put out images that Bayonetta

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
is gonna be in the game.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
No other news about it

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
just hi Bayonetta.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
What else do you need besides

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I don't know a sequel to Bayonetta? I know right.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And also amongst the

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
30 some odd games that were removed

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
from the Japanese Wii Virtual

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Console uh

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
basically 4 Sonic games are gone.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Sonic 1 to Sonic and Knuckles is gone

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
as well as the uh Master System

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
version of Sonic 1.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Which is too bad cause you know it's impossible

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
to get Sonic 1 on any other platform.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Well there's

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
no I mean the Master System.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I know what you mean but you know what I mean.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
But there's

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
no word about it in the US or Europe yet

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
but I'm sure it's gonna follow.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And then fans of ThinkGeek

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
who have I'm sure seen more and more

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
and more Portal stuff pop up there

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I sure have including an inflatable

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Sentry and a little uh talking

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Sentry uh plushie that I totally want.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Um the Portal gun

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
is for sale for 140 bucks.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
5,000 replicas have been made.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And somebody better buy me one for my birthday.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
That's all I'm saying.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
No secret what you want huh?

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Just saying.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Birthdays next month.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Let's go to the FUGL Question

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
of the Week. We missed it last week but it's back tonight.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
The FUGL Question of the Week.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Uh Facebook and

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Google Plus get a question every week

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
and we read some of our favorite answers

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
here on the program for you

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
guys and if uh those in studio want to

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
answer. I don't know if they repeat the question

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
in advance. It's kind of a toughie. This is one that

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
takes a little bit of thought tonight.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Uh so we'll start at Google Plus

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
FUGL Question of the Week. If you could go back and change

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
a classic games ending since

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
you know it's all the rage right now talking about changing

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
the ending of games. What ending would you change

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and what would the new ending be?

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
And I said let's stick to classics because

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
we don't want to spoil any new games. So I

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
did force people to think classics. It's interesting

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
though. We got a lot of varied responses that

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
weren't, that kind of took the question in a different

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
direction. And uh Derek H.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
starts us off on Google in that direction.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I want to go back to the days when

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
games didn't have endings.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
The only time it ended was because the

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
machine broke or you ran out of quarters.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I bet there's some guy in Ohio that's

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
still playing River Raid after 25

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
years and he's only on his

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
second man.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Imagine some kid complaining after the planet

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
exploded in Stargate or when Pauline

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
kept getting kidnapped by Donkey Kong

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
or that the ambulance always passed you in

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Turbo. That would never happen because

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
in those days, gamers

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
weren't spoiled little punks who need

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
closure after having pretend sex with an

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
alien.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
So some pretty strong words

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
there about uh

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
back in my day, back in the old day.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
That's true though. A lot of Atari

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
2600 games never ended.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Very few had an ending. You know the ending

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
the only game I can think of

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
a couple of them that actually

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
had endings. Oops

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
no. No Holik during the uh

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
question. Thank you. Um

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Pitfall and Pitfall 2.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And at the end of Pitfall

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
it just stops. It freezes.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I don't think there's anything to do it. And the ending of

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Pitfall 2, he jumps up

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
and down a lot. And you won.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
It's because games back then

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
were trying to recreate the arcade experience

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
games today are

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
about touching you emotionally.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Alright uh going to Facebook

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
some of the answers there.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Blue 2 says that's a tough one. I can't

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
think of any ending I would change. However like

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
thousands of gamers out there

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
finished Half Life already Gabe.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So uh he kind of ignored the question

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
of the week and just said finish Half Life. But actually

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Alan was telling me about how

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Half Life 2

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Episode 1 did kind of

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
go back and

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
patch a few things up from what was originally

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
out there for Half Life so

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
they've kind of tinkered with those

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
endings before. Um

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Let's see

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Jim H answers on Facebook

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
saying since I just beat it again yesterday

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I would change the ending of Super Mario Brothers 2

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
so it isn't a dream

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
at the end. I know it

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I know it was a different

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
game they just plugged in Mario

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
characters into but since they did end up

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
using enemies from the game in later sequels

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
it would be nice if it fit into the

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
continuity better. Oh yeah the

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
original it was all a dream ending

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Mario 2 right?

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Yeah. But it

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
doesn't fit well into the continuity when it's all a

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
dream. I like that idea. That's good.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Uh let's see Stan H

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
on Facebook says I'd

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
change the ending of the

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I Said No Holic

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Thank you

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I'd change the ending of the original

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Super Mario Brothers. I'd make it so that when

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Mario saves Peach from Bowser

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
she tells her that he

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I think he tells her that he is enrolling her in some

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Taekwondo lessons with Chun-Li

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
so that when Bowser tries to kidnap her

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
at least she'd be able to put up a fight and she

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
wouldn't get kidnapped so damn frequently.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Nintendo wouldn't have to whore the Mario

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
series out so much. Remember

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
she doesn't fight with Kung Fu she fights

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
with emotions. That's right

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Super Princess Peach. That's what we learned.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Lastly Robert C

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
on Facebook says I'd change the ending to

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Mortal Kombat. The mandatory

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
final fight would be between Katana and

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Sonia. They'd suddenly both swap

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
fighting styles to Brazilian Jutsu

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
in a big pool of mud

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
or jelly. The final scene would

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
obviously be a slow motion montage

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
of them moving from fighting to kissing.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Cue the 70's porn music.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Oh

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
you.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I see what you did

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
there. It'd be kinda hot.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Any classic

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
games you guys here in studio would want to change?

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I know you haven't had a lot of time

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
to think about the answer. I

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
would say let's go back to Ghosts and

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Goblins and give them proper grammar.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
How's that sound?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
That was part of the fun.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I guess that's true.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Um

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I can't

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
really think of anything because you know what

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I'm not a little bitch with

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
a sense of entitlement.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
We're just having fun.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I will tell you which

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
game needs another

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
different ending. The Legend of Zelda

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
it needs a third quest.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Actually

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I would give a better ending to Zelda

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
to the past after how fucking hard that game

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
is. Kinda get a shitty ending.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
That game was epic.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I mean yeah don't get me wrong it's a fucking tremendous

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
game but kind of a crab ending.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Dude.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
They really, you know what would be awesome

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
totally on tangent here.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Is they should totally go with the

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Little Big Planet style to

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
the Legend of Zelda games. You know how they have

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
a ton of ROM hacks and stuff like that with custom levels

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
for the Legend of Zelda. Why not have

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
a Legend of Zelda game that was like Link to the Past

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
but with a ton of fucking custom games

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
in there. Oh I know because no one would ever

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
play your new Zelda games because they'd be

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
too busy enthralled with

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
the custom made stuff.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
You want the Legend of Little Big Planet?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I want the Legend

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
of Zelda with a really kick ass

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
editor

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
that's officially sanctioned. I'm trying to

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
think of just the endings of different games

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
and really I keep thinking back

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
to how epic many of them were.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
You know like Hitler's head blowing up

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
at the end of Bionic Commando

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
or

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
you know

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
how you felt bad

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
for the baby Metroid when you know

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
it got killed

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
and

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
it's all kinds of sad-facedness.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I would go back and make sure

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
that every Silent Hill game had a dog

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
ending. Yes. I would

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
you know what actually I would change the ending

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
to Shattered Memories because I

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
wanted to like that game a whole lot.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
In fact

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I think that the next Silent

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Hill game should be directed by Peter Molyneaux

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
and you should play as the dog.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Should be

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
called Silent Dog. Alright now you guys are getting

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
crazy. Let's move on with some more game news.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Yeah but wait wait wait Silent Dog

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
has a cat

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
let me finish let me finish has a cat ending.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I love the idea of a game called

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Silent Dog.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Where the

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
This might be a dream game.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Hold on. Hold on. Alright dream game.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Silent Dog. The dog must confront

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
you know the

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
demons of its past you know like

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
all the legs they've peed on

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
chasing its tail and

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
yeah being chased by a

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
faceless postman with claw

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
hands. Tires that they can

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
just never catch.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Frisbees of doom with razor blades

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
on them. And mandatory

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Kiryamoka is forced

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
to do all the music.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Cause it's

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
just not a Silent Hill game. Really it should just be

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
the dog song throughout the whole game.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
That you know we need we need

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
to we need to play that Rob. I don't think I have

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
the dog getting music readily accessible.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Yes you do. You have

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
YouTube. Yes you do.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
You know

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I would love to see like the

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
saga of the UFO ending Silent Hill

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
as a UFO.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
That would just be great.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Uh hold on I'm

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
finding it for you guys.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
It was you the whole time?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Praying there's no uh

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
There it is.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It would be awesome.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
But we can't forget about the most important

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
part of Silent Dog.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Which I think is at the very end of the song.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I like that he growls

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
at that one horrible guy.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Ugh this is so great.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Listen to Vampire wants to know this is the canon ending to Silent Hill 2 right?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Yes. Yes absolutely.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Was it Silent Hill 3 that had like the um

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Here's the most important scene in the entire game.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Hold on.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Oh.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Does it do the chorus one more time?

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Yes. Oh god.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I was wondering if the voice actor has been changed for the dog in the HD collection.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Here it is.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
That's right the all important sex scene.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Where the adults are having sex and the dog is just forced to watch with that blank expression on their face.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Like what are my owners doing?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:35.000
You know actually one of my live journal icons is the dog and it says game over.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
You know as much as I love the dog ending I still like the um the Silent Hill theme.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Silent Hill. Silent Hill.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
From one of the UFO endings.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Anyhow I don't know how we got on this topic but Silent Dog make it happen.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Woof woof woof.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
So we were going to get into news at some point right?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
News?

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Yeah we were talking about Silent Dog though so that is very important.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Um.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Oh our dream game.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Silent Dog.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:13.000
So someone needs to explain to me once again why we have these online passes because I swear it's just like I never hear anything going smoothly with them.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I mean I don't understand but whatever.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:24.000
So Ninja Gaiden 3 came out this week and um yeah apparently no one could redeem the online passes for that game.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Not even the reviewers could redeem the online passes because they had forgot to flip the switch to allow those passes to be redeemed.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Ha ha.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Um so yes none of the codes worked at all at launch.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I think they work now. They may be working soon but as of you know earlier this week they were not working at all.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
So fun.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Um.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And then on top of that MLB 12 the show another game with an online pass also had its issues.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Apparently the Playstation 3 and Vita versions had a problem if the Vita players tried to redeem the online pass they couldn't do it via the Vita.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
They could only do it if they had a Playstation 3.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:24.000
But here's the funny thing if they did it via the PS3 it unlocked online play for the PS3 version that they don't own.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:34.000
So uh yeah apparently they were working out problems with that.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
But I don't know.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
It's interesting I guess.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
And then last but not least there is one more game that had an online pass.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
EA Sports MMA.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
It had an online pass and it had online play.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
It wasn't a very popular game.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And on April 13th they will be shutting down the server for it.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
So it just.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
It was on the failure board. Sorry.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
It seemed appropriate.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Other games that are going to be shut are getting their servers shut down as well.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:10.000
EA Create game which was supposed to take on LittleBigPlanet and that sucked.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:15.000
And EA Sports Active 2 which I didn't even know that had online.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:23.000
And the Xbox Live Arcade game Spare Parts is also going to be getting its servers shut down.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
On top of that Boom Blocks for the Wii.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Burnout Revenge for Xbox 360.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Damn it I own Boom Blocks.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp for the Wii.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
FIFA 10 for the PSP and the Wii.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Godfather 2 for the PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Need for Speed Pro Street on PS3 and 360.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And the Saboteur for PS3 and 360 is going to lose the access to the Midnight Club.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Which is some exclusive club but that was in the game if you preordered.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:01.000
And then on the 31st they're shutting down Battlefield 3 Aftershock for the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
You know that game they just released.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
And a few other iPad games.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000
But you know that $10 that funds that online pass.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
It costs a lot to shut a server down.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Yeah must be nice I hope they're refunding money.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Oh of course they're not refunding money because you got your online play.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
But just remember when you're paying for $10 for online for some of these games.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.000
If it's not popular they're just going to shut the server down.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
At least it wasn't as quickly as like say you know.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Oh what was that one MMO that was like Grand Theft Auto?

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
That they just re-released for free.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
APB?

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Yeah at least it wasn't that quick.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Dart Tetsuya in our chatroom says I called that section the online pass blooper reel.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I have to admit when I was reading all this news all I could hear in my head was.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Music

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I mean those poor bastards that are buying some of those games used.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And now they're just going to be offline.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I mean shutting down the servers is nothing new.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:17.000
But now we have a game that people paid $10 to play online and it's not forever.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And I understand that these games may not have been popular or whatever.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And I'm sorry that's nice that it might not have been popular.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000
But I don't know I mean I guess eventually it has to happen.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Figure out a way to consolidate then.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I mean I realize I'm talking out my ass here.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
But shouldn't there be a way where maybe you could consolidate some of the servers.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And just have a computer that runs for whatever occasional game.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
You know like combine servers.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Yeah I mean I can't imagine that like you know EA Sports MMA.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
And the reason they shut them down is because not many people are playing them right now.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
But there's still a few people playing them.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Just drop them out of servers that you have.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Drop of the one.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
You can only have one person play online at a time.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Well I mean still that's better than none at all.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
And especially for people that paid.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Just unfortunate.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Alright well anyhow here's something else that's unfortunate.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.000
And kind of along the same topic of something we were just talking about.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.000
You know the Silent Hill HD collection just recently came out.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And apparently it's getting very very mixed polarized reviews.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I haven't played it myself yet.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
So I can't say one way or the other.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
But you've got some people that are like yay it's Silent Hill it's in HD it looks great.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
And some people are like the game is fucking missing fog.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
The frame rate is hideous.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
The voice acting is terrible.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And it's gotten to the point.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I don't know if you want to call this entitlement or what.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Amazon.com is no longer stocking the game.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
That just came out two weeks ago.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Because there are too many user reports that there is a problem with the item.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
So Amazon.com is doing an investigation to see if it's problematic.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
It didn't even come out two weeks ago. It came out last week.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Oh my gosh.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
And you know what though?

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I have to agree with them as far as the fog thing goes.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Because even the art director or whatever said hey we use a lot of transparent textures for fog.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:17.000
And you can even see there's a lot of objects that don't quite go all the way.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
They're not complete objects because the fog would normally be obscuring them.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And so without the fog it looks like oh hey look I've got these telephone wires that just disappear.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
What the hell? That doesn't make any sense.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
But what's interesting I tried to go to like I wanted to see what the user feedback was.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
So I went to Amazon.com to read some of the reviews and it's still kind of divided.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And like I don't know if that's like fanboys versus you know or what it is but it's very divided.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Because for like let me go to Metacritic real fast and do Silent Hill.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Now it should be noted the PS3 one is getting more flack than the Xbox 360 one seems to be.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So just to kind of put that out there.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Yeah the user score 5.1.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Six positive reviews. Five negative reviews.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
So you have some people that are giving it tens going I don't understand why people are hating on this.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Konami says relive the two best horror games of all time, strong graphics.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.000
And then you get some people that are bombing it putting the game has far too many bugs to recommend to first timers or veterans alike.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
And it's interesting you look at the scores.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Okay eleven people have reviewed the game.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Here are the scores.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Zero. Zero. Ten. Ten. Zero. Ten. Nine. Zero.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
And it's funny is that you have.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Nobody's in the middle. They're either all the way here or all the way there.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
You have to. That's a perfect example right there of what's wrong with review scores.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And what's wrong with review scores by just average people sometimes.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Because those people are obviously fanboys.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Because a game. Trust me that game doesn't warrant a ten and it doesn't warrant a zero either.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
It's just. It's ridiculous.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Now to be fair the critics.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
The you know legitimate whatever you want to call it.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Critics. Although I think that's a shitty name.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Have given it. There's only three reviews up so far which is strange.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I thought more outlets have reviewed it.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
But you have a ninety, an eighty, and a seventy.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
So two good and one average.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I think it's been more average for sure.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I think that's what I've been reading out on the internet too.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
It's kind of like if you've never played Silent Hill.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
And the old games are too hard to get now then go ahead and play this.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
But otherwise get your PS2 and go hook up the old games because they were better.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I don't know.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Rama in chat says how the hell they fucked this game up I'll never know.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Well not putting fog in there.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
And I think was that only on the PS3 version or something like that?

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Like they were saying oh well we had trouble rendering the fog.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Why would you have trouble rendering the fog on the Playstation 3?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Here's my other concern. Why did they feel the need then to put this game out now?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
It's not like we have a shortage of Silent Hill in the world right now.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
We just had Downpour. We're gonna have the Vita game coming out.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Why does this need to be out right now?

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
And okay let's just say that...

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Go back and make it right.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Let's just say for whatever reason okay we can't do the fog.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Did anybody that was QA'ing that game realize hey it looks a little fucking weird that something that's supposed to not be there.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Or something that's supposed to be obscured by fog is just stopping in the middle of the air.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
That doesn't make any sense.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Maybe we should I don't know recreate the object or something like that instead of porting all the assets over and going.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Eh whatever close enough.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I mean seriously come on.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Just like spend the two seconds it would take to recreate the object or I don't know go back and fix it.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Was the Metal Gear collection this bad?

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
It was fuzzy looking. I didn't like the look of it.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
But I don't think it was this bad.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000
I honestly haven't seen because Dan keeps playing the MSX versions.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Does it really have the MSX games in there?

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Yes.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
In English?

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Yes.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Nice.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I think it got the Metal Gear Solid collection got good reviews.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Sg100Matt in our chatroom says it's a fucking Playstation 3 how can it not render fog?

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
That's a great question.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Why is fog on the PS3 difficult?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Fog in the same way they did it on the PS2 is probably difficult but ok.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Well take the time to redo it if you're gonna do this.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
That's exactly my problem.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Just like those fucking people at Capcom.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
They're complaining well we didn't know how to do local team play.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
In Street Fighter X2 we didn't want to bother to learn that.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Boo fucking hoo that you couldn't spend the time to figure out how to program your game.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
If you can't do any god damn programming then quit.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Because seriously you're of no use to us if you can't make a game.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Oh we had to make new assets for this game.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
You mean I couldn't just straight port the shit over and up the res the textures?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Yeah you may have to do a little bit of work.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Porkchop in our chatroom says maybe we'll have a DLC bundle.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
We'll call it the Fog and Dog Pack.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Maybe.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:03.000
AcidicVampire says maybe someone should file an issue with the Better Business Bureau and get the fog eventually implemented.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Don't give people ideas.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
But it's important to say this though.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Again the reviews were half and half.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
So not everybody's hating on it.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And Konami they've had issues with the Silent Hill series.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
They really have.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I mean.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Well Akira Yomoka going somewhere else didn't help.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Yes that's true.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I mean and it's not our show role but you know and as I mentioned weeks ago.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
The Vita version has been delayed.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000
That's right again right to May or something?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Well the rumor is May right now but I don't think there's actually a date yet for it.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Wow.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
But yeah the Vita version's been delayed.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
They have one more chance.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Konami has one more chance at this HD collection thing.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000
They've got the Zone of Enders collection coming out in the fall.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
So cross fingers.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Well if the Metal Gear 1 was pretty good and the Silent Hill 1 was not so good then maybe ZOE will be in the middle.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:04.000
And we're talking like porting different engines over.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
So maybe that has some issues.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
But come on.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Try a little harder.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:16.000
When did you think I mean come on you don't see any problem with hey you know that telephone pole just disappears.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000
You know like or hey that part of the fence is missing it just goes nowhere because you had fog obscuring it before.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It does also make me worry like if they can't render fucking fog like granted it's another company we're talking about here.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
But is that Final Fantasy 10 HD remake gonna blow?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
And it's not that they couldn't render fog they couldn't render enough fog.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Like certain textures they couldn't render.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Needs more fog.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Seriously it's like how did you fuck this up?

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Transparent textures the PS3 just can't do that.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Or Konami doesn't know how to do that.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Alright let's move into the mailbag.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Speaking of strong opinions and so forth.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and picks.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Oh she got a little sticky tonight.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Picks a few of her favorite mails to read to us here in studio.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
All two of them.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com email us.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Last year when I bought my beast video card for my PC it came with Civ 5.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Rob I'm sorry but as much as I tried I was always so bored by it.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Get out.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
But last week I found the answer.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Quick pace.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Ever since I found that little option I can't stop playing the game.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Alright you can stay.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I used to be a huge German board game player and this is a very involved board game to

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
me.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
And it was because you always talk about how great the game is.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Thank you very much for that.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Also I have a request for OLR.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
My wife of seven years just had her birthday and I was hoping that at the end of reading

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000
this email you could wish a very happy birthday to french fry.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000
As always you are an integral part of my week your loyal turtle and filly series turtle.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Happy birthday french fry.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
What if I'm more of a fan of onion rings?

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Can we give a shout out to onion rings?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Don't be a hoe.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Alright happy birthday french fry.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Happy birthday french fry.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000
I like the sea salted french fries a lot at Wendy's just saying.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Last email.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Is there any relation to french toast?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
This is me staring at Rob with a, you didn't just say that face.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
This is me recycling the happy music.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Hearts.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I'm making hearts at Rob now.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Boy not eating makes you a bitch.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Does it?

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I have lots of energy.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I've been drinking so much.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I'm just fucking with you.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:48.000
All the times by the way that I have been quiet I've been in the bathroom.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I'm doing nothing but drinking broth.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Okay.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Robert HM here.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I'm peeing nothing but broth.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
I said drinking nothing but broth.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Never mind.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Next email yes.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I never heard your thoughts on the Muppets DLC pack for LittleBigPlanet 2.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Myself I enjoyed it but haven't gotten to sit down to get everything yet.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Relatedly, is that a word relatedly?

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Sure.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.000
How do you feel about the level pack DLC for the game and possibly others staying hosted on the server?

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Such as that the levels out at the time were inaccessible during the PSN outage.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I guess the only positive is that one doesn't have to wait for hundreds of megabytes at PSN speeds to download.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
It does update the game itself though.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Or is the content now being loaded in and I have no idea what I'm writing about.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:43.000
The LittleBigPlanet stuff is generally fun but frustrating content especially trying to get all the prize items.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I actually had no idea.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Okay confession time.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
I loved LittleBigPlanet 1.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
I still haven't bought LittleBigPlanet 2.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I'm waiting for it to go on sale and every time I check it's like still like 50, 60 bucks.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Granted it's the game of the year edition that comes with all the extra stuff but I'm kind of waiting for it to get a little cheaper before I buy it.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I just totally missed it.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.000
It came out at a time when a ton of other games came out so I never got around to getting it.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:17.000
And I want to get it so I can check out this Muppets DLC and all that so I'm not going to sit here and make up an opinion on something I haven't played.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:21.000
But I'm still interested in checking it out. I'll put it that way.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
As far as the server end stuff, I had no idea that was going on.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:32.000
That's weird though. Why would you not...

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I don't get it because you either have to download it to your drive or you have to download it to play it server side even.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
It's not like it's doing an on live thing where it's streaming.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
It's like...

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
I don't think it could handle it.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000
That's weird.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:58.000
That sounds very like Final Fight Magic Sword locks you out when PSN is down type of thing to maybe prevent hacking and cracking like what we're seeing happen with Street Fighter X Tekken.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And that's...

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
You got something about that too coming up.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Sony needs to stop assuming that PSN is always going to be up because it's not.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Anyhow.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Very strange.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
So anyway. That's the last email.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Alrighty.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to send us emails in the future.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Meanwhile, Loki.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Alright. Let's talk a little bit about hacking.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Not necessarily hacking of things that some people might find controversial but fan translated stuff for example.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:49.000
For example, there's two games that recently have been kind of hacked to translate them into English because no English versions were made available.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:55.000
One of those being Tales of Vesperia on the PS3.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Tales of Vesperia of course came out on Xbox 360 in the US but never on the PS3.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:10.000
The PS3 version, which I believe was superior to the Xbox 360 version and had a lot more content to that, was available in Japan.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:25.000
So what people are doing of course is hacking the game to actually use the Xbox 360 translation to translate the text in the PS3 version and of course doing their own translation for the new content.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And it's funny enough they said that actually the Xbox 360 translated version text was actually hidden in the PS3 code because you know you don't clean up your code.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
So they're working on translating that.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:45.000
They were originally doing the Tales of Graces but since that actually did get localized over here they stopped working on that when that announcement was made.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And I guess of course they're saying that this will have a patch to the game and of course it will require you to have a jailbroken PS3 with a firmware of 3.55 or lower.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And they're going to release documentation on how to patch your game if you wish to do so.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:20.000
And then on top of that there of course is another fan translated thing that actually finished and that is Fatal Frame 4 Mask of the Lunar Eclipse has been translated into English for the Nintendo Wii.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:41.000
And there's a big ol' effort with that. Of course you have to patch a version of the game that you have dumped to an ISO or you can always download a pre-patch version and run it from your hard drive because they made it so freaking easy to do that.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000
But very interesting.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I don't usually endorse the piracy of games but if they're not going to release it here, they're not going to give you the opportunity, what other choice do you have?

02:24:52.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Exactly. And if you had it before then you might as well translate it into English so you can actually understand it. Also it should be noted that they have fully translated it into Spanish and German and French translations are about halfway done as well.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
So it's pretty interesting.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Alright. Well Microsoft has put out an interesting patent. You know we sometimes get what's coming in the gaming industry from what's going on with patents.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And Microsoft has patented this weird helmet device. It's a laser scanning virtual image display and it will display an image very close to your eyes.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Apparently by doing this the two displays could be in a helmet and you'd be able to see stereoscopic 3D. It's kind of a similar trick to what the 3DS uses except it's putting those images right in front of your freaking face.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:59.000
It doesn't necessarily mean that this is limited to video games. Remember Microsoft is a PC company as well so it could be something that's used with general PC games.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:08.000
But it could be used in aviation as stated in the patent. Maybe this is going to be like a bitchin' flight simulator add-on or what do they call it now? They changed the name.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Microsoft Flight.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.000
You know what? It's the Lawnmower Man.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Actually I remember like 20 years ago renting from the local store. Don't ask why we did this but we rented a headset VR display.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And all it was you put this headset on it fucking looked like something on Lawnmower Man. It was just a TV right in front of your eyes.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000
And it was the amazing VR display you could play Super Nintendo games on.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:43.000
They had a VR type thing over at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz and you could play versions of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:54.000
And I actually played Quake on that and it was terrible. It was like I had my eyes straight up to my PC screen and that was it.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Oh go ahead.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
I was going to say yeah it's so immersive with the 640x480 graphics.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.000
And there's a 100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrady.com brings up the Virtual Boy. It was kind of a similar gag too.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:11.000
This image may be partially transparent so you can see the world around you.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000
So that way you can play your game and this sounds like something out of a giant picture.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
It's the game from Star Trek.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
So you can see the people laughing at you.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000
No seriously from Next Generation where they had the little thing that shot lasers in their eyes. Oh.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000
So you can see the people laughing at you for wearing a giant helmet.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Oh my god Chiggers at the exact same time you said that Chiggers in chat said it's like that Star Trek Next Generation episode and everybody will be zombies.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000
You guys are both really big nerds.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.000
So.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Alright so there you go.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Before you even say oh this is the next Xbox.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000
No.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Sit down. It's not.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
No we've been down that territory.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
OMG Microsoft Portable.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
No.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Sit down.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:56.000
You know that Wii prototype or the one that was fake would have been pretty fucking awesome.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Mm hmm.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
VR.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
DarkSakura what do you have for us.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Well as mentioned earlier Capcom is cracking down.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Basically a statement and I actually did read this on the Capcom Unity forums.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:18.000
But they're talking about people using the download character.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000
The downloadable characters on disk using hacked Xboxes.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And one of the big guys at Capcom Unity said quite ballsy for folks to be taking hacked Xbox 360s on live where they are detectable.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:38.000
And they're also saying in any event we have open channels of communication with Microsoft on these issues Friday night.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.000
And then they started asking people to take screenshots and record videos of the offenders.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000
But they closed the video and said oh we'll catch them ourselves.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000
They do realize that you can't take screenshots of a fucking Xbox 360 right?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Yes you can.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Well you can if you're a developer.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:58.000
But what if you have one of those capture cards?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Okay well that's a capture card but I'm talking about like you can't just.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
It's not like the Vita where I can push two buttons and take a screenshot.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
And it wouldn't.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000
And there's iPhones and cameras.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.000
And we wouldn't have this problem if they didn't put the DLC on the fucking disk.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I agree.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000
And this smells a lot like CD Projekt Red a few months ago.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
We're gonna catch those hackers.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
And we're gonna let the hackers go.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.000
They're gonna be Batman. I'm Batman.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Well I mean I do agree with the point that you gotta be pretty bold to play this shit online.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Again it's kinda that gamer mentality you see sometimes.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And some gamers where it's like I gotta be the first and I gotta I'm gonna show these guys online that my penis is the biggest.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000
And I'm using characters you're not supposed to have.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
You know it's a little bit silly.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Look at my E-Pain.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Exactly.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.000
But it's kind of a dumb thing to take it online where you know they're watching.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I like what Chigurh says. I will hit you with a coelacanth.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000
I'm moving on.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Logie.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:09.000
So this is I'm sure a disappointment to some of the people who are actually playing.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:15.000
But Zynga has purchased the company OMG Pop. The makers of the game Draw Something.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.000
And of course they purchased them for quite a bit of money.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Including approximately $200 million between I guess a cash deal and $30 million or so for employee retention payments.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And of course you know they're gonna be working with them to create some new games I guess.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
In related news I deleted Draw Something this week.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I was playing it pretty hardcore for a little bit. I had like 15 games going at once. It was crazy.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
And I said nope I'm done.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:53.000
By the way there's another iPhone app you might want to check out if you are in the same boat I am.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
It's called Sharadium.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000
C-H-A-R-A-D-I-U-M.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.000
It was free at least for a little bit. I don't know if it still is but you can check it out.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Now before you go saying well Rob if you don't like Zynga because they rip games off.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Why are you recommending another game that's a rip off of Draw Something?

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Because it is a little bit different. It's not like a direct rip off.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Unfortunately one of the best parts of the game which is the whole Wheel of Fortune round isn't really in there.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000
It's more of a chat type guessing thing.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:26.000
But there's more paint styles and it's more of a robust paint program than Draw Something was.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
You don't have to pay for extra colors and shit.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
You have to pay for extra colors?

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Oh yeah and Draw Something if you wanted more than just red. What was it? Red, blue, yellow and black were the only colors you could use.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:44.000
If you wanted green and purple you either saved up enough tokens from winning games or you had to pay 99 cents to get them.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
That's hilarious.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Oh yeah and I knew people that had tons of colors.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Well it's sad.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
You know what? Your money spent by which you won.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
And you know what though?

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Until Zynga knew I spent 99 cents buying the legit add free Draw Something.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Because I'm like this is a great new game I want to support this.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
And then this happened.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Honestly I can't fault some of the employees at Zynga because they're just working but it's obviously the higher ups.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
It's the ones that are making the decisions.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
The executives.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I actually have some friends that work at Zynga and there's some really talented people which I'm like what are you doing working at Zynga but hey whatever.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Well it's just like how we talk about GameStop.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I know lots of people that work at GameStop that are great people and they're just people trying to get by and make a living.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I don't have a problem in the world with people that work at GameStop.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.000
You know and I even will go so far as to say they have some of the toughest jobs in the world and I respect that.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:46.000
It's some of the decisions that are made at a corporate level at GameStop that I have a huge problem with.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Yeah.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
That's the issue.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000
So you know I imagine it's a similar situation.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Why else do you think that Dan keeps getting class action lawsuit checks after he hasn't been working there for six years?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Wow.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Just saying.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Very interesting.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
I want some class action lawsuit checks.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
How do I get in on that?

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Work for GameStop.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Well they might try to go the other way around and sue me.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Alright.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Anyhow one more story for you guys tonight and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but not just yet.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.000
We have one more story for you guys tonight and it's another fucking Kickstarter.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
This is a trend.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I'm not liking this trend.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I'm just going to say it's just too much.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Everybody in the world wants a piece of this Kickstarter thing and it's like I'm sorry.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.000
It's kind of like those that got in on it early like the double fine and stuff.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Good for them but now it's just getting old.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:47.000
However there may be some folks that are really into this so good for you guys.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Tex Murphy may make a comeback.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Big Finish Games is going to start up a Kickstarter page on May 15th.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.000
That seems weird to me that you'd announce like six weeks in advance.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:05.000
We're going to start a Kickstarter but alright they're going to round up funding for a sixth game in this Full Motion Video Adventure series.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Oh God I remember these games.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Wow.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:15.000
On May 15th they're going to go live and you can donate to all this and the guy who plays Tex Murphy is on board.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And you can actually see him in a YouTube video where they're actually trying to kind of hawk the whole Kickstarter event.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:32.000
So I don't know it's like I don't want to hate Kickstarter but I just hate the trend thing is what it is.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000
And I don't hate every campaign on Kickstarter but there's some that are pretty gross.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
But I've already talked about that on a previous episode.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:47.000
There's one in particular I saw that was downright offensive and I think people who contributed to it.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I think in some ways got suckered and swindled but that's your choice, your money.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Anyhow let's move on to happier topics or maybe worse topics.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:04.000
It's all up to you guys in the hands of the listeners because the Skype line is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Alright and going to our chatroom ddrdollarbill says I like the Tex Murphy games.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I'm not saying they were bad games.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:19.000
It's just this trend is a little strange and I'm not a big fan of this.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Alright so going to our Twitter while we wait for some calls.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Again it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Going to the Twitter we have gamergirl who tweeted us and says I need to get a new TV.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Anyone got any recommendations as far as price and model goes?

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I miss my games, cries.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
I'm pretty happy with our Panasonic.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Toshiba makes good ones too.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000
If you've got fries in town go to fries.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I have specials all the damn time.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Yeah don't buy anything on impulse.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
It's so hard for me to recommend you a specific TV gamergirl.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Do not get a plasma.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Get an LCD.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
It's so hard for me to recommend a TV gamergirl because I don't know what type of setup you have.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Do you have a gigantic living room that you want a gigantic TV to fill?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Or do you want something for your bedroom that maybe you're not going to be able to use the living room an awful lot.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Like if you want a bedroom TV and it's specifically for gaming because you said I miss my games.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Maybe you should look into that Playstation monitor that's out.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I hear it's not terrible and you could do the whole 3D games if you have the consoles to support it.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.000
But if you don't really have a Playstation 3 then that TV is kind of a waste.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:36.000
So something to think about. Again if you're going for a bedroom TV why not go for a computer monitor?

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:41.000
You can get a cable that will hook an Xbox 360 up to the computer monitor.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:44.000
As well as a Playstation 3 can hook up to a computer monitor right?

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000
With a particular cable. Am I correct in that?

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.000
In Japan.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
HDMI?

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
HDMI yes it can hook up to a monitor.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Well HDMI you can hook it up through an HDMI to DVI adapter.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Otherwise they sell a device or they sell an actual cable in Japan that will do it.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
That I'm sure will work with the USPS3s.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room suggests Vizio. Best bang for the buck.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000
That's actually what we have. I'm happy with the Vizio. That's the way to do it.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Rama says Samsung. Best TVs ever. Chigurh says Sony Bravia all the way.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:29.000
So gamer girl it's really hard when we don't know your circumstance and your budget to pinpoint one correct TV.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000
But do your research. Do your research online. Read reader reviews.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Don't go to the store on a whim and let the sales guy know.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Yeah I need to get a new TV because I can't play games anymore.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Because they are going to try to take it to the cleaners.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Because they're going to know you need a new TV.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.000
And they're going to be like oh this chick's not going to leave for that one.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.000
It's like shopping for a car.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Yeah exactly. So...

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Don't be afraid to say no and don't let them know you want it.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Exactly.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
And don't buy a plasma.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Well now some folks in the chat room disagree with you.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Legend of Zaku says get a plasma. Very little lag.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Chigurh agrees though saying plasma hurts my eyes.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Niche or niche I don't know how to say that.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:14.000
It says plasma is better than LCD. WTF.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Disagree because with plasma you can also deal with more burn in in some cases.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I would say also Gamer Girl go to the store and kind of look at the TVs.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Especially a place where you're less likely to get hounded like Best Buy or even like Target.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Good with a furniture store.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Or Walmart even.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Oh furniture? I never thought to get TVs at a furniture store.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.000
RC Willy.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
So yeah go to a place where you're less likely to get hounded and just kind of look.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
And go oh I like the look of this.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Because then you can make your own decision on plasma versus LCD.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Maybe you'll look at a plasma and go I want this.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
And then you know you can.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
So I would do that.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I think a Target or a Walmart is a great place to look.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Because you're not going to get hounded by salesmen.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
You don't have to buy. Just look.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
In fact the TVs at Walmart are probably not.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I mean they're cheap for a reason. Remember that.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000
I actually super agree with Technus.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.000
If you have a membership to Costco, Sam's Club or BJ's.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
I recommend them because of the return policies.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Agree agree agree.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I think the best place in the world actually.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
And here we go with advertisements.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
But I'm saying it because I believe it.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I think the best place in the world to get a TV is Costco.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Because their return policy.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
It used to be a lot more generous than it is now.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Oh my God I had a TV break like two years after I bought it.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
And Costco took it back. I was astounded.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.000
They did that with us. They didn't have our model anymore.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000
So we traded it in from a 58 inch to a 52 inch.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
And paid just another hundred bucks.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Me too. I was astounded.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.000
So I don't think their policy is as generous anymore.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
You have to have a receipt now.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Yeah. But yeah.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Just the price and the fact you don't get hounded.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.000
And the selection I think is a great place to try it.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Alright anyhow.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Wow the phone's not ringing.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I hope it's working. 1877 game OLR.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Our username on Skype is orangeontradio.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Or the listeners are just being shy tonight.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
That's okay. That happens sometimes.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.000
It might have also just been a little bit of a slow news week.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
You know what I mean? Sometimes that happens.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Yeah. Why don't you just call and ask me a question people.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Dar Sakura wants attention.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I'm just checking.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
No. I'm just trying to get some life into the phone line.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I'm checking to make sure the 800 number is actually working.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Because it's been having some problems lately.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Yeah it's working.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000
There it is.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000
People who've got problems.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Alright. Anyhow.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Let's move on to a couple more tweets.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:44.000
We have Tiger Claw links us to a story about NASA helped with Angry Birds Space.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Oh yeah. That came out.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
I forgot.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
But Angry Birds Space did come out.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:56.000
And apparently NASA collaborated in this with what's called a Space Act Agreement.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Why does NASA team up with this?

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:03.000
It saw an opportunity to teach kids about space, science, and the laws of physics.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And considering that NASA's kind of taken some hits lately with funding and all that,

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I can see why they'd want to get on board with this.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.000
And you know, if I was a kid, I'd be really into this I think.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So I think this is actually a good thing.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
I can't hate on this.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000
A comment from, what is this?

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Space Station Trajectory Operations Officer.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:32.000
It's a great way to demonstrate how we can use trajectories to get from one place to another.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:37.000
It's a really good example of how interplanetary probes can take gravity assets from other,

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.000
or gravity assists, excuse me, from other planets.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Alright, hey, our phone line's lighting up now.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I think your hemming and hawing worked, Dark Soccer.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
We got a call.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Hi, this is Zach Deff.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Hey, Zach Deff. What's up, buddy?

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Just checking if Skype works.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Yes, thank you. It does work. We're good.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Well, what's on your mind? What have you been playing lately?

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Not much, really. I have been playing mostly Team Fortress 2 on Steam and Forza 4.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Forza 4?

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Yeah.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Forza, that's a series I never really got into because it's a little too pro for me,

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.000
but what do you like about Forza 4?

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Forza, pretty much, it's pretty much like Gran Turismo in the simulation sense.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:32.000
It's very precise, and when you have to accelerate turns and all that, it's like driving a real car.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:42.000
But the thing that Forza has as a series is that it has an arcade feel rather than a simulation feel.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Are you a car guy in real life? Do you like to mod cars and kind of pimp your ride and all that?

02:42:49.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Somewhat. I do like cars, though I don't know that much to mod or modify cars like that,

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:06.000
but I am a car aficionado in real life, so I do know some stuff.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Okay, so yeah, I just kind of notice usually the people that get into these games are car aficionados,

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
and there's nothing wrong with that. Cars can be very sexy machines, even I recognize that.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:20.000
I don't necessarily drive a state-of-the-art car, but I even parked next to a guy today.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.000
I'm like, that's a sexy car. If I had more money, I'd want that car.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:35.000
But yeah, something that Forza has, it doesn't feel like a simulation at all.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:41.000
You have all the customization, you can paint your car, you can tune it out,

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:47.000
and you can pretty much do everything with your car, and it also drives like a real car.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:53.000
But like I said, the moment you're playing the game, it doesn't feel like a simulation.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.000
It doesn't feel like Gran Turismo, where the races are hard because you have to make very precise turns and all that.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:11.000
And even though you have, but like I said, you have a lot of options that make it feel like an arcade racer rather than a simulation.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:18.000
I was going to say, are you a fan of arcade racers, like the split seconds, the blurs, the burnouts of the world?

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Yeah, I'm a fan of both types of games, really, though I do mostly play arcade racers like Ridge Racer, the Dirt series, and all that.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Then tell me, am I right or am I right? F-Zero needs to be a Wii U launch title.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Oh yeah, it does.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Thank you very much. That's another series I need Nintendo to bring back from the dead.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Although, speaking of series coming back from the dead, don't forget Kid Icarus came out this week,

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.000
and I've got it sitting in a box in my room, I haven't been able to play it yet, I've been kind of busy this weekend.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Yeah, I've been hearing that, that's pretty good.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:45:01.000
I'm hearing, I was talking to Shane earlier about it, and he says the game's got a great sense of humor, he says he's reminded of Earthbound in the sense of humor,

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
and I'm like, ooh, that's a big name to invoke around Nintendo.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.000
But that's pretty cool if it's got that sense of humor to it.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
No, that will be all.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Alright, well take care buddy, have a good one.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
You too, thanks.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Bye.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I should have asked if he was into Mario Kart too, because Mario Kart's kind of a racer that's a little bit toned down so everybody can get into it.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:37.000
You know what I played randomly not that long ago was Mario Kart on the Wii again, I hadn't played that in forever, but it's still alright.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:43.000
One other tweet here from Tigerclaw at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, where you guys can send us tweets every week.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Scammers attempt to trick fans with promise of new Mass Effect 3 endings.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Oh, this is terrible. God, there's always scammers that read the gaming sites and seem to figure out what's going on.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Like, you see this with Blizzard all the time.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Like, how Mists of Pandaria Beta just came out this week, which, funny enough, I can't believe I didn't bring it up on the show.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Maybe because there's, you know, Horde House, the whole other show I have for that stuff.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.000
But yeah, the Mists of Pandaria Beta just started out of the fucking blue this week, which is a pretty big deal.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.000
But of course, scammers want to get in on that and try to rip off, you know,

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Congratulations, you're in the Mists of Pandaria Beta. Click here to give us all your information so you can download the client, like your credit card number.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
And some people, unfortunately, fall for it.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Well, it's happening with the Mass Effect 3 ending stuff.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:29.000
I'll come back to the story in a minute, but we have another call coming in.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Hey, Ranma, what's up?

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Not too much, not too much. How about you, good friend?

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Same old, same old. Just working, sleeping, playing Mass Effect.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Uh-huh, Mass Effect, I see that.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Yeah, what's on your mind?

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Not too much, I was pondering to call and see if you have played Kid Icarus yet,

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Because I'm more or less waiting on your review of the game before I go out and buy it,

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.000
But from the last call, you haven't popped it open yet, so I'm kind of anxious about it.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Oh, god, I will have a review next week, I promise.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:07.000
I did buy it, I took a leap of faith and bought it.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:13.000
I got it on Amazon, which is kind of funny, because I ended up getting, like, it was $39.99, right?

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:19.000
They refunded me ten bucks, because I guess Best Buy or somebody else put it out cheaper,

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.000
So they have that whole, if it comes out cheaper somewhere else, we'll refund your money.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:30.000
That would kind of explain why I could not find it in Best Buy the last couple of days,

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Because I just decided to walk in and check, just out of idle curiosity, nope, didn't have it.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Well, that means it's selling, which I guess is a good sign.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
I would like for the series to come back.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I'm hoping the game doesn't suck, but the general consensus I'm reading on the internet is that the game is pretty damn good,

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:54.000
But the controls are so bad, it ruins it for some people.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Like, there's a reason the game came with the little stand.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.000
That's kind of the general consensus I'm hearing, which is a little bit alarming.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.000
If the controls are that bad, it's going to ruin the game.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:12.000
But it's good enough to further explore the concept, is kind of what I'm getting.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Ah, okay, I get it. I get it now.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.000
There's also the 3D re-release of the original Kid Icarus.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Apparently, it's not just the ROM.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000
I mean, this isn't a huge deal, but they went and added backgrounds, I guess, into it.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.000
So they did kind of give it a little something, something they didn't have before.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:36.000
That sounds interesting, because I'm kind of reminded of the times I used to sit there and play the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Oh yeah, the kind of overlooked sequel that really did come out, yeah.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:48.000
You know, I was reading some people hating on Kid Icarus this week, because they were saying it wasn't that good of a game.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And, oh god, that makes my heart hurt every time I read it, because I loved it.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.000
But it was a hard-as-nails game.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:00.000
It was a really hard game, and it did have some weird, quirky stuff in it.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000
But, and it tried to do a lot.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Like, I think they kind of stretched themselves thin with, suddenly, it's a vertical scroller.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Now, it's a side scroller. Now, it's a dungeon crawler. Now, it's a shooter.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
You know what I mean?

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
That's a bit of a mindfuck if you think about it.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:23.000
It is, but, I mean, for a child who was, you know, 8 years old with mild ADD, it was great.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Pretty much.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Maybe that's why it holds my attention so well.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Since we're on the topic of 3DS games, I'll make this quick before I bounce off.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I finally got around to playing Super Mario 3D Land.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Ooh, what'd you think?

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Okay, I kept saying that I want a 3D version of Super Mario 3.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.000
That's what I've been screaming for.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:49.000
And this game pretty much comes close to my inner Super Mario 3 fandom.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
It comes close.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
It's really good.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.000
I really think people don't give it enough credit for what it's doing to the franchise as a whole.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I think it's really good.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:05.000
I mean, one of my main issues with the game is that all the levels are straightforward.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I thought maybe you'd be able to go to 1-1 and 1-2.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
You could just go down another direction, go to 1-4, this and that.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Oh, like in Mario 64, kind of?

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:17.000
No, more like for the way it was in the original Mario 3.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Oh, I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Have you finished the game yet or no?

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I've fake finished it.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I don't want to say too much for spoiler reasons.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Okay.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Let me put it this way. It's got a Symphony of the Night-esque thing going on.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
Yeah, I know.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
I'm playing through the game.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:41.000
In the back of my mind, I'm like, I can't believe I'm going through the levels the way I am.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:45.000
It's like the difficulty kind of jumps around.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:52.000
And then at that last section, I thought it was done and then this whole more of it pops up.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:55.000
I'm like, Nintendo, what the fuck?

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Exactly.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000
What the fuck?

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Yeah, right.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
But that's great.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
That's great.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.000
It's not often that games kind of invoke that feeling that you got when you realized,

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:10.000
oh my God, Symphony of the Night, I'm not even halfway done.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.000
That's awesome.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
That's all I got to say is just...

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Well, good luck.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:23.000
And you know, if you do well enough, you might get to be Black Luigi playing Luigi.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
I've already gotten to that part.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Okay.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:33.000
I like how they redid Luigi. I like that.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
It's more playable.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.000
All right. Anything else before we let you go tonight?

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
No, that's it.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:43.000
You too.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Bye.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Agdeft in our chat room says, Rob, it's a Mario game.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Do we really need spoiler alerts for it?

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Well, look, I'm just trying to be nice.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.000
All right.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
We have another call coming in.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Who's this?

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
This is Shane.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Hey, you've been calling a lot lately.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:56.000
What's up?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:01.000
I know, because I stay up later for some reason, which is probably why I fail at work more

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.000
often than not.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.000
It's all good.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
This show's important, damn it.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Totally.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000
What's on your mind?

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.080
Well, I will say, first of all, this week I won't talk about Mass Effect, because I'm

02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:18.920
pretty sick of both fanatics on each side, and it's just disgusting me at this point.

02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:22.400
But I will call and talk about Kid Icarus.

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:25.160
Ah, that's what our last caller wanted to know about.

02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:27.520
What do you think about Kid Icarus?

02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:28.520
It's fantastic.

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:33.320
The way they pace the game with the terrible control scheme, because let's just be honest,

02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:40.380
if a game makes you hurt your hands while playing on purpose, it's got a terrible control

02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:42.680
scheme.

02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:48.820
But the writing is so good, and I think the Earthbound comparison that I gave to you earlier

02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:56.100
is spot on, because it's witty, it's stupidly cheesy, it makes terrible puns, and it breaks

02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:59.120
the fourth wall constantly.

02:52:59.120 --> 02:53:00.120
That's pretty cool.

02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:06.240
Maybe that's because Nintendo is, for whatever reason, and this makes me hurt to say, please

02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:11.400
don't be mad at me, fanboys, but maybe since Nintendo's kind of abandoned the Mother franchise,

02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:17.280
maybe they're bringing Kid Icarus in as kind of their, you know, silly.

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:19.200
Or do you think it's just because it's for four year olds?

02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:22.000
I think it's because it's made by Sakurai, is why.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Anything?

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Yeah.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Alright.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.680
Well, he's got a great sense of humor, then, because...

02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:32.680
To be fair, in the interest of full disclosure, you're a big fan of Power Rangers and Pokemon.

02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:33.680
Yes.

02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:37.440
So, maybe the game's aimed at children.

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:41.720
I don't know, when one of the lines is, it's like a birthday party where everybody's trying

02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:44.720
to kill me, I don't feel like that's really Pokemon.

02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:46.360
Hey, Shane.

02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:47.360
Yes.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:51.720
Quick spoiler, because I forgot to talk about this last week during the segment that doesn't

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:52.720
exist.

02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:53.720
Which game are you spoiling?

02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:56.840
Oh, real quick, I was just gonna say, hey, I bet you don't know that there's a Kinect

02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:01.400
version of Power Rangers Samurai coming out later this year.

02:54:01.400 --> 02:54:04.720
You mean the game I feel the urge to pre-order now?

02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:05.720
Yes.

02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:10.960
Because I will totally morph and punch things in the air.

02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:11.960
That's awesome.

02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:16.960
You know, I played the crap out of the Super Nintendo one.

02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:18.360
Oh yeah, that was great.

02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:19.360
That one was awesome.

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.760
That was a really good beat-em-up.

02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:25.600
And there was a Die Ranger game that came out in Japan that I had the ROM for that I

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:27.360
played the hell out of.

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:28.360
I bet that was pretty good too.

02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:29.360
It was really good.

02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:33.200
The only one I was kind of disappointed in when I played it besides, you know, the newer

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:36.600
stuff they put out was the fighting game on Genesis.

02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:38.840
Oh, that was painful.

02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.240
Have you already pre-ordered Black and White 2?

02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.680
I almost did from Playasia for the Japanese copies.

02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:47.880
Our chat room flailed at the mention of Pokemon.

02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:48.880
Pokemon!

02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.400
Well yeah, because everybody should be excited about that.

02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:58.220
And not to cross-promote shows or whatever, but I'm sure on Horthouse we'll talk about

02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:05.440
this week, they datamined some of the pet battle stuff and it shows what's weak to what,

02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.280
what's strong against what in some of the new attacks.

02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:13.080
So Pokemon in World of Warcraft is just going to make my day.

02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:15.440
That is pretty awesome, I gotta say.

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:18.960
It's both the dumbest thing I've ever heard and the most awesome thing I've ever heard.

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.720
It's like a movie that's so bad it's good.

02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:26.280
Yeah pretty much, and I will be doing that all the time.

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:30.600
It's going to take away from leveling, which is kind of sad.

02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.040
So gosh, what else do I ask you about?

02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:35.560
So thank you for the plug for Horthouse, that's good, we always try to cross-promote the shows.

02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:40.440
And Kid Icarus, so you think Kid Icarus, because Rama said he's waiting for my review to check

02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:44.920
it out, but you're saying don't bother, just go get it, and you can play the game in ten

02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:48.720
minute bursts, so that way when your hand starts wanting to die, you can take a break

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:49.720
and it's okay.

02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:55.840
Yeah, and I really like the way they scale the difficulty for you.

02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:02.640
There's no hard easy mode, there's this bar and you wager hearts, and by wagering hearts

02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:07.720
you get better rewards, and the more hearts you wager, the harder the game gets.

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:11.640
So if you lose, you lose a whole bunch of hearts, but if you beat it, you get better

02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:13.880
rewards, and the difficulty just skyrockets.

02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:21.240
I almost died wagering to a 4.2 level difficulty, it was pretty hard.

02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:23.120
Is the eggplant wizard in the game?

02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:28.320
Yes, and that was one of my favorite puns in the entire game so far, and I'm gonna ruin

02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:30.520
it because I don't care, because it was so good.

02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:36.160
So there's lots of back and forth dialogue in the game, and it constantly happens, there's

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:41.220
no cutscene for it, it's just you're fighting and oh, Palutena and Pit have to talk the

02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:42.400
entire time.

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:48.320
So she's like, oh, remember the eggplant wizard and the nurses, and it previously would heal

02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:49.320
you?

02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.160
And he was like, or Pit was like, yeah, I went there so often they named it after me,

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:54.160
and she's like, what?

02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:56.840
And he's like, hospital, get it?

02:56:56.840 --> 02:56:57.840
Hospital.

02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:01.600
Oh my god, that is terrible.

02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:02.720
Isn't it?

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.460
But it's just so funny when you're playing it, it's like, are you kidding me?

02:57:07.460 --> 02:57:08.460
This is great.

02:57:08.460 --> 02:57:10.160
And it's all voice acted, right?

02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:12.440
Yeah, there's not any text.

02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:15.520
Oh, there's text, but I mean, it's all dialogue voice stuff.

02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:18.240
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:22.840
Or when you are scaling a wall in one of the flying stages, and there's enemies pouring

02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:26.800
down on you, and you beat them all and you get to the top, Pit's like, yeah, take that

02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:27.800
wall.

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:29.880
I'm like, that sounds like something I would say.

02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:32.320
That is something you would say, actually, very much.

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:35.480
That also sounds like something Dan would say.

02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:37.400
It does, it does.

02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:41.720
Any online-ish components, StreetPass, SpotPass, any of that?

02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.640
Yeah, it does have, I believe, an online multiplayer, a local multiplayer.

02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:55.560
I haven't done them yet, because I'm only to world four or five, because I fell asleep.

02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:56.960
And then went back to playing Mass Effect.

02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:00.960
Yes, and then I went back to playing Mass Effect.

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:05.320
It sounds like, from everything I've read, the multiplayer is really fun, and a lot of

02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:11.320
the sort of high-risk, high-reward stuff happens in that too, because if you take, I guess,

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:16.800
one of your better weapons into multiplayer, if you, when you take a good weapon in there,

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:22.480
you take, you have a lower health bar, so it expects, if you have a good weapon, you're

02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:27.640
going to be a better player, and I think that's really cool, because if I'm going to have

02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:31.440
a god weapon, I should only have a little bit of health, because I earned that weapon.

02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:32.440
All right.

02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:35.960
Well, we've got to let you go to wrap up the show, but quickly, I know you said you weren't

02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:39.680
going to bring up Mass Effect, but I just have to ask one Mass Effect-related question.

02:58:39.680 --> 02:58:40.680
Yes, game's hot.

02:58:40.680 --> 02:58:41.680
Jack is the greatest character ever.

02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:42.680
There you go, answer.

02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:43.680
Yes or yes?

02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:44.680
What?

02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:46.280
Sorry, say it again.

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:47.720
Jack is the greatest character ever.

02:58:47.720 --> 02:58:48.720
Yes or yes?

02:58:48.720 --> 02:58:49.720
No.

02:58:49.720 --> 02:58:50.720
Don't lie to listeners.

02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:51.720
But I do like Jack better in two.

02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:52.720
I mean, three.

02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:53.720
Don't lie to listeners.

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:54.720
All right.

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:55.720
All right, have a good one.

02:58:55.720 --> 02:58:56.720
Shane.

02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:57.720
You too.

02:58:57.720 --> 02:58:58.720
All right, bye.

02:58:58.720 --> 02:58:59.720
Bye.

02:58:59.720 --> 02:59:00.720
That'll do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:01.720
Thanks to those guys that got through.

02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:05.680
It was a little slow to begin, but then it started to fill up there at the end, so don't

02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:06.680
be shy next week.

02:59:06.680 --> 02:59:07.680
You guys can get through.

02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:09.520
I've heard from some of my favorite people today.

02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:10.760
Oh?

02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:11.760
On the Skype.

02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:12.760
Oh, on the Skype line, yeah.

02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:13.760
Oh, I thought you were-

02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:14.760
I'm especially...

02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:20.120
I'm pleased slash angry with Shane, because of all of the music that I got in trouble

02:59:20.120 --> 02:59:24.680
for buying on Amazon after being in a turntable with him.

02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:26.840
Oh, you guys turntabling this week?

02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:29.320
We did two nights ago.

02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:30.320
Nice.

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:31.320
Yeah.

02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:36.200
I don't remember because I can't remember anything, but I got in trouble for all those

02:59:36.200 --> 02:59:37.600
music I downloaded.

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:40.840
I have good music, yay, but I'm poor boo.

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:45.920
There is an unofficial official turntable FM after party for Orange Launch Radio that

02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:48.720
Hitstun puts together, so it's kind of one of those.

02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:50.160
We endorse it.

02:59:50.160 --> 02:59:52.400
It's not us doing it, but we endorse it.

02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:53.560
I love turntable FM.

02:59:53.560 --> 02:59:54.560
It's a great site.

02:59:54.560 --> 03:00:00.240
It's one of the greatest things to happen to music in a long time since iTunes.

03:00:00.240 --> 03:00:05.720
All right, anyhow, I want to quickly say I never finished up the tweet from earlier that

03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:08.040
TigerClaw sent us, the whole scamming thing.

03:00:08.040 --> 03:00:13.240
The new scam is Mass Effect 3, and there is a spam email going out, and I can't believe

03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:16.000
people are falling for this, but unfortunately it's working.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:21.440
You download a zip file containing a password-protected downloader for the supposed new ending, and

03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:26.720
a text file in the zip tells you to go to a website where you do offers to get the ending.

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:28.960
I mean, this is shady as hell, right?

03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:30.440
So don't fall for this stuff.

03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:33.280
And then I'm sure the executable is a virus.

03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:36.560
If something legit happens, it will be all over the internet.

03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:42.440
We'll not only report on it here on the show, but if you can't wait until Sunday, just seriously.

03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:44.080
The Mass Effect 3 stuff has been so big.

03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:45.080
I don't know.

03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:46.560
That sounds kind of legit to me.

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:49.720
I see stories on my news.google.com.

03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:55.440
I used to kind of get the aggregate news a lot, and Mass Effect 3 is always in the technology

03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:57.440
stories.

03:00:57.440 --> 03:01:01.960
Anyhow, that's it.

03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:02.960
That's it for calls.

03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:06.080
That's it for tweets, and I think that's it for another episode of OLR.

03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:09.920
Quickly, though, before we wrap it up and say good night, I need to ask if there's any

03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:10.920
last-minute stories.

03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:13.480
Dark Soccer, Loki, any last-minute stories you want to get out tonight?

03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:14.480
No.

03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:17.760
Nothing I want to get out.

03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:22.440
Do you have a day on chat that says it's happening for the Guild Wars 2 beta, too?

03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:23.440
That's unfortunate.

03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:25.080
I really wish I was getting in that beta.

03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:30.320
Well, maybe you'll get your zip file executable, and then you can download the password from

03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:31.320
a website.

03:01:31.320 --> 03:01:32.320
Stop.

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:33.320
Stop.

03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:34.320
All right.

03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:37.240
Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:40.560
Dark Soccer, what's your final thought for the listeners tonight?

03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:42.280
I want pizza.

03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:44.320
Wait, we can't do final thoughts.

03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:45.320
You know what?

03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:46.320
We skipped something.

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:47.320
What?

03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:48.320
We never did the FUs of the Week.

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:49.320
Fuck.

03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:56.880
I'm just not angsty, Rob.

03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:04.800
Well you can do a thank you, or bless you, or whatever you call it.

03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:07.800
Actually, I do have a fuck you.

03:02:07.800 --> 03:02:14.120
To the guy who is setting up the booth outside of Walmart that said get rid of Obama, vote

03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:19.280
Republican, with a very poorly handwritten sign, first of all.

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:24.160
If you want to draw the right attention, you need a better designed sign, just saying.

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:30.000
Two, don't vote in Satan to get rid of a guy who's doing good, just saying, even if you

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:31.000
don't like him.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:38.560
Don't vote in the devil, because, seriously, they're all evil, evil, evil, evil.

03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:42.280
And a fuck you to my stomach for rumbling, I'm going to have to put some more tea in

03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:44.520
you when I get home.

03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:45.520
I like fasting.

03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:48.040
I really do feel great, except I'm hungry.

03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:49.040
That's it.

03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:50.040
Logie?

03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:59.400
Um, I guess, uh, I have to be tired, because I've had to work hard the last few days because

03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:07.520
I've had to watch Josh instead of going to work and give me at least a lunch break.

03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:14.240
My a few of the week goes to internet drama, because it's very, very serious.

03:03:14.240 --> 03:03:15.240
The internet's serious business.

03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:23.960
It is serious business, and our lives depend on internet drama.

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:27.840
Porkchop in our chat says orange launch radio is linked to aggressive and violent hosts.

03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:28.840
Possibly.

03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:33.680
All right, uh, last minute, or excuse me, now our final thoughts, because we did last

03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:34.680
minute stories.

03:03:34.680 --> 03:03:35.680
Final thoughts.

03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:36.680
So Darkstalker, you get another go at it.

03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:37.680
What's your final thought?

03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:38.680
Tea.

03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:42.080
Uh, my final thought of the night is broccoli beef.

03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:43.960
Logie, your final thought tonight?

03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:48.440
Uh, there are a lot of good projects on Kickstarter, so be sure to check out Kickstarter, but there

03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:53.800
are a lot that seem, you just have to look at it and how professionally it's being approached

03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:58.680
and stuff, and some of them are quite sickening to the amount of money that they raised for

03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:04.700
what they've raised it for and for how long those certain things were going for prior

03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:09.360
to putting a Kickstarter up, if you know what I mean.

03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:12.760
I think that's as vague as I can get.

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:17.720
All right, and, uh, let's see, my final thought tonight, oh no, I did my final thought.

03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:18.720
Hello.

03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:20.360
Sorry, I got distracted by chat.

03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:23.360
But I will say this, this is the segment I always say at the end of every show, it's

03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:25.400
the final final thought from all of us.

03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:30.220
If you like Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show, leave

03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:33.280
us a nice review somewhere, spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:36.880
You know, we do this show commercial free because we love the community, that's what

03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:40.600
it's all about, so all we ask in exchange, help our community grow.

03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:45.800
I've seen a lot of you guys give us links on your blogs, that's awesome, I've seen little

03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:50.840
signatures on sites, somebody inevitably on every forum ever starts a what podcast do

03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:55.240
you listen to thread, and people kind of say, I listen to OLR, and that's awesome, we appreciate

03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:56.240
all of that.

03:04:56.240 --> 03:04:59.800
So please, please help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:04.120
That's it for tonight, guys, we'll be back to do it all again next week, right?

03:05:04.120 --> 03:05:08.600
It's a new month, it's going to be April next week, so crazy, crazy.

03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:12.240
And remember, portal gun for me for my birthday, just saying.

03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:13.240
Yeah, that's right.

03:05:13.240 --> 03:05:17.100
Dark Stalker's birthday is in April, so what can I say, it's going to be a crazy month,

03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:20.800
so we'll see you next week to do it all again here at Orange Launch Radio, have a great

03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:21.800
