0	20680	Tonight, March 11th, 2012, a new iPad claims to do something Xbox and PlayStation can't.
20680	31720	One UK retailer is in financial trouble, and could the next Xbox be disc drive free?
31720	34880	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34880	38700	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38700	45380	We are live with episode number 449 of our show for this March 11th of 2012.
45380	49040	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
49040	52040	say hello to, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
52040	53040	Ugh.
53040	54040	How are you?
54040	55040	Full.
55040	56040	Full.
56040	57040	Full of orange chicken I see.
57040	58040	Yes.
58040	59040	One of my weaknesses.
59040	62160	Because my DNA compelled me to eat it.
62160	64880	Panda Express is like Starbucks around here.
64880	65880	There's a crack.
65880	68760	There's a place like, there's literally, you can go to a mall and there's Panda Express
68760	74200	in the food court, and then right next door, in the other mall, is another Panda Express.
74200	75640	And they're all next door to Starbucks.
75640	76640	Yes, exactly.
76640	78320	That's how it works around here.
78320	83160	Alright, also say hello to, you know he loves his food too, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
83160	84160	Hello.
84160	85160	How you doing, Loki?
85160	86160	I'm doing good.
86160	88080	You went pretty basic with your food choice tonight.
88080	89440	You went to the McDonald's.
89440	96800	Yes, it was because I just, there's not, like I said, there's not a lot here to, or from
96800	99400	my house to, you know, your apartment, so.
99400	100400	Yeah.
100400	106280	And there's like, like a ton of McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and that's pretty much it.
106280	108560	This part of town's really sad when it comes to food.
108560	113360	So I mean, unless I pull off the freeway mid, you know, mid-trip, I, there wasn't really
113360	115560	much for me to, you know, have in.
115560	119520	I was gonna go to Quiznos, but I was like, I had Quiznos yesterday.
119520	124320	You know, I had pizza yesterday, so, I was like, I'll just have McDonald's, it won't
124320	125320	be that bad.
125320	129680	It was actually pretty terrible, but it's alright, you know, it's, I don't, I've been
129680	134460	not eating McDonald's, so, you know, Burger King's the way to go, at least that food is
134460	136460	palatable.
136460	138560	Alright less food, more games.
138560	141320	Join us to talk about what you've been doing in video games this week.
141320	145360	After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice, and we do tape live every Sunday
145360	148800	night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
148800	153160	show and his misguided ways about particular soundtracks, but it's still a good show, so
153160	157200	tune in and stay tuned for us at, again, six Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, and join us
157200	163700	live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, where some of the chatters are not too happy
163700	165840	about us bringing up food.
165840	171280	Uni starts us off tonight saying, OMG, dang you for mentioning Panda, I want it now, lol.
171280	175020	And they don't even pay us for these ads, these free ads that we're giving away here
175020	176020	on the show.
176020	179120	We need to put the clamp down on that, alright.
179120	180120	No more freebies.
180120	181120	Alright.
181120	185800	I love my food from Redected.
185800	188440	Exactly, beep.
188440	190280	Let's talk about games.
190280	194320	The kickoff topic tonight I wanted to start with kind of talking about is rediscovering
194320	196800	games kind of late in the game.
196800	199800	We usually talk about, you know, what video games we've been playing this week, and I'll
199800	204840	kind of tell you in advance here, one of the games that I finally, finally played this
204840	207900	week, and you guys are seriously going to roll your eyes and be like, how are you on
207900	214000	a gaming podcast and you've never played this game, to which I say, shut up, because just
214000	219000	because we do a podcast doesn't mean we have time to play every single game that comes
219000	220720	out, because there's so many of them.
220720	227200	So sometimes we miss some, and one that I missed the first several times is Mass Effect,
227200	232080	and I finally started playing it this week, when did Mass Effect come out, like 2007?
232080	233080	I've never played it.
233080	234080	That sounds about right.
234080	237320	So see, sometimes, you know, you just don't have time to play everything.
237320	241840	So yeah, I finally started playing it, and well, I'll save my opinions for a little bit
241840	242840	here.
242840	243840	I think it was the same year as Rock Band.
243840	244840	Was it really?
244840	245840	Like, within a week.
245840	251520	Well, I figure they come out about every other year, except for, I think, Mass Effect 2 originally
251520	255240	had been bumped back, like, it was a January release, wasn't it?
255240	259760	Uh, PS3 it was, because that came out a year later, I think.
259760	263320	I could have sworn that when Mass Effect 2 came out, it was really early in the year,
263320	266400	because when it got a lot of Game of the Year awards, people were like, that came out this
266400	267400	year?
267400	269360	Oh yeah, it came out, like, right after Christmas.
269360	273760	So, but anyway, this isn't about necessarily just the timing of things, but what I really
273760	278080	wanted to ask was, has there ever been a game that just, it seemed like you missed the boat
278080	282780	on it for so long, it just took you so long to get into it, and years later, here you
282780	284480	are finally playing it.
284480	289800	Have you ever had a game like that, where it took you like five years to get into it?
289800	292960	I know here on the show, we do the Classic Game of the Week every week, too, where Dark
292960	297000	Sakura talks about a game, you know, and sometimes people have discovered games that way, like,
297000	300360	I think there's an email coming up tonight about that, sort of, but, just wondering if
300360	305840	you guys have had any experience with delayed games.
305840	309320	Played Chain of Memories, like, really late.
309320	315240	I really can't think of very many, because I really can't play a lot of console stuff
315240	316240	anymore.
316240	319360	Oh yeah, because of your hand and stuff, huh?
319360	323960	I played Mario Kart 7 for the first time yesterday.
323960	325720	It didn't make me throw up.
325720	326720	Well that's good.
326720	329520	I thought I let you play Mario Kart 7 when I got it.
329520	330520	Alright.
330520	331520	I played Loki's Ridge Racer.
331520	332520	Yeah?
332520	333520	That was it.
333520	334520	And it made me sick.
334520	335520	Oh, it's too bad.
335520	337440	Loki, anything you can think of that was a little bit delayed for you?
337440	341120	Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
341120	345960	That's true, you've just been talking about the first game, not that long ago, huh?
345960	350980	Well, we're gonna be going to three pretty soon, I think.
350980	353880	Because I asked them, like, hey, you guys wanna do number two?
353880	358400	Like, we're gonna move to another game, we're gonna go to the latest one.
358400	365400	Not Black Ops or anything, not really into the Cold War stuff, we're more into the Modern
365400	366400	Warfare stuff.
366400	369880	Going to our chat room, I love some of the comments we're getting in our chat room.
369880	374760	We are the show, of course, where every gamer has a voice, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
374760	379000	Katsuhiko Jinai says, I haven't played Mass Effect either, so it's not just you, Dark
379000	381800	Sakura, or me, up until today.
381800	385280	And let's see, the Rob D. in our chat says, I do that all the time.
385280	391400	I went back and beat 50 games back in 2006 just for this purpose.
391400	393040	Probably five games were new.
393040	398760	That's a, man, I wish that was a goal I could realistically accomplish, but I never beat
398760	399760	games.
399760	403120	I really should force myself to, but there's just, there's so much other stuff I have to
403120	406080	tackle that I wouldn't want to give myself a goal like that.
406080	407340	That's a lot.
407340	412080	That's up there with reading 100 books in a year or something like that.
412080	414840	Black Wolf in chat says, BeatMania 2DX.
414840	417760	I think, I can think of one for you, Dark Sakura.
417760	419240	World of Warcraft.
419240	421040	I played it right at the beginning though, too.
421040	422040	Oh, that's right.
422040	423040	You did.
423040	424040	You didn't like it.
424040	425040	Remember, I had a vanilla account.
425040	426040	Yeah, I forgot about that.
426040	427040	That's true.
427040	429480	The Rob D. says, playing new games is overrated.
429480	435060	You know, it's usually a lot cheaper if you wait, that's for sure.
435060	436620	So there you go.
436620	441800	So those are some of the delayed games there, delayed games.
441800	444680	Let's move on and talk about what video games we've been playing this week, whether it be
444680	446400	new or old.
446400	447800	Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off?
447800	456280	Well, I finally beat every single puzzle in Best of Move for iOS, and it was pretty epic.
456280	460220	Now I want them to release some more so that I can get more puzzles.
460220	466040	I started another game called Star Mine that I bought on name alone, and it's actually
466040	467720	a pretty fun little puzzle game.
467720	470800	It's like a block sliding kind of game.
470800	475600	And then I played some well in Sonic CD.
475600	480080	All right, there you go.
480080	481080	Loki?
481080	489480	I played just a few games this week, other than Call of Duty, played a little bit of
489480	495400	the new Vita game, Motorstorm RC, which is pretty cool.
495400	497880	It's a little different than a regular Motorstorm game.
497880	503280	It's more like a Super Sprint or Ivan Ironman, Stewart's super off-road type thing.
503280	507360	And I've been playing that a bit, and one of the things I was trying to do was beat
507360	511240	you, because they have ghost data that you race basically in the game.
511240	515280	And so I was trying to beat that stuff, and I was pretty happy that I was able to beat
515280	521200	the ghost data that was in there until I figured out that the ghost data is glitched out, because
521200	527100	the ghost data, yeah, even though you beat it, like for example, the very first track
527100	532400	in the game is called Mixing Bull, and beat the ghost data in that.
532400	535080	Except then I noticed, hey, it disappeared.
535080	538940	That's because the ghost data only runs three of the four laps.
538940	546320	So it's impossible to beat, because it's all fucked up, because the game is cheap and terrible.
546320	555360	Well, it's not terrible, but hey, it's free, so I guess you can't complain.
555360	556360	I don't know.
556360	557360	It's frustrating.
557360	561000	Unfortunately, I kind of ran into the same thing with some of the other ghost data that
561000	567880	I raced, where I beat it and find out that, oh, look, I'm still ranked 3,000, even though
567880	570200	they're, oh, there's times they're faster than mine.
570200	573940	Well, then why wasn't that the ghost data that I was racing?
573940	576560	It's just all really weird.
576560	581380	And I complained to, of course, got to complain to them, Bill, listen, bitch, I know this
581380	582380	shit was free.
582380	583380	Did you say in an angry tweet?
583380	585240	I did say in an angry tweet, too.
585240	587760	At PlayStation, why are your games broken?
587760	592040	No, no, see, you would think it's at PlayStation, but no, it's at MotorStormRC, they have their
592040	595940	own fucking Twitter account, and I'm like, what the fuck, you can't beat this goddamn
595940	599600	ghost lap, because it only does three of the four laps.
599600	602440	We're aware of the issue, we're working on it.
602440	606400	I kind of did something similar this week, I sent a tweet, this is serious, not a joke,
606400	612320	I sent a tweet to AwakeNBC, and I sent a tweet that said, please don't get cancelled, because
612320	615800	I like the show, and apparently not a lot of people are watching it.
615800	618000	So I sent them a tweet, and I said, please don't get cancelled.
618000	622320	They didn't reply to me, maybe they've already been cancelled, I don't know.
622320	627800	So that was alright, I played a little bit of that, and then a couple other things that
627800	631880	are a little frustrating with me, the camera is really annoying, I really wish this game
631880	636560	was a first person driving game, and I understand maybe the camera's top down because one, it's
636560	643760	an RC game, that's fine, but I've played other RC games that were first person, or at least
643760	647920	behind the car type thing, not this, I have to figure it out from the top of the track.
647920	650120	Is this going to be about your love of Excite Truck again?
650120	652680	No, it's not going to be about Excite Truck.
652680	657280	No, there was a racing game that was on, I think it was Re-Volt, was actually on the
657280	664560	Playstation 2 or Playstation 1, that was actually pretty cool, it was an RC game.
664560	667840	It's a little frustrating, like when you're racing, it's hard to see some of the track
667840	673200	get the really mess of the camera to get it just right.
673200	679000	And then of course they have cars you can buy, which, as far as I'm aware, they don't
679000	683900	have stats on those cars, so I don't know what any of these other cars that I'm unlocking
683900	688200	do other than different types, and they're assuming different types handle differently,
688200	694140	but as far as different cars within the same type, I think it's just the way they look.
694140	703560	I did download the free cake car that you can, it's a cake slice car, so that was free.
703560	705800	What else?
705800	714040	I played Luminous on the Vita as well, I went through and I decided, hey, I'm going to beat
714040	718160	all the leaderboards on here, at least within my friends, and so I did that.
718160	723800	I beat all the leaderboards and, last I checked, and I was on top of all of them.
723800	728840	Except for obviously some of the higher master class stuff because I haven't beat the master
728840	730240	thing yet.
730240	735240	That's like really frustrating, just trying to get all the trophies for that game.
735240	740880	Oh, and I ranked up to 50 because for some reason when I play Luminous, it's actually
740880	746200	when they start doing the world cube thing, and you level up like 30 levels just by checking
746200	747200	it once.
747200	751160	I still can't nail what time of day, like I thought, it seemed like to me at the beginning
751160	756280	it was 4 o'clock Pacific everyday because that would be midnight in Greenwich time,
756280	759120	but it doesn't seem like it's always that time.
759120	767800	It's about 7, I think it's about, well it's just after, between 8 and 9 Pacific, 8-9 PM
767800	773680	Pacific is about when they're up, because I actually watched it one day when they had
773680	779400	a few hundred thousand left, and I actually contributed quite a bit to that one.
779400	784960	But yeah, around 8, 7, it was 8 or 9 PM Pacific.
784960	793720	Of course, with the time change and everything, it might be 7-8 PM Pacific.
793720	796160	So yeah, that's pretty much all I played.
796160	797160	Alright.
797160	800160	My gaming week, let me talk about a few things I've been playing this week.
800160	801560	There have been a few things.
801560	804680	Obviously first off is Mass Effect, but I haven't played it enough.
804680	807480	Well, A, do you really want me to review a 5 year old game?
807480	812840	I think most of you probably know how you feel, but since I did see somebody earlier
812840	818280	had said they haven't played it, and DarkSora hasn't played it, I'll just quickly say, well
818280	821280	I haven't played enough to give you a full review, but I'll tell you this much.
821280	826200	I am way less annoyed by the combat than I thought I would be, because I know Mass Effect
826200	832000	is very much about use cover and hide behind things and get things, and that's why I could
832000	833400	not play Gears of War.
833400	837160	And it's not that I think Gears of War is a bad game, it's not, it's a good game, but
837160	843360	I, that whole like cover thing, like no, I want fucking Quake or Unreal where you run
843360	846080	out there guns a blazing, that's more my kind of shooter.
846080	849400	So I thought the cover thing would really bother me, but it's not.
849400	853360	And I think, let's be real, I think a lot of that is because I'm playing on easy, so
853360	857200	I think my squad mates really pick up the slack for me, which is totally fine by me
857200	859320	because I'm really more playing for the story.
859320	863960	And I did find through playing Star Wars The Old Republic and you know, a little bit of
863960	867320	the Dragon Age, I do like BioWare's whole little conversational style, and I really
867320	873120	do see where the game can damn well be two completely separate games, depending on how
873120	877160	you are playing it, so I like that.
877160	882440	I kind of like that, that it can go in the different directions, but little annoyances
882440	884720	I have so far.
884720	889120	Some of the interface is just kind of crappy, now I hear that they fixed a lot of those
889120	893360	issues in two and three, so I'm not going to really harp on it, but let me just say,
893360	898360	I really value the one button maps, that's all I'm going to say.
898360	903160	But those are kind of nitpicking, otherwise what I think, especially for five years ago,
903160	908840	was graphically a good game, and you know, I guess ahead of its time in some ways.
908840	911960	But I'll let you know how things progress after I actually play more of it, because
911960	914720	if I told you where I was right now, you'd be like, oh Rob, you've barely touched the
914720	916720	damn game.
916720	922200	Couple other things I played, Rune Spell Overture, I can't remember if I talked about this game
922200	927480	before on the show, but it's a game I bought in one of those indie bundle collections that
927480	931160	I got a key for on Steam, and maybe I played it a little bit, you know, back when I first
931160	934280	got it, and I might have mentioned it in passing on the show, but I played it more in depth
934280	940560	this week, and for those that don't know it, I would say it's a little bit Puzzle Quest
940560	947600	2-ish meets a solitaire slash poker hybrid, and I know that sounds really weird, but the
947600	953920	way you battle enemies is that you have a, you kind of have a solitaire-ish hand, and
953920	959040	then they have one, and you form poker hands by moving your cards around, but it doesn't
959040	963520	follow the rules of solitaire, it doesn't have to be red on black or any of that stuff.
963520	967660	You can take their cards too and move them up into your hand, and you're trying to form
967660	971780	like the best poker hands, like you know, five of a kind would be the best one, which
971780	975240	is more of a Yahtzee, but you know what I mean.
975240	980080	And you kind of battle that way, but on top of that, you have spells, which felt a little
980080	983560	more like Puzzle Quest, because you can kind of activate those based on the power that
983560	989120	you've generated, so pretty cool little time killer puzzle game, and I imagine it's super
989120	993140	cheap, you know, I bought it in a bundle, so I bought it when it was, you know, a very
993140	998880	very reasonable price, soundtrack's good too, let me throw that out there, pretty deep story,
998880	1003880	no voice acting, but you know, some dialogue questions, and you know, just, it definitely
1003880	1007760	seems like there's a fleshed out story that I'm not far enough in to really appreciate
1007760	1008760	yet.
1008760	1015540	Let's see, a couple other things I've been playing this week, there was one other one
1015540	1018940	I wanted to name before I got to the big one, and now I can't remember, so I'll just say
1018940	1024320	World of Warcraft, but the other one I want to mention is amongst all the hype for Mass
1024320	1029100	Effect this week, I think there's another game that's come out, well, it's only come
1029100	1032620	out to a small audience, but I think it's coming out for a bigger audience this week,
1032620	1037560	and I gotta tell you, don't miss this one, because I think it's pretty awesome, and that's
1037560	1043520	a game called Journey on the Playstation 3, not to be confused with the awesome arcade
1043520	1050800	game from the 1980s, okay, this has nothing to do with the band, but Journey is by the
1050800	1055760	folks that did Flower, that game company I think is their name, and this is kind of their
1055760	1062320	new game, and so if you played Flower at all, you'll kind of know what to expect, now this
1062320	1067040	game isn't like Flower, it's not like, I think Flower is the most creative racing game I've
1067040	1073320	ever played in my life, that's kind of how I would describe Flower, Journey, I don't
1073320	1079440	know where to put, Journey is definitely kind of more like a platformer, but don't think
1079440	1084160	of it like a platformer, I'm being very careful and choosing my words carefully here, because
1084160	1089040	I think Journey is best experienced not knowing anything about it, because I will tell you
1089040	1095080	this, I sat down and played Journey, it doesn't tell you anything, there's no dialogue, there's
1095080	1103360	no, you know, do this, or you need to go here, or arrow, or any help, there's one little,
1103360	1107600	the little controller will show up, and it'll say, you know, A is jump, that's about it,
1107600	1110860	like once in a while it'll kind of pop up, so you're kind of left to your own devices
1110860	1116680	to figure out what the heck's going on, and it's a game that's told really through its
1116680	1123480	soundtrack, in a way, like I just, I found the soundtrack to be amazing, and really moving,
1123480	1128680	and then there's a twist to it, there's a reason why it's called Journey, and some of
1128680	1131920	you probably know, but I don't want to ruin it for you, if you don't already know, the
1131920	1135480	band pops out, and starts playing you on your way, therefore it's part of the soundtrack,
1135480	1141600	I wish, I wish, that would make it even more awesome, but there's a twist, and when it
1141600	1148120	happened, I was like, wait a minute, what the, and like, I don't know, do you know what
1148120	1152040	I'm talking about, have you read about this game at all? I've read about the game, but
1152040	1154720	I'm trying very hard not to ruin it for the listeners, I'll have to tell you during the
1154720	1159960	break or something, but there's like a little twist to it, and when I first, like, I didn't
1159960	1167400	realize what was happening, as it was happening, and I was kind of like, this is so, the, how
1167400	1175120	do I explain it, ah, just, as it was happening, I was kind of like, I, I didn't realize what
1175120	1180200	it really was at first, and then it kind of hit me, like, oh my gosh, this is this. Yeah,
1180200	1184120	I know what you're talking about now. Do you? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Do
1184120	1187880	you really? Yeah. Okay, but there, yeah, but you know, like, it's, it's, and then suddenly
1187880	1191520	when you figure it out, you're like, oh my god, I had no idea that this was part of the
1191520	1198620	game, and then, again, I said there's no dialogue, and there's not a lot to it, you're finding
1198620	1205400	all these interesting ways you've never thought about before to now play this game, and it
1205400	1211160	can go a variety of directions. It can go a very customary direction, or it can go in
1211160	1216720	a direction where I never saw this twist happen, I'm just going to ignore it, I don't give
1216720	1220920	an F, I'm going to go do this what I was doing before, and the game still kind of works in
1220920	1231680	both ways. Now, the one, the one thing I will say about it is that it's short, it's like
1231680	1239420	two or three hours tops, and it's a $15 game, and that may not sit well with people, which
1239420	1244780	is fair, because, you know, we've been taught to know that games like that usually shouldn't
1244780	1251240	cost that much money, but I do think it's a really good two, three hour experience,
1251240	1256160	and there is some replay value in it, I can see, again, there's several different ways
1256160	1261520	to approach the game, and yeah, I would recommend it, but I think that play time is going to
1261520	1267400	really scare some people off, but, and I think a lot of people are saying this, this game
1267400	1275280	is very much the games are art in motion, but I don't know, like, I wouldn't necessarily
1275280	1280120	say well Roger Ebert needs to play this game, I don't think he could appreciate it, but
1280120	1285960	as somebody, you know, who's had some pretty miserable experiences on Xbox Live, and had
1285960	1290640	to put up with like trolling in World of Warcraft and so forth, the experience that this game
1290640	1299920	brought was really organic and neat, so, I guess that's really all I can say about it,
1299920	1302200	again, some of you know darn well what I'm talking about, and you're just like just say
1302200	1308680	it, but I'm telling you, there's a reason why I'm not telling you, because I don't want
1308680	1313400	you to be spoiled on that, and seriously, avoid reviews, play the, the value of the
1313400	1319380	game will be so much more if you know nothing about it going in, trust me, don't spoil it
1319380	1326960	for yourself, you might figure it out right away, but, you know, that's all I'm going
1326960	1334080	to say, alright, let me move on, it is what I'm going to pick up this week though, I wanted
1334080	1337880	to pick that up, yeah, you're welcome to test it out here if you want to see if it's worth
1337880	1343040	15 bucks or not, but, you know, because, you know, again, it's a pretty basic platformer,
1343040	1347000	the visuals are not, I think it's a very beautiful game, but some people are going to go, it's
1347000	1350800	all desert, it's just the desert, desert, desert, but there's some very beautiful things
1350800	1354700	they do, like there's one level where you're kind of, it's almost like a race, like you're
1354700	1358880	falling down a hill, and you're kind of like, you know, having to move, like it's almost
1358880	1361840	like hydro thunder or something, and it's like you're falling through the desert as
1361840	1367160	the sun is setting, it's really gorgeous, so. I forgot that I had one more game. You
1367160	1369240	have one more game you want to add, that's fine, because I'm done, what did you want
1369240	1373960	to add? I was playing Doctor Who, the Mazes of Time. Is that actually good? It's pretty
1373960	1379640	good so far. Is that an iPhone game? Yeah, it's, you play as the doctor and Amy, and
1379640	1384520	you have to, it's basically one person does one part of the puzzle, and maybe has to stand
1384520	1387880	on something so that it activates another part of the puzzle, and then you have to figure
1387880	1392820	out how to get both of them through the maze. So it's just, it's just a fun little, it's
1392820	1401460	a dollar right now, so, get it. There you go. Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about
1401460	1405560	some housekeeping before we get into news. I actually have something tonight, and this
1405560	1410860	is something I'm going to surprise DarkSakura and Loki with on air, because aren't on air
1410860	1416720	surprises the best? Oh lord. Alright, so let me tell you about this. I got a package in
1416720	1420900	the mail this week from our buddy Brad at Pod Culture, and this is, this is the package
1420900	1424320	that we got, and I had no idea what it was. Cardboard! Yes, it's cardboard, but there's
1424320	1427780	something inside this cardboard I think you should see, and you, Jamie, I think are really
1427780	1432700	going to appreciate this. You ready? Okay, so here's what was sent to us, and listeners,
1432700	1442860	this can impact you as well. These are vinyl decals of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.
1442860	1447820	There's one for you, there's one for Matt. Now here's the cool thing, I wouldn't take
1447820	1450660	that off, because once you do, you're going to have to stick it on something. I check
1450660	1454540	the ink on everything, you know me. Oh yeah, you're a nerd like that. Here's the thing,
1454540	1458300	we have some extra decals here, and I'm sure we'll give those away at some point, except
1458300	1461580	I want to keep one for myself. There's some other ones in here, these are hard to see,
1461580	1466420	but hold them up to the light, and you can see, these are like the white silhouette ones
1466420	1472220	that you see on the backs of cars. Yeah. Yeah, but like the artist here took kind of like
1472220	1480420	the art and did that, and I really like the way that looks. Yeah. So, assuming that Loki
1480420	1486060	and Dark Sakura like this, the guy is going to, I think we're going to try, he's offered
1486060	1491420	to sell the stickers on his site, so you guys can get them too. Of course, you know, they're
1491420	1494940	not free guys, it does cost money to make, but I know the guy will be reasonable about
1494940	1499980	the price. I wouldn't mention it here on the show, if I didn't think that, and it's, you
1499980	1504340	know, Brad from Pod Culture is our buddy. And of course, I didn't put the name of the
1504340	1510380	site here in front of me, but I have the letter here, it is Decalmic.com. There it is, Decalmic.com.
1510380	1514540	And we're going to see what we can do to get that added to the store, so you guys can check
1514540	1519420	that out. Now the listeners are demanding pictures. I don't, I don't think that. It's
1519420	1522980	going to be hard to take a picture of. Exactly, I'm like, you have to remember, it's a vinyl
1522980	1526860	decal of the Orange Orange Radio album art. So if you've seen the podcast. With Flash
1526860	1530620	it could work. You already know what it looks like, but they're like little stickers, and
1530620	1534620	they're about the size, how big, how big would you say that is? The size of your phone. It's
1534620	1537620	about the size of an iPhone, but a little bit more square. I think it's a three by three,
1537620	1540780	or three and a half by three and a half. So those of you guys that have been asking for
1540780	1544140	OLR merchandise, because you know we, it's been how many years, we still don't have a
1544140	1547740	t-shirt, I think we'll be able to jump on this. So I want to say thank you, thank you,
1547740	1552140	thank you, thank you, thank you to our buddy Brad at Pod Culture, and of course Decalmic
1552140	1556900	for the hard work there. But Brad from Pod Culture is the one that essentially, I guess
1556900	1560340	for lack of a better term, front of the money, I guess for that, or kicked around the idea
1560340	1567540	to get that started. So props to him. Alright, yeah, probably not going to show up very well
1567540	1575060	on the iPhone, we'll not do it justice, but you know. Oh. And if you're a fan of Airwolf,
1575060	1580940	or you know, Back to the Future, there's also decals on Decalmic's site as well. Oh really?
1580940	1584460	I have to be honest, I've only, I haven't had a chance to browse the site yet, but he
1584460	1588840	has some other stuff too. Yeah, there's stuff like from Airwolf, there's World of Warcrack,
1588840	1595060	there's Thundercat's Sword, the Stargate SGC decal. It's all the shows that Brad talks
1595060	1600840	about on his show, I'm not surprised at all. Yeah, there's, you know, the TARDIS Interruptus,
1600840	1606860	there's Pod Culture stuff. Oh, his other shows, alright. Type 40, Geek Spin, and a lot of
1606860	1614660	stuff from Occupy Wall Street, there's the Guy Fawkes mask, a Dalek. A Dalek. Nice. Yeah.
1614660	1619580	Loves it! Alright, so. I'm putting up a few pictures. Thanks again you guys, and listeners,
1619580	1623680	if you want to get these stickers, I have to do some, they're not there yet, I have
1623680	1627820	to do some DMs and all that stuff, and you know, on Twitter, and get that all arranged,
1627820	1635440	but they should be up. I will remind you guys next week about that. Alright. My 3DS friends
1635440	1640320	are asking for 3D pictures. You guys, it's a window decal, they're not in 3D. 3D is not
1640320	1646660	going to do it justice. Alright, now let's get into some gaming news. Less about us,
1646660	1652960	more about the video games. Loki. So there was a brief little web stream thing for the
1652960	1657960	PlayStation Vita. I was hoping for a lot more US titles, but unfortunately they're all Japanese
1657960	1662520	titles, but it doesn't necessarily mean that this stuff won't be coming out over here,
1662520	1666280	or in other territories other than Japan, but as of right now it's just all Japanese
1666280	1670760	titles. So starting off, one of the titles that got announced was Phantasy Star Online
1670760	1675600	2 is coming to the Vita, with PC cross-play. So you're going to be able to play against
1675600	1683200	people that have the PC version as well. So there you go, your first MMO on the Vita.
1683200	1690400	And you know, I'm not really sure how the online's handled, but I mean, hell, if anything,
1690400	1697760	you know, the old PlayStation, or not PlayStation, the old Sega Dreamcast, Phantasy Star Online
1697760	1705400	was able to work over dial-ups, so Phantasy Star Online 2 working over 3G, maybe? That'd
1705400	1710520	be kind of interesting. No word on when that's going to be coming out, probably later this
1710520	1716680	year, but still pretty cool. And then they also had a... I really hope this comes to
1716680	1719200	America. Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I really want this to come to America.
1719200	1725600	I really liked, I'm probably the only person in the world that liked Phantasy Star Universe.
1725600	1731440	And I know this is not PSU2, this is PSO2, and it's PSO2 because PSU was not viewed as
1731440	1737800	very good. But regardless, I'm a fan of this series, and I hope that we are getting it
1737800	1741920	in America, because I was interested in it when they first announced the PC one. I liked
1741920	1747000	playing Phantasy Star Online offline. That was kind of fun. Well then you'd probably
1747000	1753280	like those PSP games were just Phantasy Star Universe, but offline. Yeah, meh. That was
1753280	1757400	the one where you could have the pizza box. It had some really weird tie-ins, remember
1757400	1762080	that? Yeah, the Pizza Hut stuff, that was funny. Wasn't Colonel Sanders in there or
1762080	1768240	something like that? Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me because I think Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell
1768240	1776640	are like all the same people. Brand wars. Another RPG that's coming out as well on the
1776640	1784240	Vita, The Legend of Heroes, or Dragon Slayer, The Legend of Heroes. And that's coming out
1784240	1789200	on the Vita as well. And they also announced that Gundam Seed Battle Destiny will be coming
1789200	1797680	out on the Vita. And it's, I guess, the sixth game in the Gundam Battle series, of which
1797680	1804880	I am not familiar with. I am assuming those were only Japanese releases. Not surprised.
1804880	1807400	There was another one that was unannounced that was kind of like, oh, we're gonna work
1807400	1813280	with the fans to make this happen or something. It just reminded me too much of Mega Man Legends
1813280	1822120	3, so I just tuned that out. But yeah, unfortunately no actual US titles or anything like that.
1822120	1827480	Because it is Japanese. Well yeah, the press conference was Japanese. It's funny because
1827480	1831440	I think a lot of people when this was first announced was like, why are they doing this?
1831440	1834840	The system just came out like two weeks ago and they already have to have a press conference.
1834840	1838880	Well, in Japan it's been quite a bit longer than two weeks, because they got the Vita
1838880	1845200	in December. So it makes sense. I do hope there is a press conference for us soon where
1845200	1849840	they talk about the US release of PlayStation Online 2, but at this point they might as
1849840	1856560	well just do E3. Yeah, well I mean, if you think about it, three months from launch that's
1856560	1861880	almost E3, so why not. And they've already kind of announced everything that's gonna
1861880	1869900	be coming out, first party at least, up through the end of the second quarter. So it would
1869900	1873440	make sense that any of those other announcements are gonna be at E3. And there's probably gonna
1873440	1876880	be a little bit of a lull during the summer, but you're gonna get a lot of fall games.
1876880	1881800	And I mean, hell, we got like Resistance and Gravity Rush. And in fact, actually Gravity
1881800	1888600	Rush, yeah, that'll be the June title. Resistance is gonna be the May title. April, probably
1888600	1892200	LittleBigPlanet at this point. Well, now here's what I'm wondering, because this was a Twitter
1892200	1895520	conversation I was in this week, and somebody was asking when LittleBigPlanet was coming
1895520	1900120	out, and I was like, well supposedly it's April, but the box art isn't even finalized
1900120	1903600	yet and there's a lot that seems like it's still up in the air in the game. I would,
1903600	1908400	I mean, the game may be awesome, and I'm totally down with that if that's the case. Box art's
1908400	1913660	finalized, just aside from the ESRB rating. I'm really worried about them rushing it.
1913660	1917120	I just don't want a rushed game. I don't think it's gonna be rushed. Alright, because I was
1917120	1919200	thinking at this point it would get delayed this summer because we just haven't heard
1919200	1922320	a lot about it. No, because this was a good launch title. I think it's already been delayed.
1922320	1930200	It's just, I think putting it out in March would have been kind of, I mean, it would
1930200	1934360	have been alright, but I think it's good that they're spacing their titles out, because
1934360	1941080	they had, what, two titles coming out in March, and they're gonna have one each month coming,
1941080	1946840	you know, major titles coming out soon, so at least there's a lot more releases than
1946840	1951040	there were on the 3DS, because I remember when the 3DS came out, the next month was
1951040	1956680	pretty much SpongeBob SquigglePants. There was a... SpongeBob SquigglePants? SquigglePants,
1956680	1961720	yes. I thought it was SquarePants. No, SquigglePants. Is this his cousin? It was the one that was
1961720	1967120	like WarioWare. Did he marry into the SquigglePants family? He must have. Yes, he changed the
1967120	1973800	last name, or his last name. I see. So I just remember that the releases were a lot slower,
1973800	1980520	but I don't know, it's kind of cool. I would like to see some, you know, some other stuff.
1980520	1984400	I'm hoping, I'm hoping, because it's supposed to be a PlayStation Network title, I'm hoping
1984400	1990880	that Retro City Rampage will be playable on the Vita, because that would be pretty awesome.
1990880	1998840	And it might be. I mean, it doesn't have to push a lot of graphics. Alright, well, now
1998840	2003780	that the Vita is out and they're talking about it, now our attention starts to shift towards
2003780	2010120	the next batch of consoles that is the unknown. That would be, of course, the Wii U, the PlayStation
2010120	2015600	4 someday, and the next Xbox, or whatever they're gonna end up calling it. I think they
2015600	2021600	should do the Apple thing and just call it the Xbox all over again. The new Xbox. That's
2021600	2028440	like so confusing. I mean, seriously? Well, we're gonna get to it later in the show, so
2028440	2031120	I'll talk about it then. I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.
2031120	2037000	No, I understand why they're doing it, because of their other, their other, you know, series
2037000	2046200	of hardware devices. Or anything. I bought a Corolla, you know, or I bought a Xerox machine.
2046200	2049260	You know, there's a lot of things that we don't necessarily address. Xerox machines
2049260	2054240	have model numbers, Corollas, they call them, in different car manufacturers, it's a 2012
2054240	2056600	Corolla or it's a 2011 Corolla. I know that, I know that, but people don't necessarily
2056600	2061240	like refer to it by that, so I don't know. Well fine, they can call the stupid new, the new iPad,
2061240	2063280	and you know what people are gonna call it? iPad 3. You're having an argument we're supposed
2063280	2069640	to be having in 30 minutes. Did you not get tonight's list? I don't care. Alright, the
2069640	2075400	next Xbox, the new Xbox, Xbox lube, Xbox, I won't even call it that other number name,
2075400	2078640	because that's such a stupid name and I can't believe everybody always calls it that. How
2078640	2082960	about the X-Sphere? The Xbox. I hear the new system will be full of skateboarding games.
2082960	2090040	Yes, I was gonna say the next Xbox Atari skateboarding game. Alright, anyhow, the big rumor going
2090040	2094800	around this week about it, and what's interesting about this rumor is that we had a very similar
2094800	2099280	rumor five weeks ago, and I seriously think everybody forgot, but we kind of already had
2099280	2106240	this rumor, but it made the rounds again that the next Xbox won't have a disk drive. Oh,
2106240	2112140	supposedly the code name is Durango, speaking of cars, but anyway, the next Xbox is not
2112140	2116520	supposed to, is supposed to not have a disk drive. There's, you know, apparently it's
2116520	2120440	leaked out even though there was big NDAs and all that, and, you know, of course there's
2120440	2125760	the way these things happen. The next Xbox quote will offer, the quote from MCVUK, quote
2125760	2131000	will offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid state card storage,
2131000	2135560	although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such
2135560	2144680	as SD. So if I'm reading this correctly, we've gone from cartridges to disk, back to cartridge.
2144680	2151440	Right? Is what they're saying with the next Xbox. Well, what they're saying, and I, I
2151440	2155960	really don't buy that they're gonna do this, because I think that, you know, Xbox, their
2155960	2160440	thing is we want to be your source for, like, entertainment, and I think the next step would
2160440	2164680	be a Blu-ray drive, because that's what everybody's using for entertainment, they want it, you
2164680	2172400	know. It's doing, like, a proprietary format, like the Vita. It was basically for security,
2172400	2175960	because that thing was getting hacked to shit, and, you know, publishers didn't want to make
2175960	2180480	games for the system because, you know, they're afraid it's gonna get pirated. Well, wouldn't
2180480	2183880	that just be forward thinking on Microsoft's part, that Blu-ray is gonna get hacked to
2183880	2188880	shit if it hasn't been already, and they don't want to, you know, A, it's, Sony's involved
2188880	2192640	with Blu-ray, so why? It doesn't matter. It's not a matter of Blu-ray being hacked to shit,
2192640	2196600	it's your file formats on those disks. The disk is just a storage medium. You can have
2196600	2202480	that same, you know, format, or the same file structure on a solid state disk on whatever.
2202480	2206600	You know, granted, if it's a proprietary thing, it's gonna be harder to read, because, you
2206600	2211320	know, no one has anything to read it yet. Well, of course, everybody's now crying. It's
2211320	2215840	the death of the used game market. It's the death of retail. It's the death, blah, blah,
2215840	2221980	blah, blah, because when you don't have a disk, therefore, there's nothing to interchange,
2221980	2226680	so it is gonna go belly up. Although, why are people going here when we're talking about
2226680	2231000	cartridges? This sounds like the Vita to me. I mean, it'll probably be, but it's probably
2231000	2234720	gonna be just like the Vita. It doesn't even matter. It's gonna have a drive of some sort.
2234720	2238560	They're not gonna just get rid of physical disks. I think it's still gonna be disk space.
2238560	2242080	I think that all these rumors are full of shit. Where's their source? Oh, it's some
2242080	2247080	guy that said he was under NDA. Well, I'm under NDA, and guess what? It's a fucking
2247080	2252360	giant robot. It's a giant 50 foot tall robot. That's the new system. I wasn't supposed to
2252360	2256680	tell you because I was under NDA, but it's a giant 50 foot fucking tall robot. I used
2256680	2263240	to be able to hear, thank you. So it's a response to the Sony Aibo. It is a giant fucking robot.
2263240	2269240	Oh, I'm sorry. I was under NDA. You didn't hear it from me. Giant fucking robot. I mean,
2269240	2274120	that is about how credible this is. It's just stupid. It is so fucking stupid. We've had
2274120	2281400	all these... Because it's just feeding into the... It's just troll bait is all it is.
2281400	2287500	They're not that dumb, okay? They know that if they put out something that's digital only,
2287500	2292440	that it's gonna... First off, it's gonna... Not everybody has broadband connections.
2292440	2297840	So yeah, a lot of people do, but not everybody. So I mean, why would you do that? You're not
2297840	2301720	going to. I think if anything, it's gonna be kind of a compromise like the Vita is where
2301720	2306600	all their titles are offered as a digital download at a slight discount, or you can
2306600	2310720	buy everything physical. Now, whether the disc is gonna be a Blu-ray disc or it's gonna
2310720	2315000	be a cartridge or whatever, it doesn't matter, but there's gonna be some physical part to
2315000	2320360	it. I don't think the cartridge idea is so far fetched. We know that those little memory
2320360	2326320	cards, those tiny, tiny ass memory cards on the PlayStation Vita can hold up to 32 gigabytes,
2326320	2331520	and that Sony is charging way more than those cards are really worth. So in a couple years
2331520	2336200	time when the Xbox new is a reality, you could probably fit... How much can a Blu-ray hold
2336200	2340080	right now? Is it 20 gigs? It's like 50 some gigs. Is it even... Oh God, I thought it
2340080	2342900	was less. Well, because I was gonna say, you could probably hold more on a card than you
2342900	2347320	probably could. I mean, USB drives go higher. They're probably looking at something where
2347320	2351560	you can hold more on a card than you can on a disc. Well, that even might be... And to
2351560	2355560	be honest, I mean, that might be the reason why they're going that route is because they're
2355560	2359680	worried that they're gonna run into the same problem they do with the DVD-9 format where
2359680	2365080	they're gonna basically run out of disc space, and they're just thinking ahead saying, hey,
2365080	2372000	maybe we shouldn't do this because we wanna have some sort of support for whatever formats
2372000	2374520	that are larger than this because we don't wanna have to come out with a new console.
2374520	2378320	Dungeon Buster in our chat room says, Macross box.
2378320	2381880	It transforms into a Valkyrie and flies away with your money.
2381880	2386720	Pika Uno in a chat says, it's not the time for digital only yet. I'm kind of on board
2386720	2391700	with that. I think the Vita is a good sign of where we're at right now. Some people want
2391700	2394960	digital only, and certainly the publishers like it when we do that and they give incentives
2394960	2399960	to go that route, but I think there's still enough of America that isn't on super high
2399960	2406080	speed internet or has that type of bandwidth a month. I think sometimes in our big urban
2406080	2410120	areas, we live in a little bit of a bubble. Those of us that live there thinking everybody
2410120	2413000	has that type of connection, but they don't.
2413000	2417520	Can you imagine even, let's just say they do have a high speed connection. Say we have
2417520	2424640	cable. It's pretty fast, right? Can you imagine downloading a 50 gigabyte game? That would
2424640	2429960	take fucking forever. Oh, there you go. Five games or even a couple games and you hit your
2429960	2431200	bandwidth cap.
2431200	2435720	Even Mass Effect was six gigs and I was like, that's too much. I have that bandwidth cap
2435720	2440000	I have to think about and six gigs is gonna take several hours. I don't really wanna do
2440000	2444200	this. So it's not the time for digital only.
2444200	2449520	It's not. It's not gonna happen. And can you imagine, oh, hey, a game stuff. Yeah. You
2449520	2455240	know how we're we've been providing with products and stuff like that. We're not going to anymore.
2455240	2459240	I'm sorry, but people aren't gonna just all of a sudden go, you know, hey, I'm gonna buy
2459240	2460440	it from Microsoft.
2460440	2464840	That's not Microsoft's fucking problem, nor is it something that Microsoft really I think
2464840	2469260	has to concern themselves with because let's face it, game stops are going to end up like
2469260	2472680	Blockbuster. It's a matter of time.
2472680	2478440	But it's just the thing with, well, Blockbuster is a whole other problem. It wasn't necessarily
2478440	2483480	that people weren't going to rent. It's just mismanaged. But, um, I think people are still
2483480	2487200	looking for physical stuff. I mean, that's why Redbox is doing so well. They're still
2487200	2488200	looking for this.
2488200	2493040	It's just, you know, it's more convenient now to go to a kiosk versus a store. Um, but
2493040	2498000	I still think people are looking for this. I mean, because they want to be, they want
2498000	2502320	to have the illusion that they own the product, even though, you know, license agreements
2502320	2503320	prevent that.
2503320	2506880	Great comment from chat too. Raginator in our chat room says, I don't care for digital
2506880	2511120	ever since Sony fucked me over with my videos. And we remember hearing about his plights
2511120	2515240	a few months ago during the call-in segments of the show is that some people have a severe
2515240	2519960	lack of trust with digital, you know, and I got to admit, if the new Xbox was announced
2519960	2523400	as digital only, I would have a slight hesitation.
2523400	2526020	At the end of the day, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but I would
2526020	2531460	want to know what's Microsoft, clearly Microsoft systems are not infallible to hacking. So
2531460	2535220	what, you know, how, how is my stuff going to be protected?
2535220	2539380	And also on top of that, I mean, if they put out, okay, if Microsoft said, we're going
2539380	2543020	to do only, we're going to do digital only and Sony said, we're going to do digital and
2543020	2547700	disc people are going to go with Sony. They're going to, they're going to buy a system that's
2547700	2552920	going to have physical media or medium. But yeah, I think though it's getting a lot more
2552920	2558680	convenient to purchase digitally, but it's not, there's a lot of factors into just convenience.
2558680	2564460	And unfortunately the publishers are not quite understanding yet.
2564460	2569840	Here's something to think about. I saw a great point to this on Twitter this week that I
2569840	2574140	would, I wouldn't have thought about right away, I must admit, but I thought it was just
2574140	2579000	a great argument for why this is definitely a possibility that the next Xbox may not have
2579000	2583340	any type of dis format at all. Because if X, you know, and even though everybody's rabble
2583340	2587180	rabbling about, you know, whether it would kill to use game market and dah, dah, dah,
2587180	2590820	dah, if they got rid of the disk drive and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, Xbox wouldn't be the
2590820	2595260	first person to do it. In fact, another company's done it. Another company's cut out the disk
2595260	2598700	drive completely and they have the most popular fucking computer in the world right now that
2598700	2608780	everybody wants. Who is it? Apple. Where's the disk drive on the iPad? Where is it? Had
2608780	2613540	didn't they even release a laptop that specifically doesn't have a disk drive in it? You have
2613540	2619100	to have some type of like airport hub in your home and people are eating it up. So if Xbox
2619100	2625060	went this direction, they would not be the first. Okay, hold on. Now you're comparing
2625060	2629980	the average gamer with a hipster and I'm sorry, it's just not going to work. You have to understand
2629980	2636500	that people, the people that buy Macs, okay, and I'm not talking about iPods, I'm talking
2636500	2642980	about Macs. It's all about seeing the PlayStation before it was mainstream. Okay. It's all about
2642980	2648180	it's like, well, I like the brushed metal finish on this system. It's so sleek and wonderful.
2648180	2654060	Oh, I don't care if it has only one USB port. I don't need those pesky USB ports. I only
2654060	2659040	value the Atari 2600 with the wood paneling finishes on the side. Don't bring me those
2659040	2664180	little plastic refurbs because they're not the real deal. I had a four controller system
2664180	2669060	before any of you did. Listen, the only reason they took out-
2669060	2673220	I have two Atari 5200s, hello. The only reason they took out the disk drive
2673220	2676900	is because they're like, we want to make the thinnest fucking laptop ever. And they did
2676900	2680940	it and then people are like, Oh my God, it's so thin, I'm going to buy it. Like it's a
2680940	2685060	fucking supermodel or something like that. And so they did. And then they're like, Hey,
2685060	2688580	I can't fucking install any software on it. And Apple's like, well, that's okay. Cause
2688580	2692420	no software is really supported by our system anyway. So, Oh, well you don't need to download
2692420	2696140	it. My Rob the robot is a hundred percent organic and gluten-free. Okay. I bought it
2696140	2701500	at Whole Foods. Thank you. To be honest, the Fairchild Channel F is totally underappreciated.
2701500	2705260	And you know what? Hey, if they're going to go the Apple route, why don't we charge $4,000
2705260	2708860	for the goddamn system? Because as long as it's sexy enough, people will buy it. Even
2708860	2715940	if it's, you know, performance wise, not quite inferior to the competition for the same price.
2715940	2719480	But Hey. Well, Duke Nukem Forever is five bucks.
2719480	2723580	And you know what? You know, the Japanese Sonic soundtrack is clearly superior to the
2723580	2732460	American one. And if we're, if we're talking about like, you know, devices with whole foods
2732460	2737220	anymore, I go to farmer's markets, you know, if we're talking about devices without, uh,
2737220	2741180	I just drive to Mexico. This drives and stuff like that and how well they worked out. Where's
2741180	2745780	the netbook nowadays? Oh, that's right. It's a format that failed. Yeah. I understand you
2745780	2750020	have one, but I'm talking about the format. I'm saying that the format itself failed.
2750020	2753380	They're not making them anymore. They're not making netbooks. They're not making netbooks
2753380	2761780	anymore. It's people like this drives. They're not making netbooks anymore. They are. Yeah.
2761780	2765340	They're the older ones that they're clearing out inventory on. There's no new netbooks
2765340	2772580	coming out. I like mine. And there's also the transformer, which Dan has, which is a
2772580	2776920	tablet and a netbook. And last I checked, most games out there are probably not a few
2776920	2783820	megs versus, you know, the typical application size, but whatever, you know, if you want,
2783820	2788260	if you want a system without a disk drive and you want it in a brushed metal, you know,
2788260	2792420	finish and you want it to be sleek and have a glowing Apple symbol on the back of it,
2792420	2797720	then fine. You go ahead and purchase yourself, you know, what disk drive list system and
2797720	2801180	don't come crying to me when you can't install anything on it. All right, look, one more
2801180	2803980	thing I want to say on the story and then we can move on. And that is the fact that
2803980	2810000	Microsoft was asked to comment on this by the gaming blogs is to be expected. What's
2810000	2814760	interesting about it is that they didn't 100% deny it. You know, you think you're going
2814760	2819380	to get the line that says Microsoft does not comment on rumors or speculation and the line,
2819380	2826000	right? But here's the actual quote. Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend its lifecycle,
2826000	2830260	like introducing the world to controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the
2830260	2835100	console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships. We are always thinking
2835100	2839900	about what is next for our platform and how to continue to defy the lifecycle convention.
2839900	2844960	Beyond that, we do not comment on rumors or speculation. So it's just PR spin and the
2844960	2850460	do not comment. It's, it's, it is a little weird to me. In a way it says to me, why are
2850460	2855780	you talking about the new Xbox? We're still extending the life of the Xbox 360. Stop focusing
2855780	2863500	on this new Xbox and our plans for it. There's plenty to go on the 360, but maybe, I don't
2863500	2870240	know, this is crazy, crazy tinfoil hat time. Ready? Maybe there's a new 360 coming out.
2870240	2876380	That's like the Microsoft version of the PSP go. You heard it here first on the orange
2876380	2881220	owned radio, throwing it out there, just throwing it out there. So maybe it's, well, maybe,
2881220	2886620	Oh God, here we go. Hold on. I just, all I want to say, but maybe the one mistake that
2886620	2893860	Microsoft won't make that Sony did that ruined the PSP go is that maybe the system is priced
2893860	2899980	right. All right, now, Loki, what's your witty retort? My witty retort is no one's going
2899980	2909040	to buy it. That's my witty retort is they're not going to do that. Only Sony makes those
2909040	2914260	stupid mistakes where they're like, Hey, yeah, we just announced the Vita. Oh, and we're
2914260	2920500	going to put out a new PSP. What? Why? Oh, and it's not going to have any sort of wifi
2920500	2927900	built in. What? Huh? All right, let's move on. I'm sure there's plenty more comments
2927900	2931440	we're going to hear on this. Uh, by the way, I did want to say though, uh, one thing I
2931440	2936220	forgot to tie this to the story that this ties into from five weeks ago, we may not
2936220	2941040	have been, you know, hearing about the, they are got rid of the disc, but we did hear the
2941040	2948380	rumor about they won't play used games. So I'm telling you, man, you know, I was over
2948380	2954380	in China the other day on the production line for the new Xbox and that leg was a good 20
2954380	2960140	feet long, 50 foot robot. I'm telling you, Xbox GFR. Yeah. Speaking about things that
2960140	2969500	are full of shit, mad dog McCree. Oh, poor guy. I hate that game. I'm going to tell you
2969500	2979180	a story about mad dog McCree. One day, one day, shut up. When I was working up serious,
2979180	2983580	I was working at cyber station and we had a mad dog McCree freaking hate that because
2983580	2991260	I had to clean that bitch. Did you have to watch grandpa's balls? Not as often as you
2991260	2998900	do. Did you have to polish his knobs? That has nothing to do with the game. So yeah.
2998900	3005540	Mad dog McCree. Rob is having a spasm right now. He's just laughing at the fact he said
3005540	3013780	balls. Thank God it's radio. He's all red in the face. It's kind of cute. Anyway, a
3013780	3018860	group called engine software is porting mad dog McCree to the 3DS. It's going to be released
3018860	3028900	on the eShop and scores of gamers across the world go, why? Because honestly, that game
3028900	3034300	was not very good. It had a sequel. How did that game get a sequel? It had it at Solomon's
3034300	3040860	that was by my college in Alabama. Is dragon's lair on the 3DS out yet? No, and why isn't
3040860	3045740	it? Because, you know, when I think of laser disc games immediately getting ported to everything
3045740	3053060	in the fucking universe, I think of dragon's lair. When I think of laser disc games, I
3053060	3056780	think your average consumer that has the 3DS probably doesn't know what a fucking laser
3056780	3062980	disc is, nor would be interested in mad dog McCree. I have one more question about mad
3062980	3068060	dog McCree on the 3DS. Dark Sakura, since you, you know, we're very familiar with mad
3068060	3074220	dog McCree and you know, you touch that machine in all its places. Was mad dog McCree in 3D?
3074220	3080940	No it wasn't. Why is it on the 3DS? Now I'm deaf in the other ear. Thank you. Okay. And
3080940	3084700	they said that they're not even going to port it over with any kind of 3D added into that.
3084700	3089100	And the quote is, and I'm going to read it. There's really no 3D in the 3DS version because
3089100	3098820	how are you going to do that? You know, it's funny. How are you going to do that is also
3098820	3104160	probably the answer to, um, we're going to need to sell this game. How are you going
3104160	3112900	to do that when no one gives a shit about this game? Seriously, that game is awful.
3112900	3116600	I guarantee you'll sell, you know, twice as many copies as you did the Wii version, which
3116600	3127140	is probably zero. But, but Loki two times zero is zero. Thank you for the math. If you
3127140	3132780	just put them together, it's infinity. You know how much it's going to cost? $4.99 in
3132780	3138820	U S dollars. You know how much you're overpaying by? $10. $4.99 U S dollars. They should pay
3138820	3145020	you to play it. I got to say on the Wii, it's available now, by the way, they were charging
3145020	3150420	like $19.99 for it. So the fact that it's only, you know, five bucks is still gouging
3150420	3156580	you. Just saying they should pay you. It's actually $15 overpriced because they should
3156580	3161940	be paying you $10 and one cent to play it for them. So they can say, Oh, people got
3161940	3168920	her game. The end. Listen, why didn't they just put tits in the game? Then people want
3168920	3174980	to buy it. True. Um, if you're interested in playing a game that has that kind of laser
3174980	3180980	disc vibe to it and even a Western theme, I recommend that you pick up Gun Stringer
3180980	3185300	with the DLC that was, you know, out there for it. What was that game? The time traveler
3185300	3190820	game that was on, um, laser disc that had the cowboy horrible hologram. I know that
3190820	3196980	was awful. I remember it in the arcades and it was a terrible game. I liked cliff technology
3196980	3201260	though because it was really Lupin and the castle of Cagliostro cause you could literally
3201260	3210340	touch that guy's balls. Lupin is coming back. Next story. We're not going to talk about
3210340	3216780	balls anymore. I think if you want, we know. Thank goodness. Um, so let's talk about last
3216780	3221780	week and last week we talked a little bit about, uh, Street Fighter cross Tekken and
3221780	3227560	all the, the screwy things that they're doing with the download content with this game.
3227560	3231600	For example, all the download content for the game is paid to unlock content, which
3231600	3237260	is fantastic. Also those wonderful PlayStation exclusive characters, aside from, okay, you
3237260	3240980	know, the guy from infamous cause it just wouldn't make sense that he was on 360 version
3240980	3248100	and also I believe, uh, the two, those two Japanese cats, um, everything else was also
3248100	3254060	on the disc. Now, Capcom insinuates, listen, listen, this is just to make sure there's
3254060	3258300	compatibility with, you know, the people that don't have the DLC so that, you know, when
3258300	3262580	you're playing them, um, online and stuff like that, that your character data is still
3262580	3269060	there and all that stuff. Okay, fine. That's the excuse you want to use, but at the same
3269060	3274220	time, then why are the beginning and ending movies there? And you know, all the data is
3274220	3278420	on a disc and I understand that you can use it for compatibility. Although Saints Row
3278420	3282880	the third, for example, they have compatibility patches. Um, and there's even like some other
3282880	3287060	games that have compatibility patches. So it's a free download if you don't buy the
3287060	3291900	DLC, but you can play against other people that have the DLC. That way everything works
3291900	3297780	just fine. Um, so you actually don't need to have everything on disc. Really the excuses,
3297780	3303300	you know, it's just an excuse. That's what it is. It's that they're selling you, you
3303300	3312060	know, was a half of the game or whatever beyond, uh, the cost of the actual disc, even though
3312060	3316340	all the content's on there. How's the game selling? I don't know. It's just been out
3316340	3319780	for weeks. Pretty good so far. I thought maybe you'd know from your, I mean, it seems to
3319780	3324520	be pretty good. I just haven't heard that. I don't hear people talking about it. Like
3324520	3328300	I did Street Fighter IV. Now granted, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm not to profess
3328300	3333740	that I am this fighting gang guru guy, but I don't hear as many people talking about
3333740	3337580	it nearly as I am talking, hearing, talking about Mass Effect or that we're talking about
3337580	3342420	Street Fighter IV when it came out. So it's just, I find that interesting. I'm just wondering
3342420	3346860	if there is a backlash occurring, yes or no, because I know I'm not going to buy it because
3346860	3350740	I, it's, it's not even so much the content on the disc thing, although I think that's
3350740	3355660	kind of skeezy. It's just the whole, there's going to be an ultimate edition at some point.
3355660	3362100	Yes, I know they're denying it. I don't believe them. Sorry. I don't believe them. Maybe I'm
3362100	3368140	being a fool, but I'm going to go off track. I could go off Capcom PR statement or I could
3368140	3375560	go off track record. PR, track record. I'm going with track record. Let's see. A Street
3375560	3379900	Fighter IV. Did that have some sort of game? Oh, wait. Yeah. Had a few. A Super Street
3379900	3386860	Fighter IV and then there's Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition and Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3386860	3394860	They didn't even give it nine months. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Uh, yeah. So, anyways,
3394860	3400980	um, and then on top of that, this is, this is great. On top of that, the Xbox 360 version
3400980	3406300	has an issue with it. You can't take your local teams online. It's stated in the manual
3406300	3415340	that you can and the PS3 version can, but the 360, meh, just doesn't work. So, fantastic.
3415340	3419740	And their excuse is, well, the reason for that is the difference between, or the difference
3419740	3425780	is because of the architecture differences between Xbox Live, gamer tags, and PlayStation
3425780	3430300	Network IDs. I'm not sure of the technical details, but basically it amounts to Sony
3430300	3435060	made it so that you can mix and match online and offline. Microsoft made it so you can't.
3435060	3441140	However, Mortal Kombat allows you to do that just fine, so that's full of shit. Um, Halo
3441140	3446420	3 allowed you to do that too. How old is that game? But you used to be able to do split
3446420	3452700	screen and you could go on Xbox Live together. Yeah, and also you can do that in Borderlands.
3452700	3460340	You can do that in Call of Duty, I think. You can do that in quite a few things. But,
3460340	3467740	uh, sure. Whatever. Yeah. Um, okay. So real quick, I just want to talk about DLC because
3467740	3471780	it seems like there's a whole lot of issues. There's even one with, you know, I don't think
3471780	3477020	it's one of the stories you have about Mass Effect 3 and the DLC and stuff like that.
3477020	3481260	And I just, I think we need to set some ground rules on what I think should be acceptable
3481260	3485260	for DLC and what shouldn't as far as timing and that kind of stuff. All right. So let's
3485260	3491060	start off with pay to unlock content. I never think that that should be acceptable at all.
3491060	3497820	It's on disc. You're paying for it. The content was done before the disc was certified and
3497820	3501300	it's ready to go. So it's all ready. They planned it out so that you're going to have
3501300	3505340	to pay for additional con additional content for your game. It wasn't like, Hey, you know
3505340	3508020	what? This is cool. We thought, Hey, these characters aren't in the game. Let's go ahead
3508020	3511500	and add them and you can download them and add them to your game. So it's paid unlock
3511500	3518540	content. Uh, so that should never be acceptable. Day one DLC I think is fine because the reason
3518540	3523580	for that, for example, in the case of Mass Effect 3 game certified, you know, a month
3523580	3529060	or so ago, um, and during that time they were working on DLC, which they got done. It's
3529060	3533980	not on disc at all. It may use some assets from the game, but come on. I mean, if you're
3533980	3537180	using characters from the game, of course you're going to reuse some of that, but a
3537180	3542780	lot of it's brand new and uh, they put it out. Here's the thing. I might take shit for
3542780	3547300	this opinion, but F you. It's my opinion. I don't understand the logic that the people
3547300	3552880	that are hating on the Mass Effect DLC are using because the logic is you shouldn't charge
3552880	3557160	me for something that was being, or what is it that you shouldn't charge for something
3557160	3560540	that you were already making for the game before the game came out. Right. That's kind
3560540	3565760	of like the logic, right? Well, if that was true, shouldn't you have never bought Mass
3565760	3574660	Effect 1 or 2 because, you know, they were just leading up to Mass Effect 3? I mean,
3574660	3578900	kind of. Or, um, you should never have bought Saints Row 2 because you just get it for free
3578900	3583800	with Saints Row 3 on PlayStation. You should never have bought White Knight Chronicles
3583800	3587140	because you get the whole game free with White Knight Chronicles 2. White Knight Chronicles
3587140	3591580	was there for a shit game. Yeah. I mean, their, their logic is, okay, well you should delete
3591580	3595860	or delay it until you have all the download content out for the game and then you just
3595860	3600060	put it on disc. Well, they, they didn't do that. They actually just got it to the point
3600060	3604860	where the first batch of DLC just happened to be done a month or so after they certified
3604860	3610080	a disc and boom, it's day one download content. A lot of it, this, this is where I'm at. A
3610080	3615900	lot of it has to do with value. Is what you're paying for really worth what you're paying
3615900	3619940	for it? And even though I'm not to that point in the series yet and I haven't formed my
3619940	3624980	final opinion on Mass Effect, I'm pretty sure that for fans of Mass Effect, the on disc
3624980	3630400	experience presented with Mass Effect 3 is worth the price of admission. Going to Street
3630400	3635180	Fighter X Tekken, you know what, for a lot of hardcore fighting game fans and for, you
3635180	3638980	know, those individuals, the price of the stuff that's on the disc and even the unlocked
3638980	3645400	stuff is probably still worth it to them and I'm not going to knock that. But for me, everything
3645400	3650820	in that Street Fighter X Tekken has been devalued based on Capcom's history of how they treat
3650820	3656920	fighting games. Is what is on that disc worth $60? Not to me when I know in nine months
3656920	3662960	it'll be down to $40 with everything online included. That's the difference to me from
3662960	3663960	where I'm sitting.
3663960	3668160	Yeah, and if you, if you think that that game, by the time that all the DLC is released is
3668160	3676620	still going to be $60, you are sorely mistaken. That game is going to devalue pretty quick.
3676620	3680780	Especially if it doesn't sell very well. I mean, look at the last Dead Rising 2 game
3680780	3687760	that came out. I mean, off the record, didn't do that well and it's already marked down.
3687760	3692560	I think though, like, there's some companies that are just taking it too far. Like, even
3692560	3696900	with Vol, I don't even know if I, I wouldn't blame Volition because I don't think it's
3696900	3701240	the developer's fault. I think it's the publisher's fault, but let's look at Saints Row the Third.
3701240	3706400	Aside from the DLC that they actually have made separately and beyond, you know, that
3706400	3711800	you actually download, which is fucking terrible so far and it's really sad, everything else
3711800	3717640	has been paid to unlock content. Everything else. All the little costumes, all the little
3717640	3722240	special weapons, those are all paid to unlock content. It's all stuff that was on there.
3722240	3727840	Any of your pre-order bonuses, that's all paid to unlock content. Unless, unless of
3727840	3731080	course it's something that, okay, you get the first thing, a DLC that comes out a month
3731080	3735760	after the game comes out. And that's not, you know, paid to unlock content. But for
3735760	3740600	the most part, you know, those special weapons or skins or whatever, that's all on the disc.
3740600	3747120	And you're, you know, paying money, you know, to have that right, I guess. But it's kind
3747120	3751200	of sad though that they're like, you know, the publishers are getting mad, or not even
3751200	3754840	the publishers and developers, or maybe a little bit both, developers and publishers
3754840	3759760	are getting mad that people are complaining about, oh, well, you know what, too bad. This
3759760	3767720	is how we wanted to do it. Well then, that's not really, I mean, humor the consumer a little
3767720	3771860	bit. If you're playing on releasing these characters, say like, you know, these 12 characters
3771860	3777560	or whatever were, just don't put them on the disc. Just have it so you download them later
3777560	3782960	on. You would be doing the same thing, I don't know, I don't know as far as infrastructure
3782960	3787320	costs go, like if, you know, actually having more than just a key downloaded from Xbox
3787320	3792200	Live or something costs more to the publisher or the developer than it does just the key.
3792200	3800040	Okay, whatever. So say it's not. Just humor the consumer and don't put that data on the
3800040	3805400	disc. Just have it where you actually have to download the physical, you know, data for
3805400	3811280	those characters, all the movies, graphics, everything. And then that way people wouldn't
3811280	3814480	bitch about it and they'd be like, oh my god, this is a great value because look at all
3814480	3818480	these extra characters, Capcom supporting the game long after it's been out. This is
3818480	3823040	fantastic versus I'm getting fucking ripped off because all this stuff was on the disc
3823040	3827240	already. Notice, same thing, you're providing the same amount of content, but it's perception.
3827240	3831040	All right, let me jump in here because DarkSacker, I feel like you're dying to comment on this.
3831040	3836720	I'm just, I already said it in the chat room, so meh. I kind of don't care. I mean, really,
3836720	3843280	I don't because if, like for example, Street Fighter X Tekken, I'm gonna wait, you know,
3843280	3846520	the three months or so and see if they put out another one. If not, I'm gonna buy it
3846520	3851640	cheaper and then I don't have to look at, you know, shitty fake Mega Man.
3851640	3855960	So in other words, the DLC allows you to not get something you know is going to be shitty.
3855960	3861920	Exactly. I didn't give a shit about Jill or Shuma Garath as we call him slash her Shuma
3861920	3866840	Chan at home because I, all the characters I wanted to play were in the game. When Ultimate
3866840	3870880	came out, I was like, oh cool, we get sure to hear you. We have a new game.
3870880	3873920	I know this might be, I already know what the answer to this question is, but I'm gonna
3873920	3877880	ask it anyway. What would you think if you went online and then suddenly you're fighting
3877880	3882240	against someone else who's playing as the Mega Man you don't want to see?
3882240	3889400	DC. I'd seriously quit the match. Keep in mind, I'm the same person that if there is
3889400	3896480	one single troll in my dungeon run, I will leave party because I don't, my time is important
3896480	3902480	and I don't have to put up with shit I don't like. You know, I really, if I want a game,
3902480	3906080	I'm going to buy the game regardless of what's already on the desk. I don't really care.
3906080	3911360	All right. I'm going to try to wrap this up. Bobby is sending a link to the official DLC
3911360	3915360	response for Mass Effect 3. In a nutshell, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but
3915360	3920400	it's kind of what we already know is Bioware's approach to this is that, you know, they finished
3920400	3926560	Mass Effect 3 before they did the DLC, but in order to do DLC, you have to kind of put,
3926560	3931560	and this is the part that's kind of, you know, more information. You have to put the seeds
3931560	3936520	of the DLC in the game or you can't have the DLC interact with the game that's already
3936520	3938760	pressed on the disk. If that makes sense.
3938760	3942640	You have to have the code that's going to access the info.
3942640	3945880	And I don't think there's any problem with having an outline of, we know we want to do
3945880	3949960	this, this, and this later on. Kind of Saints Row clearly did the same thing as Mediocre's
3949960	3953640	content did. You know, they, they knew that they, what, what packs they were going to
3953640	3956880	do. In fact, didn't they advertise it from day one? The Gangsters in Space was going
3956880	3958160	to be an add on eventually.
3958160	3961920	It wasn't day one, but they had, they, there's, you know, obviously they were selling the
3961920	3966160	season passes, which I have a problem with season passes, but that's the same problem
3966160	3972640	as like paying money up front for, I don't know, whatever. It, I don't like season passes
3972640	3973800	either. I think it's stupid.
3973800	3979440	Nito, Nito comment from E3VL or Evil, I suppose, in our chat room. Whatever happened to unlocking
3979440	3982440	characters the traditional way?
3982440	3982440	It's not.
3982440	3984000	You can still do that in some games.
3984000	3984520	Some games.
3984520	3985640	It's not cost effective.
3985640	3987680	Probably not a Capcom game.
3987680	3992840	That is a, but that's a, that's a sad, I mean, it's a good question, but it's a sad question.
3992840	3998000	Because the modern gamer seriously doesn't really want to work for anything.
3998000	4000440	Hence why they'll put up the 99 cent unlock thing.
4000440	4004000	Exactly. Because it's instant gratification.
4004000	4008760	I'll tell you exactly why that's not unlocked in the traditional ways anymore. Because back
4008760	4012760	in the day when, you know, a lot of that stuff was unlocked traditionally is through playing
4012760	4018120	through the story mode. Nowadays, most gamers are split between single player and multiplayer.
4018120	4022400	And a lot of people are purchasing this game just to play multiplayer and they won't even
4022400	4027440	touch the single player. And so why make someone go through the single player when they're
4027440	4029840	not going to, you know, play it?
4029840	4033840	All right. Well, let's move on. Again, lots of opinions. And we look to hear yours at
4033840	4040600	mailbagorangelawnsradio.com. Some drama going on over in the UK with a retailer over there.
4040600	4044040	Now this isn't a retailer that exists here. So sometimes we forget about these guys, but
4044040	4049120	it's a store simply called Game. And I like that. I've never really seen the stores outside
4049120	4053520	of these little pictures, but it's just a big old building that says Game in the same
4053520	4055360	font as Game Boy.
4055360	4060000	Oh, a type nerd would pick up on that. I didn't pick up on that. Except they're kerning is
4060000	4065840	really tragic way. Well, it's going to say closed pretty soon on the top of it if things
4065840	4069560	keep going the way they're going, because apparently game is in trouble. Now game, we've
4069560	4074720	already heard of some trouble going on there. They didn't sell Mass Effect 3. It won their
4074720	4080480	street fighter cross Tekken. You can't get it at Game. That is not good when the retailer
4080480	4083200	will not sell the games people are looking for.
4083200	4088960	I know exactly what's going on here, because this exact same thing happened with Blockbuster.
4088960	4094040	What happened was is when they get into this financial problems where they're like facing
4094040	4099280	bankruptcy or I don't know if they've even filed bankruptcy yet or whatever, these publishers
4099280	4103840	are concerned about getting paid for their product. And so they don't extend them credit
4103840	4108640	any more. And so because of that, they're unable to purchase games. Where in the case
4108640	4113800	of Blockbuster, Blockbuster had to purchase games through a distributor and the distributor
4113800	4122700	basically covered, they floated them the credit, I guess, some way. And so basically they assume
4122700	4127320	all the risk for them. And unfortunately it sounds like that there's no UK distributor,
4127320	4131360	although I can't imagine that there's not UK distributors or maybe at least someone
4131360	4134720	that's not willing to float that kind of credit risk.
4134720	4139000	But that's what's going on here. That's why you're seeing certain publishers are not carrying
4139000	4142600	certain games and stuff. And I'm assuming it's going to be a lot of publishers if we're
4142600	4148920	talking EA, Ubisoft, I can't remember the other one, Capcom, Street Fighter Cross Tekken.
4148920	4151960	I'm not sure who the publishers are, because I know there's different publishers in the
4151960	4158360	UK. But I mean, if it's going to be, you're going to see it's going to be specific companies
4158360	4162000	and they're going to stop giving them credit. And that's why they're not carrying the games.
4162000	4165600	Well, just to further illustrate how serious this issue is, apparently Game is behind on
4165600	4170000	the rent. They have to pay some landlords in about two weeks. And if they don't, thousands
4170000	4175120	of jobs could be at risk. And that is obviously not going to be good news. Now, there is a
4175120	4179440	company that's kind of circling around like a hawk that might be picking these guys up
4179440	4185360	and that would be GameStop or as we call it here on Sunday nights at all games, Evil G.
4185360	4190280	GameStop particularly is interested in the Spanish arm of the business, apparently. And
4190280	4194800	I think this has to do with the fact that GameStop did try to do UK before, but they
4194800	4199720	closed some stores. But that doesn't necessarily mean they won't buy all of Game, it's just
4199720	4203360	Spanish is of particular interest, other countries, maybe.
4203360	4208800	They're just waiting for it to devalue enough and they'll swoop right in. I guarantee that
4208800	4215360	they'll probably buy it because it just makes sense that they're they're going to they're
4215360	4219560	not going to come out of this. I mean, yeah, this is this is kind of probably past that.
4219560	4222660	It's going to it's going to have to be someone buying them.
4222660	4225600	And Pete Caruno is in our chat room and I know he's from over there. The nice thing
4225600	4229880	is with the whole spring forward here, we did a little early. I think it's an hour early
4229880	4236160	for the folks overseas to tune into OLR live now. Pete Caruno says, I have 15, 15. I can't
4236160	4239880	see the pounds. Is it pounds? OK, because I can't see how it translates over here as
4239880	4245080	it comes up a special text. I have 15 pounds of vouchers with them. Need to spend it soon.
4245080	4250760	Yes, I would recommend if you have any sort of gift cards, the game, get those. Just buy
4250760	4255440	something, buy something, trade them in for cash if you can, if you can do that over there.
4255440	4259820	I know you can in California, but if it's a certain amount, but yeah, buy something
4259820	4264480	soon and it'll have to be an older game. Like Mass Effect one or something you've missed
4264480	4270840	out on in the past. There you go. All right. So, well, good luck game. You're going to
4270840	4277040	need it. DarkSakura? Bad game, no cookie. So there's some information out about Metal
4277040	4284880	Gear Solid HD Collection for the Vita. If anyone cares. Rob cares. So it's the Vita
4284880	4289480	version is going to have HD remasters of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 with all
4289480	4295320	of the trophies and crap that the PS3 version does. They didn't say anything about Peace
4295320	4300080	Walker though. There is something that says they have a rebalanced user interface that's
4300080	4305600	going to go a little bit more with this transferring system that's being developed. What it's,
4305600	4311360	what the transferring is, is basically some type of cloud storage. It's called title user
4311360	4317920	storage, TUS, where your save game is going to transfer via whatever that cloud is and
4317920	4327480	you can access it on both PS3 and on Vita without using Wi-Fi. So that's how tiny the
4327480	4332360	gamer memory is because I completely forgot about transferring. Thank you for reminding
4332360	4341600	me. Well, the Japanese release date is June 28th. It's summer over here too. All right.
4341600	4344560	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner.
4344560	4350720	One other thing. You've got different things available with the touch panel. You have zooming
4350720	4357160	like with your binoculars on event scenes. You can close up in the cinematics. So kind
4357160	4360640	of working in those little features of the Vita. You know, make the Vita special. It's
4360640	4365040	kind of neat. So I thought I'd add that. All right. Release dates. Loki starting off here
4365040	4372320	locally in the US. Ah, yes. Um, let's start off with Silent Hill Downpour finally coming
4372320	4381140	out. Hope it's good. Uh, that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week. Um, of course today
4381140	4390600	Mario Party 9 came out. Yakuza Dead Souls on the PlayStation 3. GG. I don't know. Something
4390600	4397160	based off a toy with, it's like, I guess they have a toy that's hermit crabs. I don't know.
4397160	4403640	Every DS game. Um, Silverlicious based off a book series. That's also on the DS as well.
4403640	4407720	Uh, the foreign one action pack from South peak. It's a bunch of really terrible PlayStation
4407720	4414360	network games. Uh, so that sounds like fan. Fantastic fun there. Uh, Naruto is shipping
4414360	4420400	in ultimate Ninja storm generations on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 birds of steel on PlayStation
4420400	4429520	3 and Xbox 360 this week as well. Tales of Graces F on PlayStation 3 Ridge Racer on the
4429520	4437360	Vita. I don't want to play that, but it's still not fucking worth it. Um, FIFA streets
4437360	4447800	on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reality fighters on the Vita and uh, let's see what else here.
4447800	4452360	And that would be it. All right. Traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases
4452360	4457960	over there, uh, in Japan on the 360 mass effect three gets released on March the 15th. Uh,
4457960	4462340	it's Japanese release. I don't know if that means all the dialogue has been redubbed with
4462340	4468120	Japanese voice actors. I would assume so. Um, but you know, there you go. SSX also coming
4468120	4472320	out in Japan this week on the three 60 going over to the PlayStation three. It's pretty
4472320	4477780	much the same story. Mass effect is there as well and as X, X S S X. But there are some
4477780	4483480	other games coming out as well. A resident evil five AE or biohazard five AE and revival
4483480	4487960	selection HD remaster twin pack. So there's like a whole little like double games for
4487960	4493480	a little less money. Sengoku, Bissara three. Ooh, Tage double pack comes out as well as
4493480	4499720	Shin Sengoku Musou online. Ryujin Rambo comes out this week and that is obviously it's an
4499720	4505080	online game. Is that dynasty warriors? I think it is. Yeah, it's dynasty warriors online
4505080	4508140	and it sounds like it's some type of expansion pack coming out for that on the PlayStation
4508140	4514200	three this week. Looking at the handhelds real quick. Let's check out the Vita on the
4514200	4519160	Vita this week. Slaughter mania, slaughter me. Best name ever. No, it's no, no, it's
4519160	4525160	not slaughter like S Sergeant slaughter. It's S L O T T E R likes like pachinko machine
4525160	4531560	slaughter mania five black lagoon. But the cool thing is it's a slot machine and then
4531560	4536000	a chick with a big gun. Yeah, she's like, you're going to give me that money or I'll
4536000	4540720	put a bullet in you. And then it's a slot machine. There's a little like automate cutscenes
4540720	4545960	with guns and cigarettes and I like the twin be one all sorts of vices. Also FIFA soccer
4545960	4551400	on the Vita. Yeah, but you can't shoot the players. There's no guns to be found in FIFA
4551400	4556840	soccer. You can throw a ball at their heads. You can, uh, going to the three ds real quick.
4556840	4561520	Um, only one game coming out from d three this week. Oh, no, no. Cool to me. She soon
4561520	4566680	he, it comes out this week and I don't know what it is, but it's another game featuring
4566680	4574760	dating in school uniforms, dating. Oh man. She, Oh, I feel like the dateline guys are
4574760	4577840	going to show up at my house just for bringing that picture up on my computer. I told you
4577840	4581880	from the beginning I was a dating SIM. I have a seat over there. Oh no, no. Cool is like
4581880	4587400	little girl. Don't import. Don't import the game or what's his name will show up at your
4587400	4591200	house. Chris Hansen. Is that his name? Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't buy that game. Go to another
4591200	4598320	country now. Yes please. Okay. How about the u k on March 12th all zombies must die on
4598320	4605040	the 13th shoot many robots. That's a clever name and warp on March 14th journey for the

4642360	4646520	Couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Oh, Loki, whatever
4646520	4651920	possible surprise news story could you be talking about next? Let's talk about the iPad.
4651920	4657600	Yes, I know. Shocker. There was a new iPad announced this week and it's called the new
4657600	4662120	iPad in case you hadn't heard. In case you hadn't heard, I'm full of lust. It was pretty
4662120	4666040	much all the rumored stuff except for the really weird stuff that they started remembering
4666040	4671560	this week. Um, it's got the, you know, the retina display. It's got the upgraded camera
4671560	4679040	that was, uh, in the iPhone four s quad core process or quad core, um, a five X processor
4679040	4689360	and a, also a, um, uh, what else? 4g connectivity. Uh, of course now everybody's phone is starting
4689360	4694120	to show 4g connectivity even though they're not 4g phones. If you're on AT&T it's because
4694120	4698440	of the multiple different types of 4g networks that existed and they're all being, um, solidified
4698440	4703800	into the one that I think Verizon uses. So, uh, those are out and of course it's gonna
4703800	4709000	range anywhere in price for the wifi version from four 99 to six 99 depending on how much
4709000	4716200	storage you want or for the four g six 29 through eight 29 and they will go on sale
4716200	4724560	this week, March 16th. Um, fantastic. Of course, you know, with this they got to, you know,
4724560	4730560	show the, Hey, Hey, we, we can do games. So, um, you know, they showed off a new infinity
4730560	4736680	blade game and flame infinity blade dungeons. That's a prequel to infinity blade and a look
4736680	4742400	kind of like God of war. Uh, and then also a flight SIM game called sky gamblers that
4742400	4749880	kind of looked like, um, ACE combat. And that was from Namco. Uh, unfortunately no buttons,
4749880	4753640	still no buttons other than the, you know, the home button. And, uh, or unless you buy
4753640	4759040	an Ikea, which isn't an official Apple product, so they don't talk about it. So, um, which
4759040	4763320	was interesting because they made a claim, uh, that there was a claim during the press
4763320	4767160	conference where they attacked essentially the three 16, the PlayStation three and said,
4767160	4773580	this thing does more pixels at once than a millions, millions more pixels at once than
4773580	4778000	a X-Box three 60 year PlayStation three, because the resolution is greater than 10 80 P 10
4778000	4783480	80 means 10 80 by. And one of these suckers is what, 2000 something. Yeah, it was like
4783480	4789600	29 something. But once again, graphics aren't everything. You can have a really beautiful
4789600	4795840	game that controls like shit and it will be terrible. It's also how the developers utilize
4795840	4801640	it. I mean, cause you know, you have to upper as everything or you have to make, you know,
4801640	4805200	your games actually utilize that stuff in order for it to work out. Plus, you know,
4805200	4809920	the hardware and the limitations there. I mean, I'm, I don't get me wrong. Those games
4809920	4814840	are probably gonna look really nice, but do I really want a game that controls, you know,
4814840	4818520	via tilts or, you know, touch screen and some of the touch screen stuff. I mean, infinity
4818520	4826240	blade was all right, you know, with touch screen, but it's just, I don't know. Fine.
4826240	4832560	You know, brag about your, your resolution of your screen, stuff like that. But at the
4832560	4837560	same time also you gotta remember you do have some faults. There are people that are completely
4837560	4843120	swayed by shiny. So, well, I'm not going to lie. I still kind of want one. I just, I don't
4843120	4848680	feel like I need one right away at this point. But I mean, not even from a game standpoint,
4848680	4851840	I'm just like, I want to watch movies in bed on that thing cause there's not going to be
4851840	4856680	a better screen than that. But I have a Vita, you know, don't cry me a river. I'm going
4856680	4859960	to be okay not having one of those day one. And see, I was actually already planning on
4859960	4862800	getting one because I have a legitimate need of it for school. There's some really good
4862800	4867320	note taking apps and that, well, they have the whole I university book thing now too.
4867320	4872080	That's pretty cool. Yeah. Well, there's also an app that will let you type in your notes
4872080	4877420	and it timestamps your notes in conjunction with where you started in the lecture while
4877420	4882360	it records the lecture. And for me with my hand, that's perfect because then I can record
4882360	4887040	my lecture and actually take notes and say this slide was used at this point or this
4887040	4890500	and that and the other was used at that point, which I'm using my netbook already. Yes, I'm
4890500	4897280	using my netbook, um, which does just fine. But for my hand problems, you know, typing
4897280	4903680	on an iPad will be easier. So I'm actually, now that the new ones are, you know, there
4903680	4908880	I'm going to get one. That's the plan. Anyway, I have a legitimate need for it. I'm buying
4908880	4911840	it for school.
4911840	4916560	Loki I probably don't even ask to ask you how you feel about the new iPad. And by the
4916560	4920640	way, just to go back to our chat room and chat, that orange sounds ready.com Amiga 777
4920640	4924040	says, really? That's actually going to be the real name. I thought that the article
4924040	4929120	I read was going to be a joke. It's not that the name is the new iPad. That's not the name.
4929120	4935900	The name is iPad. That's it. Just like I Mac, they don't differentiate between them or airbook
4935900	4940780	or Mac mini. They don't differentiate between the different ones. It's just, it's the iPod
4940780	4947160	or iPad flavor of the month. Fine. iPad third generation. Fair enough. I mean, how are you
4947160	4951460	going to call it on your website? You're going to have, you know, uh, I think most people
4951460	4957300	are going to call it iPad three or iPad HD. I would say iPad HD. I still know why they
4957300	4962360	got to be all, uh, stubborn about it. Well, we're not going to put a number on it. You
4962360	4965280	make it sound like we release these things every few years or something. I mean, what
4965280	4973000	the hell? Because it's branding and marketing. End of story. They do it that way because
4973000	4977200	they have to do it that way because they want people, when you think of iPad, they want
4977200	4984520	you to think of the newest, best version of it that they have. I get it, but I feel bad
4984520	4989800	for those that can't tell the difference because there will be people out there that buy iPad
4989800	4994560	off Craigslist and get one of those first generation iPads, you know, which, you know,
4994560	4998920	let the buyer beware. I know, I know, but I'm just saying, I feel a little bad for those
4998920	5004400	people. I don't. If they didn't take the time to contact the seller and verify it, that's
5004400	5012600	their fault. All right. One more story before the classic game of the week. Um, that is
5012600	5019120	rock band. Yep. Still relevant. Nope. I'm not talking about rock band four. It's just
5019120	5023200	that. And you know, I can admit this is, this is a really nice thing to hear. Harmonics
5023200	5028400	has basically commented that rock band releases aren't stopping. One of the few things to
5028400	5032240	come out of game developers conference 2012, a harmonic says, quote, we've been really
5032240	5036000	pleased with the continued performance of rock band downloadable content. We've delivered
5036000	5041040	over four years of weekly DLC and over 3,500 songs to the music platform. And we have no
5041040	5046560	plans to stop weekly releases anytime soon. If there's a song you still want, rock band
5046560	5050840	folks encourage you to go look at the Facebook app that they have and vote for artists on
5050840	5055640	the wishlist. And this kind of makes me wonder if guitar heroes ever going to come back because
5055640	5060720	how can you compete with that kind of a library? It's going to be difficult. Um, harmonics,
5060720	5064640	by the way, also said they have no intentions of doing rock band for this year. They have
5064640	5069240	some other projects going on right now. So maybe rock band is on the back burner until
5069240	5074640	the next, you know, X-Box or playstations are being talked about and maybe some of those
5074640	5079120	features being used. I'm strangely okay with this. You know, as much as I love rock band
5079120	5082640	and would love to see a rock band for, I kind of get where, well, maybe there's not a whole
5082640	5087200	lot else you can do with it. So the props to them for continuing to support the game
5087200	5095800	with true DLC, you know what I mean? True, reasonably priced variety, varied, not on
5095800	5102160	the disc DLC. Yeah. Now that is continuing. And when they say that they're going to support
5102160	5109080	it weekly, they support it weekly and they continue to support it. Unlike some companies
5109080	5116080	Konami. Hey, there was a third DLC pack for a party or what is it? Rhythm party this week.
5116080	5121560	The Xbox three 60 game that everybody fan won't acknowledge exists. What weird songs
5121560	5127920	do they have this time? Uh, Stacy Q, who I think did two of hearts years and years ago
5127920	5134680	was one of the songs. And one of the, one of the chicks from sister sledge has a song.
5134680	5139000	It's it's crazy. The obscurity of that stuff. That might've been the first DLC bundle. I
5139000	5141920	can't remember. That was, I think that was the one you talked about. What was it? There's
5141920	5149960	there's you look it up. I played it when it first came out and I already forgot. Sorry.
5149960	5156000	But now a rhythm party. If you have all the DLC is up to like, no, no, it's funny. No.
5156000	5161680	About 20 songs maybe starting to feel a little more like a full game. All right, but let's
5161680	5166020	travel. Let's travel back to a day when there wasn't DLC, shall we? We're going to take
5166020	5172760	a trip down memory lane to a time when games are simpler. Not in this case. It might still
5172760	5178160	be a difficult game, but, uh, back before where there was this fancy schmancy cover
5178160	5183360	and dialogue trees. This one had nine inch nails. Awesome. What is the classic game of
5183360	5190360	the week? Quake. Yeah, seriously. If you guys, if Alan can do half life while I'm gone, but
5190360	5197600	I can do quake. Um, quake is if you don't know what quake is and you need to get out
5197600	5203480	from under the rock that you've been under for the last 20 years. Um, quake is a first
5203480	5209800	person shooter game that came out by, um, the same people that gave us doom. Surprise,
5209800	5214480	surprise. Um, and it spawned a whole series of games that actually came out on steam on
5214480	5221240	August 3rd, 2007. Basically you have to go navigate through the level and you face enemies
5221240	5226840	and you have to open doors and do different things. But when you start a level, you have
5226840	5233120	three different pathways. It's an easy, medium and hard skill level. And to get to like the
5233120	5239400	nightmare level, you have to, um, go into a secret passageway and stuff. So basically,
5239400	5245160	um, you've got different episodes of about eight levels each and there's even a low gravity
5245160	5250600	episode too. Um, but you collect all these different items and you carry them onto the
5250600	5255440	next level and then the next level gets, you know, more challenging. When you die, you
5255440	5259320	have to restart at the beginning of that level, but you can save your game as many times as
5259320	5264520	you want. Um, you also do have multiplayer, like a death match. You've got, I think there
5264520	5270120	was captured the flag. Yeah. But I mean, I really don't need to go into too much detail
5270120	5276600	about the story of Quake because seriously, it's what happened with Quake. Who gives a
5276600	5281680	fuck about the story? This is just about killing bitches. Pretty much. I mean, basically you
5281680	5288320	have to stop an enemy named Quake. That's pretty much it. And it's sort of like a military
5288320	5292880	operation that sends you through. It's like, it's like Doom. It's dark fantasy. So, um,
5292880	5298920	but anyway, it's what happened with this game. I'm going to switch from the ambient noises
5298920	5310040	to the actual music here. Yeah. Okay. It's pretty much what happened with this game after
5310040	5318860	that. It was a VGA full color, uh, game. You know, there's an ASCII version of it. I actually
5318860	5324360	did know that. There's an ASCII version of Quake. It's where the Quake engine went with
5324360	5332920	this. That game engine has been in so many other games. Basically it's, um, it uses,
5332920	5337440	it was polygon models instead of the sprites, you know, the way that Doom did it. You have
5337440	5343720	full 3d level design, different light maps that are pre-rendered. You've got all kinds
5343720	5350680	of abilities to modify it because there is a huge Quake modding, um, uh, community out
5350680	5355760	there. I remember bringing up on the show, um, playing Gotcha Quake, which was Gotcha
5355760	5359840	Mon Patch for Quake. That's why we have talked about this on the show before. I knew it came
5359840	5364240	out before, but it's not just a classic movie. Did you know it was developed by John Carmack?
5364240	5369880	I did know that. Yep. Um, also Michael Abrash and Johnny Cash as opposed to Johnny Cash
5369880	5376680	who was dead. He wasn't at the time. What? And not his son either. And I was just thinking
5376680	5382200	about, you know, the people that did the soundtrack. Johnny Cash was involved with the cover, but
5382200	5389160	nevermind. Anyway, but if this was like pretty much the king of first person shooter games
5389160	5395560	for the longest time, um, there, huh? I was gonna say, even I played the shit out of this
5395560	5400400	game in college. We used to call, like this is back in, um, you know, when we had used
5400400	5404560	modems to dial into everything, but my friends at Sonoma State had like one of those state
5404560	5408760	of the art T one lines or whatever. So we'd all call into their server at Sonoma State.
5408760	5414040	We play the fuck out of this game till like two in the morning. Yeah. So much fun. Multiplayers.
5414040	5421000	I mean, well, basically when, um, the, uh, before there was even a demo, there was, uh,
5421000	5427080	arcade software put out Q test, which is a February 24th, 1996. That was a tech demo
5427080	5433760	that had three multiplayer maps. And basically it just lit a fire cause when Quake came out,
5433760	5440360	there were servers everywhere popping up. I mean, just basically like you were saying,
5440360	5444880	and uh, you know, there were people reskinning the textures, you know, reskinning the whole
5444880	5451360	visuals, making new maps, you name it. That's what really came out. It's basically, um,
5451360	5458400	scripted in, um, Quake C was I believe the, the code for it, the coding for it. And the
5458400	5465120	first, um, Quake mod that came out was Team Fortress, which was capture the flag, but
5465120	5470560	it had that class system basically. And we know where Team Fortress has gone since then.
5470560	5476960	So there was also, um, three wave capture the flag. There was, uh, you know, I've actually
5476960	5483480	seen where someone used, um, they did it first in Quake and then went and did it in Half
5483480	5491200	Life where they redid the whole ending of, um, of, uh, Cube 2.
5491200	5498760	Oh yeah. Yeah. But there were like different, uh, you know, they created different bots
5498760	5505000	for it. There's Rocket Arena where, uh, you didn't have to really know the levels that
5505000	5508000	well. It was really more of a matter of how you played it. There's people that do speed
5508000	5516720	runs. Um, there's the big nickname Quake done quick. You remember that? There's also a second
5516720	5522320	attempt that was called Quake done quicker that beat the game in 16 minutes, 35 seconds,
5522320	5527200	which actually reduced it from three minutes from the original run. And I think that now
5527200	5534320	they're down to it having been beaten in 12 minutes. So that's pretty good. So yeah, there's
5534320	5541240	all kinds of different, it's, it's really blown up since then. Like, um, going to this,
5541240	5547480	uh, image on here, that's basically the family tree of Quake games. We have on here coming
5547480	5554760	from Quake, we have Quakeworld that spawned Twilight and more Quakeworld, Zquake, FTE,
5554760	5560400	um, Doom 3 eventually came from, uh, Quake 3, which was built on Quake 2, built from,
5560400	5566160	uh, the first Quake. So we've got, like, all of these different ones. Medal of Honor, um,
5566160	5575400	Allied Assault. We have, uh, STV Elite Forces 2 on the list. We have Paintball. Jedi Academy.
5575400	5581440	There's all kinds of games on here that run off of variants of the original Quake engine.
5581440	5588120	So basically your first person shooters are what they are today because of Quake. Just
5588120	5596760	saying. And also you can play it on, um, the Amiga. God, that's how old this game was.
5596760	5602000	It actually runs on an Amiga. There's a port for it on the Amiga. The ports I really need
5602000	5606720	to get into. Well, they made the source cord pub or source code. So source code public
5606720	5613440	some time ago, right? Yes. Um, the Commodore Amiga port was done in 1998 by ClickBoom.
5613440	5618280	And then, but it's only available in 68K. Uh, there was a Linux version that was made
5618280	5624280	by an id software employee. Of course there was a Linux version. For fun, in a spare time.
5624280	5628800	And then in 1999 there's a retail version, um, for Linux that was put out by, uh, Macmillan
5628800	5635980	Digital. There also had two add-ons, which was the offering for Linux. So there's a Mac
5635980	5641720	version now that was done by Macsoft. Um, there's Sega, it came out on Sega Saturn,
5641720	5647120	Nintendo 64. There are all kinds of versions. There's Nintendo DS versions of Quake. There's
5647120	5652800	Quake DS and SeaQuake. So you name it, you can play Quake on it probably. You probably
5652800	5659200	play Quake on a toaster. So that's it. There it is, your classic game of the week. A true,
5659200	5665960	true classic indeed. Quake. I remember playing Quake 3 on the Dreamcast with our ethernet
5665960	5670040	adapter. Quake 3 was amazing. And you know what, if you want to just, like, play Quake
5670040	5675460	inspired games, go play Quake Live, because that's basically Quake 3. And even though
5675460	5680000	there's lots of differences between Quake 1 and Quake 3, eh, it's still a good time.
5680000	5685320	ASCII Quake. ASCII Quake is just funny. Yeah, it's funny for like two seconds. Alright.
5685320	5690560	Then you're like, this is annoying. Escape. This makes my eyes hurt. Ow. Alright, uh,
5690560	5693680	that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Launch Radio, but we have plenty more to come. Don't
5693680	5696800	go anywhere. Don't stop your iPods. Don't turn off your live stream of all games, because
5696800	5702120	we got plenty more to come. Rapid Fire News, Fugal Question, Mailbag, FUs, your calls,
5702120	5713360	more news when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio. Welcome back everybody to Orange
5713360	5718020	Launch Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. We are live here with episode number
5718020	5722820	449 of our show at All Games Radio. Hope you guys are joining us live. If you've never
5722820	5726080	listened live before, you really should join us sometime. We got a very full chat tonight.
5726080	5730000	Just want to give a shout out to all of our chatters. Some folks talking about the music
5730000	5733640	we played on Break. Obviously we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast. There's
5733640	5738100	like laws and stuff. We would like to continue to deliver our podcast. But we had music from
5738100	5741600	Street Fighter and we had music from Tekken, because I was doing a little joke there, Street
5741600	5747280	Fighter and Tekken. And some folks are talking about kind of, you know, what songs, what
5747280	5752680	stage music they prefer, or what character. In the case of Act Deft in our chatroom says,
5752680	5757440	Cami greater than Chun Li. That's just cause she shows her butt. If you do, if you win
5757440	5760040	with a special move, doesn't she show her butt? Okay, I have to tell you where that
5760040	5769140	came from. What? Dan's little brother. It was a friend of ours son was saying, whenever
5769140	5774560	Cami does her wind pose and turns around, she goes, look at my butt. That's what he
5774560	5781300	would say. Loki? I was going to make the argument that is because she was, she's not American
5781300	5784920	though. So I can't make that argument, but I thought that they're drawing some sort of
5784920	5790360	a comparison to soundtracks of a certain other game and one being superior to the other,
5790360	5798520	you know, the non Japanese being superior. Stop it right now. Stop it. All right. But,
5798520	5804320	but, but to be fair, UK and Japanese have the same soundtrack. So hot. Ikuma JP says,
5804320	5808940	I don't use female characters in any game. I think that, I think that's just Street Fighter
5808940	5812840	he's talking about. But I noticed in fighting games that the female characters tend to be
5812840	5816800	like the ones that are quick and agile. You know, I know that's kind of stereotype, but
5816800	5820840	that's how I use almost all female characters. Me too. Like accepting King of Fighters where
5820840	5825000	they all look androgynous. I used to be a pretty good Chun Li player like back in the
5825000	5832240	day. I want a very non agile, large female character. They probably do exist. I'm like
5832240	5835460	trying to think you'd probably have to go to like the Neo Geo series. The only character
5835460	5839720	that I can think of in the Street Fighter series that's female and sizable would be
5839720	5851080	Elena and her legs. Mm hmm. Um, there's also, um, no, I can't think of one. Um, but I know
5851080	5857080	that there's male characters that are, you know, like a Vega. If you want to do Street
5857080	5862360	Fighter, one thing of the sizable male characters, like what was this? Well, that's what I'm
5862360	5866960	saying. We need a large, sassy black woman as like you do. Uh, I was trying to think
5866960	5872520	of one exit. Well, you can, you can create to your heart's content and soul caliber,
5872520	5875800	which I was thinking Ivy doesn't exactly, of course, nothing in soul caliber is really
5875800	5879320	agile. I mean, it's sort of caliber is kind of a different style of fighting. I guess
5879320	5883440	that's not true. Some would say like Voldo is like an agile type of character, but Voldo
5883440	5888160	is also into bondage and shows off his package regularly. Not that there's anything wrong
5888160	5892840	with that. All right. Now let's move on. We've got to get back into some gaming news. Uh,
5892840	5896360	we still have a lot of room to go here before we get to your calls later on in the show.
5896360	5900480	So Loki, how about some news? All right, let's talk about the new Sim city. They showed it
5900480	5907880	off at GDC and uh, it looks pretty, it's not scheduled to come out until 2013. Um, and
5907880	5912920	it will be on PC, but it looks like they've really amped up the detail, everything, you
5912920	5917800	know, from actually seeing the individual cars driving around to the way, how much control
5917800	5922280	you have over. It's just ridiculous. The amount of control, but a pretty awesome looking and
5922280	5929760	we'll run on in this new glass box engine, uh, which like I said, it's really, really
5929760	5938200	detailed. Um, yeah, so very cool looking game. Sorry. This has nothing to do with Sim city,
5938200	5943240	but my mind is still suck stuck on the whole, uh, you want to like large sassy lady in a
5943240	5948000	fighting game. And my mind for some reason instantly went to Latrice Royale from RuPaul's
5948000	5952320	drag race. And that made me think, wouldn't RuPaul's drag race make the best fighting
5952320	5958640	game ever? That would be great. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. No,
5958640	5967160	really your life. I was thinking that Oprah should be downloadable. Then he could have,
5967160	5970960	you know, Sharon needles with her party city attack. It'd be great. Anyway, there's like
5970960	5974400	two people listening that'll get that joke. Oh yeah. I actually know who Sharon needles
5974400	5982040	is. Sim city. Yeah. Um, remember the old games? Yeah. Old Sim city games were hilarious. Did
5982040	5988880	you ever play the Sim city game that was on the PC on CD rom? Like they had a not, I'm
5988880	5992080	not talking about the first computer one cause obviously the old school one, I think a lot
5992080	5995480	of us have played cause there's a port of it on super Nintendo, but there's one on CD
5995480	6002160	that had like it hoard the full motion video and there was some bad video. Did you ever
6002160	6007780	play it? I did not play that one. The first Sim city game I played was on five and a quarter
6007780	6013560	floppies that uh, was in black and white. Well, the monitor I had was in black and white,
6013560	6019480	but a really old Sim city. Then I played some city 2000 a little bit. I didn't really care
6019480	6024240	for it too much. I was like, whoa, this is way more complicated than Sim city. So this
6024240	6028240	game is like, I didn't like the minute I was like, wait, I have to build like piping and
6028240	6032760	shit too. Yeah, no. Yeah. That's this game. The manager, sewer systems. I'm like, I just
6032760	6039560	want to build buildings and have Godzilla attack them. I saw the most scary thing ever,
6039560	6045800	ever for Sim city. What's that was this guy who basically created the most efficient city
6045800	6052760	in Sim city with 6 million people and fully functioning everything. But the thing that
6052760	6058320	he sacrificed was longevity of the people. So he had them dying off at like 50, but his
6058320	6065520	city was the most efficient and he spent four years making it. Wow. That's frightening forever.
6065520	6071880	And he's got himself exactly. It's the forever alone guy. He plays Sim city, but seriously,
6071880	6075720	there's like a YouTube on there of him bragging about his shit with this epic music and all
6075720	6079880	I can think of. That's so sad. Speaking of YouTube, I've got to play this for you guys
6079880	6084880	since you haven't seen it. This is one of the great cut scenes from that Sim city PC.
6084880	6089680	Remember when everything had to have full motion video? Yes. So this was like that period
6089680	6093320	where like every adventure you've had. Okay. Here's, here's a great cut scene back from
6093320	6099200	the Sim city days. So this is like one of the action news sequences that would chime
6099200	6109280	into your game when things happen. Check out that 1994 rendering. Finally in the new 90
6109280	6114800	year old Yancy Kornblatt was arrested last night for flashing for the 79th time. Kornblatt
6114800	6122360	told the court that he was going to retire, but decided to stick it out one more year.
6122360	6126280	We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the Sim
6126280	6132480	city nuclear power plant. Plant may reach critical mass at any moment and explode above
6132480	6139480	do not panic. Repeat, do not panic. Stay calm. Even though radiation may fear or flash internals
6139480	6145520	always just listening slices of human spam. Everything will be just peachy. Do not panic.
6145520	6152220	And the Oscar goes to, I don't know the pun. Horribly bad lipstick. Basic ass bitch from
6152220	6161200	Sim city action news. We should do a, where are they now? I would like to know what happened
6161200	6166560	here. Mocap or it was a full motion video actors and actresses. Where are they now?
6166560	6176160	I would love that as a segment. Oh my God. Dana Plato dead. I couldn't help it. Actually.
6176160	6180080	I don't know that that might not be that different. We should try that. That'd be kind of fucking
6180080	6183560	down with that. That is like, I'm sorry. The first thing that popped in my head was night
6183560	6194640	trap. I was like, Tina Plato, dad, Jamie shame on you. That would be kind of funny. I'm all
6194640	6198040	down for that. I would like to know what happened to Sim city action news lady. Some of these
6198040	6201920	people might actually be famous for all we know. I don't think she is, but here's the
6201920	6205520	thing. I'm not, I'm not doing this to harp on her acting skills or whatever. Cause let's
6205520	6209480	face it, we all got to get work somewhere and you know, moving from community theater.
6209480	6214520	She's been in one, one more game than I have. Right. More people have seen her than listen
6214520	6219600	to this podcast. I'm sure of that. But look, uh, my point is that stuff would just cut
6219600	6222640	right into the middle of your game when you were playing Sim city, like you'd be doing
6222640	6225520	your thing, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. And then all of a sudden that fucking full
6225520	6233520	motion video would come in. God damn it. I'm trying to play a game. Oh yeah. Sim city five.
6233520	6239160	Hope it doesn't suck. I don't think Sim city woman's going to be in it though. Oh, thank
6239160	6245160	God. You should do that. They're just, what? That doesn't make any sense. Stan in the chat
6245160	6249760	room says she's probably selling insurance now. Hey, wait a minute. I work in insurance.
6249760	6255340	You better watch it buddy. What are you talking about? All right, moving on. Oh, poor, poor
6255340	6263760	Dana Plato. Oh, is it my turn? No, it's Loki's. Loki's done one story. rapid fire news. Hey,
6263760	6269120	we were talking about Sim city. Okay. It's important. I promise to be fair. I'm going
6269120	6273960	to be fast. Uh, the next one, uh, would be a sorcery. Finally has a date and you know,
6273960	6278240	Hey, they talked about it during E3 is a big thing. And then it went poof, disappeared
6278240	6284200	and just delays, delay, delay. So now the PlayStation move game will be out on May 22nd.
6284200	6291080	Looks kind of neat. Um, so yeah, May 22nd. And then finally diabolical pitch, which is
6291080	6299280	the really strange, uh, crossing between grasshopper manufacturer and connect and also zombies
6299280	6306080	and baseball. Um, that game will be out April 4th and man, what a weird fucking game that
6306080	6313400	is, but, uh, that'll be out on Xbox live arcade. Um, and yes, it's a really weird fucking game,
6313400	6317920	but would you have it any other way with grasshopper manufacturer? I'm okay with weird. Yeah. So
6317920	6324040	throwing baseballs at zombies. So with connect, good time. Yeah. All right. Well, this isn't
6324040	6327600	as cool as a connect zombies and all that stuff, but, um, it's a game that a lot of
6327600	6332560	people are looking forward to and a huge change apparently announced this week. Diablo three.
6332560	6336520	Hello. PC game. You might've heard of it coming out soon. Cause the, you know, Diablo two
6336520	6344400	sold billions of copies. Uh, PVP has been taken out for now, which might lend a hint
6344400	6348100	as to what the holdup is with this game. We've been talking about it here. I know I've been
6348100	6352440	talking about it all the time on a hoard house. This game has been delayed, delayed, delayed.
6352440	6357360	Well, no Blizzard game has ever truly delayed cause they don't, you know, but let's be real.
6357360	6361120	The beta has been out forever, so it seems like the game is done. So the question has
6361120	6365480	been, what's the holdup? Well, it might've been PVP because this official press release
6365480	6370120	came out on Blizzard site that basically says, um, you know, we're counting down the days
6370120	6374200	getting ready to announce this release date. We have come to realize that PVP is not up
6374200	6380000	to the standards. We will release it in a patch following the game's launch to which
6380000	6383280	a lot of people kind of roll their eyes and go, uh, patching in the content after the
6383280	6390280	game. But let's be fair. PC games kind of do this anyway a lot and something as robust
6390280	6393800	as PVP and they're not going to charge the extra for it. I think it's okay if they're
6393800	6398080	going to do that. PVP wasn't really in Diablo two, so it was something new to Diablo three.
6398080	6402440	So whereas I'm sure some folks will be disappointed if it'll get the damn game out already, then
6402440	6407480	I'm okay with this taking a little bit of a break. So they do say that when PVP does
6407480	6414520	come out multiple arena maps, theme locations and so forth, it wasn't in the beta. So I
6414520	6418720	guess it's not that surprising that PVP is getting cut out. So hopefully your release
6418720	6422960	date for Diablo before too long. Uh, hopefully your release date soon for this game too,
6422960	6427600	because I know the screenshots that came out for it this week have me very excited as I'm
6427600	6432680	sure a lot of you and that is Kingdom Hearts 3D or Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance.
6432680	6438920	Get it? Well, some of the screenshots came out this week that show Sora in Tron World.
6438920	6444160	Looks very sexy. Uh, there's a Sora with a little identity disc there. There's a little
6444160	6448960	picture here that you can actually see. You can see Korra and you can see, um, you know,
6448960	6453360	Jeff Bridges character and I'm assuming that's his son. Although it doesn't really look like
6453360	6459320	him. No it is. Sam, son of Flynn. It's supposed, yeah, I know it's Sam. And Riku? The other
6459320	6463680	two kind of, kind of at least look like him. Is that Riku? No, I think that's Sora. I thought
6463680	6467680	it was Riku. Cause I couldn't see his poofy hair. Yeah, well it's in the hat. Uh, by the
6467680	6472680	way, Jeff Bridges confirmed for the game. That's awesome. That is very awesome. So.
6472680	6477320	I love Jeff Bridges. I know, it's great that he will do that and it's great that, you know,
6477320	6481160	those Kingdom Hearts game, man, they don't fuck around with the voice actors. No, they
6481160	6485600	don't. And I know the first one got a lot of shit for Lance Bass as Sephiroth, but let's
6485600	6490200	be real. I mean, you know, that was during the height of his, like in sync and all that
6490200	6494240	stuff. So to get him to voice a video game, no matter what character it was, was kind
6494240	6498040	of a big deal. And a lot of the voice, just the voice I can cast in all those games is
6498040	6503640	phenomenal. So it looks like they are sparing no expense with Kingdom Hearts 3D. I would
6503640	6508580	love to see a Kingdom Hearts 3 on consoles already, but I'll take this to hold me over.
6508580	6514460	One other, uh, quick story here about Dead or Alive 5. Dead or Alive 5 has a new character
6514460	6518960	on the roster. Might be familiar if you've ever played a little game called Virtua Fighter.
6518960	6524760	Akira Yuki will be in the next Dead or Alive game. There you go. So if you're a Virtua
6524760	6529480	Fighter fan. I'm not. Worlds are colliding. I wasn't really either, but there you go.
6529480	6534920	All right. You know, my husband liked it and I was like, the only time I ever played any
6534920	6539040	version of that game for like any period of time was because I was trying to knock off
6539040	6549120	Kage's mask in Virtua Fighter 2. All right. So my turn, huh? Yep. Well, how about some
6549120	6555080	stuff from Nimblebit? There is a new work in progress called Pocket Planes that, uh,
6555080	6561880	it looks just like a tiny tower, but it's with airplanes and you basically stuff people
6561880	6565400	into airplanes and you make bigger and bigger airplanes and you take them all over the world.
6565400	6570680	That sounds like fun, doesn't it? I want that game. I like everything that Nimblebit does.
6570680	6577760	And then Assassin's Creed 3 will be on the Wii U and there is a trailer out. And, uh,
6577760	6581200	isn't this the one that's like the Native American one that's taking place during the
6581200	6587400	American Revolution? I do believe it is. So yeah, it actually has, uh, big battles that
6587400	6592760	are going on, including the, uh, Continental Army versus the British Army, all kinds of
6592760	6598960	cool stuff. You know, actually I have to tell you something. Assassin's Creed came up in
6598960	6604960	my Renaissance history class, my Renaissance art history class, because apparently it is,
6604960	6611000	it shows, um, the towns so realistically that my teacher was able to use the models in the
6611000	6617040	game to show us the Palazzo and all kinds of different places in Venice. I thought I
6617040	6623200	would mention that. So she was able to walk her daughter through different parts of the
6623200	6627640	places in the game because she knew of them from, you know, through art history. I thought
6627640	6634200	it was pretty cool. So anyway, also Just Dance Propel. Yay. So you can drink your Propel
6634200	6641440	while you drink, while you play. Is it really tie into the drink Propel or is that just
6641440	6647480	the name? Speculation. I see. It's, I think it's just a clever name, but yeah. But hey
6647480	6651920	yo dog, I heard you like Propel so you can play Propel while you drink Propel and Propel
6651920	6656160	your head through the screen. Old meme is old. I know, but it's still funny sometimes.
6656160	6665880	Okay, I'm done. Real quick. Yeah. Now this might be a coincidence, but I was looking
6665880	6674760	for the actress that played... I was just about to say the chatters found something
6674760	6678260	on that, but go ahead. We'll see what you got first. Stephanie Fargo is the actress
6678260	6684160	that did that. Funny enough, search for Stephanie Fargo on Facebook. You don't get Stephanie
6684160	6693260	Fargo. You do, however, get Stephanie, I believe it's Goats, who happens to be a news reporter.
6693260	6698880	Is that a coincidence or what? She's also blonde. It could be the one. She could have
6698880	6706340	actually turned this into a career. I'm not saying that this is the person because there's
6706340	6713280	very little go on because you know, IMDB and stuff, but man, that would be a coincidence.
6713280	6721420	OLR me. Bring me Stephanie Fargo. I has questions. And she looks like age wise that it could,
6721420	6728440	it could be show me cause I can't find her. Like you've got it. Stephanie Fargo's photos,
6728440	6733480	address, phone, email. See, look, I did a search for Stephanie Fargo. You shouldn't
6733480	6737680	encourage people to stalk like this. This is, this is borderline. Like I got a bunch
6737680	6744280	of, you know, but I was like news anchor reporter. Really? Wow. I mean that would be a coincidence.
6744280	6749520	I'm don't get me wrong. I don't know. It doesn't really look like her to me. It's hard to say
6749520	6753400	because I mean that that's like the nineties hair. Well, SSU 100. Matt was the chatter
6753400	6758660	that said the wind said step. Stephanie Fargo is the SimCity news hiker. Her IMDB says that
6758660	6763560	she's only been in SimCity, but that's IMDB. I mean, I was like, you all have problems.
6763560	6774120	Stop stocking these poor, poor full motion actors. Oh my God, you guys. All right, let's
6774120	6781200	go to the foogle question of the week. Every week we ask you guys a question on the Facebook
6781200	6785640	and the Google plus you put them together. It's foogle, uh, Facebook, Google question
6785640	6789820	of the week. With the recent announcement of the new iPad, the statement was made by
6789820	6794400	Apple that the resolution of the device was greater than the PlayStation three or Xbox
6794400	6799480	three 60 experience. Do you consider the iPad a gaming device for the core gamer? Why or
6799480	6803040	why not? I think we've kind of said our piece on this. Let's go to some of the answers.
6803040	6807280	There was a lot of answers. I can't read them all, but I'm going to read some of these.
6807280	6812880	Um, let's see. Jennifer J says to be completely honest, I don't see it as much of a gaming
6812880	6816440	machine. I mean, sure there are games made for it and whatnot, but I really don't see
6816440	6821360	it going anywhere. But then again, I might be wrong. Uh, John K says, not really. While
6821360	6824600	there are some amusing games that one can play on it, the lack of physical controls
6824600	6829280	holds it back from a solid gaming experience. I've yet to play anything on the iPad on the
6829280	6835520	level of an uncharted Arkham city, Final Fantasy 13, et cetera. Uh, Jim H says not for core
6835520	6840400	gamers. They'll always want a deeper experience. However, it's a gaming machine of a different
6840400	6844240	sort. I think you're going to see that Nintendo and Sony's newer portable consoles aren't
6844240	6848960	going to sell like past incarnations because Apple and Android have all the casual pickup
6848960	6853880	and play gamers locked up. I think there's a story on that coming up in a minute here.
6853880	6858400	Uh, Hunter R says, first of all, the resolution claim is contingent on the apps that run on
6858400	6865120	the iPad. Remember the PS3 can do 1080p, but how many games actually run at that resolution?
6865120	6869240	As far as the iPad being a gaming device, I don't buy it. I don't play many games on
6869240	6873240	my iPad and the games I do play are mainly board and card games. This is mostly due to
6873240	6877400	the control scheme. Having my fingers get in the way of the display is a problem for
6877400	6882920	most games, but is not a problem for boarding card games. Also, I use my iPad more to watch
6882920	6886660	videos, use Twitter, check my email, read online articles and type up long rambling
6886660	6892300	passages that may or may not be interesting, such as this one. Uh, let's see. Uh, Katsu
6892300	6897320	Hiko J says, uh, for a pickup and go experience. Yes. You can say the full name on that one.
6897320	6902880	It's a anime character. I always say first in the lesson at OTA. For a pickup and go
6902880	6907640	experience. Yes. For a sit down and play for hours experience. Probably not. That is decided
6907640	6912240	by the game, whether it's tiny tower or grand theft auto. Realistically, I can see myself
6912240	6916280	playing tiny tower for two to three minutes and be satisfied. There's no way I can play
6916280	6922640	it for many hours straight, not even 30 minutes. It won't replace your PS3 or your 360. I kind
6922640	6927000	of like that compare or that kind of calling it out like that because that's a lot of what
6927000	6933480	I see in iOS gaming versus, you know, playing on the consoles. It's really about that time
6933480	6938440	investment. There's a lot of games that just take like seconds. Uh, last one from Facebook
6938440	6942940	here. Mike B says if they put Xbox live on the iPad, it would be a winner. So you could
6942940	6946800	play the games you have downloaded on Xbox live. It would be fun to play. Bejeweled was
6946800	6954260	my friends or some gears of war. I love the thinking, but you have to be living in a fantasy
6954260	6959560	world for Microsoft to suddenly get along with the Apple devices like that. Um, but
6959560	6963080	why aren't we seeing that type of stuff with the windows phones? I guess. Well, I guess
6963080	6966560	we are a little bit. I mean, there is Xbox live stuff on there and I think you can even
6966560	6970320	go so far as to earn some achievement points. I don't know about the whole cross platform
6970320	6975240	playing, but if the Vita can interface with the PC, I mean anything else is just a matter
6975240	6981600	of time, I'm sure. So, but as far as gears of war, that might be a bit much, but jeweled
6981600	6987000	you'd think will be easy though. I think I might've found Ms. Fargo. You guys are stalkers.
6987000	6991800	What's wrong with you guys? The one, the one I found it wasn't her because it just happened
6991800	6998400	that since I searched for Fargo, it was a news anchor in Fargo. So that's not, I see.
6998400	7002800	What did you owner Stephanie Fargo, a gorgeous Amazonian, former actress with an uproarious
7002800	7009280	laugh. I found that article. Yeah, it's a revolution fitness. So she's a fitness instructor
7009280	7015400	now. That might be her. She didn't look Amazonian in the, uh, the video there. She was also
7015400	7021960	sitting down. She might've bulked up if she took a fitness instructor role. Anyhow, can
7021960	7026360	I, can I go to the Googles? Can I go to the Googles? Cause they're actually my favorite
7026360	7030760	response out of all of them was on Google plus Stephanie powers. So let me get to Google
7030760	7034880	plus, um, our page on Google plus you can find by searching for orange launch radio.
7034880	7039240	Let me read a couple of these here. Uh, Carlos M says, definitely I do more gaming on my
7039240	7044160	zoom tablet than on my PS three and we combined and my Xbox beats it just because of dragon
7044160	7048400	age having sampled the world of goo need for speed and dead space for the tablet format.
7048400	7052680	I can certainly vouch for the quality of games, not only graphics wise, but also on their
7052680	7057960	entertainment value. Now, if they'd, if only they'd release a final fantasy or BioWare
7057960	7062880	RPG there. Well, to be fair, I just want to get this out there. There are some really
7062880	7069320	good final fantasy ports, um, on iPhone, which would be the final fantasy one, two and three.
7069320	7074800	And I believe three has an iPad version too. Uh, and then there's, I think tactics to mass
7074800	7079000	effect supposedly has a spinoff game that's on iOS, but my friends that are like obsessed
7079000	7084680	with mass effect tell me it stinks and Loki's given the thumbs down too. Here's my favorite
7084680	7092160	comment of them all from Derek H. The iPad is a gaming device. Just like a picture of
7092160	7098240	B Arthur is a contraceptive. It'll work in an emergency, but it should never be your
7098240	7107400	first choice unless you're Deadpool. The iPad lacks two things that a gaming device needs.
7107400	7113000	A decent way to control games and decent games. Sure you can point to a couple of passable
7113000	7117640	titles, but that's out of thousands. When 1.3 of your games are passable, it's time
7117640	7122000	to move on. Also, it's not a camera, so I don't ever want to see anyone at any event
7122000	7126820	taking pictures with it. And it's also not a video editor, a typewriter, a guitar, credit
7126820	7132440	card machine, or a piano. I got to say, I know as much as you want to, you want to have
7132440	7135020	first off, that was a hilarious comment in the beginning, but I will say for the second
7135020	7141600	half of it, a video editor, I wouldn't use it for anything serious, but I took a trip
7141600	7146680	up to Lake Tahoe and I did a little video and I did it in iMovie and it was really easy
7146680	7152000	and it made a cool, fun little thing to post on Facebook. I wouldn't make it much more
7152000	7156280	serious than that, but I was actually really pleased with video editing on the iPhone because
7156280	7160720	it was really super easy. But granted, if I was going to do anything professional, I
7160720	7167480	would do it on a Mac or a PC. Credit card machine, I was at a restaurant the other day
7167480	7172400	and I saw the waiter taking my order on an iPod. Couldn't believe it. That's where technology
7172400	7175800	has come. It was the same restaurant you were at the other day, you were telling me when
7175800	7180600	you came in here. Well, something else too is that a friend of mine who used to do drive-by
7180600	7187000	appraisals actually would do them with his iPad mounted on the front of his bike and
7187000	7193320	would basically drive around the house on his bike and take pictures of the home. Basically,
7193320	7197040	what a drive-by appraisal is for people who don't know is when a mortgage company hires
7197040	7201680	somebody to go make sure the house is lived in. I get the sense that the iDevices, they
7201680	7207320	don't do anything maybe the best, but they do them well enough and considering how portable
7207320	7210920	they are, a lot of people really like it. But that's, you know, I think a lot of that
7210920	7215720	is based on opinion. So, it is the show where every gamer has a voice. Alright, let's move
7215720	7220640	on to a few more news stories before we get to the mailbag, the twitter.com slash o-l-r
7220640	7227120	and all that good stuff. Loki. Well, of course this month, well, just recently we got some
7227120	7234400	NPD numbers talking about the sales during February. The Nintendo 3DS has finally hit
7234400	7240480	4.5 million units in its first year. It's outperformed the original DS already and of
7240480	7248800	course it hasn't even quite hit a year yet. That will be March 27th, but, eh, you know,
7248800	7256240	close enough I guess. By comparison, I guess they said 9 million units of software have
7256240	7262520	been sold and 1.2 billion dollars in revenue it's generated so far. The original DS sold
7262520	7271560	2.3 million units in its first year. And of course, during February, 200,000 of those
7271560	7279040	are actually, actually I'm sorry it's not 2,000, yeah 200,000 systems were moved during
7279040	7285920	February and Mario Galaxy has sold 5 million units as well. So, it's doing pretty well.
7285920	7294640	The Nintendo Wii also sold about 228,000 units and the 3DS itself 135. So, still not doing
7294640	7304000	too bad even though the 3DS is out. Microsoft didn't do too bad as well. They sold almost
7304000	7314800	half a million units for the Xbox 360 and reached the top console spot for 14 consecutive
7314800	7327160	months. That's not bad. The PlayStation Move, they've shipped 10.5 million units. Of course,
7327160	7332240	as I've mentioned in the past before when they talk about shipping units for the Move,
7332240	7338720	how you can't really compare that to the Kinect because the Kinect, you know, they've sold,
7338720	7344320	I can't remember how many units for the Kinect, it's quite a bit. I think it's actually still
7344320	7351920	more than 10 million units. But, you know, what are they exactly counting for the PlayStation
7351920	7358640	Move since, you know, like the Wii, you can use multiple Move units per system and are
7358640	7362920	they counting the camera, are they counting the navigation controller, any accessories,
7362920	7367960	it's just Move units. You can bet the math is as fuzzy as possible. I'd be willing to
7367960	7374360	bet, yeah. So, 10.5 million units, that could be significantly less households and judging
7374360	7378840	by the sales of Move-only games, I would guess it's probably... I don't want to sound like
7378840	7382640	a jerk, but I don't think I know anyone in real life that has a PlayStation Move. I know
7382640	7387520	people on the internet. Oh, you do? Yeah. Do I play with it? No. Maybe that's why I
7387520	7392880	don't know anybody because nobody ever like, you know, says, let's play Move. It's sad
7392880	7397440	because it's not bad. It's actually a pretty good peripheral. I mean, I would prefer to
7397440	7402960	use Move over Kinect, but, you know, I think for some things, the Kinect is way better.
7402960	7407480	Like dancing games, I think it would be a lot better, you know, tracking you versus,
7407480	7411920	you know, the Move controller. For like core games, like, you know, shooters and stuff,
7411920	7421160	it's probably way better. Like, I would play... What was it? God, no. I'd play like some of
7421160	7425120	the third-person shooters or whatever, the gun games and stuff with the Move controller
7425120	7431160	versus trying to even remotely do that with a Kinect camera. It just wouldn't be accurate
7431160	7439940	at all. Plus it has buttons. Buttons are important, right? Yeah. Very important. All right. Well,
7439940	7443400	what about the sales figures overall? I mean, what do we think this is saying? Like, is
7443400	7448520	the 3DS recovered or whatever? I mean, this says to me, yes. I think that's the picture
7448520	7452600	they're trying to paint is that it's, you know, recovered, but, you know, we'll see
7452600	7459120	how, you know, long-term that is. I'm still doing well. I mean, even the regular DS is
7459120	7467480	doing fine. The Wii, though, I can guarantee you that the Wii systems, you know, even 200,000,
7467480	7471880	that's still, I think, gone the downturn. And, you know, looking at the slate of Wii
7471880	7477680	games coming out, they're kind of done with that system. I mean, there's a lot of games
7477680	7484400	that aren't getting Wii ports anymore. It's just, it's gone. All right. Well, this might
7484400	7488840	make Loki sad, because I don't know who he's going to make fun of now. But Peter Molyneux
7488840	7493920	has left Microsoft, meaning he's left Lionhead Studios as well. Ah, yes. His head was too
7493920	7498680	big for the building. He had to leave. I think they had to carve him a new door on the way
7498680	7511840	out. He's left for a startup called 22 cans. Big cans. No, 22 cans. He did leave some parting
7511840	7516360	words. His parting words were, quote, it is with mixed emotions that I make the decision
7516360	7521840	to leave Microsoft and Lionhead Studios, the company that I co-founded in 1997 at the conclusion
7521840	7527360	of development of Fable The Journey. I remain extremely passionate and proud of the people,
7527360	7532640	products and experiences that we created. It's not on rails. Okay, I added the last
7532640	7538360	part, but the rest of it's true. Because it is on rails. So there you go. It is apparently
7538360	7544240	an amicable breakup. Uh, there's still Facebook friends from what I understand. So, uh, maybe
7544240	7547640	sometimes they'll just end up in bed together. They might throw some shade at each other
7547640	7550800	once in a while, but that'll be the extent of it. I was going to make a game about a
7550800	7557040	little boy named Milo. Then Chris Hansen showed up. So now I'm on the lam. So I went to a
7557040	7567960	company called 22 cans, 22 cans. All right. I, they're a porn company. Stop it. 22 cans.
7567960	7570800	That's the people that they have standing out on the street with an empty can saying,
7570800	7579160	put money in me. What level is this show sunken to? Not Rob. Dana Plato. What you talking
7579160	7584780	about? Mail bag at orangelandtrader.com is where you send emails every week and dark
7584780	7591920	soccer has to read them. Why don't you read the emails from our kind and generous listeners
7591920	7601600	this week? Oh, I like you. You're my favorite show ever. Don't make them up. Okay. Hi. I
7601600	7605360	just wanted to say thank you for talking me out of buying street fighter cross tech and
7605360	7608800	I was very excited to get it, but after hearing how over a quarter of the complete roster
7608800	7613720	is paid to unlock, I had to say hell no. In fact, I went to GameStop yesterday to preorder
7613720	7618440	the game, but I got a three ds instead and I got Mario Kart, so I'm down to play someone.
7618440	7622520	The guy before me was buying a PS three and just dance three and I preordered the game
7622520	7627160	as well. I was at the register next to him and the lady checking me out and she is checking
7627160	7631160	you out. I'm asked if I wanted to preorder any games and I told her that you were hot
7631160	7634720	with your three ds. I wanted to get street fighter cross tech in it, but went on about
7634720	7638520	how quarter the roster was paid to unlock and the guy was checking out next to me freaked
7638520	7643100	out. You could totally see the surprise in his eyes when I blurted that out. I'm sure
7643100	7647000	she was pissed that I might have talked to the guy out of a sale. Oh well. But yeah,
7647000	7654000	that's just nuts. 12 characters, probably $5 a piece to buy would mean they'd be $60,
7654000	7657480	which is the cost of a game. Are you telling me that I'd have to shell out the same amount
7657480	7662200	of money in order to get the full experience? Um, there's a big link on there. I'm not going
7662200	7669960	to relink. Um, this is why they did it to save on hard drive space, but they didn't
7669960	7674800	explain when they'd be unlocked and I'm guessing $3-$5 a piece, which is still too much. Sure
7674800	7678320	they did that with Jill and Shuma Garath in the two Marvel vs Capcom 3 games, but that's
7678320	7683120	just for two characters. If all 12 characters were available in a bundle for like $10, then
7683120	7687560	I'll stop bitching. But I doubt that'll happen. Oh, I also thought it was funny that the PS3
7687560	7691480	exclusive characters can also be found on the Xbox version. Their files were found in
7691480	7695360	the disc, so if anyone is good at hacking, they might be able to play as cool on the
7695360	7699840	Xbox. Okay, that's it. I'm done. Thanks for reading this. I look forward to your
7699840	7705120	tenth-versary, Stan. And also, the reason why they're probably on the disc is because
7705120	7710760	it's the same information ported. Oh yeah, it's kind of lazy porting, in a way. I mean,
7710760	7715400	I know that sounds really harsh, but it kind of is what it is. The other thing I want to
7715400	7720640	say about that is it's kind of scary that we kind of talked not one but two people out
7720640	7725240	of buying the game. It's not what we set out to do. Like, I'm not trying to discourage
7725240	7728480	people from buying the game, because, you know, again, there's fighting game fans out
7728480	7731840	there that are going to eat this up, and that's fine. That is fine. It's your money. Buy what
7731840	7736640	you want. But, you know, we're all about people making informed decisions, and it sounds like
7736640	7739480	that's what happened in this case, is that people kind of realized, like, wait a minute,
7739480	7742480	I'm going to have to pay $60, and then if I want everything, I have to pay $60 more
7742480	7749960	dollars, maybe, only to see a super Uber collection at the end of the year? I kind of talked myself
7749960	7754000	out of it with that same logic. I think that's why I asked Loki earlier, what did the sales
7754000	7757000	look like for this game, because I want to see if it's just more than the three of us
7757000	7764920	now that we're up to. Anyhow, next email. Dear Orange Launch Radio, let me say, first, you
7764920	7768960	guys and Lady are amazing. Between Loki's Rants of Rage and Dark Soccer in the Sky's
7768960	7774540	Epic Trolls, you make a three-hour podcast of very entertaining. I'm not a troll. Epic
7774540	7780880	trolls. I'm not an epic troll. You don't, you, it's not that you are a troll, it's that
7780880	7787560	you have done trolling. I was trolling you for compliments. Bitch. Girl, please. Now,
7787560	7791400	granted, I haven't listened to you guys from the beginning, mostly because I was ten when
7791400	7801780	you guys started... Oh my God. Okay, emailers, I totally appreciate, I appreciate your emails.
7801780	7807440	Please don't say that ever again. But for the past three years, you guys have taught
7807440	7811000	me about old school games, system hackings, and other stuff I can't think of off the top
7811000	7816400	of my head. You guys can make a long car drive seem shorter, a boring day entertaining, and
7816400	7820520	a regular guy seem crazy because he can't stop laughing in the middle of class. I hope
7820520	7825200	you guys keep podcasting, really enjoy the show, signed Haseo Sumiragawa. PS, if there
7825200	7829840	are trophy whores listening to this show, you can add me on PSN, it's Haseo underscore
7829840	7835860	Sumiragawa. I would love to be able to compare trophies to someone that isn't 100 or so trophies
7835860	7844880	below my total. Next email. Now start paying attention in class, you young whippersnapper.
7844880	7852000	Hello Hellions. Ever since the expansion pack for World of Warcraft involving the Pandarens
7852000	7856280	was released, something has been stuck in my head. I've been ruminating about it for
7856280	7862000	some time until it struck me just now. Look at the promotional material released for this
7862000	7866160	expansion pack. Look at the architecture that is on display. Look at the landscapes that
7866160	7869440	are on display. Look at the pandas that are on display. Suddenly something seems very
7869440	7874400	clear to me. The Pandaren expansion for World of Warcraft seems tailor made to appeal to
7874400	7880720	China. But, being that China is an emerging market, not just in video games, but also
7880720	7884880	different aspects of our modern day economy, it makes sense that Blizzard would tailor
7884880	7889740	make something for the Chinese public. Okay. This also makes me think of the possibilities
7889740	7894160	that could happen if Blizzard decides to tailor make something to any other emerging markets.
7894160	7899320	Finally, one of the possibilities began to take tangible shape in my mind. Behold, the
7899320	7907000	Jersey Darians. Lord. Okay. This is funny now. Coming from the mythical realm of shortopia,
7907000	7912160	smush smush. I don't know what that means. The Jersey Darians are an orange race whose
7912160	7917320	clothes, hair and muscular definitions appeal mostly to people of their own race. The Jersey
7917320	7921760	Darians are not a smart race, but just try telling them that. Criticizing a Jersey Darian
7921760	7926240	may result in you getting your teeth punched in by an orange troll whose overstylized hair
7926240	7932000	makes up for the bulk of their height. One of them is pregnant, you know. I know I didn't
7932000	7937120	need to know that. It just made my life hurt. Other possibilities for expansion packs for
7937120	7942640	the emerging markets include for the English, the Cockney Darians, for the Irish, the U2
7942640	7947440	Darians, for the Somalians, the not Jack Sparrow Piradarians, and for Utah, the conservative
7947440	7952840	control freak-a-darians. Stay black, Reddertainment. This message has been brought to you by politicians
7952840	7957680	who value adequately funding a sports stadium over adequately funding public education.
7957680	7964720	Grrr. I just thought of the best argument ever for gay marriage. Or, you know, equal
7964720	7968320	marriage because there's really no such thing as gay marriage. But I have the best argument
7968320	7975760	ever. I can't get married, but Snooki can. Just think about that for a minute. So that
7975760	7982200	sink in next time you're at the ballot box. That's the country we live in, folks. There's
7982200	7988480	a woman who's- Rick Santorum wants Snooki to get married, but not me. Anyhow. Hello
7988480	7992400	OLR crew. There was something else that you might want to say. Oh, the Pandarian thing
7992400	7996960	in China. We've talked about this on the best little hoard house in Azeroth, a show all
7996960	8003480	about the World of Warcraft. www.hoardhouse.com. We talked a little bit about this, and actually
8003480	8008760	I don't think the claim is as far-fetched as some think. It's ironic because there was
8008760	8012440	a time when people were saying it can't be Pandaria. They're not going to do Pandaria
8012440	8017280	because there's laws in China against panda people. Like, you can't- that's defacing pandas
8017280	8022080	and da da da da da da da. I don't think what you're saying is too far-fetched. I think
8022080	8025660	it's kind of a win-win situation for Blizzard because, yes, they can do a very respectful
8025660	8030580	thing for the Chinese culture. And, you know, here in the States and in other countries
8030580	8036040	like Canada and UK and so forth, we kind of like that culture. There's a lot of people
8036040	8039800	that are like, you know, pandas are cute. And, you know, they, they like the architecture
8039800	8045400	and all that. So it makes, it makes sense. I still forgot to reserve the name orange
8045400	8051420	chicken. But I think, um, you know, Pandarans, don't forget, they've been in Warcraft lore
8051420	8055160	already. They're not new to- Even though they were a joke. Well, yeah, they were kind of
8055160	8061920	a joke that went really far. Could you imagine a Pandaren druid, Boomkin, named orange chicken?
8061920	8066640	That would be funny. My troll was, my troll was already an orange chicken. Anyway, hello
8066640	8072000	OLR crew. Ooh, to DarkSakura. Well, I do respect you preferring the Japanese- Oh god, here
8072000	8076000	we go. The Japanese Sonic CD soundtrack. I must side with Bobby Blackwolf and claim the
8076000	8080560	US soundtrack as superior. Again, your opinion. Despite the fact that Sonic CD- Where every
8080560	8088080	gamer has a voice, a really- That's why I'm pointing out an opinion. A really wrong voice.
8088080	8093480	I just got the hand. No, that was a high five. Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought you were making
8093480	8098920	me talk to that. Okay. No, I was giving you a high five. Despite the fact that Sonic CD's
8098920	8103880	musics have a style different from the other Sonic games for its time, at least to me anyway,
8103880	8108300	the Japanese music sounds very cheesy. It's way too upbeat and has some hammy voice samples
8108300	8112200	that are out of place. I believe the US tunes composed by Spencer Nielsen do a fantastic
8112200	8116280	job of fitting in with the atmosphere of each level, even if it sounds a little new agey
8116280	8120280	at times. Yeah, but that's kind of why I have a problem with it doesn't sound like Sonic
8120280	8125320	music. Here's a question for the whole OLR crew. What are some of the best deals that
8125320	8130300	you've had for video game or video game hardware? For me, I've recently had a Circuit City Tiger
8130300	8137000	Direct Honor, an erroneous $40 price tag for a 32 gigabyte PlayStation Vita memory card.
8137000	8140860	I literally just bought Mass Effect for 11 bucks. I thought that was pretty good. This
8140860	8147960	is also by Full Brazilian. I love that name so much. What's the most that's ever been
8147960	8156080	shaved off a price for you? I know one on Dan's behalf where he traded his Sega CD for
8156080	8163720	a Neo Geo and games. What about a Steam? Like anything on Steam? I bought like every Doom
8163720	8168720	game ever for $3. I know there's a lot of good deals there. And I randomly get free
8168720	8177000	games from people. I got my Dreamcast for 40 bucks. Amazing deal. Those things are still
8177000	8184240	fucking rad to have. Dreamcast Twin Sticks for Oritario Tangrum. We paid 45 bucks for
8184240	8191440	them and they were going eBay for like $500. I won my Dreamcast at a Q's R All Nighter.
8191440	8202640	Nice. Oh, we've gotten our first model PlayStation when they were still going for $700. We got
8202640	8208320	$100 back from Discover. $700 for that first PlayStation? I guess they were about that
8208320	8212960	much in the beginning, weren't they? Yeah, but we got $100 back from Discover and Dan
8212960	8219160	got his manager's discount on it. So I guess that's kind of good and it still works. There
8219160	8224720	you go. And it still plays all of our old stuff. So next email? Yes, please. How many
8224720	8230560	more emails? Three. Geez. I know. It's all right. Every gamer gets a voice. That's why
8230560	8234320	the show is three and a half hours long. Hi, OLR. A couple of weeks ago, Dark Soccer did
8234320	8238560	a classic game of the week, which inspired me to get the game for my iPod Touch. More
8238560	8243400	specifically, Puzzle Bobble, aka Bust A Move. It was well worth the $5 I spent to get it.
8243400	8248040	It's very addicting and it's full of awesomeness. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, Vince Raven.
8248040	8255320	P.S. Make sure everyone votes for President Cat in the elections. LOL XD. LOL. If President
8255320	8261440	Cat was running for Republican, then I think everybody else would not make it. Oh, I was
8261440	8264360	trying to read if there was a question. I got distracted. There was no question. Somebody
8264360	8267760	sent me naked photos of one of the people from Glee. So I was like, oh, I want to see
8267760	8275500	that. And then I wasn't I wasn't listening to the female or male female. OK, who it was.
8275500	8287920	It's a video game podcast, right? It was just thanking me for referring. What? Nice. I'm
8287920	8293800	back to video games. OK. OK. What is that badge in the background? It might be. Let's
8293800	8302440	move on. It was a mirror. No. Well, you see, Jamie, women have a vagina. Shut up. And so
8302440	8313520	do you. You're a bitch. Read an email. Love you. Mean it. Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly
8313520	8318880	neighborhood turtle. I just heard that Diablo three is now removing PvP to speed up their
8318880	8324440	release time. I'm getting real tired of companies. It should be really tired. Hello. Of companies
8324440	8328720	stripping down their games to hit a release date and the game suffering for it. And it's
8328720	8333440	my opinion that they usually release the rest of the game as paid DLC, which Blizzard will
8333440	8338240	not be doing. But I'm still tired of it anyway. Just needed to get my frustration. And I'll
8338240	8342920	answer Jamie's request for an OLR memory next time. Peace and chicken grease, serious turtle.
8342920	8354600	I still agree with Rob. Sorry, what was the question? Girl. OK. It's about the Diablo
8354600	8360880	three, removing the PvP and saying tired of games, right? You know, coming out with stuff
8360880	8364880	that's going to be DLC later and we'll have to pay for it. They say they're not going
8364880	8368280	to charge for. Yeah, but I think it's still the you mean it's not going to have everything
8368280	8373560	on it. I'm OK with it because I don't want to wait nine more months for the game to come
8373560	8378960	out. Yeah, like you kind of hit a point waiting for a baby. How how long without the indigestion
8378960	8382840	waiting for Diablo three and PvP was not one of the elements I personally cared about.
8382840	8387640	I don't as much it. I mean, I'll play it later when they patch it in, but I don't need it
8387640	8392240	right away. It is like waiting for a baby without the indigestion. Moving on. OK, last
8392240	8399200	one is I'm I didn't leave a name, so I'm just going to say it's pork chop. I totally agree
8399200	8403280	with the fact that gamers don't want to work for unlocks anymore. I taken six and still
8403280	8408560	caliber five. Everything is there to use right away. And the modes are rather lacking. The
8408560	8418080	good old days of gaming are dwindling, folks. Agreed. And you know what? That's it. At least
8418080	8422400	that's all I'm going to read. Mailbag at Orange Laundry dot com. It sounds like Jamie sadly
8422400	8426240	had to cut a few out tonight. So no, I didn't. I just said if any more arrived, I wasn't
8426240	8430040	going to read them until next week. There you go. Look, you'll read them next week.
8430040	8434480	There you go. That would be funny if Loki read them. He's done it before when you're
8434480	8442840	not here. I know. But while I was here, the mailbag. Yeah. All right. Moving on. This
8442840	8463840	is the part of show where we get angsty because because. Uppity mail bitches. If you'd up
8463840	8471040	any mail bitches. Hey, not you. OK, there's OK. I have a friend. Oh, I know where this
8471040	8475480	is going. You know where this is going. You know, going. I already know you didn't have
8475480	8484440	to say it. Who occasionally acts like a stereotypical hysterical woman and doesn't admit. And it's
8484440	8493200	Nathan Lane in the bird cage and doesn't ever admit. Well, except for this time when said
8493200	8499080	person has done something wrong or, you know, gives the roundabout passive aggressive type
8499080	8505040	of apology. You know what I mean? Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. And I'm getting kind
8505040	8511680	of sick of it and I'm getting sick of just that sense of entitlement. So. But you know
8511680	8518080	what? We talked about things are better. I hope that said person watches it. But I really
8518080	8524280	got so pissed off that I I haven't been this angry in a long time. I got so pissed off
8524280	8530520	I've worked. She's not lying. She sent me a message. And wow, girl, I just burped. I
8530520	8536780	am so angry. I burped. I threw up in my mouth. That was awful. And the place I didn't want
8536780	8543280	to do it either. I was at synagogue. I was sick and had to leave. I was so mad. It was
8543280	8551000	awful. Loki. Oh, I'm sorry. Girl, I'm F you to rob. I'll sound like you're done. No, I
8551000	8555160	have one more. All right. Now I forgot what it was. Whatever. Oh, yeah. F you to daylight
8555160	8562640	savings time, you whore. Who were? Who were? Because, OK, I got last time I went to the
8562640	8567920	Jewish Film Festival. I come home at like one and sit down to, you know, check on my
8567920	8571640	email and everything. I look at the clock. Next thing I know, it's three because boom
8571640	8578080	time skip. And then I'm not in bed until like after four because I had all this crap to
8578080	8582960	do that I thought I still had another hour to do because I forgot about it. I get up
8582960	8590520	at one today because of my weird sleeping schedule and I'm groggy all day and tired
8590520	8600720	and although I did have the world's best chocolate mousse cake last night. So good. OK, I'm done.
8600720	8609280	Loki. F you to the donut shop in Folsom for not having the baking maple donuts you sold
8609280	8616440	out of them at what, like 10 in the morning. I mean, seriously, that is just ridiculous.
8616440	8620920	Not a single donut. You would think that they would be popular and you make a ton of them.
8620920	8628680	I mean, that's my thought. So that's just unfair. They're open till five o'clock. I
8628680	8633480	was going to come. I was going to leave early and go to the donut shop, pick up a dozen
8633480	8638880	of those donuts, bring them in delish, but they know. Sorry, we stopped making them because
8638880	8645360	we sold out of our tray of them that we made losers. All right. Any more. That's it. Right.
8645360	8650580	Because you know what happens if I cut someone off my F you the week goes to daylight savings
8650580	8656920	time as well, because it is a dirty. I've had two cups of coffee today to compensate.
8656920	8662400	Not one, two cups of coffee. I did too. Thanks to you. Actually. Fuck. I had three. I need
8662400	8670320	to catch up. Otherwise I had a really crazy week last week, but, um, a lot of like, a
8670320	8674900	lot of good news and a lot of like, I don't really feel one way or the other about it
8674900	8680120	news. Just like, just when it rains, it pours and that's not necessarily an F you, but it's
8680120	8686400	just, damn, I'm going to be busy. If you do the fact that there aren't more hours in the
8686400	8690020	day. In fact, there's one less thanks to daylight savings time. Did I say a few days daylight
8690020	8695000	savings time? Cause I really mean it. You know what? I think I can set back you up in
8695000	8700240	that completely because fuck it. Good. Cause I'm right. I like more nighttime. All right.
8700240	8706720	I want nighttime savings time. Let's go to some more news before we get to your calls.
8706720	8710840	Hey, the 800 number works again this week. That's good. But we have a few more stories
8710840	8716660	first. Loki. All right. Let's talk a little bit about, um, hopefully not anything I was
8716660	8722160	looking up there. We don't need to talk about that. Um, more boobs. Well, it's the same
8722160	8730680	boobs. So let's talk about, uh, valve in. Um, they of course came out and debunked the
8730680	8738560	whole steam box debacle thing or whether everyone's conspiring that they were making some sort
8738560	8742960	of console. And of course that's not the case. What they were doing though is they were making
8742960	8749920	test boxes to, um, test out their big picture initiative, which is basically developing
8749920	8756000	an interface for steam that looks nice on TV displays. So that's what those boxes were
8756000	8760200	being used for. Not necessarily a game console, but I mean, if you think about it, likely
8760200	8767140	story, no, it actually does sound like a likely story. So, um, you know, if you think about
8767140	8773400	it though, I mean that kind of set up, you could use a PC next to your hooked up to your
8773400	8781760	TV and kind of treat it like game box, you know, or something like that. I don't know.
8781760	8787120	All right. Well, are you bummed out with this news? Were you hoping for a steam box? No,
8787120	8792480	I didn't really care. I don't have a steam account. It would have really, that's surprising.
8792480	8795800	It would have been neat, but it's not the end of the world that, I mean, it's still
8795800	8800540	going to be a really good service for the PC. So I still think I'm right on the half
8800540	8803900	life three thing though. So that means there's not going to be half life three until this
8803900	8809520	steam box is ready years and years away. All right. Maybe I'm trolling a little bit. Um,
8809520	8814280	I'm not trolling as much as Adidas is though. Yeah. You know, Adidas, the sporting company,
8814280	8819280	I know we don't talk about them a lot with games, but a THQ has been sued. Uh, Adidas
8819280	8826500	is suing the pants off of them. If your pants hold $10.6 million Adidas sued THQ this week
8826500	8832800	for 10.6 million. Keep in mind, THQ has had some bumpy roads already. So this certainly
8832800	8839240	doesn't help. What is at issue here? Breach of contract. Apparently a game that THQ is
8839240	8845400	supposed to produce for Adidas called me coach 24 seven. I believe it's my coach, my
8845400	8851720	coach, am I code? I thought maybe cause the we, but okay, my coach 24 seven, uh, got canned.
8851720	8856040	Uh, THQ told Adidas in December that it would not be able to present the product and developers
8856040	8861440	who were working on the project were laid off. So maybe this was one of those things
8861440	8865280	we heard about the layoffs of THQ. This was one of those things that was affected and
8865280	8871480	Adidas isn't happy. So they want 10.6 million in damages. This humans, it's all scary. Similar
8871480	8875920	to that Beyonce lawsuit we heard about where they got sued over the canceled Beyonce game.
8875920	8880760	Remember that? And anyway, that wasn't THQ as somebody else. But anyway, uh, THQ is refusing
8880760	8885800	to turn over the publishing materials to an alternative developer. That's probably not
8885800	8892160	good if that's true. Allegedly, it's all allegedly. Adidas is seeking an injunction preventing
8892160	8897800	THQ from selling or transferring the rights to another company. So maybe this was something
8897800	8902480	they were trying to sell off to, uh, get some of the money back. But, uh, Nope, Adidas won't
8902480	8908480	have it. And they're going to have to do this out in a court of law, hopefully judge Judy,
8908480	8913040	but probably not. It'll get settled as they always do. Yep. All right. Dark soccer. We
8913040	8919280	need something better. We need some more warm, fuzzy news. Yeah, no, I haven't well for like,
8919280	8925840	okay, how about Samurai Yeti and Ninja werewolves? There's a teacher whose name is Ben Bertoli
8925840	8933440	is a sixth grade teacher who turned his classroom into an MMO. Basically he set up a, um, experience
8933440	8938960	system and achievements for doing certain things in conjunction with his class, even
8938960	8943240	giving out extra experience for when people, uh, turned in essay, you know, extra credit
8943240	8948520	essays and stuff. And the students are actually helping him remember to keep track of everyone's
8948520	8955840	experience on, um, you know, on a tracking board. They call it class realm and, uh, tried
8955840	8963760	it out at the end of the school year. Um, his beta test group and, um, basically, uh,
8963760	8970320	didn't even tell anybody, just told the students and, uh, they, uh, apparently really liked
8970320	8975240	it. So there's rules of classroom. Uh, one classroom is completely, don't talk about
8975240	8981480	classroom is completely voluntary. XP is the backbone of classroom. Every 10 XP you earn
8981480	8986080	pushes you to the next level. Everyone starts off at level one. XP can be obtained by doing
8986080	8990840	simple things as answering questions, joining in class discussion, uh, working hard on an
8990840	8998360	assignment, helping others participation, random encounter Friday and gaining achievements.
8998360	9005000	When he lets random encounter Friday is when he lets a wild boar loose in the classroom.
9005000	9011200	Or achievements are gained by completing specific tasks. Um, for example, a student can obtain
9011200	9015640	bookworm by reading two unassigned chapter books and explaining the plot and characters
9015640	9021660	to me. Each achievement has four levels, bronze, silver, gold, and master. Each level is harder
9021660	9026680	to reach than the one before it. Boys are pitted against girls. The gender that can
9026680	9031340	acquire the most achievements by the end of the year will, um, earn extra recess and ice
9031340	9037360	cream party during lunch. Each Friday is random and here's the secret because it's the sixth
9037360	9040940	grade. Everybody will win the ice cream party so you don't even have to try cause that's
9040940	9045520	how these things work. Hush. Everyone who wants to battle will put their name in a hat.
9045520	9049940	I will draw out two names and they will battle. Students will be asked a question. Oh my God,
9049940	9055500	it's battle royale. Shut up. I will repeat the question twice and start battle music.
9055500	9060300	The first to write the correct answer on the board will put their and put their hands up
9060300	9067500	will win XP. You can only answer once. Question subjects are chosen at random. Students may
9067500	9072840	join in alliances of up to six classroom citizens. The alliance with the highest combined level
9072840	9077020	at the end of the year wins a pizza party. All info except for the current amount of
9077020	9080860	XP each student has will be listed online and in the classroom for students and parents
9080860	9088780	to see. Well, apparently it's been a big hit and everyone's been super enthusiastic and
9088780	9094500	really trying to participate in it. In fact, there's one he called the Newberry achievement
9094500	9100660	that's based off the Newberry medal that has it's earned by writing an unassigned five
9100660	9105900	paragraph essay and he had 20 essays turned into him in the first week that are written
9105900	9113380	during students' free time outside of their other work. So apparently this is really popular.
9113380	9118180	The kids like it and they're learning with it. So that's pretty cool.
9118180	9123780	So Sally, little Jimmy, you've been called into battle.
9123780	9138340	Rob, for real. If it's getting kids to actually participate in school and enjoy learning,
9138340	9142600	I think it's a great thing. No, I did. In all seriousness, it is. You know, I have to
9142600	9147000	fuck with it because that's what I do here. But it is. And it's, it's not that dissimilar
9147000	9152580	from stuff even I experienced when I was that age, you know, a long time ago, back when
9152580	9158220	some of our listeners weren't even born. But, but like I remember in the seventh grade,
9158220	9163460	our science teacher used to have these meters that would fill up with time. And like, as
9163460	9168160	we answered questions correctly or volunteered to do things or do extra work, a little, little,
9168160	9171220	we would move up the ladder a little bit. When you get to the top, you got like a free
9171220	9176100	day. It was like a free day in the class, you know, like no work, no nothing. It was
9176100	9180660	just like, you know, screw off day or study lab or whatever, which, you know, was kind
9180660	9184320	of cool. And it's kind of a similar thing, right? You gain experience. I remember in
9184320	9189420	the fifth grade, we had a whole little like village with its own economy because I remember
9189420	9194540	one thing I did, I ran a shop that rented Nintendo games in my fifth grade class. And
9194540	9200500	I would rent games to, you know, my classmates for like 10 of the fake bucks that were named
9200500	9208140	after the teacher. So that was like my business. Shroup bucks. What? Shroup bucks. No, I just
9208140	9212920	don't, you know, I don't want to, but no, that wasn't the name, but yeah, same idea.
9212920	9215980	But the whole battle thing is just really funny to me. Sorry. I can't help but think
9215980	9219060	of the hunger games. That's what everybody's all talking about right now. I don't give
9219060	9227620	a crap. So, well, at any rate, I say good for you. And he's apparently a, a, a regular
9227620	9233260	reader and commenter on Kotaku. So, um, the news is just really catching fire. I really
9233260	9237460	hope that it's actually something that he can market for other schools. I see what you
9237460	9242740	did there. Catching fire. Nevermind. What? Don't stand in fire. No, this is a hunger
9242740	9250140	games reference. The hunger game sequel is catching fire. I okay. I'm going to tell everybody
9250140	9255860	something. Unintentional lulz. I don't give a shit about hunger games. I had never, the
9255860	9260380	only thing I've ever heard of it, but let me finish. You're a woman. I don't give a
9260380	9265100	shit. The only thing I've ever heard about it is the name. That's it. I don't know anything
9265100	9269260	about it. And guess who doesn't want to know anything about it. That would be me. I don't
9269260	9276540	care. End of story. Don't care. They're hungry. It's about a bunch of hippos and they're really
9276540	9285780	hungry. That sound is, that's my head repeatedly hitting the microphone.
9285780	9299020	As I bang it into it. Ah, I've successfully derailed the show. Uh, low key. Help us get
9299020	9304240	back on track and then we'll open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR. Tiger
9304240	9308620	Claus says, I wonder what Rob was like when kids didn't return the Nintendo games on time.
9308620	9322140	Were you mean to them? Nope. Just one finger for each day late. This is how we roll, right?
9322140	9333180	So Tony Hawk, um, he's a little sad, sad, Tony Hawk. Um, he says that ride was a bit
9333180	9340740	rushed and that people didn't give it a chance. Really? You should try Tony Hawk's ride. Give
9340740	9344980	it a chance. Cause you know, the game may have been a little rushed and the critics
9344980	9350840	didn't like it. Give it a chance. Of course, that didn't stop them from creating the sequel
9350840	9354260	that I would assume wouldn't have been as rushed because you know, they would have had
9354260	9360540	a whole year to polish it, but still sucked. So I don't see the logic there, but whatever
9360540	9366500	you know, it's rushed. Um, he, he's quoted, I think pride was a bit rushed for a number
9366500	9371940	of reasons, mostly because probably for about the first half of the development process,
9371940	9376820	it was just figuring out how to make a board, how to make a board and how to make it work.
9376820	9383060	We were in uncharted territory. Uh, so the game was a bit rushed, but I still feel critics
9383060	9388260	never really gave it a chance in terms of learning how to play. They got on it and they
9388260	9392660	went straight into expert mode because supposedly they were expert gamers and they didn't really
9392660	9397660	learn the mechanics of how the board works. And so I felt like that already in their mind
9397660	9403780	it made it up or made up their decision before it came out. It was a gimmick and it was a
9403780	9407460	peripheral and whatnot and they never really took the time to learn how to play. No, I
9407460	9413020	think what they decided was that it's a fucking terrible game and you're selling it for $130.
9413020	9417220	This thing takes up too much goddamn space in my house. Get it out. No, it's not even
9417220	9424220	that it took up a lot of space. It was $130 for your stupid game. Not anymore. Yeah. Hey,
9425340	9429540	yeah, seriously, gamers, if you want to take a chance on a ride, you can probably find
9429540	9434220	it for 10 bucks with the board. Go to like Wise Buys or whatever. Anywhere. Big Lots
9434220	9439540	or whatever. It's just terrible. And I'm sorry, like I understand. Okay, let's say the first
9439540	9443540	ride game was terrible or whatever. It was rushed or whatever because you were trying
9443540	9449380	to figure out the technology. Then why did the second game suck just as much? You have
9449380	9456380	no excuses, Tony Hawk. The game sucked. It was terrible. It was a dumb idea because Activision
9456500	9460820	thought, hey, we're going to cash in on all these peripheral games because we made money
9460820	9466020	on DJ Hero. Actually, I think DJ Hero came out around the same time. Well, we made money
9466020	9470460	on Guitar Hero so we're going to put out this peripheral game because people like peripherals.
9470460	9476340	It makes them more interactive. Yeah, it just didn't work out. Just get over it. So no,
9476340	9480020	you know what? I think that the direction that they're taking right now where they're
9480020	9486660	taking the good games that you had and making them look better, that's probably the best
9486660	9492780	way to go because all your experiments to make your game series better have failed over
9492780	9498820	and over again. And the board, that was just the icing on the cake. All right, one more
9498820	9502940	story for you guys and then we're going to open up the phones at 1877 Game OLR or our
9502940	9507540	username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is about a little bit of resolution. I just
9507540	9514180	reported on some legal troubles in one area but this is about resolution to one lawsuit
9514180	9519340	that was going to happen. This was between Bethesda and Mojang. You might remember this.
9519340	9526020	It was over the name Scrolls. Remember Bethesda felt that the name Scrolls was infringing on
9526020	9531580	its trademark for Elder Scrolls and people might get confused. Just like when I reviewed
9531580	9536580	Journey earlier in the show, I had to clarify that it's not the one about the 1980s ban
9536580	9542740	you know because the games are so similar once you've played them. But anyhow, there
9542740	9548900	were some tweets. I love that official statements come from tweets now. That they have settled
9548900	9556020	with yay heart. The settlement is that we give them the trademark. We get to keep the
9556020	9560460	name and won't make an Elder Scrolls competitor using the name. That's the settlement. Usually
9560460	9564060	you don't get to hear about the details of the settlement. I'm just glad like no finance
9564060	9569660	stuff were changed or whatever. So they don't get to have a trademark on Scrolls but Bethesda
9569660	9574680	will leave them alone as long as they don't try to infringe on you know epic epicness
9574680	9580500	of first person role playing games. Which I don't think Scrolls was supposed to be.
9580500	9589220	There you go. Fantastic. Fantastic. Alright so we are gonna open up the Skype line 1877
9589220	9596660	Game OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. And oh we're already getting calls. And by
9596660	9600980	the way we will go to the Twitter here. Also Twitter.com slash OLR. But first we have some
9600980	9605940	calls coming in. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? This is Shane. Hey Shane it's
9605940	9611780	my co-host from Horde House. It sure isn't. What do you mean? Yes you are. You're on that
9611780	9615800	show. Oh yeah I guess I am sometimes. Right except this week you could only talk about
9615800	9619940	Mass Effect. Which by the way screw you. I bought Mass Effect this week which is kind
9619940	9624100	of like peer pressure in a way. And you do that a lot and I kind of despise you for it.
9624100	9629500	It's kind of because I blew up your phone about it. You really did. My god. And I'm
9629500	9633180	like. I hope you have unlimited texting. Who is Kaiden and why is Shane in love with him?
9633180	9638020	Does it? Alright anyway. What's up? What are you calling him for tonight? I was calling
9638020	9643580	because I want to talk about something I don't normally talk about. What's that? Mass Effect.
9643580	9648580	Of course. I've never heard you talk about Mass Effect before. Are you here to monopolize
9648580	9652540	the show with Mass Effect chat just like you did on Horde House this week? Yes. Alright
9652540	9658280	well what's up? I wanted to not talk about you know the story so much or how awesome
9658280	9662860	the game is. Don't spoil it. Don't talk about that ending that everybody's like petitioning.
9662860	9666220	I don't know about the ending yet. I have not beat the game. Did you hear that people
9666220	9671500	are petitioning BioWare to change the ending? It's apparently that bad. Yeah I'm kind of
9671500	9678820	kind of scared. Like I don't want it to end so I don't get disappointed. But anyway that's
9678820	9686780	not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how much respect I have for BioWare now. Oh.
9686780	9694020	Yes because this is the first game I have ever played in which I feel like they did
9694020	9702580	not take any stereotypes and put them into their gay characters. Not a single one. And
9702580	9709380	I think they actually humanized them instead of using them for comic relief or something
9709380	9716860	to just flirt with or hook up with. What about Dragon Age? No Dragon Age is totally terrible
9716860	9724980	with that stuff. Zevran in the first game especially. But in this game I feel like they're
9724980	9732180	just normal people who happen to be gay and I don't see that in games. And it really really
9732180	9739180	makes me feel like BioWare is a company I should support more often. Interesting. I'm
9739180	9744500	not sure what else I can really say to that. Have you only explored the male-male relationships
9744500	9750740	in that game or have you looked into how it compares to male-female or female-female?
9750740	9755340	Well and I'm only going to say it's for three because I've seen stuff on one where it was
9755340	9764780	pretty I think I described it at work skanky. Well sometimes relationships are skanky. Yes
9764780	9773260	but I just I wanted something more and this game has given it to me. I've only seen male-male
9773260	9778580	and actually the one I romance technically is in gay but it's just because I couldn't
9778580	9784080	resist his charms. I won't say who because that could be a spoiler I guess but really
9784080	9789740	romancing people isn't a spoiler. I found it interesting because I asked you in an email
9789740	9793340	this week when you wouldn't shut up about the game. I asked you like what kind of different
9793340	9798460	like relationship options were available and it seemed like the the the people that choose
9798460	9803620	to play femshep who want to be in a relationship with a male so an opposite sex relationship
9803620	9809660	but with a female care female lead was the most limited. Yes and three at least it is.
9809660	9813680	I found that to be kind of sad because you know we want you know I'm sure there's a lot
9813680	9818340	of ladies out there that would like to romance some men in their games and they don't really
9818340	9823820	get that option in this game. No they get romance ice cream tubs now instead because
9823820	9829780	they're sad. That is very sad so well maybe DLC I guess you never know is there a possibility
9829780	9836220	they're gonna add more romance options in later on? I don't know I I wouldn't imagine
9836220	9843820	so because the first DLC character is not romanceable to my knowledge and it'd be really
9843820	9850620	awkward if they were but you never know it's Bioware they can they can do whatever they
9850620	9857340	want and do it right apparently but also that game is amazing and I have cried three times
9857340	9864260	during it so far now. Three. It has beaten the previous game's record. What was the previous
9864260	9870320	game before that? Suikoden 2. That was twice. So just to kind of go back to the main point
9870320	9875820	of the call because you know to wrap up soon and all that why is this so important to you?
9875820	9881700	Because it's something I can relate to like I don't want to relate to like the skanky
9881700	9890380	options that people would have before I want you know a really nice story and that's what
9890380	9896960	I'm getting. What would you say to people who say why does Bioware have to put gay stuff
9896960	9905340	in every game? Because they want to give more options to everybody. That is what I would
9905340	9913980	say. Oh my god did somebody get shot in the background? No that is a washer being. Alright.
9913980	9917180	Somebody just shot you for your opinion that's really unfortunate what a hideous place we
9917180	9921960	live in. Are you okay you still there? Yeah I'm still here I'm just trying to do another
9921960	9927580	conversation at the same time. That works out great. Well I guess yeah I mean one thing
9927580	9932020	I've sensed even just from playing the first game before not even talking about relationships
9932020	9935580	or whatever is that I do notice there's so many options in the conversation so forth
9935580	9939180	to play the game in many different ways and it's something I kind of noticed in Star Wars
9939180	9945060	too is you know you could kind of be although in Star Wars the paths were very well lit.
9945060	9951460	Yeah I that's another thing I'm glad you kind of said something about like the choices in
9951460	9958700	the past the the one I took with the character I romanced in 3 for Mass Effect it wasn't
9958700	9963460	like you know we were having a normal dialogue conversation then bam here's a hook up with
9963460	9967820	you option or a not hook up with you option it was something that just kind of evolved
9967820	9975300	naturally and actually kind of came out of nowhere in my opinion but not in like. You
9975300	9981820	alright? He cut out. Oh no I'm back sorry I hit the wrong button. I just it was nice
9981820	9987440	it just kind of went natural and I didn't have to pick stinky stuff to get there. That's
9987440	9992980	one thing that some people I guess might misinterpret is that there's not the option like you know
9992980	10000560	it isn't on the menu like what should we do now oh well let's go kill aliens or let's
10000560	10006020	do research on the next mission or let's go upstairs and fuck like rabbits it's not like
10006020	10012220	how it plays out. No it's nothing like that at all it's like I'm not going to try to do
10012220	10019140	this not spoilery and kind of be general something happens that's major and then well if you've
10019140	10023640	played Mass Effect you can do missions and then one of like your home base of operations
10023640	10030540	is the Citadel that's not a spoiler it's always around so you do some missions and then something
10030540	10035220	happens and then you can you know run around the Citadel and we just happen to have a friendly
10035220	10041140	lunch conversation that it turned into us going out all of a sudden in a really really
10041140	10048860	nicely written scene and what's cool about that too is the actual gay guy in the game
10048860	10054380	I was doing some conversations with him and he said something about looking at some eye
10054380	10058980	candy and one of my options were no I'm interested in women and the other was like well what
10058980	10061660	about me and I picked up well what about me because I didn't want to screw up what I had
10061660	10066080	already done and he's like well yeah of course I'm looking at you but I know you're with
10066080	10070420	so-and-so so it's like oh crap the game actually knows the choices I've made and it's like
10070420	10076940	commenting on them. Interesting huh all right I guess I'm gonna have to hurry up and play
10076940	10080860	one and two so I can see more of this in action in three because one's still kind of basic
10080860	10085900	but I just started. All right we gotta let you go to get more calls any other quick thoughts
10085900	10090420	here before we let you go? No just oh also the multiplayer is really fun so sadly it's
10090420	10094980	part of the experience to get the best ending from what I understand but I played it for
10094980	10100020	two hours straight today and had a blast so I suggest people at least give it a shot.
10100020	10104820	All right there you go thanks for calling Shane. Thank you bye. Bye. All right 1877
10104820	10108880	game OLR or our username on skype is orange lounge radio in the meantime while we're waiting
10108880	10112460	for calls let's go to twitter twitter.com slash OLR because we've got some interesting
10112460	10116060	questions and comments on twitter this week I want to start with this one from the Rob
10116060	10122020	D this is a bit of a whopper here to start with um at OLR how do you guys stay motivated
10122020	10127000	each week to do a show have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular
10127000	10131820	basis so two questions there how do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show you
10131820	10135340	know I haven't think that question was asked a couple days ago coffee I've been thinking
10135340	10139060	about that question I honestly don't know if I have an answer I don't know what keeps
10139060	10144540	me motivated to do this show well I the people obviously seeing you guys come out and chat
10144540	10148400	and support what we're doing here is a huge motivator getting a hang with Matt and Jamie
10148400	10151580	and knowing that we're like creating this thing on the internet that even if it's just
10151580	10155300	like two or three people that enjoy it like people are enjoying it coffee that's a huge
10155300	10162500	motivator very very very very are both very big motivators certainly and my own ego and
10162500	10166060	like the phone line is lighting up right now that's it look at that my screen is like full
10166060	10171220	of like rings right now so that's a huge motivator all names are recognized all right let's let's
10171220	10174820	go to another call and see who's on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
10174820	10179500	hey what's up this is excellent hey how you doing hey doing long doing well a long time
10179500	10184980	I know it has been a while yeah I know hey I just kind of ironic um not to talk about
10184980	10188940	Mass Effect 3 because I haven't played it myself I did play the first two I just love
10188940	10194660	how they did do the stuff though um from the choices you make in your first game can affect
10194660	10201020	a lot of outcomes in the second game um and how I supposedly guess how the stuff in the
10201020	10205420	first and second can also impact the third I like how they they added that kind of like
10205420	10210020	it's a continuous storyline so it's not like you're replaying something over and over and
10210020	10213940	over again that's brand new for a three part you know for a three part series I kind of
10213940	10220160	like the fact that how everything can have a pro or con effect to something else within
10220160	10224640	the game that's the entire reason I started with one because I will tell you I was tempted
10224640	10229820	to just jump ahead to three but I didn't also it's really cool to know the fact that they
10229820	10235140	they took the inventory system and made it better and more flow and more easy thank god
10235140	10239340	because it's one it's one to two because one and two is so night and day and the controlling
10239340	10244500	was two I played one and then there was a big gap between me playing one and part two
10244500	10249860	I'm like am I doing this right is this the right way I'm you know why does this feel
10249860	10254500	like it changed so much and it's kind of weird but you get used to it though it's not too
10254500	10258740	much though within that game so so what else you've been playing lately just was because
10258740	10263820	you're not playing mass effect 3 but what are you playing these days well other than
10263820	10273740	wow la nor and I'm because my my I'm like you know me I'm an achievement whore I'm also
10273740	10279140	such as for the Xbox so right now I'm like three four achievements shy from perfecting
10279140	10284460	every single achievement within that game so I'm trying to get through that and then
10284460	10289740	I'm going to jump into a copy that my friend let me borrow a Saints Road three and try
10289740	10295660	to get through that so my gamer add is so bad I have only ever got every single possible
10295660	10302980	achievement in one game one what my first one my first one was Assassin's Creed and
10302980	10308920	that was a bitch mine you would never guess my perfect achievement game the only one is
10308920	10314660	rally X on Xbox arcade new rally acts the remake because I did I used to legit love
10314660	10319760	that game back in the day when I was a kid and so I'm I'm pretty decent at it but yeah
10319760	10324220	that's that's the only one yeah I thought my second one was gonna be you know but yeah
10324220	10329620	some people can really mess you up in that game so still today so that's kind of intriguing
10329620	10337500	so play rusty hearts too which is an awesome game if you like while I strongly just joining
10337500	10341740	up with me whenever you see me on steam probably because I know we're friends play some rusty
10341740	10346880	hearts with me man you'll like it trust me is this a free game or is this like yes hey
10346880	10352020	one or what it is no no no free to play it's absolutely awesome you can actually believe
10352020	10358100	or not I made my own little guild within the game that that's how cool this thing is and
10358100	10364620	it's pretty much the sky's the limit and it's like how this point it's like wild type but
10364620	10371100	also it's like when you ran through the dungeons it's more feeling like a first person scroll
10371100	10374780	like you're going from room to room kind of like and you're being up on stuff but the
10374780	10381520	way if you see him being played it's really cool so all right well excellent any other
10381520	10386460	quick shout outs you want to get out before we not really at this moment but also they
10386460	10391380	need to quit putting the disc dlc within the disc and stuff and then charging double the
10391380	10395660	money for that of the game with that that's getting ridiculous they really need to quit
10395660	10399100	on that I understand they're trying to make some extra money but it's really seriously
10399100	10402940	getting out of hand I agree with a lot of people on that subject it's gone too far all
10402940	10407420	right excellent you take care buddy enjoy the various games and at one some one of these
10407420	10412300	days I'll catch up in Mass Effect yeah absolutely quickly tie in tower do so you love it I'll
10412300	10419060	try but Alan Alan Alan makes me check on my tower I don't want to play he's like show

10648820	10652840	username on skype is orange launch radio going back to the rob d question from earlier how
10652840	10659260	do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show um you know obviously it's it's a lot
10659260	10662580	of it is the people and I don't know if I have like an easy answer for it you just kind
10662580	10667620	of have to make it a priority because if you allow yourself self to be like all oh but
10667620	10670720	the amazing race is on the night I really would just rather watch that instead then
10670720	10674060	it's gonna go kind of like fall apart like you just I think all of us have just kind
10674060	10679060	of made like a commitment like we're gonna do olr no matter what now of course there's
10679060	10683300	gonna be some things that are more important and sometimes it's just because we need a
10683300	10689960	break like Disneyland is Disneyland more important than olr yes well yes and no you know what
10689960	10695300	I mean though if we did it every week then why would we do olr but anyhow the other half
10695300	10698820	the question real quick have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular
10698820	10704140	basis yes it's called horde house and jamie had one for a while too and maybe she'll have
10704140	10709420	something new in the future as far as pre-recorded segments for the show um I don't know if that's
10709420	10715340	a suggestion but I'm always open to ideas there was I will say admit this there was
10715340	10718920	a time where we were talking about doing not break music in the middle but something else
10718920	10723220	so you never know what might happen here at olr we got another call coming in let's go

10759300	10765660	it was about um comparing because they were saying that you know well you know a console

11009220	11012820	week but we have got to wrap up and I've got I still got some tweets to go here before
11012820	11017380	we wrap up tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet there's still several tweets damn it I closed the
11017380	11026860	tweet window to bring up that Kid Icarus story um tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet there we go
11026860	11033500	the Disney stuff again all right uh we got a tweet from tech color tweets us and says
11033500	11041860	do all of you really hate Minecraft it's actually quite fun for like 10 minutes okay hate is
11041860	11047860	a strong word I do not hate Minecraft because saying I hate Minecraft means I I think that
11047860	11053140	people that play Minecraft are like like not smart and that's not the case at all no I
11053140	11059700	get why people like Minecraft it's not really for me I cannot like the I I don't really
11059700	11064100	keep in mind I don't ever really like to use hate because I think it's a very strong word
11064100	11069500	in a wasteful emotion but you can not like a game and not give a crap about who plays
11069500	11073960	it you know if other people like it that's their thing but you can completely loathe
11073960	11078820	the game you know it doesn't mean that you think anyone else that plays it is stupid
11078820	11084480	you can say like I hate Minecraft players then that's you know so I hate is a word reserved
11084480	11089640	for like doing my taxes I thought I was really boring I was bored but I love watching my
11089640	11094520	Minecraft videos I'll give you that I like watching the people that are really into it
11094520	11098980	online Alan watches a lot of these and some of them are pretty funny but like my mind
11098980	11103180	when it comes to that just like I have this big open palette and like just do something
11103180	11108140	with it before the goblins you know tear you up it's like I don't I don't it's weird like
11108140	11114960	I don't know what to do now I want to find like I was kind of thinking about trying it
11114960	11122060	again with the high definition textures I will say I did really try to do terraria though
11122060	11126660	I couldn't get into it I really you sent me that copy I did I even got like a four pack
11126660	11133140	and send it to my friends and I could get into it I tried it was too like there just
11133140	11136900	needed to be more structured kind of like I needed a little bit of hand I'm the type
11136900	11140280	of person that wouldn't play Minecraft the way it was supposed to be I would turn off
11140280	11146700	the enemies and just build shit all day that's what I would do I like this comment from DK
11146700	11150660	pop man in the chat I would think dark soccer would like it from an artistic standpoint
11150660	11155260	because that's kind of I'm not really an artist but you are a designer I mean yeah but the
11155260	11160660	thing is I have the Sims I see so you kind of just have a different outlet for it and
11160660	11165940	I don't really play the Sims anymore either I mean usually if I'm sitting down to do design
11165940	11170680	I've got in design open and am making something that I'm going to print you know or putting
11170680	11175300	something in my portfolio I am not you know trying to poopoo on Minecraft at all it's
11175300	11182580	just you know I really couldn't get into it I mean I might try it again but to be honest
11182580	11186060	I'm still trying to find a job right now and I don't have the time to devote to anything
11186060	11192660	else that's distracting me but yet you're still here at this show yeah I've been here
11192660	11197860	for 10 years I can't quit now all right Tiger class is a couple news tweets here I want
11197860	11203700	to read hold on because I have to do this for something else coming up okay I'm going
11203700	11208500	to Tiger claw a couple tweets here Minnesota lawmakers seek to ban community broadband
11208500	11213140	what the title alone that seems a little silly here look at the story from game politics
11213140	11219980	dot com Minnesota would do legislation meant to forbid community broadband projects joining
11219980	11225220	states like Georgia North Carolina hf 26 95 bars any community from building a broadband
11225220	11231740	network within the state meanwhile the companies that provide broadband in the state are refusing
11231740	11239040	to expand their networks to unders underserved unders excuse me underserved underserved underserved
11239040	11242500	and unserved areas within the state remember I don't get to see these in advance because
11242500	11247940	they're Twitter topics they come in during the show a trade group representing the industry
11247940	11250900	and the state claims they are not behind the bill before lawmakers activists have their
11250900	11256420	doubts why would this be why would you ban that I don't like I'm not seeing the other
11256420	11261020	side of this what's the good it sounds like other states have already done this why would
11261020	11267980	you ban it a recent post on a community action group called stop the cap revealed that George's
11267980	11271820	bill has been effectively shelved by being turned into what is called a study bill okay
11271820	11275780	so it didn't pass in Georgia if you're a citizen of one of the many towns not served by a broadband
11275780	11278820	service provider it would probably be in your best interest to ask your state representative
11278820	11282460	not to vote for this bill what's the pros about this I'm not seeing anything any can
11282460	11286100	anyone think of what a pro would be about this bill why would this bill be necessary
11286100	11292900	is it that they don't want I mean I thought competition was okay chatters help me out
11292900	11298580	because I'm maybe the cable providers or whatever like saying hey why are you giving away free
11298580	11306540	broadband that makes our expensive broadband look less wonderful I don't know I don't really
11306540	11312540	see I don't even really see a point to this but I know I don't get it either I'm really
11312540	11318220	seen waiting to see if somebody in check and kind of jump in here don't steal the government
11318220	11324740	hates competition all right let's see another tweet from Tiger Claw here fraud claim dismissed
11324740	11331220	an ex-Infinity ward heads versus Activision lawsuit a state Superior Court judge dismissed
11331220	11337500	one of the fraud claims by ex-Infinity ward heads Jason West and Vince Zampella against
11337500	11341780	their former employer Activision Blizzard they originally filed a lawsuit citing breach
11341780	11347020	of contract they added two counts of fraud to that saying they never intended to honor
11347020	11351860	their Activision never intended to honor their contract but the judge dismissed one of the
11351860	11356940	counts agreeing with Activision that the claim should not go forward however there is still
11356940	11365260	another claim of promissory promissory fraud and that will be on a trial starting May 7th
11365260	11370380	so one counts been thrown out but there's still plenty other counts to go and the chatter
11370380	11376940	say we're all as stumped as you good good thought all right let's go to a tweet from
11376940	11384940	101 DK pop man tweets us tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1 I don't know how to answer

11588620	11592500	still doing a show back when like literally there were three people in chat and we still
11592500	11596060	had fun with it and you know I'd like to think that I would still have fun with it even if
