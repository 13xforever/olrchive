13989	20052	Tonight, March 11th, 2012, a new iPad claims to do something Xbox and PlayStation can't.
20632	25735	One UK retailer is in financial trouble, and could the next Xbox be disk drive free?
31687	36390	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36670	38512	Orange Lounge Radio.
38652	44015	We are live with episode number 449 of our show for this March 11th of 2012.
45356	48959	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host.
48999	51901	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53041	53441	How are you?
53802	54042	Full.
54362	56142	Full, full of orange chicken I see.
56342	56643	Yes.
56963	58023	One of my weaknesses.
58323	61364	Because my DNA compelled me to eat it.
62204	64205	Panda Express is like Starbucks around here.
64725	65566	There's a crack.
65626	72928	There's a place like, there's literally, you can go to a mall and there's Panda Express in the food court and then right next door in the other mall is another Panda Express.
74169	75369	And they're all next door to Starbucks.
75949	76829	Yes, exactly.
77090	78050	That's how it works around here.
78772	83313	Alright, also say hello to, you know he loves his food too, say hello to Tech Master Loki!
83513	83934	Hello.
84034	84634	How you doing, Loki?
84814	85334	I'm doing good.
85674	87535	You went pretty basic with your food choice tonight.
88035	89055	You went to the McDonald's.
89375	99198	Yeah, it was because I just, there's not, like I said, there's not a lot here to, or from my house to, you know, your apartment, so.
99378	99558	Yeah.
99758	104520	And there's like, like a ton of McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and...
105640	106200	That's pretty much it.
106220	108421	Yeah, this part of town is really sad when it comes to food.
108501	115523	So, I mean, unless I pull off the freeway mid-trip, there wasn't really much for me to have.
115663	118284	I was going to go to Quiznos, but I was like, I had Quiznos yesterday.
118304	124125	I had pizza yesterday, so I was like, I'll just have McDonald's.
124145	124926	It won't be that bad.
125006	128967	It was actually pretty terrible, but it's all right.
129147	131628	I've been not eating McDonald's, so, you know.
132848	133709	Burger King is the way to go.
133729	135411	At least our food is palatable.
155350	181171	and again 6 Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and join us live in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where some of the chatters are not too happy about us bringing up food Uni starts us off tonight saying OMG dang you for mentioning Panda I want it now lol and they don't even pay us for these ads these free ads that we're giving away here on the show we need to put the clamp down on that alright no more freebies meh
182458	185020	I love my food from Redacted.
212438	214620	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
237299	243564	So yeah, I finally started playing it, and while I'll save my opinions for a little bit here... I think it was the same year as Rock Band.
244144	244784	Was it really?
244884	245725	Like, within a week.
245805	252670	Well, I figure they come out about every other year, except for, I think, Mass Effect 2 originally had been bumped back.
252710	254591	Like, it was a January release, wasn't it?
255952	259675	PS3 it was, because that came out a year later, I think.
259835	266499	I could have sworn that when Mass Effect 2 came out, it was really early in the year because when it got a lot of Game of the Year awards, people were like, that came out this year?
266939	268840	Oh yeah, it came out like right after Christmas.
269360	283949	So, but anyway, this isn't about necessarily just the timing of things, but what I really wanted to ask was, has there ever been a game that just, it seemed like you missed the boat on it for so long, it just took you so long to get into it, and years later, here you are finally playing it?
284449	287931	Have you ever had a game like that where it took you like five years to get into it?
289898	293479	I really can't think of very many because I really can't play a lot of console stuff anymore.
293499	293599	Yeah.
317219	318780	Oh yeah, because of your hand and stuff.
319480	322641	I played Mario Kart 7 for the first time yesterday.
323921	325302	It didn't make me throw up.
325642	326262	Well, that's good.
326883	329003	I thought I let you play Mario Kart 7 when I got it.
329103	329383	No.
330084	331304	I played Loki's Ridge Racer.
332184	333365	That was it, and it made me sick.
333965	334505	Oh, it's too bad.
335066	337126	Loki, anything you can think of that was a little bit delayed for you?
337366	338547	Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
340977	345521	That's true, you've just been talking about the first game not that long ago, huh?
345781	349424	Well, we're gonna be going to three pretty soon, I think.
350806	353708	Because I asked them, like, hey, you guys wanna do number two?
353808	357932	Like, if we're gonna move to another game, we're gonna go to the latest one.
358332	359694	Not Black Ops or anything, because...
360526	362286	I'm not really into the Cold War stuff.
362306	365947	We're more into the Modern Warfare stuff.
391132	418377	probably five games were new that's a man I wish that was a goal I could realistically accomplish but I never beat games I really should force myself to but there's just there's so much other stuff I have to tackle that I wouldn't want to give myself a goal like that that's that's a lot that's up there with reading a hundred books in a year or something like that BlackWolf in chat says Beatmania 2DX I think I can think of one for you DarkSakra World of Warcraft
419321	420823	I played it right at the beginning, though, too.
421124	422206	Oh, that's right, you did.
422366	424089	Remember, I had a vanilla account.
424109	425170	Yeah, I forgot about that.
425210	425631	That's true.
426352	429377	TheRobD says, playing new games is overrated.
429417	432983	You know, it's usually a lot cheaper if you wait, that's for sure.
434986	437308	I finally beat every single puzzle in Best Move for iOS.
454103	480235	and um it was pretty epic now I want them to release some more so that I can get more puzzles um I started another game called Star Mine that I bought on name alone and it's actually a pretty fun little puzzle game it's like a block sliding kind of game and then um I played some while on Sonic CD all right yeah there you go Loki
481567	485548	I played just a few games this week other than Call of Duty.
487369	495192	Played a little bit of the new Vita game, Motorstorm RC, which is pretty cool.
495292	497772	It's a little different than a regular Motorstorm game.
497812	502214	It's more like a Super Sprint or Ivan Ironman, Stewards, Super Offroad type thing.
503074	517021	and I've been playing that a bit and one of the things I was trying to do was beat because they have ghost data that you race basically in the game and so I was trying to beat that stuff and I was pretty happy that I was able to beat the ghost data that was in there.
517961	518841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
546835	553589	well it's not terrible but hey it's free so I guess you can't complain um
555478	555778	I don't know.
555978	557018	So it's a little frustrating.
557058	566421	Unfortunately, I kind of ran the same thing with some of the other Ghost Data that I raced where I beat it and find out that, oh, look, I'm still ranked 3,000.
567661	570082	Even though, oh, there's times they're faster than mine.
570402	573723	Well, then why wasn't that the Ghost Data that I was racing?
573883	575223	It's just all really weird.
576444	579705	And, you know, I complained to, of course, got to complain to them, Bill.
579765	581765	Listen, bitch, I know this shit was free.
581785	582945	Did you say in an angry tweet?
583186	584746	I did say in an angry tweet to...
585166	586107	at PlayStation.
586127	586647	No, no, no.
586667	587907	Why are your games broken?
587948	591609	No, no, see, you would think it's at PlayStation, but no, it's at MotorStormRC.
591669	594831	They have their own fucking Twitter account, and I'm like, what the fuck?
594851	598773	You can't beat this goddamn ghost lap because it only does three of the four laps.
599487	600288	We're aware of the issue.
600968	602268	We're working on it.
602649	604029	I kind of did something similar this week.
604129	604689	I sent a tweet.
605090	606390	This is serious, not a joke.
606530	611012	I sent a tweet to Awake NBC and I sent a tweet that said, please don't get cancelled.
611932	615234	Because I like the show and apparently not a lot of people are watching it.
615754	617475	So I sent them a tweet and I said, please don't get cancelled.
617995	618796	They didn't reply to me.
618836	619837	Maybe they've already been cancelled.
621438	622559	I don't know.
622899	623400	That was alright.
623480	624321	I played a little bit of that.
624521	628784	A couple of things that are a little frustrating with me.
628864	630646	The camera is really annoying.
630986	633829	I really wish this game was a first person driving game.
633849	637372	I understand maybe the camera is top down because one, it's an RC game.
638873	645559	That's fine, but I've played other RC games that were first person or at least behind the car type thing, not this
646064	648026	I had to figure it out from the top of the track.
648046	650188	Is this going to be about your love of Excite Truck again?
650569	652050	No, it's not going to be about Excite Truck.
652671	659558	No, there was a racing game that was on, I think it was Revolt, was actually on the PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1.
660219	661220	That was actually pretty cool.
661360	662041	It was an RC game.
662802	665526	It's just, it's a little frustrating though.
665546	672176	Like when you're racing, it's hard to see some of the track, get the really mess of the camera to, you know, get it just right.
673097	676041	And then of course they have cars you can buy, which...
677378	700203	as far as I'm aware they don't have stats on those cars so I don't know what any of these other cars that I'm unlocking do other than different types and assuming the different types handle differently but as far as different cars within the same type I think it's just the way they look um I did download the free cake car that you can it's a cake slice car um
701763	702804	So that was free.
704625	706045	What else?
706065	709667	I played Luminous on the Vita as well.
710227	716709	I went through and I decided, hey, I'm going to beat all the leaderboards on here, at least within my friends.
717410	717990	And so I did that.
718190	723052	I beat all the leaderboards and last I checked and I was on top of all of them.
723732	748080	except for obviously uh some of the higher uh master class stuff because I haven't beat the master thing yet that's like really frustrating just trying to get all the trophies for that game um oh and ranked up to 50 because for some reason when I play Luminous it's actually when they start doing the world cube thing and you level up like 30 levels just by checking it once I still can't
748300	749260	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
770869	771030	8 or 9 p.m.
771050	771370	Pacific
784909	789113	And of course, with the time change and everything, it might be 7 to 8 p.m.
789293	792256	Pacific.
793717	795559	So yeah, that's pretty much all I played.
796740	797041	All right.
797881	798482	My Gaming Week.
798522	800143	Let me talk about a few things I've been playing this week.
800163	801044	There have been a few things.
801345	802706	Obviously, first off is Mass Effect.
803607	804648	But I haven't played it enough.
804768	807550	Well, A, do you really want me to review a five-year-old game?
807590	807871	I think...
808271	821096	I think most of you probably know how you feel, but since I did see somebody earlier had said they haven't played it and DarkSakura hasn't played it, I'll just quickly say, well, I haven't played enough to give you a full review, but I'll tell you this much.
821436	824837	I am way less annoyed by the combat than I thought I would be.
825217	849789	because I know Mass Effect is very much about like use cover and hide behind things and get things and that's like why I could not play Gears of War and it's not that I think Gears of War is a bad game it's not it's a good game but I that whole like cover thing like no I want fucking Quake or Unreal where you run out there guns a-blazing that's more my kind of shooter so I thought the cover thing would really bother me but it's it's not and I think
850389	852931	Let's be real, I think a lot of that is because I'm playing on easy.
853351	858954	So I think my squad mates really pick up the slack for me, which is totally fine by me because I'm really more playing for the story.
859314	866918	And I did find through playing Star Wars The Old Republic and a little bit of Dragon Age, I do like Bioware's whole little conversational style.
866958	869160	And I really do see where the game can...
870060	874522	Damn well be two completely separate games depending on how you are playing it.
874582	875983	So I like that.
876303	879645	I kind of like that, that it can go in the different directions.
879745	883427	But little annoyances I have so far.
884548	886949	Some of the interface is just kind of crappy.
887009	891492	Now I hear that they fixed a lot of those issues in 2 and 3, so I'm not going to really harp on it.
891872	895894	But let me just say, I really value the one button maps.
896894	897675	That's all I'm going to say.
898155	918287	but those are kind of nitpicking otherwise what I think especially for five years ago was graphically a good game and you know um pretty I guess ahead of its time in some ways but um I'll let you know how things progress after I actually play more of it because if I told you where I was right now you'd be like oh Rob you barely touched the damn game um a couple other things I've played um
919708	920670	Rune Spell Overture.
920770	935171	I can't remember if I talked about this game before on the show, but it's a game I bought in one of those indie bundle collections that I got a key for on Steam, and maybe I played it a little bit back when I first got it, and I might have mentioned it in passing on the show, but I played it more in depth this week, and...
936252	945555	For those that don't know it, I would say it's a little bit Puzzle Quest 2-ish meets a solitaire slash poker hybrid.
945575	958240	And I know that sounds really weird, but the way you battle enemies is that you kind of have a solitaire-ish hand, and then they have one, and you form poker hands by moving your cards around.
958260	960160	But it doesn't follow the rules of Solitaire.
960180	962101	It doesn't have to be red on black or any of that stuff.
962721	968744	Um, you can take their cards too and move them up into your hand and you're trying to form like the best poker hands.
969124	973186	Like, you know, five of a kind would be the best one, which is more of a Yahtzee, but you know what I mean?
973846	984350	Um, and I, you kind of battle that way, but on top of that, you have spells, which felt a little more like puzzle quests because you can kind of activate those based on the power that you've generated.
984430	985371	So, um,
985911	989532	Pretty cool little time killer puzzle game and I imagine it's super cheap.
989813	994975	I bought it in a bundle so I bought it when it was a very, very reasonable price.
995135	996015	Soundtrack's good too.
996135	996935	Let me throw that out there.
997756	998776	Pretty deep story.
998876	1008280	No voice acting but some dialogue questions and it definitely seems like there's a fleshed out story that I'm not far enough in to really appreciate yet.
1010521	1010761	Let's see.
1010801	1012322	A couple other things I've been playing this week.
1012822	1012962	Um...
1014861	1015461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1028001	1028141	Journey
1050337	1050817	and so on.
1072975	1080785	I don't know where to put... Journey is definitely more like a platformer, but don't think of it like a platformer.
1080925	1088015	I'm being very careful and choosing my words carefully here because I think Journey is best experienced not knowing anything about it.
1088135	1090358	Because I will tell you this, I sat down and played Journey.
1091860	1092881	It doesn't tell you anything.
1093382	1094443	There's no dialogue.
1094883	1101191	There's no, you know, do this or you need to go here or arrow or any help.
1101811	1106697	There is one little, you know, the little controller will show up and it will say, you know, A is jump.
1106837	1107418	That's about it.
1107518	1109020	Like once in a while it'll kind of pop up.
1109580	1112223	So you're kind of left to your own devices to figure out what the heck's going on.
1113224	1139689	and it's a game that's told really through its soundtrack in a way like I just I found the soundtrack to be amazing and really moving and then there's a twist to it there's a reason why it's called Journey and some of you probably know but I don't want to ruin it for you if you don't already know the band pops out and starts playing you on your way therefore it's part of the soundtrack I wish, I wish that would make it even more awesome but there's a twist
1140769	1145093	And when it happened, I was like, wait a minute.
1145774	1148757	What the... Do you know what I'm talking about, Loki?
1148777	1149738	Have you read about this game at all?
1150839	1153722	I've read about the game, but... I'm trying very hard not to ruin it for the listeners.
1153962	1156484	I'll have to tell you during the break or something, but there's a little twist to it.
1157205	1157325	And...
1158686	1162130	I didn't realize what was happening as it was happening.
1162590	1168095	And I was kind of like, this is so... How do I explain it?
1170938	1173500	As it was happening, I was kind of like, I didn't...
1174588	1179411	Realize what it really was at first, and then it kind of hit me, like, oh my gosh, this is this.
1180131	1181692	Yeah, I know what you're talking about now.
1181732	1181913	Do you?
1181953	1183153	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
1184134	1184594	Do you really?
1184994	1185154	Yeah.
1185315	1192059	Okay, but there, yeah, but you know, like, it's, and then suddenly when you figure it out, you're like, oh my god, I had no idea that this was part of the game.
1192639	1196842	And then, again, I said there's no dialogue, and there's not a lot to it.
1198042	1203446	You're finding all these interesting ways you've never thought about before to now play this game.
1203726	1203986	Mm-hmm.
1204981	1222581	and it can go a variety of directions it can go a very customary direction or it can go in a direction where I never saw this twist happen I'm just gonna ignore it I don't give an F I'm gonna go do this what I was doing before and the game still kind of works in both ways now
1224778	1230560	The one thing I will say about it is that it's short.
1231140	1233240	It's like two or three hours tops.
1233840	1235101	And it's a $15 game.
1236181	1237522	And that may not sit well with people.
1239342	1246364	Which is fair because we've been taught to know that games like that usually shouldn't cost that much money.
1246944	1271674	but I do think it's a it's a really good two three hour experience and there is some replay value in it I can see again there's several different ways to approach the game and um yeah I would recommend it but I think that play time is going to really scare some people off but and I think a lot of people are saying this this game is very much the games are art in motion
1273342	1273983	But I don't know.
1274683	1277285	I wouldn't necessarily say, well, Roger Ebert needs to play this game.
1277685	1278966	I don't think he could appreciate it.
1279507	1295620	But as somebody who's had some pretty miserable experiences on Xbox Live and had to put up with trolling in World of Warcraft and so forth, the experience that this game brought was really organic and neat.
1296740	1296901	So...
1297741	1299764	I guess that's really all I can say about it.
1299804	1302466	Again, some of you know darn well what I'm talking about and you're just like, just say it.
1302767	1307011	But I'm telling you, there's a reason why I'm not telling you.
1308172	1311176	Because I don't want you to be spoiled on that and seriously avoid reviews.
1312737	1317322	The value of the game will be so much more if you know nothing about it going in.
1317622	1318263	Trust me.
1318824	1319985	Don't spoil it for yourself.
1322059	1324162	You might figure it out right away.
1324722	1327045	But, you know, that's all I'm going to say.
1327226	1328227	All right.
1329448	1330049	Let me move on.
1330590	1331891	I actually had one more game I was playing.
1331911	1333433	It is one I'm going to pick up this week, though.
1333814	1334815	I wanted to pick that up.
1334915	1335516	Yeah.
1335796	1338920	You're welcome to test it out here if you want to see if it's worth 15 bucks or not.
1338960	1339821	But, you know, because...
1340422	1369502	you know it's again it's a pretty basic platformer the visuals are not I think it's a very beautiful game but some people are going to go it's all desert it's just the desert desert desert but there's some very beautiful things they do like there's one level where you're kind of it's almost like a race like you're falling down a hill and you're kind of like you know having to move like it's almost like hydro thunder or something and it's like you're falling through the desert as the sun is setting it's really gorgeous so I forgot that I had one more game you have one more game you want to add that's fine because I'm done what did you want to add
1370061	1371662	I was playing Doctor Who The Mazes of Time.
1372402	1373222	Is that actually good?
1373742	1374642	It's pretty good so far.
1374722	1375323	Is that an iPhone game?
1375623	1389207	Yeah, you play as the Doctor and Amy and you have to, it's basically one person does one part of the puzzle and maybe has to stand on something so that it activates another part of the puzzle and then you have to figure out how to get both of them through the maze.
1390007	1395568	So it's just a fun little, it's a dollar right now so get it.
1396029	1396429	There you go.
1397769	1398069	All right.
1400170	1400751	Let's move on.
1401051	1403372	Let's talk about some housekeeping before we get into news.
1403612	1404873	I actually have something tonight.
1405433	1409955	And this is something I'm going to surprise DarkSakura and Loki with on air.
1410216	1411976	Because aren't on-air surprises the best?
1412397	1412837	Oh, Lord.
1414332	1415592	Alright, so let me tell you about this.
1416152	1419513	I got a package in the mail this week from our buddy Brad at PodCulture.
1419693	1421434	And this is the package that we got.
1421454	1422634	And I had no idea what it was.
1422654	1423114	Cardboard!
1423374	1426155	Yes, it's cardboard, but there's something inside this cardboard I think you should see.
1426195	1428655	And you, Jamie, I think are really going to appreciate this.
1429035	1429375	You ready?
1429975	1431556	Okay, so here's what was sent to us.
1431936	1434296	And listeners, this can impact you as well.
1435757	1441198	These are vinyl decals of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.
1442731	1443691	There's one for you.
1444331	1445332	There's one for Matt.
1445752	1446812	Now, here's the cool thing.
1447472	1450393	I wouldn't take that off because once you do, you're going to have to stick it on something.
1450433	1451713	I check the ink on everything.
1451733	1452113	You know me.
1452373	1452653	Oh, yeah.
1452673	1453353	You're a nerd like that.
1453654	1454254	Here's the thing.
1454554	1459175	We have some extra decals here, and I'm sure we'll give those away at some point, except I want to keep one for myself.
1459455	1460635	There's some other ones in here.
1460715	1463816	These are hard to see, but hold them up to the light, and you can see.
1464076	1467917	These are like the white silhouette ones that you see on the backs of cars.
1468197	1468457	Yeah.
1468477	1468557	Yeah.
1468797	1473786	Yeah, but like the artist here took kind of like the art and did that.
1473866	1475529	And I really like the way that looks.
1475970	1476210	Yeah.
1476370	1476591	So...
1478869	1507575	assuming that Loki and DarkSakura like this the guy is gonna I think we're gonna try he's offered to sell the stickers on his site so you guys can get them too of course you know they're not free guys it does cost money to make but I know the guy will be reasonable about the price I wouldn't mention it here on the show if I didn't think that and it's you know Brad from PogCulture is our buddy and of course I didn't put the name of the site here in front of me but I have the letter here it is
1508095	1514861	DecalMike.com There it is, DecalMike.com and we're going to see what we can do to get that added to the store so you guys can check that out.
1515222	1516583	Now the listeners are demanding pictures.
1518294	1520755	I don't think that... It's going to be hard to take a picture of.
1520895	1521315	Exactly.
1521355	1525456	I'm like, you have to remember it's a vinyl decal of the Orange Lounge Radio album art.
1525516	1527457	So if you've seen the podcast... With Flash it could work.
1527637	1533198	You already know what it looks like but they're like little stickers and they're about the size... How big would you say that is?
1533678	1534479	The size of your phone.
1534539	1536579	It's about the size of an iPhone but a little bit more square.
1536599	1537119	I think it's a 3x3 or 3.5x3.5.
1539480	1546406	So those of you guys that have been asking for OLR merchandise, because you know it's been how many years we still don't have a t-shirt, I think we'll be able to jump on this.
1546586	1553072	So I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to our buddy Brad at PodCulture, and of course Decal Mike for the hard work there.
1553813	1561199	But Brad from PodCulture is the one that essentially, I guess for lack of a better term, fronted the money, I guess for that, or kicked around the idea to get that started.
1561280	1563802	So props to him.
1565410	1565671	Alright.
1566274	1567580	Yeah, it's probably not going to show up very well.
1567641	1569549	The iPhone will not do it justice, but, you know.
1571070	1571170	Oh.
1572170	1579892	And if you're a fan of Airwolf or, you know, Back to the Future, there's also decals on Decal Mike's site as well.
1580152	1580532	Oh, really?
1580552	1582012	I have to be honest.
1582072	1585173	I haven't had a chance to browse the site yet, but he has some other stuff too.
1585193	1586893	Yeah, there's stuff like from Airwolf.
1586933	1588153	There's World of Warcrack.
1588673	1593574	There's the Thundercat Sword, the Stargate SGC decal.
1593634	1595835	It's all the shows that Brad talks about on his show.
1595855	1596875	I'm not surprised at all.
1596895	1597415	Yeah, there's some...
1598095	1600296	Yeah, there's, you know, it's hard to interrupt this.
1600536	1602276	There's, you know, the pod culture stuff.
1602296	1602956	Oh, his other shows.
1603016	1603537	All right.
1603617	1608978	Type 40, Geekspin, and, you know, a lot of stuff from Occupy Wall Street.
1609018	1610679	There's the Guy Fawkes mask.
1611059	1611559	Adalic.
1612579	1613019	Adalic.
1613740	1614020	Nice.
1615580	1616361	Loves it!
1616401	1617861	I'm putting up a few pictures.
1617901	1618722	Thanks again, you guys.
1618842	1622903	And listeners, if you want to get these stickers, I have to do some... They're not there yet.
1623524	1628326	I have to do some DMs and all that stuff on Twitter and get that all arranged, but they should be up.
1629449	1630871	We'll remind you guys next week about that.
1631512	1631772	All right.
1634475	1636898	My 3DS friends are asking for 3D pictures.
1636958	1638119	You guys, it's a window decal.
1638139	1639201	They're not in 3D.
1639962	1641343	3D is not going to do it justice.
1643606	1643846	All right.
1643906	1645328	Now let's get into some gaming news.
1645928	1647570	Less about us, more about the video games.
1647650	1647871	Loki.
1648251	1653955	So there was a brief little web stream thing for the PlayStation Vita.
1654575	1658418	I was hoping for a lot more US titles, but unfortunately they're all Japanese titles.
1658578	1664242	But it doesn't necessarily mean that this stuff won't be coming out over here or in other territories other than Japan.
1664302	1666443	But as of right now, it's just all Japanese titles.
1666503	1674529	So starting off, one of the titles that got announced was Phantasy Star Online 2 is coming to the Vita with PC cross-play.
1674569	1677511	So you're going to be able to play against people that have the PC version as well.
1678331	1683258	So there you go, your first MMO on the Vita.
1684981	1693773	I'm not really sure how the online's handled, but hell, if anything, the old PlayStation, or not PlayStation, the old...
1695815	1704342	Sega Dreamcast, Phantasy Star Online was able to work over dial-up, so Phantasy Star Online 2 working over 3G, maybe?
1705423	1706324	Be kind of interesting.
1707285	1712329	No word on when that's going to be coming out, probably later this year, but it's still pretty cool.
1714048	1717070	and then they also had a... I really hope this comes to America.
1717110	1719151	Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off, but I really want this to come to America.
1719171	1724453	I really liked... I'm probably the only person in the world that liked Phantasy Star Universe.
1725594	1732217	And I know this is not PSU 2, this is PSO 2, and it's PSO 2 because PSU was not viewed as very good.
1732817	1741669	But regardless, I'm a fan of this series and I hope that we are getting it in America because I was interested in it when they first announced the PC one.
1741689	1744132	I like playing Phantasy Star Online offline.
1744492	1745394	That was kind of fun.
1746107	1750850	Well then you'd probably like those PSP games were just Phantasy Star Universe but offline.
1751411	1752952	Yeah, meh.
1753152	1755053	That was the one where you could have the pizza box.
1755794	1757475	Had some really weird tie-ins, remember that?
1757555	1759036	Yeah, the Pizza Hut stuff, that was funny.
1760117	1763299	Wasn't Colonel Sanders in there or something like that?
1763319	1769804	Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me because I think Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell are like all the same people.
1769824	1770704	That's kind of cool.
1770925	1771145	Yeah.
1771605	1772666	Brand Wars.
1773746	1781650	Another RPG that's coming out as well on the Vita, Legend of Heroes, or Dragon Slayers, The Legend of Heroes.
1782430	1785011	And that's coming out on the Vita as well.
1785051	1790274	And they also announced that Gundam Seed Battle Destiny will be coming out on the Vita.
1791194	1792115	And it's, I guess...
1793475	1799039	The sixth game in the Gundam Battle series, of which I am not familiar with.
1799339	1802441	I am assuming those were only Japanese releases.
1804443	1804843	Not surprised.
1804863	1810947	There was another one that was unannounced that was kind of like, oh, we're going to work with the fans to make this happen or something.
1811007	1815069	It just reminded me too much of Mega Man Legends 3, so I just tuned that out.
1815490	1821814	But yeah, unfortunately, no actual US titles or anything like that.
1823817	1823997	E3 E3 E3 E3
1853075	1858539	Well, I mean, and yeah, I mean, if you think about it, three months from launch, that's almost E3, so why not?
1858879	1868627	And they've already, you know, kind of announced everything that's gonna be coming out, first party at least, up through the end of the second quarter, so...
1869787	1872649	It would make sense that any of those other announcements are going to be at E3.
1872709	1876371	There's probably going to be a little bit of a lull during the summer, but you're going to get a lot of fall games.
1877331	1879232	We've got Resistance and Gravity Rush.
1879792	1883214	In fact, Gravity Rush, that would be the June title.
1883294	1886576	Resistance is going to be the May title.
1886856	1889337	April, probably LittleBigPlanet.
1889517	1893660	Well, now here's what I'm wondering, because this was a Twitter conversation I was in this week.
1893680	1902806	Somebody was asking when LittleBigPlanet was coming out, and I was like, well, supposedly it's April, but the box art isn't even finalized yet, and there's a lot that seems like it's still up in the air in the game.
1903246	1907689	I mean, the game may be awesome, and I'm totally down with that if that's the case.
1907789	1910751	Box art's finalized, just aside from the ESRB rating.
1910991	1913533	I'm really worried about them rushing it.
1913773	1914694	I just don't want a rushed game.
1915154	1916935	I don't think it's going to be rushed.
1916955	1919817	I was thinking at this point it would get delayed to summer because we just haven't heard a lot about it.
1919957	1921198	No, because this was your launch title.
1921218	1922219	I think it's already been delayed.
1922279	1940871	I think putting it out in March would have been kind of... I mean, it would have been alright, but I think it's good that they're spacing their titles out because they had two titles coming out in March and they're going to have one each month coming.
1941932	1943613	Major titles coming out soon.
1945494	1947516	At least there's a lot more releases than there were on the 3DS.
1947536	1956761	Because I remember when the 3DS came out, the next month was pretty much... SpongeBob SquigglePants, there was... SpongeBob SquigglePants?
1956961	1957822	SquigglePants, yes.
1957842	1958802	I thought it was SquarePants.
1958942	1959623	No, SquigglePants.
1959643	1960303	Is this his cousin?
1960743	1962825	It was the one that was like WarioWare.
1962845	1964946	Did he marry into the SquigglePants family?
1965066	1965666	He must have.
1966567	1969349	Yes, he changed his last name.
1969649	1969889	I see.
1971550	1973891	So I just remember that the releases were a lot slower, but...
1975052	1976113	I don't know, it's kind of cool.
1976593	1980456	I would like to see some other stuff.
1980676	1990464	I'm hoping, because it's supposed to be a PlayStation Network title, I'm hoping that Retro City Rampage will be playable on the Vita, because that would be pretty awesome.
1991945	1992265	It might be.
1993726	1996248	I mean, it doesn't have to push a lot of graphics.
1997782	2007070	Alright, well, now that the Vita is out and they're talking about it, now our attention starts to shift towards the next batch of consoles that is the unknown.
2007270	2014977	That would be, of course, the Wii U, the PlayStation 4 someday, and the next Xbox, or whatever they're going to end up calling it.
2015378	2018500	I think they should do the Apple thing and just call it the Xbox all over again.
2018520	2019481	The new Xbox.
2019501	2020442	The new Xbox.
2021483	2023104	That's, like, so confusing.
2023325	2024506	I mean, seriously...
2026232	2029475	Well, we're going to get to it later in the show, so I'll talk about it then.
2029515	2031657	I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.
2031697	2038383	I understand why they're doing it because of their other series of hardware devices.
2038864	2041987	For anything, I bought a Corolla.
2044080	2046341	or I bought a Xerox machine.
2046381	2048501	There's a lot of things that we don't necessarily address.
2048542	2052703	Xerox machines have model numbers, Corollas, and different car manufacturers.
2052763	2054603	It's a 2012 Corolla or it's a 2011 Corolla.
2054683	2057884	I know that, but people don't necessarily refer to it by that.
2058585	2058885	Well, fine.
2058905	2061306	They can call the stupid new iPad.
2061326	2062206	You know what people are going to call it?
2062226	2064467	You're having an argument we're supposed to be having in 30 minutes.
2065007	2066507	Did you not get tonight's list?
2066607	2067127	I don't care.
2069168	2079763	Alright, the next Xbox, the new Xbox Xbox Lube, Xbox I won't even call it that other number name because that's just a stupid name and I can't believe everybody always calls it that How about the X-Sphere?
2080303	2085891	I hear the new system will be full of skateboarding games Yes, I was going to say the next Xbox Atari skateboarding game
2087272	2087853	All right, anyhow.
2089294	2099862	The big rumor going around this week about it, and what's interesting about this rumor is that we had a very similar rumor five weeks ago, and I seriously think everybody forgot, but we kind of already had this rumor.
2100502	2106106	But it made the rounds again that the next Xbox won't have a disk drive.
2106166	2109689	Oh, supposedly the code name is Durango, speaking of cars.
2110229	2114052	But anyway, the next Xbox is supposed to not have a disk drive.
2114737	2143250	um there's you know apparently it's leaked out even though there was big NDAs and all that and you know of course there's a way these things happen uh the next Xbox quote will offer the quote from MCV UK quote will offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid state card storage although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as SD so if I'm reading this correctly we've gone from cartridges to disc back to cartridge
2144628	2144848	Right?
2145308	2146488	Is what they're saying with the next Xbox.
2166454	2170357	It's doing like a proprietary format like the Vita.
2170737	2179743	It was basically for security because that thing was getting hacked to shit and publishers didn't want to make games for the system because they're afraid that it's going to get pirated.
2179843	2187268	Well, wouldn't that just be forward thinking on Microsoft's part that Blu-ray is going to get hacked to shit if it hasn't been already and they don't want to... A, it's...
2188169	2189870	Sony's involved with Blu-ray, so why?
2208922	2210983	Well, of course, everybody's now crying.
2211263	2212963	It's the death of the used game market.
2213003	2214404	It's the death of retail.
2214504	2215224	It's the death.
2216345	2221586	Because when you don't have a disc, therefore, there's nothing to interchange.
2221967	2223967	So it is going to go belly up.
2224047	2227288	Although, why are people going here when we're talking about cartridges?
2227349	2228449	This sounds like the Vita to me.
2228909	2231451	I mean, it'll probably be just like the Vita.
2231511	2232572	It doesn't even matter.
2232712	2234634	It's gonna have a drive of some sort.
2234674	2236875	They're not gonna just get rid of physical discs.
2237336	2238597	I think it's still gonna be disc-based.
2238617	2240678	I think that all these rumors are full of shit.
2240718	2241399	Where's their source?
2241659	2244101	Oh, it's some guy that said he was under NDA.
2244361	2246283	Well, I'm under NDA, and guess what?
2246603	2247644	It's a fucking robot.
2247684	2249905	It's a giant 50-foot tall robot.
2249925	2250786	That's the new system.
2251627	2256430	I wasn't supposed to tell you because I was under NDA, but it's a giant 50-foot fucking tall robot.
2256510	2257491	I used to be able to hear.
2257551	2257871	Thank you.
2258732	2260853	So it's a response to the Sony AIBO.
2261533	2263113	It is a giant fucking robot.
2263874	2264414	Oh, I'm sorry.
2264514	2265634	I was under NDA.
2265674	2266515	You didn't hear it from me.
2266795	2267595	Giant fucking robot.
2268155	2271136	I mean, that is about how credible this is.
2271236	2272376	It's just stupid.
2272517	2273777	It is so fucking stupid.
2273817	2279739	We've had all these... Because it's just feeding into the goddamn... It's just troll bait is all it is.
2281240	2282301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2306035	2329257	or you can buy everything physical now whether the disc is going to be a blu-ray disc or it's going to be a cartridge or whatever it doesn't matter but there's going to be some physical part to it I don't think the cartridge idea is so far-fetched we know that those little memory cards those tiny tiny ass memory cards on the PlayStation Vita can hold up to 32 gigabytes and that Sony is charging way more than those cards are really worth
2329737	2336603	So, you know, in a couple years' time, when the Xbox New is a reality, you could probably fit... How much can a Blu-ray hold right now?
2336663	2337584	Is it 20 gigs?
2337804	2338905	It's like 50-some gigs.
2338965	2340466	Is it even... Oh, God, I thought it was less.
2340486	2344990	Well, because I was going to say, you could probably hold more on a card than you probably could... I mean, USB drives go higher.
2345611	2349134	They're probably looking at something where you can hold more on a card than you can on a disc.
2349154	2354979	Well, that even might be... And to be honest, I mean, that might be the reason why they're going that route is because...
2355499	2362181	They're worried that they're going to run into the same problem they do with the DVD9 format where they're going to basically run out of disk space.
2362701	2374344	And they're just thinking ahead saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't do this because we want to have some sort of support for whatever formats that are larger than this because we don't want to have to come out with a new console.
2374464	2376445	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Macrossbox.
2378326	2380948	It transforms into a Valkyrie and flies away with your money
2398706	2403691	that isn't on super high-speed internet or has that type of bandwidth a month.
2403831	2412700	I think sometimes in our big urban areas, we live in a little bit of a bubble, those of us that live there, thinking everybody has that type of connection, but they don't.
2412940	2415963	Can you imagine even, let's just say they do have a high-speed connection.
2416003	2418065	Say we have a cable, okay?
2418245	2419867	Cable, it's pretty fast, right?
2419887	2420187	Mm-hmm.
2420908	2421589	Thanks for watching!
2440712	2443055	So it's not the time for digital only.
2460233	2470923	that's not Microsoft's fucking problem nor is it something that Microsoft really I think has to concern themselves with because let's face it GameStops are going to end up like Blockbuster it's a matter of time
2472435	2477640	But it just, the thing with, well, Blockbuster was a whole other problem.
2477680	2479662	It wasn't necessarily that people weren't going to rent.
2479682	2480643	It was just mismanaged.
2480663	2485167	But I think people are still looking for physical stuff.
2485187	2486949	I mean, that's why Redbox is doing so well.
2486969	2487990	They're still looking for discs.
2488090	2491213	It's just, you know, it's more convenient now to go to a kiosk versus a store.
2492594	2494976	But I still think people are looking for discs.
2495057	2497038	I mean, because they want to be able...
2497659	2497959	and DarkSakura.
2517798	2522960	And I got to admit, if the new Xbox was announced as digital only, I would have a slight hesitation.
2523380	2534923	At the end of the day, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but I would want to know what's Microsoft... Clearly, Microsoft systems are not infallible to hacking, so how is my stuff going to be protected?
2535163	2563566	and also on top of that I mean if they put out okay if Microsoft said we're gonna do only we're gonna do digital only and Sony said we're gonna do digital and disc people are gonna go with Sony they're gonna they're gonna buy a system that's gonna have physical media or medium but yeah I think though it's getting a lot more convenient to purchase digitally but it's not there's a lot of factors into just convenience and unfortunately the publishers are not quite understanding yet and
2564318	2565318	Here's something to think about.
2565438	2572180	I saw a great point to this on Twitter this week that I wouldn't have thought about right away, I must admit.
2572860	2580401	But I thought it was just a great argument for why this is definitely a possibility that the next Xbox may not have any type of disc format at all.
2580961	2589363	And even though everybody's rabble-rabbling about whether it would kill the used game market and da-da-da-da-da, if they got rid of the disc drive and da-da-da-da-da-da,
2590183	2617305	Xbox wouldn't be the first person to do it in fact another company's done it another company's cut out the disk drive completely and they have the most popular fucking computer in the world right now that everybody wants who is it apple apple where's the disk drive on the ipad where is it how didn't they even release a laptop that specifically doesn't have a disk drive in it you have to have some type of like airport hub in your home and people are eating it up
2618413	2621134	So if Xbox went this direction, they would not be the first.
2621234	2622294	Okay, hold on.
2622875	2626556	Now, you're comparing the average gamer with a hipster.
2626676	2628517	And I'm sorry, it's just not going to work.
2628897	2633659	You have to understand that people that buy Macs, okay?
2634019	2635679	And I'm not talking about iPods.
2636219	2637040	I'm talking about Macs.
2637080	2642102	Well, Loki, I was listening to PlayStation before it was mainstream, okay?
2642362	2642902	It's all about...
2643482	2646404	Well, I like the brushed metal finish on this system.
2646464	2648365	It's so sleek and wonderful.
2648705	2651146	Oh, I don't care if it has only one USB port.
2651246	2652647	I don't need those pesky USB ports.
2652687	2657730	Now, look, Loki, I only value the Atari 2600 with the wood paneling finishes on the side.
2657810	2662072	Don't bring me those little plastic refurbs because they're not the real deal.
2662312	2665334	I had a four-controller system before any of you did.
2667095	2670096	Listen, the only reason they took out the... I have two Atari 5200s.
2670116	2670316	Hello?
2671618	2680464	The only reason they took out the disk drive is because they're like, we want to make the thinnest fucking laptop ever, and they did it, and then people are like, oh my god, it's so thin, I'm gonna buy it!
2680684	2683886	Like, it's a fucking supermodel or something like that, and so they did.
2684266	2692571	And then they're like, hey, I can't fucking install any software on it, and Apple's like, well, that's okay, because no software is really supported by our system anyway, so, oh well, you don't need to download anything.
2692591	2695874	My Rob the Robot is 100% organic and gluten-free, okay?
2695914	2697435	I bought it at Whole Foods, thank you.
2697575	2700817	To be honest, the Fairchild Channel app is totally underappreciated.
2701437	2701977	And you know what?
2702017	2706159	Hey, if they're going to go the Apple route, why don't we charge $4,000 for the goddamn system?
2706199	2708660	Because as long as it's sexy enough, people will buy it.
2708760	2715203	Even if it's, you know, performance-wise, not quite inferior to the competition for the same price.
2715823	2716223	But hey.
2716423	2716724	Wow.
2717744	2719225	Duke Nukem Forever is $5.
2719425	2720025	And you know what?
2720545	2724507	You know, the Japanese Sonic soundtrack is clearly superior to the American one.
2726477	2732679	and if we're talking about like, you know, devices without Who shops at Whole Foods anymore?
2732719	2733700	I go to Farmer's Market.
2734440	2738281	You know, if we're talking about devices without I just drive to Mexico.
2738301	2740582	This drives and stuff like that and how well they worked out.
2741082	2742443	Where's the netbook nowadays?
2742823	2743383	Oh, that's right.
2743583	2744864	It's a format that failed.
2745104	2747985	Yeah, I understand you have one, but I'm talking about the format.
2748465	2750046	I'm saying that the format itself failed.
2750066	2750946	They're not making them anymore.
2751340	2752300	They're not making netbooks.
2752481	2753641	They're not making netbooks anymore.
2754161	2755042	People like disk drives.
2755902	2757283	They're not making netbooks anymore.
2759464	2761184	They still make some.
2761365	2762425	Yeah, they're the old ones.
2762805	2764086	They're clearing that inventory out.
2764146	2765787	There's no new netbooks coming out.
2768268	2768748	I like mine.
2770602	2773644	And there's also the Transformer, which Dan has, which is a tablet and a netbook.
2773904	2780487	And last I checked, most games out there are probably not a few megs versus the typical application size.
2781108	2782809	But whatever.
2783169	2792994	If you want a system without a disk drive and you want it in a brushed metal finish and you want it to be sleek and have a glowing apple symbol on the back of it, then fine.
2793014	2796836	You go ahead and purchase yourself a disk drive-less system and
2797776	2800017	Don't come crying to me when you can't install anything on it.
2800217	2800637	Alright, look.
2801037	2802997	One more thing I want to say on this story and then we can move on.
2803017	2809259	And that is the fact that Microsoft was asked to comment on this by the gaming blogs, as to be expected.
2809759	2813580	What's interesting about it is that they didn't 100% deny it.
2813880	2819482	You know, you think you're going to get the line that says, Microsoft does not comment on rumors or speculation and the line, right?
2819662	2821022	But here's the actual quote.
2822253	2833823	Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend its life cycle like introducing the world to controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships.
2834183	2839288	We are always thinking about what is next for our platform and how to continue to defy the life cycle convention.
2839848	2841870	Beyond that we do not comment on rumors or speculation.
2842731	2872195	so it's just PR spin and the do not comment it is a little weird to me in a way it says to me why are you talking about the new Xbox we're still extending the life of the Xbox 360 stop focusing on this new Xbox and our plans for it there's plenty to go on the 360 but maybe I don't know this is crazy crazy tinfoil hat time ready maybe there's a new 360 coming out that's like the Microsoft version of the PSP Go
2875157	2876698	You heard it here first on Orange Zone Radio.
2876718	2877718	Just throwing it out there.
2877839	2878839	Just throwing it out there.
2879179	2881561	So maybe it's, well, maybe, maybe.
2882461	2883422	Oh, God, here we go.
2883442	2884042	Hold on.
2884062	2894327	All I want to say, but maybe the one mistake that Microsoft won't make that Sony did that ruined the PSP Go is that maybe the system is priced right.
2895768	2897709	All right, now, Loki, what's your witty retort?
2898129	2900671	My witty retort is no one's going to buy it.
2903432	2904453	That's my witty retort.
2907073	2907954	They're not going to do that.
2908174	2913738	Only Sony makes those stupid mistakes where they're like, Hey, yeah, we just announced the Vita.
2913898	2915820	Oh, and we're going to put out a new PSP.
2915940	2916200	What?
2916820	2917161	Why?
2918401	2921204	Oh, and it's not going to have any sort of Wi-Fi built in.
2921764	2922004	What?
2923065	2923305	Huh?
2924966	2925286	All right.
2925587	2926307	Let's move on.
2926367	2928689	I'm sure there's plenty more comments we're going to hear on this.
2929630	2932492	By the way, I did want to say, though, one thing I forgot to tie this to is
2933427	2944430	The story that this ties into from five weeks ago, we may not have been hearing about that they got rid of the disc, but we did hear the rumor about they won't play used games.
2945230	2947330	I'm telling you, man.
2948071	2954972	I was over in China the other day on the production line for the new Xbox, and that leg was a good 20 feet long.
2954992	2956933	50 foot robot, I'm telling you.
2957053	2957813	Xbox GFR?
2959053	2960854	Speaking about things that are full of shit.
2963411	2964352	Mad Dog McCree.
2966093	2966874	Aw, poor guy.
2967295	2967955	I hate that game.
2969096	2970898	I'm gonna tell you a story about Mad Dog McCree.
2972159	2975141	One day... One day... Shut up.
2975242	2976443	When I was working at... Shut up.
2978825	2979185	Serious.
2979265	2981587	I was working at Cyber Station and we had a Mad Dog McCree.
2982528	2984810	Freaking hate that because I had to clean that bitch.
2986071	2988033	Did you have to wash Grandpa's balls?
2990529	2991430	Not as often as you do.
2991530	2993152	Did you have to polish his knobs?
2994733	2996034	That has nothing to do with the game.
2998136	3003582	So yeah, Mad Dog McCree Rob is having a spasm right now.
3004342	3006144	He's just laughing at the fact he said balls.
3006745	3007585	Thank God it's radio.
3009835	3010696	He's all red in the face.
3010756	3011396	It's kind of cute.
3013038	3017642	Anyway, a group called Engine Software is porting Mad Dog McCree to the 3DS.
3018242	3019723	It's going to be released on the eShop.
3020624	3025989	And scores of gamers across the world go, why?
3027150	3029692	Because honestly, that game was not very good.
3029812	3030552	It had a sequel.
3030632	3032034	How did that game get a sequel?
3032974	3036157	It had it at Solomon's that was by my college in Alabama.
3037458	3039580	Is Dragon's Lair on the 3DS out yet?
3039600	3040961	No, and why isn't it?
3041401	3048748	Because, you know, when I think of Laserdisc games immediately getting ported to everything in the fucking universe, I think of Dragon's Lair.
3048848	3051470	Immediately followed by Space Ace.
3051830	3060558	When I think of Laserdisc games, I think your average consumer that has the 3DS probably doesn't know what a fucking Laserdisc is, nor would be interested in Mad Dog McCree.
3061118	3064380	I have one more question about Mad Dog McCree on the 3DS.
3065240	3073444	DarkSakura, since you were very familiar with Mad Dog McCree and you touched that machine in all its places, was Mad Dog McCree in 3D?
3074205	3074725	No, it wasn't.
3074745	3075806	Then why is it on the 3DS?
3076566	3078127	Now I'm deaf in the other ear, thank you.
3080308	3084530	Okay, and they said that they're not even going to port it over with any kind of 3D added into that.
3084650	3089993	And the quote is, and I'm going to read it, there's really no 3D in the 3DS version because how are you going to do that?
3093707	3117454	you know it's funny how are you gonna do that is also probably the answer to um we're gonna need to sell this game how are you gonna do that when no one gives a shit about this game seriously that game is awful i guarantee you'll sell you know twice as many copies as you did the wii version which is probably zero
3121335	3123576	But Loki, two times zero is zero.
3126037	3127037	Thank you for the math lesson.
3127077	3128317	If you just put them together, it's infinity.
3128337	3130218	Well, you know how much it's going to cost?
3131878	3133459	$4.99 in US dollars.
3134099	3135480	You know how much you're overpaying by? $10.
3138482	3139862	They should pay you to play it.
3140563	3146526	I gotta say, on the Wii, they were charging like $19.99 for it.
3146566	3150548	So the fact that it's only $5 is still gouging you.
3151028	3151548	Just saying.
3151909	3152709	They should pay you.
3153269	3155590	It's actually $15 overpriced.
3156051	3160413	Because they should be paying you $10.01 to play it for them.
3160853	3162554	So they can say, oh, people got our game.
3164235	3164595	The end.
3166096	3166336	Listen.
3166894	3168335	Why didn't they just put tits in the game?
3168375	3169376	Then people would want to buy it.
3170036	3170237	True.
3171418	3183607	If you're interested in playing a game that has that kind of Laserdisc vibe to it, and even a western theme, I recommend that you pick up Gunstringer with the DLC that was out there for it.
3183787	3187670	What was that game, the time traveler game that was on Laserdisc?
3188651	3189331	That had the cowboy.
3189351	3190552	That horrible hologram one?
3190572	3191433	I know, that was awful.
3192806	3195068	I remember it in the arcades and it was a terrible game.
3195568	3196428	I liked Cliffjumper.
3196448	3197309	Neat technology though.
3197449	3200111	Because it was really Lupin and the Castle of Cagliostro.
3200131	3202212	Because you could literally touch that guy's balls.
3202232	3203453	You know Lupin is coming back.
3206114	3206774	Next story.
3209737	3211038	We're not going to talk about balls anymore?
3211859	3212500	If you want.
3212780	3213321	No, thank goodness.
3215302	3217204	So, let's talk about last week.
3217264	3222329	And last week we talked a little bit about Street Fighter X Tekken and all the...
3223650	3227072	The screwy things that they're doing with the download content with this game.
3227533	3232536	For example, all the download content for the game is paid unlock content, which is fantastic.
3232976	3244564	Also, those wonderful PlayStation exclusive characters, aside from, okay, you know, the guy from Infamous, because it just wouldn't make sense that he was on the 360 version, and also, I believe, those two Japanese cats.
3246205	3248867	Everything else was also on the disc.
3249508	3251630	Now, Capcom insinuates...
3265481	3266241	Okay, fine.
3267222	3268483	That's the excuse you want to use.
3268623	3273606	But at the same time, why are the beginning and ending movies there?
3273746	3274947	All the data is on a disc.
3275267	3277128	And I understand that you can use that for compatibility.
3277548	3281150	Although, Saints Row the Third, for example, they have compatibility patches.
3281831	3284452	And there's even some other games that have compatibility patches.
3284492	3289635	So it's a free download if you don't buy the DLC, but you can play against other people that have the DLC.
3291036	3291657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3311897	3312998	Even though all the content's on there.
3313258	3314078	How's the game selling?
3315499	3315899	I don't know.
3315919	3316759	It's just been out for a week.
3316899	3317520	Pretty good so far.
3317540	3320441	I thought maybe you'd know from your... I mean, it seems to be pretty good.
3321562	3323022	I just haven't heard the day one sales yet.
3323042	3325483	I don't hear people talking about it like I did Street Fighter 4.
3325523	3338970	Now, granted, I'm not to profess that I am this fighting game guru guy, but I don't hear as many people talking about it nearly as I am hearing talking about Mass Effect or that we're talking about Street Fighter 4 when it came out.
3339910	3341771	So it's just, I find that interesting.
3341851	3344672	I'm just wondering if there is a backlash occurring, yes or no.
3345112	3346533	Because I know I'm not going to buy it.
3346673	3351995	Because I, it's not even so much the content on the disc thing, although I think that's kind of skeezy.
3352575	3355756	It's just the whole, there's going to be an Ultimate Edition at some point.
3355796	3356957	Yes, I know they're denying it.
3357277	3357857	I don't believe them.
3358638	3358918	Sorry.
3360219	3372914	I don't believe them maybe I'm being a fool but I'm gonna go off track what I could go off Capcom PR statement or I could go off track record PR track record I'm going track record
3374332	3377173	Street Fighter 4, Super Street Fighter 4, Arcade Edition, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
3396499	3402141	And then on top of that, this is great, on top of that, the Xbox 360 version has an issue with it.
3402241	3404202	You can't take your local teams online.
3405242	3411144	It's stated in the manual that you can, and the PS3 version can, but the 360, meh, just doesn't work.
3411764	3413304	So, fantastic.
3415265	3426607	And their excuse is, well, the reason for that is the difference between, or the difference is because of the architecture differences between Xbox Live, gamer tags, and PlayStation Network IDs.
3427227	3432829	I'm not sure of the technical details, but basically it amounts to Sony made it so that you can mix and match online and offline.
3433149	3434349	Microsoft made it so you can't.
3435109	3439313	However, Mortal Kombat allows you to do that just fine, so that's full of shit.
3440994	3442776	Halo 3 allowed you to do that too.
3443396	3444237	How old is that game?
3445318	3448361	But you used to be able to do split screen and you could go on Xbox Live together.
3448991	3475415	yeah and also you can do that in Borderlands you can do that in Call of Duty I think you can do that in quite a few things but sure whatever yeah um okay so real quick I just want to talk about DLC because it seems like there's a whole lot of issues there's even one with you know I don't think it's one of the stories we have about Mass Effect 3 and the DLC and stuff like that
3477252	3484194	I think we need to set some ground rules on what I think should be acceptable for DLC and what shouldn't as far as timing and that kind of stuff.
3484835	3487736	So let's start off with pay to unlock content.
3488056	3490917	I never think that that should be acceptable at all.
3491017	3491797	It's on disc.
3492377	3493177	You're paying for it.
3493217	3498439	The content was done before the disc was certified and it's ready to go.
3498499	3499479	So it's all ready.
3499519	3504121	They planned it out so that you're going to have to pay for additional content for your game.
3504141	3504641	It wasn't like...
3504997	3505257	Day 1 DLC
3517023	3524409	I think is fine because the reason for that, for example, in the case of Mass Effect 3, games certified a month or so ago.
3524850	3528753	And during that time, they were working on DLC, which they got done.
3529013	3530315	It's not on disc at all.
3530475	3533057	It may use some assets from the game, but come on.
3533097	3538221	I mean, if you're using characters from the game, of course, you're going to reuse some of that, but a lot of it's brand new.
3539502	3540863	And they put it out.
3541163	3541703	Here's the thing.
3541963	3544724	I might take shit for this opinion, but F you, it's my opinion.
3545404	3555828	I don't understand the logic that the people that are hating on the Mass Effect DLC are using because the logic is you shouldn't charge me for something that was being... Or what is it?
3555888	3560250	That you shouldn't charge for something that you were already making for the game before the game came out, right?
3560290	3561530	That's kind of like the logic, right?
3562050	3563191	Well, if that was true...
3564477	3571784	Shouldn't you have never bought Mass Effect 1 or 2 because, you know, they were just leading up to Mass Effect 3?
3571824	3575167	I mean, kind of.
3575467	3581253	Or you should never have bought Saints Row 2 because you just get it for free with Saints Row 3 on PlayStation.
3581973	3585877	You should never have bought White Knight Chronicles because you get the whole game free with White Knight Chronicles 2.
3586557	3588219	White Knight Chronicles was there for a shit game.
3588857	3596306	Yeah, I mean, their logic is, okay, well, you should delay it until you have all the download content out for the game and you just put it on disk.
3597367	3598688	Well, they didn't do that.
3598729	3607559	They actually just got it to the point where the first batch of DLC just happened to be done a month or so after they certified a disk, and boom, it's day one download content.
3607859	3612283	A lot of it has to do with value.
3612763	3616347	Is what you're paying for really worth what you're paying for it?
3616967	3628457	And even though I'm not to that point in the series yet and I haven't formed my final opinion on Mass Effect, I'm pretty sure that for fans of Mass Effect, the on-disc experience presented with Mass Effect 3 is worth the price of admission.
3629915	3632516	Going to Street Fighter X Tekken, you know what?
3632576	3640379	For a lot of hardcore fighting game fans and for those individuals, the price of the stuff that's on the disc and even the unlocked stuff is probably still worth it to them.
3640639	3641599	And I'm not going to knock that.
3642880	3651443	But for me, everything in that Street Fighter X Tekken has been devalued based on Capcom's history of how they treat fighting games.
3652572	3654174	is what is on that disc worth $60?
3655395	3659800	Not to me when I know in nine months it'll be down to $40 with everything online included.
3661209	3663510	That's the difference to me from where I'm sitting.
3663530	3672436	Yeah, and if you think that that game, by the time that all the DLC is released, is still going to be $60, you are sorely mistaken.
3672756	3678079	That game is going to devalue pretty quick, especially if it doesn't sell very well.
3678119	3681461	I mean, look at the last Dead Rising 2 game that came out.
3681541	3685824	I mean, off the record, didn't do that well, and it's already marked down.
3687975	3713274	I think though like there's some companies that are just taking it too far like even with I don't even know if I wouldn't blame Volition because I don't think it's the developer's fault I think it's a publisher's fault but let's look at Saints Row the third aside from the DLC that they actually have made separately and beyond you know that you actually download which is fucking terrible so far and it's really sad everything else has been paid on locked content
3714114	3714955	everything else.
3715155	3720538	All the little costumes, all the little special weapons, those are all paid unlocked content.
3720558	3722119	It's all stuff that was on there.
3722219	3726422	Any of your pre-order bonuses, that's all paid unlocked content.
3726642	3732486	Unless, of course, it's something that, okay, you get the first thing, a DLC that comes out a month after the game comes out.
3732526	3735307	Then that's not paid unlocked content.
3735347	3740110	But for the most part, those special weapons or skins or whatever, that's all on the disc.
3740591	3740971	And you're
3741591	3746153	You know, paying money, you know, to have that right, I guess.
3746633	3750735	But it's kind of sad, though, that they're like, you know, the publishers are getting mad.
3751075	3753836	Not even the publishers, the developers, or maybe a little bit both.
3754116	3759499	Developers and publishers are getting mad that people are complaining about, oh, well, you know what, too bad.
3759519	3760979	This is how we wanted to do it.
3761019	3764241	Well, then, that's not really, I mean...
3766094	3767975	Humor the consumer a little bit.
3768015	3775457	If you're planning on releasing these characters, say these 12 characters or whatever, just don't put them on the disc.
3775697	3777678	Just have it so you download them later on.
3778778	3780479	You would be doing the same thing.
3781179	3783620	I don't know as far as infrastructure costs go.
3783700	3791703	If actually having more than just a key downloaded from Xbox Live or something costs more to the publisher or the developer than it does just the key.
3792603	3793484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3809921	3827391	and then that way people wouldn't bitch about it and they'd be like oh my god this is a great value because look at all these extra characters Capcom supporting the game long after it's been out this is fantastic versus I'm getting fucking ripped off because all this stuff was on the disc already notice same thing you're providing the same amount of content but it's perception
3827674	3829315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3851607	3880329	so in other words the DLC allows you to not get something you know is going to be shitty exactly I didn't give a shit about Jill or Shuma Garath as we call him slash her Shuma-chan at home because all the characters I wanted to play were in the game when Ultimate came out I was like oh cool we get to hear you we have a new game I know this might be I already know what the answer to this question is but I'm going to ask it anyway what would you think if you went online and then suddenly you're fighting against someone else who's playing as the Mega Man you don't want to see
3882219	3882619	DC.
3884080	3885201	I'd seriously quit the match.
3887163	3892627	Keep in mind, I'm the same person that if there is one single troll in my dungeon run, I will leave party.
3893908	3898091	Because my time is important and I don't have to put up with shit I don't like.
3900916	3905159	If I want a game, I'm going to buy the game regardless of what's already on the disc.
3905339	3906180	I don't really care.
3906540	3907781	Alright, I'm going to try to wrap this up.
3907821	3912404	Bobby is sending a link to the official DLC response for Mass Effect 3.
3913465	3929137	In a nutshell, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's kind of what we already know is BioWare's approach to this is that they finished Mass Effect 3 before they did the DLC, but in order to do DLC, you have to kind of put, and this is the part that's kind of more information,
3929637	3937403	You have to put the seeds of the DLC in the game or you can't have the DLC interact with the game that's already pressed on the disc.
3938003	3938703	If that makes sense.
3940224	3942546	You have to have the code that's going to access the info.
3942606	3947530	And I don't think there's any problem with having an outline of we know we want to do this, this, and this later on.
3947570	3950812	Saints Row clearly did the same thing as Mediocre's content did.
3951672	3953834	They knew what packs they were going to do.
3954074	3958137	Didn't they advertise it from day one that Gangsters in Space was going to be an add-on eventually?
3958457	3963541	Neato comment from E3VL or Evil I suppose in our chat room Whatever happened to unlocking characters the traditional way?
3982358	3983560	It's not... You can still do that in some games.
3983820	3984321	Some games.
3984501	3985422	It's not cost-effective.
3985442	3986543	Probably not a Capcom game.
3987545	3992191	That is a... But that's a sad... I mean, it's a good question, but it's a sad question.
3992711	3993352	What did ever happen to that?
3993372	3996356	Because the modern gamer, seriously, doesn't really want to work for anything.
3997893	4000395	Hence why they'll put up the 99 cent unlock thing.
4000615	4003877	Exactly, because it's instant gratification.
4003997	4007619	I'll tell you exactly why that's not unlocked in the traditional ways anymore.
4007879	4013443	Because back in the day when a lot of that stuff was unlocked traditionally is through playing through the story mode.
4013803	4028856	Nowadays, most gamers are split between single player and multiplayer, and a lot of people are purchasing this game just to play multiplayer, and they won't even touch the single player, and so why make someone go through the single player when they're not going to play it?
4029704	4032146	Game In the same font as Game Boy
4055754	4057936	Ooh, a type nerd would pick up on that.
4057976	4058797	I didn't pick up on that.
4059117	4061259	Except their kerning is really tragic.
4062520	4068866	Well, it's going to say closed pretty soon on the top of it if things keep going the way they're going because apparently game is in trouble.
4068906	4071408	Now, game, we've already heard of some trouble going on there.
4071988	4073570	They didn't sell Mass Effect 3.
4073850	4074511	It wasn't there.
4074851	4077293	Street Fighter X Tekken, you can't get it at game.
4077813	4082137	That is not good when the retailer will not sell the games people are looking for.
4082197	4082277	It's...
4083338	4084899	I know exactly what's going on here.
4085759	4088120	Because this exact same thing happened with Blockbuster.
4088881	4101587	What happened was, when they get into these financial problems where they're facing bankruptcy, or I don't know if they've even filed bankruptcy yet or whatever, these publishers are concerned about getting paid for their product.
4101767	4127644	and so they don't extend them credit anymore and so because of that they're unable to purchase games where in the case of Blockbuster Blockbuster had to purchase games through a distributor and the distributor basically covered they floated them the credit I guess some way and so basically they assume all the risk for them and unfortunately it sounds like there's no UK distributor although I
4128444	4134148	I can't imagine that there's not UK distributors, or maybe at least someone that's not willing to float that kind of credit risk.
4134668	4135689	But that's what's going on here.
4135729	4140371	That's why you're seeing certain publishers that are not caring, certain games and stuff.
4140391	4142433	And I'm assuming it's going to be a lot of publishers.
4142473	4146715	If we're talking EA, Ubisoft, I can't remember the other one.
4146875	4148136	Capcom.
4149097	4152139	I'm not sure who the publishers are because I know there's different publishers in the UK.
4154321	4161967	But I mean, you're going to see it's going to be specific companies that are going to stop giving them credit, and that's why they're not carrying the games.
4161987	4166011	Well, just to further illustrate how serious this issue is, apparently game is behind on the rent.
4166291	4169074	They have to pay some landlords in about two weeks, and if they don't...
4169634	4173877	Thousands of jobs could be at risk, and that is obviously not going to be good news.
4174337	4189908	Now, there is a company that's kind of circling around like a hawk that might be picking these guys up, and that would be GameStop, or as we call it here on Sunday nights at all games, Evil G. GameStop particularly is interested in the Spanish arm of the business, apparently.
4190208	4195932	And I think this has to do with the fact that GameStop did try to do UK before, but they closed some stores.
4195992	4198713	But that doesn't necessarily mean they won't buy all of game.
4199834	4201395	Spanish is of particular interest.
4201775	4203076	Other countries, maybe.
4203236	4205098	They're just waiting for it to devalue enough.
4205178	4205438	Sure.
4205938	4207379	And they'll swoop right in.
4208060	4212743	I guarantee that they'll probably buy it because it just makes sense.
4213963	4216825	They're not going to come out of this.
4217066	4220108	Yeah, this is kind of probably past that point.
4220168	4222029	It's going to have to be someone buying them.
4222569	4225151	and Picaruno is in our chat room and I know he's from over there.
4225271	4228413	The nice thing is with the whole spring forward here, we did a little early.
4228994	4232376	I think it's an hour early for the folks overseas to tune into OLR Live now.
4233056	4235038	Picaruno says, I have 15 pounds.
4235118	4236459	I can't see.
4236539	4237119	That's pounds.
4237259	4237700	Is it pounds?
4237740	4241002	Okay, because I can't see how it translates over here because it comes up as special text.
4241322	4242843	I have 15 pounds of vouchers with them.
4243183	4243984	Need to spend it soon.
4245816	4249819	Yes, I would recommend if you have any sort of gift cards to the game, get those.
4250399	4251380	Just buy something.
4251400	4252121	Yep, buy something.
4252981	4255363	Trade them in for cash if you can do that over there.
4255783	4258245	I know you can't in California, but if it's a certain amount.
4259246	4260206	Yeah, buy something soon.
4260406	4261507	And it'll have to be an older game.
4262648	4263288	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4281761	4296057	Rob Cares So it's The Vita version is going to have HD remasters Of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 With all of the trophies And crap that the PS3 version does They didn't say anything about Peace Walker though
4296717	4304242	There is something that says they have a rebalanced user interface that's going to go a little bit more with this transferring system that's being developed.
4305583	4309565	What the transferring is, is basically some type of cloud storage.
4309685	4323054	It's called Title User Storage, TUS, where your save game is going to transfer via whatever that cloud is, and you can access it on both PS3 and on Vita without using Wi-Fi.
4325256	4330884	So that's... How tiny the gamer memory is, because I completely forgot about transferring.
4331505	4332667	Thank you for reminding me.
4333188	4335831	Well, the Japanese release date is June 28th.
4335992	4337714	It's summer over here, too.
4338776	4338956	Hmm.
4340620	4340960	All right.
4341581	4344263	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner.
4344583	4345064	One other thing.
4345124	4345284	Sure.
4345804	4349267	You've got different things available with the touch panel.
4349908	4352790	You have zooming like with your binoculars on event scenes.
4352950	4356833	You can close up in the cinematics.
4356974	4358895	So kind of working in those little features of the Vita.
4359175	4359436	Yeah.
4359496	4360536	You know, make the Vita special.
4360576	4361177	That's kind of neat.
4361397	4362278	So I thought I'd add that.
4362698	4362918	All right.
4362958	4363539	Release dates.
4363839	4365941	Loki starting off here locally in the U.S.
4366772	4368975	Yakuza Dead Souls PlayStation 3
4388331	4393033	GG, I don't know, something based off a toy.
4393153	4396134	I guess they have a toy that's hermit crabs.
4396154	4398935	I don't know, crappy DS game.
4399175	4401316	Silverlicious, based off a book series.
4401416	4403216	That's also on the DS as well.
4404077	4405997	The 4-in-1 action pack from South Peak.
4406037	4408278	It's a bunch of really terrible PlayStation Network games.
4410379	4412860	So that sounds like fantastic fun there.
4413720	4442644	Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Birds of Steel on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well Tales of Graces F on Playstation 3 Ridge Racer on the Vita kinda wanna play that but it's still not fucking worth it FIFA Street on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 Reality Fighters on the Vita
4444441	4445987	and let's see what else here.
4447814	4448296	And that would be it.
4449998	4452839	All right, traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases over there.
4453579	4457301	In Japan on the 360, Mass Effect 3 gets released on March the 15th.
4457961	4458961	It's Japanese release.
4459081	4463443	I don't know if that means all the dialogue has been redubbed with Japanese voice actors.
4463943	4464883	I would assume so.
4465844	4467084	But, you know, there you go.
4467264	4469465	SSX also coming out in Japan this week on the 360.
4470625	4473266	Going over to the PlayStation 3, it's pretty much the same story.
4473326	4474467	Mass Effect is there as well.
4475127	4501507	and SSX but there are some other games coming out as well Resident Evil 5 AE or Biohazard 5 AE and Revival Selection HD Remaster Twin Pack so there's like a whole little like double games for a little less money Sengoku Basara 3 Utage Double Pack comes out as well as Shin Sengoku Musou Online Ryujin Ranbu comes out this week and that is obviously it's an online game is that Dynasty Warriors?
4502668	4503889	Slaughter Mania 5 Black Lagoon
4529102	4532846	But the cool thing is, it's a slot machine and then a chick with a big gun.
4534448	4536971	She's like, you're going to give me that money or I'll put a bullet in you.
4538512	4539473	And then it's a slot machine.
4539493	4542096	There's little like anime cut scenes with guns and cigarettes.
4542477	4543378	I like the twin B one.
4543478	4544279	All sorts of vices.
4545060	4546742	Also FIFA soccer on the Vita.
4549205	4550186	But you can't shoot the players.
4550226	4551927	There's no guns to be found in FIFA soccer.
4552128	4553269	You can throw a ball at their heads.
4553349	4553749	You can.
4555171	4556752	Going to the 3DS real quick.
4557353	4559235	Only one game coming out from D3 this week.
4559695	4563299	Onanoko to Mishitsuni Ittara comes out this week.
4563980	4569305	And I don't know what it is, but it's another game featuring girls in school uniforms.
4569465	4570046	Dating sim.
4570126	4570787	Oh, man.
4572609	4577278	I feel like the Dateline guys are going to show up at my house just for bringing that picture up on my computer.
4577438	4579482	I told you from the beginning it was a dating sim.
4579542	4580364	Have a seat over there.
4580464	4582428	Oh, no, no, Ko is like little girl.
4585249	4587651	Don't import the game or what's-his-name will show up at your house.
4587671	4588711	Chris Hansen, is that his name?
4589332	4589932	Yeah.
4590033	4590613	Don't buy that game.
4590633	4591714	Can we go to another country now?
4591754	4592254	Yes, please.
4592374	4593255	Okay, how about the UK?
4594576	4597078	On March 12th, all zombies must die!
4598299	4600301	On the 13th, shoot many robots.
4600361	4601382	That's a clever name.
4601602	4602142	And warp.
4603063	4607407	On March 14th, Journey for the PS3, which Rob discussed at the top of the show.
4608127	4610088	and ShootManyRobots on the Xbox 360.
4610828	4632233	On the 16th, Bit.Trip Complete on Wii and Bit.Trip Saga on 3DS, FIFA Street, Inazuma 11.2 Firestorm slash Blizzard on DS, Rayman Origins on 3DS, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 and Yakuza Dead Souls and I'll go ahead and say the 17th because it's the Sunday and we'll be here is Tekken 3D Prime.
4632253	4636794	3D fighting movies.
4636814	4637514	It's actually Saturday.
4638871	4640051	So yeah, stuff.
4640911	4641251	Alright.
4642152	4644772	A couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4645652	4649133	Oh, Loki, whatever possible surprise news story could you be talking about next?
4650093	4652054	Let's talk about the iPad.
4652514	4658315	Yes, I know, shocker, there was a new iPad announced this week and it's called the new iPad.
4658355	4659415	In case you hadn't heard.
4659435	4660375	In case you hadn't heard.
4660395	4661236	I'm full of lust.
4661736	4666957	It was pretty much all the rumored stuff except for the really weird stuff that they started rumoring this week.
4667217	4667297	Um,
4668257	4676406	It's got the Retina display, it's got the upgraded camera that was in the iPhone 4S, quad-core A5X processor, and also a...
4684369	4684729	What else?
4685750	4686550	4G connectivity.
4688111	4692074	Now everybody's phone is starting to show 4G connectivity even though they're not 4G phones.
4692474	4693255	If you're on AT&T.
4693515	4700080	It's because of the multiple different types of 4G networks that existed and they're all being solidified into the one that I think Verizon uses.
4701883	4731305	so those are out and of course it's going to range anywhere in price for the wifi version from $4.99 to $6.99 depending on how much storage you want or for the 4G $6.29 through $8.29 and they will go on sale this week March 16th fantastic of course with this they got to show that hey we can do games so they showed off a new Infinity Blade game
4731725	4733147	Infinity Blade Dungeons.
4733227	4737510	It's a prequel to Infinity Blade and looked kind of like God of War.
4738251	4746078	And then also a flight sim game called Sky Gamblers that kind of looked like Ace Combat, and that was from Namco.
4748660	4749521	Unfortunately, no buttons.
4749781	4751723	Still no buttons, other than the home button.
4752504	4757007	Unless you buy an iCade, which isn't an official Apple product, so they don't talk about it.
4757708	4757908	So...
4758962	4777853	Which is interesting because they made a claim, there was a claim during the press conference where they attacked essentially the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and said, this thing does more pixels at once than a, millions, millions more pixels at once than a Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 because the resolution is greater than 1080p.
4778054	4781576	1080 means 1080 by, and one of these suckers is what, 2000 something?
4782830	4784151	Yeah, it was like 29-something.
4784171	4788032	But once again, graphics aren't everything.
4788272	4793754	You can have a really beautiful game that controls like shit, and it will be terrible.
4794034	4795935	It's also how the developers utilize it.
4795955	4806379	I mean, because you have to up-res everything, or you have to make your games actually utilize that stuff in order for it to work out, plus the hardware and everything.
4806835	4807555	limitations there.
4808176	4816921	I mean, don't get me wrong, those games are probably going to look really nice, but do I really want a game that controls via tilt or touchscreen?
4816941	4825545	I mean, some of the touchscreen stuff, I mean, Infinity Blade was alright with touchscreen, but it's just... I don't know.
4825945	4826526	Fine.
4826626	4836051	Brag about your resolution of your screen and stuff like that, but at the same time, also, you gotta remember you do have some faults.
4836462	4840484	There are people that are completely swayed by SHINee, so... Well, I'm not going to lie.
4840524	4841365	I still kind of want one.
4841645	4845467	I just... I don't feel like I need one right away at this point.
4845747	4848709	But, I mean, not even from a game standpoint.
4848749	4853011	I'm just like, I want to watch movies in bed on that thing because there's not going to be a better screen than that.
4853091	4855252	But I have a Vita, you know.
4855653	4856473	Don't cry me a river.
4856553	4858134	I'm going to be okay not having one of those day one.
4858522	4862164	And see, I was actually already planning on getting one because I have a legitimate need of it for school.
4862184	4863725	There's some really good note-taking apps.
4864585	4867846	Well, they have the whole iUniversity book thing now, too, that's pretty cool.
4868027	4878492	Yeah, well, there's also an app that will let you type in your notes and it timestamps your notes in conjunction with where you started it in the lecture while it records the lecture.
4878992	4881193	And for me, with my hand, that's perfect.
4881653	4909314	because then I can record my lecture and actually take notes and say this slide was used at this point or this and that and the other was used at that point which I'm using my notebook already yes I'm using my notebook which is just fine but for my hand problems you know typing on an iPad will be easier so I'm actually now that the new ones are you know there I'm going to get one that's the plan anyway I have a legitimate need for it I'm buying it for school
4911658	4915722	Loki, I probably don't even have to ask you how you feel about the new iPad.
4916143	4921468	And by the way, just to go back to our chat room at chat.orange.com, Amiga777 says, Really?
4921568	4923050	That's actually going to be the real name?
4923310	4925172	I thought that the article I read was going to be a joke.
4925953	4928155	It's not that the name is the new iPad.
4928195	4928896	That's not the name.
4929116	4930718	The name is iPad.
4931769	4932249	iPad 3 or iPad HD
4955436	4956477	I would say iPad HD.
4956577	4960379	I still don't know why they gotta be all stubborn about it.
4960399	4962100	Well, we're not gonna put a number on it.
4962300	4964942	You make it sound like we release these things every few years or something.
4964982	4965723	I mean, what the hell?
4966043	4968644	Because it's branding and marketing.
4968805	4969425	End of story.
4971252	4974114	They do it that way because they have to do it that way.
4974715	4981300	Because they want people, when you think of iPad, they want you to think of the newest, best version of it that they have.
4982201	4982661	I get it.
4983802	4986344	But I feel bad for those that can't tell the difference.
4987044	4993670	Because there will be people out there that buy iPad off Craigslist and get one of those first generation iPads.
4994570	4995271	Let the buyer beware.
4995291	4996492	Yeah, I know, I know.
4996532	4999294	But I'm just saying, I feel a little bad for those people.
5000275	5000495	I don't.
5001883	5004844	If they didn't take the time to contact the seller and verify it, that's their fault.
5008385	5010786	Alright, one more story before the classic game of the week.
5011406	5013327	And that is... Rock Band!
5013667	5013867	Yep.
5014788	5015448	Still relevant.
5016508	5017988	Nope, I'm not talking about Rock Band 4.
5018449	5019129	It's just that.
5019209	5021969	And, you know, I gotta admit, this is a really nice thing to hear.
5022650	5026931	Harmonix has basically commented that Rock Band releases aren't stopping.
5027431	5035153	One of the few things to come out of Game Developers Conference 2012, Harmonix says, quote, We've been really pleased with the continued performance of Rock Band downloadable content.
5035533	5044015	We've delivered over four years of weekly DLC and over 3,500 songs to the music platform, and we have no plans to stop weekly releases anytime soon.
5044835	5051498	If there's a song you still want, Rock Band folks encourage you to go look at the Facebook app that they have and vote for artists on the wish list.
5051678	5057782	This kind of makes me wonder if Guitar Hero is ever going to come back because how can you compete with that kind of a library?
5059002	5059783	It's going to be difficult.
5060183	5064365	Harmonix, by the way, also said they have no intentions of doing Rock Band 4 this year.
5064425	5066366	They have some other projects going on right now.
5066946	5073108	So maybe Rock Band is on the back burner until the next, you know, Xbox or PlayStations are being talked about.
5073728	5075468	And maybe some of those features being used.
5075808	5077129	I'm strangely okay with this.
5077709	5083691	You know, as much as I love Rock Band and would love to see a Rock Band 4, I kind of get where, well, maybe there's not a whole lot else you can do with it.
5083791	5089672	So props to them for continuing to support the game with true DLC.
5090652	5091153	You know what I mean?
5091253	5096354	True, reasonably priced, varied, not on the disc DLC.
5096454	5096994	DLC.
5097875	5098055	Yeah.
5099276	5100597	Now that is continuing to support it.
5100617	5104700	And when they say that they're going to support it weekly, they support it weekly.
5106362	5108884	And they continue to support it, unlike some companies.
5109164	5109764	Konami.
5111889	5112569	Thanks for watching!
5133823	5134504	has a song.
5134624	5136785	It's crazy the obscurity of that stuff.
5137065	5138807	That might have been the first DLC bundle.
5138847	5139607	I can't remember.
5139627	5141168	No, I think that was the one you talked about a lot.
5141329	5141669	Was it?
5141789	5143030	Yeah, let's take a look.
5143070	5144091	Yeah, you can look it up.
5145432	5148974	I played it when it first came out and I already forgot, sorry.
5149915	5156840	But now Rhythm Party, if you have all the DLC, is up to like, I don't know, 20, no, about 20 songs maybe?
5158385	5158585	Quake!
5158605	5158745	Quake!
5186272	5186572	Yay!
5186592	5193334	Seriously, if Alan can do Half-Life while I'm gone, then I can do Quake.
5194215	5200816	Quake is... If you don't know what Quake is, then you need to get out from under the rock that you've been under for the last 20 years.
5202797	5205098	Quake is a first-person shooter game that came out by...
5206218	5208160	The same people that gave us Doom.
5208500	5209441	Surprise, surprise.
5211043	5213145	And it spawned a whole series of games.
5213205	5215027	It actually came out on Steam on August 3rd, 2007.
5217108	5237370	basically you have to go navigate through the level and you face enemies and you have to open doors and do different things but when you start a level you have three different pathways it's an easy medium and hard skill level and to get to like the nightmare level you have to go into a secret passageway and stuff
5238451	5247153	So basically, you've got different episodes of about eight levels each, and there's even a low-gravity episode, too.
5248413	5254215	But you collect all these different items, and you carry them on to the next level, and then the next level gets, you know, more challenging.
5254755	5260516	When you die, you have to restart at the beginning of that level, but you can save your game as many times as you want.
5260556	5263077	You also do have multiplayer, like a deathmatch.
5263237	5265597	You've got, I think there was Capture the Flag?
5266118	5266438	Yeah.
5266758	5267358	But, I mean...
5268298	5268999	Thank you for watching!
5297360	5300203	I'm going to switch from the ambient noises to the actual music here.
5300223	5310091	It's pretty much what happened with this game after that.
5310371	5315836	It was a VGA full color game.
5315856	5317357	There's an ASCII version of it, did you know that?
5318183	5319524	I actually did know that.
5319704	5321164	Here's an ASCII version of Quake.
5322165	5324726	It's where the Quake engine went with this.
5324886	5329167	That game engine has been in so many other games.
5329227	5336090	Basically it uses, it was polygon models instead of the sprites, you know, the way that Doom did it.
5336890	5341392	You have full 3D level design, different light maps that are pre-rendered.
5342012	5351235	You've got all kinds of abilities to modify it because there is a huge Quake modding community out there.
5351395	5356937	I remember bringing up on the show playing Gacha Quake, which was a Gachamon patch for Quake.
5357297	5359357	That's why we have talked about this on the show before.
5359377	5361718	I knew it came out before, but it's not as pleasant as you believe.
5361878	5363739	Did you know it was developed by John Carmack?
5364319	5364839	I did know that.
5365299	5366479	Yep.
5366600	5370301	Also, Michael Abrash and John Cash, as opposed to Johnny Cash, who was dead.
5371101	5371781	Who wasn't at the time.
5372582	5372782	What?
5375183	5375943	And not his son either.
5376023	5378684	And I was just thinking about, you know, the people that did the soundtrack.
5378764	5381505	Johnny Cash was involved with the cover, but never mind.
5381525	5381605	Yeah.
5383727	5384228	Anyway.
5384948	5390291	But this was pretty much the king of first-person shooter games for the longest time.
5390311	5396275	I was going to say, even I played the shit out of this game in college.
5396575	5397616	We used to call.
5397656	5401679	This was back when we used modems to dial into everything.
5401699	5406202	But my friends at Sonoma State had one of those state-of-the-art T1 lines or whatever.
5406262	5408383	So we'd all call into their server at Sonoma State.
5408763	5411045	We'd play the fuck out of this game until like 2 in the morning.
5411185	5411325	Yeah.
5411685	5412265	So much fun.
5413086	5413606	Multiplayers.
5414166	5428492	I mean, well, basically, before there was even a demo, id Software put out Q-Test, which is February 24th, 1996, that was a tech demo that had three multiplayer maps.
5429172	5435715	And basically, it just lit a fire, because when Quake came out, there were servers everywhere popping up.
5437277	5438938	Just basically like you were saying.
5440259	5447262	And there were people reskinning the textures, reskinning the whole levels, making new maps, you name it.
5447462	5448963	That's what really came out.
5449163	5457167	It's basically scripted in Quake C, was I believe the coding for it.
5458047	5461569	And the first Quake mod that came out was Team Fortress.
5462869	5490192	which was capture the flag but it had that class system basically and we know where Team Fortress has gone since then so there was also three wave capture the flag there was you know I've actually seen where someone used they did it first in Quake and then went and did it in Half-Life where they redid the whole ending of of Cube 2
5492927	5493549	Oh yeah, yeah.
5495613	5498961	But there were like different, you know, they created different bots for it.
5499001	5501226	There was Rocket Arena where...
5503246	5504007	Quaked Unquick Quaked Unquicker
5533448	5535459	So yeah, there's all kinds of different
5537966	5540087	It's really blown up since then.
5540147	5545150	Going to this image on here that's basically the family tree of Quake games.
5546431	5554094	We have on here, coming from Quake, we have QuakeWorld that spawned Twilight, more QuakeWorld, ZQuake, FTE.
5555595	5561418	Doom 3 eventually came from Quake 3, which was built on Quake 2, built from the first Quake.
5562399	5564480	So we've got all of these different ones.
5565000	5566781	Medal of Honor, Allied Assault.
5568242	5592417	we have STV Elite Forces 2 on the list we have Paintball Jedi Academy there's all kinds of games on here that run off of variants of the original Quake engine so basically your first person shooters are what they are today because of Quake just saying and also you can play it on the Amiga
5595151	5596652	God, that's how old this game was.
5596752	5598012	It actually runs on an Amiga.
5598813	5600193	There's a port for it on the Amiga.
5600634	5601154	That's awesome.
5601194	5602494	The ports I really need to get into.
5602514	5607637	Well, they made the source code public some time ago, right?
5607797	5607977	Yes.
5609178	5615360	The Commodore Amiga port was done in 1998 by Clickboom, but it's only available in 68K.
5616281	5619763	There was a Linux version that was made by an id Software employee.
5619783	5621303	Of course there was a Linux version.
5621643	5622824	For fun, in his spare time.
5624184	5629146	and then in 1999 there's a retail version for Linux that was put out by Macmillan Digital.
5630107	5633248	They also had two add-ons which was the offering for Linux.
5634469	5637690	So there's a Mac version now that was done by MacSoft.
5639651	5642252	It came out on Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64,
5644261	5645322	There are all kinds of versions.
5645342	5646962	There's Nintendo DS versions of Quake.
5646982	5648303	There's Quake DS and SeaQuake.
5649764	5652065	So you name it, you can play Quake on it probably.
5652085	5653685	You can probably play Quake on a toaster.
5654966	5655446	So that's it.
5656487	5658108	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5658128	5660369	A true, true classic indeed.
5660549	5660969	Quake.
5662816	5666638	I remember playing Quake 3 on the Dreamcast with our Ethernet adapter.
5666758	5668159	Quake 3 was amazing.
5668259	5668719	And you know what?
5668759	5672561	If you want to just play Quake-inspired games, go play Quake Live.
5672601	5674502	Because that's basically Quake 3.
5675243	5677564	And even though there's lots of differences between Quake 1 and Quake 3, eh.
5678224	5680045	It's still a good time.
5680125	5680626	Asky Quake.
5681726	5682767	Asky Quake is just funny.
5683087	5684388	Yeah, it's funny for like two seconds.
5684468	5684708	Alright.
5685228	5686549	And then you're like, this is annoying.
5686669	5687029	Escape.
5687209	5688230	This makes my eyes hurt.
5688530	5688570	Ow.
5688590	5688630	Ow.
5689898	5692499	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5692539	5693559	We have plenty more to come.
5693619	5694219	Don't go anywhere.
5694259	5695180	Don't stop your iPods.
5695220	5698041	Don't turn off your live stream of all games because we've got plenty more to come.
5698201	5705943	Rapid Fire News, Fugle Question, Mailbag, FUs, your calls, more news when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5713193	5716255	Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5737270	5737991	Cammy greater than Chun-Li
5759266	5760567	Okay, I have to tell you where that came from.
5760967	5761168	What?
5761588	5762529	Dan's little brother.
5763950	5764870	Is it either Dan's?
5764930	5772777	No, it was a friend of ours' son was saying, whenever Cammy does her wind pose and turns around, she goes, look at my butt.
5773637	5774678	That's what he would say.
5775058	5775339	Loki?
5776698	5789865	I was going to make the argument that it's because she's not American, though, so I can't make that argument, but I thought that they're drawing some sort of comparison to soundtracks of a certain other game, and one being superior to the other.
5790326	5794028	You know, the non-Japanese being superior.
5794048	5795208	Stop it right now.
5795428	5796029	Stop it.
5796769	5797109	All right.
5798410	5801612	But to be fair, the UK and Japanese have the same soundtrack, so ha!
5803323	5805685	Akuma JP says, I don't use female characters.
5806045	5806625	In any game?
5807586	5818574	I think that's just Street Fighter he's talking about, but I notice in fighting games that the female characters tend to be like the ones that are quick and agile, you know, I know that's kind of stereotype, but that's how I use almost all female characters.
5818854	5819274	Me too.
5819574	5821876	Except in King of Fighters where they all look androgynous.
5822481	5825223	I used to be a pretty good Chun-Li player back in the day.
5825303	5829185	I want a very non-agile, large female character.
5829225	5830886	They probably do exist.
5832047	5832887	I'm trying to think.
5832907	5834788	You'd probably have to go to the Neo Geo series.
5834968	5840752	The only character that I can think of in the Street Fighter series that's female and sizable would be Elena and her legs.
5844494	5845255	There's also...
5848368	5849209	No, I can't think of one.
5850649	5855552	But I know that there's male characters that are, you know... Oh, yeah.
5855712	5857293	Vega, if you want to do Street Fighter.
5857313	5859414	Well, I'm thinking of the sizable male characters.
5859454	5860995	Oh, well, yeah.
5861135	5861895	Rufus.
5861915	5862596	Well, that's what I'm saying.
5862636	5864877	We need a large, sassy black woman.
5864937	5865257	You do?
5866478	5867438	I was trying to think of one.
5867458	5871481	Well, you can create to your heart's content in Soul Calibur.
5872501	5888551	which I was thinking Ivy doesn't exactly of course nothing in Soul Calibur is really agile I mean it's Soul Calibur is kind of a different style of fighting I guess that's not true some would say like Voldo is like an agile type of character but Voldo is also into bondage and shows off his package regularly not that there's anything wrong with that
5889231	5890232	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
5890272	5891973	We've got to get back into some gaming news.
5892874	5896316	We still have a lot of room to go here before we get to your calls later on in the show.
5896376	5897497	So, Loki, how about some news?
5897918	5900079	All right, let's talk about the new SimCity.
5900119	5903562	They showed it off at GDC, and it looks pretty.
5904082	5908706	It's not scheduled to come out until 2013, and it will be on PC.
5909386	5912407	But it looks like they've really amped up the detail.
5912467	5918590	Everything from actually seeing the individual cars driving around to how much control you have over it.
5918630	5920251	It's just ridiculous the amount of control.
5920331	5921692	But pretty awesome looking.
5922132	5925533	And it will run on this new glass box engine.
5926834	5930276	Which, like I said, it's really, really detailed.
5932937	5934818	Yeah, so very cool looking game.
5936590	5944096	Sorry, this has nothing to do with SimCity, but my mind is still stuck on the whole you want a large, sassy lady in a fighting game.
5944576	5948699	And my mind, for some reason, instantly went to Latrice Royale from RuPaul's Drag Race.
5949219	5953022	And that made me think, wouldn't RuPaul's Drag Race make the best fighting game ever?
5954183	5954904	That would be great.
5955284	5957686	The time has come for you to lip-sync for your life.
5958266	5959947	No, really, your life.
5962649	5964811	I was thinking that Oprah should be downloadable.
5965211	5965712	Yeah.
5966567	5966887	DarkSakura,
5987353	5994055	Like, they had a... I'm not talking about the first computer one, because obviously the old school one I think a lot of us have played, because there was a port of it on Super Nintendo.
5994375	6001457	But there was one on CD that had, like, it whored the full motion video, and there was some bad video.
6001697	6002377	Did you ever play it?
6002777	6003697	I did not play that one.
6004357	6010999	The first SimCity game I played was on 5 1⁄4 floppies that was in black and white.
6011119	6013600	Well, the monitor I had was in black and white, but...
6014660	6015781	Really old SimCity.
6015861	6018142	Then I played SimCity 2000 a little bit.
6018822	6020143	I didn't really care for it too much.
6020163	6023425	I was like, whoa, this is way more complicated than SimCity.
6024205	6029568	The minute I was like, wait, I have to build piping and shit too?
6029628	6030669	Yeah, that's this game.
6030689	6032189	You have to manage your sewer systems.
6032249	6034991	I'm like, I just want to build buildings and have Godzilla attack them.
6036002	6040485	I saw the most scary thing ever, ever for SimCity.
6040686	6041046	What's that?
6041606	6056837	Was this guy who basically created the most efficient city in SimCity with 6 million people and fully functioning everything, but the thing that he sacrificed was longevity of the people, so he had them dying off at like 50.
6058118	6062141	But his city was the most efficient, and he spent four years making it.
6063866	6081819	that's frightening and he's got himself exactly it's the forever alone guy he plays SimCity but seriously there's like a YouTube on there of him bragging about his shit with this epic music and all I can think of that's so sad speaking of YouTube I've got to play this for you guys since you haven't seen it this is one of the great
6082359	6084541	Cut scenes from that SimCity PC.
6084842	6087484	Remember when everything had to have full motion video?
6087644	6087905	Yes.
6088445	6091068	So this was like that period where like every adventure game had it.
6091088	6095672	Okay, here's a great cut scene back from the SimCity days.
6095692	6101258	This is like one of the action news sequences that would chime into your game when things happen.
6105620	6111486	We've just received an emergency report that a serious meltdown has occurred at the SimCity nuclear power plant.
6129113	6130894	And the Oscar goes to... Her horribly bad lipstick.
6130914	6133275	Basic ass bitch from SimCity Action News.
6158206	6158446	Jamie!
6158466	6158647	Jamie!
6173486	6174147	I couldn't help it.
6174207	6175508	How insensitive.
6175648	6176848	Actually, I don't know.
6177069	6178149	That might not be that different.
6178189	6179010	We should try that.
6179210	6180771	I am so fucking down with that.
6180991	6182072	I'm sorry.
6182112	6183833	The first thing that popped in my head was Night Trap.
6184434	6186595	I was like, Tino Plato.
6186755	6186975	Dad.
6187776	6189017	Jamie, shame on you.
6189037	6189077	So?
6191417	6192237	That would be kind of funny.
6192377	6193558	I don't know.
6194498	6195198	I'm all down for that.
6195238	6197659	I would like to know what happened to SimCityActionNewsLady.
6197759	6199800	Some of these people might actually be famous, for all we know.
6200440	6201021	I don't think she is.
6201321	6202161	But here's the thing.
6202181	6209744	I'm not doing this to harp on her acting skills or whatever, because let's face it, we all got to get work somewhere, moving from community theater to SimCity.
6209764	6211745	She's been in one more game than I have.
6211765	6212345	That's right.
6212985	6216226	More people have seen her than listened to this podcast, I'm sure of that.
6216706	6222169	But look, my point is, that stuff would just cut right into the middle of your game when you were playing SimCity.
6222209	6226610	Like, you'd be doing your thing, do-do-do-do-do-do, and then all of a sudden that fucking full-motion video would come in.
6227290	6228991	Goddammit, I'm trying to play a game!
6230432	6230692	Anyhow.
6232492	6234053	Oh yeah, SimCity 5, hope it doesn't suck.
6236114	6237974	I don't think SimCity 1's gonna be in it, though.
6238254	6239195	Oh, phew, thank God.
6240265	6241346	Oh, poor, poor Dana Plato.
6241927	6243148	Oh, is it my turn?
6257859	6260420	No, it's Loki's... Loki's done one story.
6260720	6261841	Finish your shit!
6262221	6263261	Rapid fire news.
6263401	6264802	Hey, we were talking about... I derailed.
6265182	6267023	We were talking about SimCity, okay?
6267043	6267223	My fault.
6267283	6267963	I finished my coffee.
6267983	6268443	It was delicious.
6268483	6269584	I promise to be fast.
6270264	6273465	The next one would be Sorcery finally has a date.
6273485	6276246	You know, hey, they talked about it during E3 as a big thing.
6276766	6280528	And then it went poof, disappeared, and just delay, delay, delay.
6280808	6282589	Diabolical Pitch, Grasshopper, Connect, Zombies, Baseball
6301717	6303359	That game will be out April 4th.
6303799	6306362	And man, what a weird fucking game that is.
6306582	6309064	But that'll be out on Xbox Live Arcade.
6310325	6313268	And yes, it's a really weird fucking game.
6313308	6316091	But would you have it any other way with Grasshopper Manufacturer?
6316191	6316951	I'm okay with weird.
6317592	6317752	Yeah.
6317892	6318993	Throwing baseballs at zombies.
6319354	6320374	So with Kinect.
6321195	6321516	Good time.
6321916	6322016	Yeah.
6323283	6324084	PvP has been taken out.
6324104	6324404	For now.
6342290	6346734	which might lend a hint as to what the holdup is with this game.
6346774	6347755	We've been talking about it here.
6347795	6349597	I know I've been talking about it all the time on Horde House.
6349977	6351799	This game has been delayed, delayed, delayed.
6352039	6357324	Well, no Blizzard game is ever truly delayed because they don't, you know, but let's be real.
6357364	6358545	The beta's been out forever.
6358985	6360286	So it seems like the game is done.
6360346	6362046	So the question has been, what's the holdup?
6362086	6371631	Well, it might have been PvP because this official press release came out on Blizzard's site that basically says, you know, we're counting down the days, getting ready to announce this release date.
6371671	6374992	We have come to realize that PvP is not up to the standards.
6375532	6383296	We will release it in a patch following the game's launch, to which a lot of people kind of roll their eyes and go, oh, patching in the content after the game.
6383536	6410762	but let's be fair PC games kind of do this anyway a lot and something as robust as PvP and they're not going to charge you extra for it I think it's okay if they're going to do that PvP wasn't really in Diablo 2 so it was something new to Diablo 3 so whereas I'm sure some folks will be disappointed if it'll get the damn game out already then I'm okay with this taking a little bit of a break so they do say that when PvP does come out multiple arena maps, theme locations and so forth
6411682	6417828	It wasn't in the beta, so I guess it's not that surprising that PvP is getting cut out.
6417968	6420250	So hopefully a release date for Diablo before too long.
6421171	6428377	Hopefully a release date soon for this game, too, because I know the screenshots that came out for it this week have me very excited, as I'm sure a lot of you.
6428437	6432240	And that is Kingdom Hearts 3D, or Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance.
6432601	6432901	Get it?
6433361	6436264	Well, some of the screenshots came out this week that show Sora in...
6436783	6438205	Sam, son of Flynn
6456923	6457263	and Riku.
6480994	6481454	No, they don't.
6503546	6507708	I would love to see a Kingdom Hearts 3 on consoles already, but I'll take this to hold me over.
6508568	6511929	One other quick story here about Dead or Alive 5.
6512450	6515271	Dead or Alive 5 has a new character on the roster.
6515691	6518532	Might be familiar if you've ever played a little game called Virtua Fighter.
6519112	6522153	Akira Yuki will be in the next Dead or Alive game.
6523114	6523594	There you go.
6523994	6525355	So if you're a Virtua Fighter fan.
6525615	6526215	Ooh, I'm not.
6526375	6527295	Worlds are colliding.
6527636	6528816	I wasn't really either, but there you go.
6530777	6542293	You know, my husband liked it and I was like, the only time I ever played any version of that game for like any period of time was because I was trying to knock off Kage's mask in Virtua Fighter 2.
6543675	6543976	All right.
6545899	6547220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6570618	6575883	and then Assassin's Creed 3 will be on the Wii U and there is a trailer out.
6577284	6582128	And isn't this the one that's like the Native American one that's taking place during the American Revolution?
6582369	6583109	I do believe it is.
6584190	6592237	So yeah, it actually has big battles that are going on including the Continental Army versus the British Army.
6592437	6593258	All kinds of cool stuff.
6593799	6595060	You know, actually I have to tell you something.
6596261	6596481	Hmm.
6597358	6602280	Assassin's Creed came up in my Renaissance history class.
6602980	6615584	Because apparently it shows the towns so realistically that my teacher was able to use the models in the game to show us the Palazzo and all kinds of different places in Venice.
6616584	6617844	I thought I would mention that.
6618805	6618965	So...
6620345	6620885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6638897	6641898	Is it really tie-in to the drink Propel, or is that just the name?
6642018	6642758	Speculation.
6642938	6643238	I see.
6644558	6646459	I think it's just a clever name, but yeah.
6646919	6652900	But hey, yo, dog, I heard you like Propel, so you can play Propel while you drink Propel and propel your head through the screen.
6653300	6654140	Old meme is old.
6654640	6656141	I know, but it's still funny sometimes.
6656361	6656781	Okay, I'm done.
6659061	6659461	Real quick.
6659641	6659841	Yeah.
6661162	6667043	Now, this might be a coincidence, but I was looking for the...
6668800	6675626	Actress that played... I was just about to say the chatters found something on that, but go ahead.
6675646	6676767	We'll see what you got first.
6676807	6679990	Stephanie Fargo is the actress that did that.
6680450	6683373	Funny enough, search for Stephanie Fargo on Facebook.
6683413	6684834	You don't get Stephanie Fargo.
6685314	6692641	You do, however, get Stephanie... I believe it's Goats, who happens to be a news reporter.
6693301	6694742	Is that a coincidence or what?
6694762	6695043	What?
6695743	6696724	She's also blonde.
6697104	6698185	It could be the one.
6698405	6702047	She could have actually turned this into a career.
6703949	6709252	I'm not saying that this is the person because there's very little to go on because, you know, IMDB and stuff.
6709312	6713155	But, man, that would be a coincidence.
6713415	6715917	OL Army, bring me Stephanie Fargo.
6717658	6718679	I ask questions.
6719039	6722141	And she looks like age-wise that it could be.
6722161	6724803	Wait, show me because I can't find her like you've got it.
6727327	6729829	Stephanie Fargo's photos, address, phone, email.
6729869	6732732	See, look, I did a search for Stephanie Fargo.
6733213	6735435	You shouldn't encourage people to stalk like this.
6735495	6737797	This is borderline a problem.
6738137	6740439	And I was like, news anchor reporter?
6741540	6742141	Really?
6742361	6744243	I mean, that would be a coincidence.
6745164	6745844	Don't get me wrong.
6746525	6767215	I don't know, it doesn't really look like her to me It's hard to say because that's like the 90s haircut Well, SSJ100Matt was the chatter that said Stephanie Fargo is the SimCity news hiker Her IMDB says that she's only been in SimCity Well, that's IMDB I was like, you all have problems Stop stalking these poor full motion actors
6770905	6771867	Oh my god, you guys.
6771907	6772227	All right.
6774050	6776173	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6778432	6781733	Every week we ask you guys a question on the Facebook and the Google+.
6781753	6783373	You put them together, it's Fugle.
6784413	6786094	Facebook Google Question of the Week.
6786194	6795496	With the recent announcement of the new iPad, the statement was made by Apple that the resolution of the device was greater than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 experience.
6795796	6798816	Do you consider the iPad a gaming device for the core gamer?
6799336	6800056	Why or why not?
6800076	6801777	I think we've kind of said our piece on this.
6801817	6803077	Let's go to some of the answers.
6803477	6804278	There was a lot of answers.
6804318	6806581	I can't read them all, but I'm going to read some of these.
6808764	6809184	Let's see.
6809405	6813350	Jennifer J. says, To be completely honest, I don't see it as much of a gaming machine.
6813530	6817214	I mean, sure, there are games made for it and whatnot, but I really don't see it going anywhere.
6817275	6818116	But then again, I might be wrong.
6819618	6820818	John K says, Jim H says,
6838343	6840686	However, it's a gaming machine of a different sort.
6841066	6850336	I think you're going to see that Nintendo and Sony's newer portable consoles aren't going to sell like past incarnations because Apple and Android have all the casual pick-up-and-play gamers locked up.
6850596	6852478	I think there's a story on that coming up in a minute here.
6854219	6859060	Hunter R says, First of all, the resolution claim is contingent on the apps that run on the iPad.
6859140	6864521	Remember, the PS3 can do 1080p, but how many games actually run at that resolution?
6865121	6867782	As far as the iPad being a gaming device, I don't buy it.
6868182	6872382	I don't play many games on my iPad, and the games I do play are mainly board and card games.
6872442	6874103	This is mostly due to the control scheme.
6874563	6880744	Having my fingers get in the way of the display is a problem for most games, but is not a problem for board and card games.
6881144	6888427	Also, I use my iPad more to watch videos, use Twitter, check my email, read online articles, and type up long rambling passages that may or may not be interesting.
6888847	6889487	Such as this one?
6889507	6890988	I don't know.
6891068	6891448	Let's see.
6892048	6895489	Katsuhiko J says, for a pick-up-and-go experience, yes.
6895769	6897070	You can say the full name on that one.
6897230	6897470	It's a...
6899091	6901992	Well, I always say first in the lesson at OTA, Janai.
6902112	6903893	For a pick-up-and-go experience, yes.
6903933	6906434	For a sit-down-and-play-for-hours experience, probably not.
6906894	6910335	That is decided by the game, whether it's Tiny Tower or Grand Theft Auto.
6910715	6914917	Realistically, I can see myself playing Tiny Tower for two to three minutes and be satisfied.
6915237	6918698	There's no way I can play it for many hours straight, not even 30 minutes.
6919158	6921179	It won't replace your PS3 or your 360.
6921619	6927701	I kind of like that, kind of calling it out like that, because that's a lot of what I see and I've
6928181	6931983	IOS Gaming versus, you know, playing on the consoles.
6932063	6933944	It's really about that time investment.
6933964	6935785	There's a lot of games that just take, like, seconds.
6937326	6938547	Last one from Facebook here.
6938927	6939547	Mike B says,
6950791	6958357	I love the thinking, but you have to be living in a fantasy world for Microsoft to suddenly get along with the Apple devices like that.
6959498	6962381	But why aren't we seeing that type of stuff with the Windows phones?
6962541	6963882	I guess we are a little bit.
6964002	6968205	I mean, there is Xbox Live stuff on there, and I think you can even go so far as to earn some achievement points.
6968726	6976192	I don't know about the whole cross-platform playing, but if the Vita can interface with a PC, I mean, anything else is just a matter of time, I'm sure.
6977373	6979635	But as far as Gears of War, hmm.
6979855	6982617	Owner Stephanie Fargo, a gorgeous Amazonian former actress with an uproarious laugh.
7004270	7005071	I found that article too.
7005091	7007033	Yeah, it's Revolution Fitness.
7008075	7009477	So she's a fitness instructor now.
7009597	7012060	That might be her.
7012080	7015004	She didn't look Amazonian in the video there.
7015024	7016066	Well, she was also sitting down.
7016086	7018188	She might have bulked up if she took a fitness instructor role.
7021012	7021313	Anyhow.
7021912	7022592	Carlos M. says, Definitely.
7022612	7026415	I do more gaming on my Zoom tablet than on my PS3 and Wii combined, and my Xbox beats it just because of Dragon Age.
7044885	7053595	I can certainly vouch for the quality of games, not only graphics-wise, but also on their entertainment value.
7054036	7058801	Now, if only they'd release a Final Fantasy or Bioware RPG there...
7059682	7061504	Well, to be fair, I just want to get this out there.
7062084	7071754	There are some really good Final Fantasy ports on iPhone, which would be the Final Fantasy 1, 2, and 3, and I believe 3 has an iPad version too.
7072615	7074137	And then there's, I think, Tactics too.
7074637	7080403	Mass Effect supposedly has a spin-off game that's on iOS, but my friends that are obsessed with Mass Effect tell me it stinks.
7081063	7082585	And Loki's giving the thumbs down too.
7084066	7100979	here's my favorite comment of them all from Derek H the iPad is a gaming device just like a picture of Bea Arthur as a contraceptive it'll work in an emergency but it should never be your first choice unless you're Deadpool
7104437	7105318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7129439	7136278	I gotta say, I know as much as you want to... First off, that was a hilarious comment in the beginning, but I will say for the second half of it, video editor...
7137370	7149738	I've, I mean, I wouldn't use it for anything serious, but I took a trip up to like Lake Tahoe and I did like little video and I did it in iMovie and it was really easy and it made a cool, fun little thing to post on Facebook.
7150139	7157223	Like I wouldn't make it much more serious than that, but I was actually really pleased with video editing on the iPhone because it was really super easy.
7158044	7162487	But granted, if I was going to do anything professional, I would do it on a Mac or a PC.
7164008	7164888	Credit card machine.
7165589	7166790	I was at a restaurant the other day.
7167691	7170133	And I saw the waiter taking my order on an iPod.
7170734	7171335	Couldn't believe it.
7171715	7172736	That's where technologies come.
7173497	7175159	It was the same restaurant you were at the other day.
7175179	7176240	You were telling me when you came in here.
7176553	7191827	Well something else too is that a friend of mine who used to do drive-by appraisals actually would do them with his iPad mounted on the front of his bike and would basically drive around the house on his bike and take pictures of the home.
7193249	7198574	What a drive-by appraisal is for people who don't know is when a mortgage company hires somebody to go make sure the house is lived in.
7199514	7200015	Thank you for watching!
7215188	7216109	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7240366	7243308	and, of course, it hasn't even quite hit a year yet.
7243848	7249530	That will be March 27th, but close enough, I guess.
7251943	7261067	By comparison, I guess they said 9 million units of software have been sold and $1.2 billion in revenue it's generated so far.
7261367	7264788	The original DS sold 2.3 million units in its first year.
7265989	7274793	And of course, during February, 200,000 of those are actually, or actually, I'm sorry, it's not 2,000.
7275593	7279637	Yeah, 200,000 systems were moved during February.
7280198	7282880	And Mario Galaxy has sold 5 million units as well.
7283080	7284682	So it's doing pretty well.
7285963	7288525	The Nintendo Wii also sold about 228,000 units.
7288906	7289646	And the 3DS itself, 135.
7289747	7292869	So it's still not doing too bad, even though the 3DS is out.
7300301	7302762	Microsoft didn't do too bad as well.
7302803	7315352	They sold almost half a million units for the Xbox 360 and reached the top console spot for 14 consecutive months.
7316973	7317773	That's not bad.
7320444	7324326	The PlayStation Move, they've shipped 10.5 million units.
7325547	7334593	Of course, as I've mentioned in the past before when they talk about shipping units for the Move, you can't really compare that to the Kinect.
7334693	7341537	Because the Kinect, they've sold, I can't remember how many units for the Kinect.
7342217	7343238	It's quite a bit.
7343258	7346420	I think it's actually still more than 10 million units.
7346960	7347120	But...
7349681	7352624	What are they exactly counting for the PlayStation Move?
7353885	7358168	Like the Wii, you can use multiple Move units per system.
7358688	7359809	Are they counting the camera?
7359829	7361731	Are they counting the navigation controller?
7362051	7362831	Any accessories?
7362911	7363972	It's just Move units.
7364032	7366094	You can bet the math is as fuzzy as possible.
7367489	7368670	I'd be willing to bet, yeah.
7368770	7373652	So, 10.5 million units, that could be significantly less households.
7373792	7381995	And judging by the sales of move-only games, I would guess it's probably... I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I don't think I know anyone in real life that has a PlayStation Move.
7382355	7383256	I know people on the internet.
7383316	7383676	Oh, you do?
7384216	7384756	Yeah.
7385217	7385917	Do I play with it?
7386377	7386477	No.
7386937	7390539	Maybe that's why I don't know anybody, because nobody ever says, let's play Move.
7391610	7417030	it's it's sad because it's not bad it's actually a pretty good peripheral I mean I would prefer to use the move over connect but you know I think for some things to connect is way better like dancing games I think it would be a lot better you know tracking you versus you know the move controller for like core games like um you know shooters and stuff it's probably way better like I would play um what was it uh
7419195	7419655	God, no.
7420015	7429560	I'd play some of the third-person shooters or whatever, the gun games and stuff, with a move controller versus trying to even remotely do that with a Kinect camera.
7429800	7431240	It just wouldn't be accurate at all.
7431300	7432041	Plus, it has buttons.
7432201	7433221	Buttons are important, right?
7433441	7433642	Yeah.
7435963	7436623	Very important.
7438689	7439009	All right.
7439590	7441731	Well, what about the sales figures overall?
7441771	7443112	I mean, what do we think this is saying?
7443152	7446054	Like, is the 3DS recovered or whatever?
7446174	7447595	I mean, this says to me, yes.
7460784	7470354	The Wii, though, I can guarantee you that the Wii systems, even 200,000, that's still, I think, on the downturn.
7470854	7475659	Looking at the slate of Wii games coming out, they're kind of done with that system.
7475959	7479403	I mean, there's a lot of games that aren't getting Wii ports anymore.
7479623	7481185	It's just gone.
7481925	7482266	All right.
7483519	7492344	Well, this might make Loki sad because I don't know who he's going to make fun of now, but Peter Molyneux has left Microsoft, meaning he's left Lionhead Studios as well.
7492364	7493264	Ah, yes.
7493304	7494725	His head was too big for the building.
7494765	7495405	He had to leave.
7496946	7499027	I think they had to carve him a new door on the way out.
7500067	7501828	He's left for a startup called 22 Cans.
7504582	7505142	22 cans.
7505502	7506242	No, 22 cans.
7507142	7508363	That would be a direction.
7508403	7510543	That would be interesting.
7511023	7512283	He did leave some parting words.
7512343	7523806	And his parting words were, quote, It is with mixed emotions that I make the decision to leave Microsoft and Lionhead Studios, the company that I co-founded in 1997, at the conclusion of development of Fable the Journey.
7524326	7529387	I remain extremely passionate and proud of the people, products, and experiences that we created.
7529667	7530447	It's not on rails.
7531787	7533688	Okay, I added the last part, but the rest of it's true.
7533889	7534829	Because it is on rails.
7536710	7537351	So there you go.
7537571	7539812	It is apparently an amicable breakup.
7540453	7542855	They're still Facebook friends, from what I understand.
7544115	7546277	Maybe sometimes they'll just end up in bed together.
7546397	7549179	They might throw some shade at each other once in a while, but that'll be the extent of it.
7549439	7552521	I was going to make a game about a little boy named Milo.
7552881	7554823	Then Chris Hansen showed up, so now I'm on a limb.
7556684	7557825	So I went to a company called 22 Cans.
7557945	7558285	22 Cans.
7558465	7558725	All right.
7563614	7564635	They're a porn company.
7565155	7565695	Stop it.
7566816	7567197	22 cans.
7567837	7571440	That's the people that they have standing out on the street with an empty can saying, put money in me.
7571560	7573681	What level is this show sunken to?
7573701	7574942	Not low enough.
7574982	7575943	Rob, Dana Plato.
7576263	7579725	What you talking about, Jamie?
7580826	7586070	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com is where you send us emails every week and DarkSakura has to read them.
7589144	7592487	Why don't you read the emails from our kind and generous listeners this week?
7594388	7596030	Oh, OLR, I like you.
7596150	7597591	You're my favorite show ever.
7597671	7598592	Don't make them up.
7600093	7600313	Okay.
7600854	7601594	Hi, OLR.
7601654	7605417	I just wanted to say thank you for talking me out of buying Street Fighter Cross Tekken.
7605437	7610542	I was very excited to get it, but after hearing how over a quarter of the complete roster is paid to unlock, I had to say hell no.
7611462	7615386	In fact, I went to GameStop yesterday to pre-order the game, but I got a 3DS instead.
7615906	7617668	I got Mario Kart, so I'm down to play someone.
7618448	7622951	The guy before me was buying a PS3 and Just Dance 3, and I pre-ordered the game as well.
7623791	7638579	I was at the register next to him, and the lady checking me out asked if I wanted to pre-order any games, and I told her that I wanted to get Street Fighter X Tekken, but went on about how a quarter of the roster was paid to unlock, and the guy was checking out next to me, freaked out.
7639520	7642321	You could totally see the surprise in his eyes when I blurted that out.
7642821	7645823	I'm sure she was pissed that I might have talked the guy out of a sale, oh well.
7646543	7647564	But yeah, that's just nuts.
7648784	7654926	12 characters, probably $5 a piece to buy would mean that'd be $60, which is the cost of a game.
7655446	7659347	Are you telling me that I'd have to shell out the same amount of money in order to get the full experience?
7660688	7661828	There's a big link on there.
7661848	7662708	I'm not gonna relink.
7665329	7667471	This is why they did it to save on hard drive space.
7668572	7673816	But they didn't explain when they'd be unlocked, and I'm guessing $3 to $5 a piece, which is still too much.
7674657	7679200	Sure, they did that with Jill and Shu McGrath in the two Marvel vs. Capcom 3 games, but that's just for two characters.
7679721	7683824	If all 12 characters were available in a bundle for like $10, then I'll stop bitching.
7684444	7685505	But I doubt that'll happen.
7685765	7690169	Oh, I also thought it was funny that the PS3 exclusive characters can also be found on the Xbox version.
7690609	7695753	Their files were found in the disc, so if anyone is good at hacking, you might be able to play as cool on the Xbox.
7695913	7697114	Okay, that's it.
7697394	7697814	I'm done.
7697974	7699035	Thanks for reading this.
7699115	7701617	I look forward to your 10th-iversary, Stan.
7702878	7707181	And also, the reason why they're probably on the disc is because it's the same information just ported
7707481	7710103	Oh yeah, it's kind of lazy porting in a way.
7710523	7713345	I mean, I know that sounds really harsh, but it kind of is what it is.
7714825	7721489	The other thing I want to say about that, it's kind of scary that we kind of talked not one, but two people out of buying the game.
7722490	7723851	It's not what we set out to do.
7724071	7729554	Like, I'm not trying to discourage people from buying the game because, you know, again, there's fighting game fans out there that are going to eat this up.
7729574	7730335	And that's fine.
7730455	7731055	That is fine.
7731115	7731575	It's your money.
7731615	7732156	Buy what you want.
7732836	7759516	but um you know we're all about people making informed decisions and it sounds like that's what happened in this case is that people kind of realized like wait a minute I'm gonna have to pay $60 and then if I want everything I have to pay 60 more dollars maybe only to see a super uber collection at the end of the year I I kind of talked myself out of it with that same logic I think that's why I asked Loki earlier what did the sales look like for this game because I want to see if it's just more than the three of us now that we're up to anyhow
7760894	7761415	Next email.
7762676	7766379	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, let me say first you guys and lady are amazing.
7766679	7772244	Between Loki's rants of rage and DarkSakura and Sky's epic trolls, you make a three hour podcast very entertaining.
7772364	7773065	I'm not a troll.
7774366	7774967	Epic trolls.
7774987	7776888	I'm not an epic troll.
7778550	7781933	It's not that you are a troll, it's that you have done trolling.
7782853	7784134	I was trolling you for compliments.
7784714	7784974	Bitch.
7785655	7786135	Girl, please.
7787236	7792098	Now, granted, I haven't listened to you guys from the beginning mostly because I was 10 when you guys started.
7792118	7794360	Oh my god.
7795260	7800563	But for the past three years... Emailers, I totally appreciate your emails.
7801564	7803065	Please don't say that ever again.
7805953	7811496	But for the past three years, you guys have taught me about old school games, system hackings, and other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head.
7812016	7819660	You guys can make a long car drive seem shorter, a boring day entertaining, and a regular guy seem crazy because he can't stop laughing in the middle of class.
7820361	7824023	I hope you guys keep podcasting, really enjoy the show, signed Haseo Sumiragawa.
7824403	7824763	P.S.
7824963	7828285	If there are trophy whores listening to this show, you can add me on P.S.N.
7828345	7831107	It's Haseo underscore Sumiragawa.
7831988	7832328	Hello, Hellions!
7847734	7847974	What?
7848214	7848495	What?
7876756	7886419	Being that China is an emerging market, not just in video games, but also in different aspects of our modern day economy, it makes sense that Blizzard would tailor make something for the Chinese public.
7887819	7893941	This also makes me think of the possibilities that could happen if Blizzard decides to tailor make something to any other emerging markets.
7894001	7897922	Finally, one of the possibilities began to take tangible shape in my mind.
7898282	7900203	Behold, the Jersey Darians.
7901524	7901844	Lord.
7902624	7902885	Okay.
7903265	7904045	This is funny now.
7904986	7906907	Coming from the mythical realm of Shortopia.
7907068	7908168	Smush, smush.
7908789	7909549	I don't know what that means.
7910070	7915814	The Jersey Darians are an orange race whose clothes, hair, and muscular definitions appeal mostly to people of their own race.
7916514	7920257	The Jersey Darians are not a smart race, but just try telling them that.
7920597	7927522	Criticizing a Jersey Darian may result in you getting your teeth punched in by an orange troll whose over-stylized hair makes up for the bulk of their height.
7928497	7929637	One of them's pregnant, you know.
7930518	7930958	I know.
7931778	7932719	I didn't need to know that.
7932759	7934019	It just made my life hurt.
7934879	7948464	Other possibilities for expansion packs for the emerging markets include, for the English, the Cockney Darians, for the Irish, the U2 Darians, for the Somalians, the not Jack Sparrow Pyro Darians, and for Utah, the Conservative Control Freaky Darians.
7952506	7973756	I just thought of the best argument ever for gay marriage or, you know, equal marriage because there's really no such thing as gay marriage but I have the best argument ever I can't get married but Snooki can just think about that for a minute
7976609	7980351	That's the country we live in, folks.
7982152	7984873	Rick Santorum wants Snooki to get married.
7985853	7986313	But not me.
7987194	7987474	Anyhow.
7988214	7989215	Hello, OLR crew.
7990195	7991275	There was something else that email wanted to say.
7991375	7992956	Oh, the Pandarian thing in China.
7993516	7998098	We've talked about this on The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, a show all about the world of Warcraft.
7998298	8000059	www.hordehouse.com Wink.
8001150	8018329	um we talked a little bit about this and actually I don't think the claim is as far-fetched as some think it's ironic because there was a time when people were saying it can't be Pandaria they're not going to do Pandaria because there's laws in China against panda people like you can't that's defacing pandas and da da da da da da da
8019891	8021752	I don't think what you're saying is too far-fetched.
8021852	8027057	I think it's kind of a win-win situation for Blizzard because, yes, they can do a very respectful thing for the Chinese culture.
8027597	8035484	And, you know, here in the States and other countries like Canada and UK and so forth, we kind of like that culture.
8035504	8038086	There's a lot of people that are like, you know, pandas are cute.
8038166	8040568	And, you know, they like the architecture and all that.
8040668	8042690	So it makes sense.
8043965	8045847	I still forgot to reserve the name Orange Chicken.
8065740	8065980	Anyway.
8066521	8067561	Hello, all our crew.
8067581	8068602	Ooh, to DarkSakura.
8068642	8071904	While I do respect you preferring the Japanese... Oh, God.
8071964	8072464	Here we go.
8072684	8076307	The Japanese Sonic CD soundtrack, I must side with Bobby Blackwolf and claim the U.S.
8076327	8077247	soundtrack is superior.
8077407	8078388	Again, your opinion.
8079168	8084892	Despite the fact that Sonic CDs... Where every gamer has a voice, a really... That's why I'm pointing out an opinion.
8084912	8086173	A really wrong voice.
8088223	8088983	I just got the hand.
8089384	8090364	No, that was a high five.
8090584	8091184	Oh, okay.
8092465	8094666	I thought you were making me talk to that.
8094766	8095706	No, I was giving you a high five.
8097727	8105611	Despite the fact that Sonic CD's musics have a style different from the other Sonic games for its time, at least to me anyway, the Japanese music sounds very cheesy.
8105651	8109152	It's way too upbeat and has some hammy voice samples that are out of place.
8109313	8116836	I believe the US tunes composed by Spencer Nielsen do a fantastic job of fitting in with the atmosphere of each level, even if it sounds a little new agey at times.
8117924	8119605	Yeah, that's kind of why I have a problem with it.
8119625	8120626	It doesn't sound like Sonic music.
8121426	8123327	Here's a question for the whole OLR crew.
8124007	8127389	What are some of the best deals that you've had for video game or video game hardware?
8127749	8135994	For me, I've recently had a Circuit City Tiger Direct Honor, an erroneous $40 price tag for a 32GB PlayStation Vita memory card.
8137095	8138936	I literally just bought Mass Effect for $11.
8139756	8140656	I thought that was pretty good.
8140817	8142057	This is also by Full Brazilian.
8143878	8145039	I love that name so much.
8146812	8149253	What's the most that's ever been shaved off a price for you?
8149273	8158517	I know one on Dan's behalf where he traded his Sega CD for a Neo Geo and games.
8159277	8160257	What about Steam?
8160558	8161558	Like anything on Steam?
8162538	8164679	I bought like every Doom game ever for $3.
8166140	8167660	I know there's a lot of good deals there.
8167720	8169381	And I randomly get free games from people.
8169721	8171622	I got my Dreamcast for $40. $40.
8174562	8175803	Amazing deal.
8176243	8179004	Those things are still fucking rad to have.
8179344	8181926	Dreamcast Twin Sticks for Oratario Tangram.
8183346	8184407	We paid $45 for them.
8184867	8186368	They were going eBay for like $500.
8187008	8190250	I won my Dreamcast at a QZAR all-nighter.
8191350	8194312	Nice.
8194612	8195552	Oh, we've gotten...
8198621	8201523	Our first model PlayStation when they were still going for $700.
8202423	8205425	We got $100 back from Discover.
8205445	8207125	$700 for that first PlayStation?
8207205	8209847	I guess they were about that much in the beginning, weren't they?
8209967	8212688	Yeah, but we got $100 back from Discover.
8212728	8214409	And Dan got his manager's discount on it.
8215509	8216650	So I guess that's kind of good.
8216730	8217490	And it still works.
8219151	8220592	And it still plays all of our old stuff.
8222232	8223233	So next email.
8223496	8223916	Yes, please.
8224556	8225237	How many more emails?
8225597	8225817	Three.
8226377	8226817	Geez!
8227397	8227837	I know!
8228257	8228637	It's alright.
8228738	8229698	Every gamer gets a voice.
8230338	8231798	That's why the show is three and a half hours long.
8232218	8232939	Hi, OLR.
8233039	8238080	A couple weeks ago, DarkSakura did a classic game of the week, which inspired me to get the game for my iPod Touch.
8238480	8240441	More specifically, Puzzle Bobble, a.k.a.
8240501	8241021	Bust a Move.
8241401	8243342	It was well worth the $5 I spent to get it.
8243382	8245422	It's very addicting and is full of awesomeness.
8245782	8246623	Keep up the good work.
8246643	8247763	Sincerely, Vince Raven.
8248143	8248443	P.S.
8248503	8250604	Make sure everyone votes for President Cat in the elections.
8250724	8251324	LOLXD.
8253527	8253947	LOL.
8254888	8259209	If President Cat was running for Republican, then I think everybody else would not make it.
8260410	8261170	Oh, huh?
8261210	8261390	Oh, sorry.
8261410	8262671	I was trying to read if there was a question.
8262711	8263231	I got distracted.
8263251	8264031	No, there was no question.
8264211	8266352	Somebody sent me naked photos of one of the people from Glee.
8266452	8267793	So I was like, oh, I want to see that.
8267853	8272194	And then I wasn't listening to the... Female or male?
8272435	8272815	Female.
8273095	8273615	Okay, who?
8274435	8276976	It was... It's a video game podcast, right?
8277497	8280558	It was just thanking me for referring... What?
8280638	8280878	What?
8282259	8282780	Nice.
8287865	8290147	Back to video games.
8290428	8291569	Okay.
8291629	8292910	Is that vag in the background?
8292990	8293551	It might be.
8293691	8294452	Let's move on.
8294592	8295272	It was a mirror.
8295793	8295953	No.
8296113	8300638	Well, you see, Jamie, women have a vagina.
8300778	8301439	Shut up.
8302059	8302740	And so do you.
8307895	8308516	You're a bitch.
8308536	8309176	Read an email.
8309837	8310337	Love you, mean it.
8311978	8312779	Greetings, OLR.
8312879	8314420	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8315261	8319625	I just heard that Diablo 3 is now removing PvP to speed up their release time.
8320025	8321426	I'm getting real tired of companies.
8321766	8322947	It should be really tired.
8322987	8323227	Hello.
8323948	8324829	Sorry, what was the question?
8324849	8324949	Girl.
8324969	8325049	Okay.
8353795	8357938	It's talking about the Diablo 3 removing the PvP and saying tired of games.
8358378	8358598	Right.
8359118	8362100	You know, coming out with stuff that's going to be DLC later.
8363041	8364202	And people having to pay for it.
8364222	8365543	But they say they're not going to charge for it.
8365563	8368745	Yeah, but I think it's still the, you mean it's not going to have everything on it?
8368805	8369025	Meh.
8369785	8373769	I'm okay with it because I don't want to wait nine more months for the game to come out.
8374770	8376171	It's like waiting for a baby.
8377372	8379814	How long have we been waiting for Diablo 3?
8380194	8384738	And PvP was not one of the elements I personally cared about as much.
8384798	8388021	I'll play it later when they patch it in, but I don't need it right away.
8388101	8390083	It is like waiting for a baby without the indigestion.
8390463	8390924	Moving on.
8398652	8402516	I totally agree with the fact that gamers don't want to work for unlocks anymore i.e.
8402576	8411486	Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur 5 everything is there to use right away and the modes are rather lacking the good old days of gaming are dwindling folks
8414142	8414562	Agreed.
8415703	8416323	And you know what?
8416863	8417683	That's it.
8417803	8418904	Or at least that's all I'm going to read.
8419424	8421384	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
8421404	8423525	It sounds like Jamie sadly had to cut a few out tonight.
8423725	8424305	No, I didn't.
8424445	8426786	I just said if any more arrived, I wasn't going to read them.
8427126	8427727	Until next week.
8428467	8428867	There you go.
8428927	8429887	Loki will read them next week.
8430067	8430507	There you go.
8431308	8432828	That would be funny if Loki read them.
8433529	8434849	He's done them before when you're not here.
8435382	8436384	I know, but while I was here.
8438388	8439189	The mailbag?
8439290	8439630	Yeah.
8440091	8440392	Alright.
8441153	8441754	Moving on.
8442796	8445522	This is the part of the show where we get angsty because... because...
8461730	8462611	Upity male bitches.
8463531	8464572	F you to uppity male bitches.
8465112	8465413	Hey!
8465613	8465953	Not you.
8466173	8466413	Okay.
8467854	8468635	There's, okay.
8469415	8470076	I have a friend.
8470496	8471517	Oh, I know where this is going.
8471617	8472437	You know where this is going.
8472457	8474199	I know absolutely where this is going.
8474659	8475940	I already know, you didn't even have to say it.
8476180	8480943	Who occasionally acts like a stereotypical hysterical woman.
8483045	8484005	And doesn't admit.
8484325	8485666	And it's Nathan Lane in the birdcage.
8487498	8500328	and doesn't ever admit, well, except for this time, when said person has done something wrong or, you know, gives the roundabout, passive-aggressive type of apology, you know what I mean?
8500988	8502109	Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
8504231	8524797	and I'm getting kind of sick of it and I'm getting sick of just that sense of entitlement so but you know what we talked it out things are better I hope that said person watches it but I really got so pissed off that I I haven't been this angry in a long time I got so pissed off I burped
8527338	8527898	She's not lying.
8527958	8530079	She sent me a message and wow, girl, I just burped.
8530659	8531339	I am so angry.
8531359	8531879	I burped.
8532759	8533539	I threw up in my mouth.
8534419	8535280	That was awful.
8536080	8537360	And the place I didn't want to do it either.
8537420	8538220	I was at synagogue.
8539720	8540861	I was sick and had to leave.
8541481	8542081	I was so mad.
8543161	8543781	It was awful.
8544401	8544701	Loki.
8545622	8546562	Oh, I'm sorry.
8546922	8548362	Girl, F you to Rob.
8548382	8550483	Sounded like you were done.
8550603	8551483	No, I have one more.
8551583	8551843	Alright.
8552103	8553083	Now I forgot what it was.
8553163	8553583	Whatever.
8553723	8554063	Oh, yeah.
8554483	8556744	F you to Daylight Savings Time, you whore.
8558137	8558577	Who were?
8559458	8559838	Who were?
8560179	8568806	Because, okay, last time I went to the Jewish Film Festival, I come home at like 1 and sit down to, you know, check all my email and everything.
8568906	8572349	I look at the clock, next thing I know it's 3 because boom, time skip.
8572990	8580676	And then I'm not in bed until like after 4 because I had all this crap to do that I thought I still had another hour to do because I forgot about it.
8581477	8583719	Thank you for watching!
8600511	8600852	Loki!
8602093	8608460	Fuck you to the donut shop in Folsom for not having the baking maple donuts.
8608900	8611843	You sold out of them at what, like 10 in the morning?
8612064	8615587	I mean, seriously, that is just ridiculous.
8616368	8617509	Not a single donut.
8617870	8620312	You would think that they would be popular and you'd make a ton of them.
8621093	8622715	I mean, that's my thought.
8625563	8626504	So that's just unfair.
8643252	8643572	Alright.
8644033	8644333	Any more?
8644753	8645034	That's it.
8645174	8645434	Alright.
8645494	8647015	Because you know what happens if I cut someone off.
8648256	8653040	My FU of the week goes to Daylight Savings Time as well.
8653140	8654201	Which is a dirty whore.
8654221	8656122	I've had two cups of coffee today to compensate.
8656863	8657263	Not one!
8657623	8658304	Two cups of coffee.
8658384	8659405	I did two, thanks to you.
8659845	8661086	Actually, fuck, I had three.
8662267	8662867	I need to catch up.
8664713	8676357	Otherwise, I had a really crazy week last week, but a lot of good news and a lot of I don't really feel one way or the other about it news.
8677418	8678418	When it rains, it pours.
8678558	8682780	And that's not necessarily an FU, but it's just, damn, I'm going to be busy.
8684620	8686581	FU to the fact that there aren't more hours in the day.
8686641	8688742	In fact, there's one less, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.
8689162	8690503	Did I say FU to Daylight Savings Time?
8690523	8691183	Because I really mean it.
8691943	8692363	You know what?
8693184	8697547	I think I can back you up in that completely because fuck it.
8697627	8698208	Good, because I'm right.
8698248	8699188	I like more night time.
8700109	8701930	I want night time savings time.
8704232	8706674	Let's go to some more news before we get to your calls.
8706714	8708575	Hey, the 800 number works again this week.
8708675	8711077	That's good, but we have a few more stories first.
8711137	8711417	Loki.
8711998	8717481	Alright, let's talk a little bit about hopefully not anything I was looking up there.
8718102	8719963	We don't need to talk about that.
8720203	8720684	More boobs?
8721687	8722534	Well, it's the same boobs.
8725236	8727717	Let's talk about Valve.
8728817	8733338	They, of course, came out and debunked the whole Steam Box debacle thing.
8733738	8740579	Everyone was conspiring that they were making some sort of console, and of course, that's not the case.
8740719	8753722	What they were doing, though, is they were making test boxes to test out their big picture initiative, which is basically developing an interface for Steam that looks nice on TV displays.
8754322	8781260	so that's what those boxes were being used for not necessarily a game console but I mean if you think about it likely story no it actually does sound like a likely story so um you know if you think about it though I mean that kind of setup you could use a pc next to your hooked up to your tv and kind of treat it like a game box you know or something like that I don't know all right
8783260	8784741	Well, are you bummed out with this news?
8784861	8786482	Were you hoping for a Steam box?
8786902	8788043	No, I didn't really care.
8789083	8790184	I don't have a Steam account.
8791285	8791525	Really?
8791565	8792365	That's surprising.
8792485	8794987	It would have been neat, but it's not the end of the world.
8795027	8798329	I mean, it's still going to be a really good service for the PC, so...
8799509	8806091	I still think I'm right on the Half-Life 3 thing, though, so that means there's not going to be Half-Life 3 until this Steam Box is ready, years and years away.
8806791	8807992	All right, maybe I'm trolling a little bit.
8809592	8812213	I'm not trolling as much as Adidas is, though.
8812573	8814194	Yeah, you know Adidas, the sporting company?
8814294	8817995	I know we don't talk about them a lot with games, but THQ has been sued.
8818815	8819656	I believe it's my coach.
8844955	8851506	MyCoach247 got canned.
8852087	8858256	THQ told Adidas in December that it would not be able to present the product and developers who were working on the project were laid off.
8859136	8861378	So maybe this was one of those things.
8861478	8862859	We heard about the layoffs of THQ.
8862919	8864680	This was one of those things that was affected.
8865240	8866201	And Adidas isn't happy.
8867002	8869884	So they won $10.6 million in damages.
8870164	8875868	It's all scary similar to that Beyonce lawsuit we heard about where they got sued over the canceled Beyonce game.
8876248	8876648	Remember that?
8876869	8877629	Anyway, that wasn't THQ.
8877689	8878170	It was somebody else.
8878210	8883753	But anyway, THQ is refusing to turn over the publishing materials to an alternative developer.
8884234	8886896	That's probably not good if that's true.
8887476	8887916	Allegedly.
8887976	8888657	It's all allegedly.
8890194	8895316	Adidas is seeking an injunction preventing THQ from selling or transferring the rights to another company.
8896957	8900378	So maybe this was something they were trying to sell off to get some of the money back.
8900439	8904820	But nope, Adidas won't have it, and they're going to have to duke this out in a court of law.
8904880	8906001	Hopefully, Judge Judy.
8908442	8909162	But probably not.
8909723	8911083	It'll get settled, as they always do.
8912204	8913784	All right, DarkSakura, we need something better.
8913804	8915085	We need some more warm, fuzzy news.
8917727	8922091	No, I'm all for like... Okay, how about Samurai Yeti and Ninja Werewolves?
8923392	8928918	There's a teacher, whose name is Ben Bertoli, he's a 6th grade teacher, who turned his classroom into an MMO.
8930339	8944104	Basically, he set up an experience system and achievements for doing certain things in conjunction with his class, even giving out extra experience for when people turned in extra credit essays and stuff.
8945985	8951947	The students are actually helping him remember to keep track of everyone's experience on a tracking board.
8952387	8953328	Don't talk about Class Realm.
8976900	8978001	is completely voluntary.
8978761	8980362	XP is the backbone of Class Realm.
8980422	8982723	Every 10 XP you earn pushes you to the next level.
8982803	8983943	Everyone starts off at level one.
8984804	8998891	XP can be obtained by doing simple things as answering questions, joining in class discussion, working hard on an assignment, helping others, participation, random encounter Friday, and gaining achievements.
8999211	9003053	Random encounter Friday is when he lets a wild boar loose in the classroom.
9005070	9008171	4.
9005450	9008171	Achievements are gained by completing specific tasks.
9009771	9016013	For example, a student can obtain Bookworm by reading two unassigned chapter books and explaining the plot and characters to me.
9017434	9020174	Each achievement has four levels, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Master.
9020895	9022775	Each level is harder to reach than the one before it.
9023395	9024576	Boys are pitted against girls.
9025376	9032258	The gender that can acquire the most achievements by the end of the year will earn extra recess and an ice cream party during lunch.
9034389	9051275	each Friday is random here's the secret because it's the sixth grade everybody will win the ice cream party so you don't even have to try because that's how these things work hush everyone who wants to battle will put their name in a hat I will draw out two names and they will battle students will be asked a question oh my god it's battle royale shut up
9052135	9081239	I will repeat the question twice and start battle music The first to write the correct answer on the board and put their hands up will win XP You can only answer once Question subjects are chosen at random Students may join in alliances of up to six classroom citizens The alliance with the highest combined level at the end of the year wins a pizza party All info except for the current amount of XP each student has will be listed online and in the classroom for students and parents to see
9082867	9085148	Well, apparently, it's been a big hit.
9086008	9092689	And everyone's been super enthusiastic and really trying to participate in it.
9092729	9096370	In fact, there's one he called the Newbery Achievement that's based off the Newbery Medal.
9099071	9101651	It's earned by writing an unassigned five-paragraph essay.
9102451	9105172	And he had 20 essays turned into him in the first week.
9105552	9107992	that are written during students' free time outside of their other work.
9109433	9112833	So apparently this is really popular.
9113394	9114794	The kids like it and they're learning with it.
9115694	9116774	So that's pretty cool.
9118054	9122215	Little Sally, Little Jimmy, you've been called into battle.
9126816	9127896	I don't want to battle!
9130317	9131017	Rob, for real.
9134006	9139390	If it's getting kids to actually participate in school and enjoy learning, I think it's a great thing.
9140391	9141712	In all seriousness, it is.
9142072	9143954	You know I have to fuck with it because that's what I do here.
9144354	9145255	But it is.
9145735	9149938	It's not that dissimilar from stuff even I experienced when I was that age.
9151079	9153920	A long time ago, back when some of our listeners weren't even born.
9154361	9162425	But I remember in the seventh grade, our science teacher used to have these meters that would fill up with time.
9162905	9169568	And as we answered questions correctly or volunteered to do things or do extra work, we would move up the ladder a little bit.
9169588	9171489	When you get to the top, you got a free day.
9172009	9175951	It was like a free day in the class, you know, like no work, no nothing.
9175991	9180893	It was just like, you know, screw off day or study lab or whatever, which, you know, was kind of cool.
9180913	9182233	And it's kind of a similar thing, right?
9182273	9183254	You gain experience.
9183774	9190437	I remember in the fifth grade, we had a whole little like village with its own economy because I remember one thing I did.
9190677	9193918	I ran a shop that rented Nintendo games in my fifth grade class.
9193978	9194438	That's great.
9194478	9201241	And I would rent games to, you know, my classmates for like 10 of the fake bucks that were named after the teacher.
9201801	9203162	So that was like my business.
9203262	9204003	Shroop Bucks.
9205824	9206184	What?
9206845	9207645	Shroop Bucks.
9207745	9209126	No, I just don't, you know, I don't want to.
9209927	9210967	But no, that wasn't the name.
9211047	9212728	But yeah, same idea.
9212849	9214830	But the whole battle thing is just really funny to me.
9215110	9215370	Sorry.
9215430	9216871	I can't help but think of Hunger Games.
9216891	9218612	That's what everybody's all talking about right now.
9218753	9219553	I don't give a crap.
9221835	9221995	So.
9223308	9232912	Well, at any rate, I say good for you, and he's apparently a regular reader and commenter on Kotaku, so the news is just really catching fire.
9232932	9236334	I really hope that it's actually something that he can market for other schools.
9237114	9238635	I see what you did there, catching fire.
9239875	9240275	Never mind.
9241136	9242016	What, don't stand in fire?
9242236	9243617	No, this is the Hunger Games reference.
9243637	9245237	The Hunger Games sequel is catching fire.
9250322	9260810	I don't give a shit about Hunger Games.
9261370	9263412	The only thing I've ever heard of it is the name.
9263952	9264433	That's it.
9264513	9265633	I don't know anything about it.
9265954	9267795	And guess who doesn't want to know anything about it?
9268055	9268696	That would be me.
9269036	9269656	I don't care.
9270217	9270737	End of story.
9271938	9272358	Don't care.
9272659	9273199	They're hungry.
9275020	9277022	It's about a bunch of hippos and they're really hungry.
9281267	9283009	Do you know what that sound is?
9283530	9283730	What?
9283790	9288135	That's my head repeatedly hitting the microphone as I bang it into it.
9293080	9294422	I've successfully derailed the show.
9296535	9302839	Loki, help us get back on track and then we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9304060	9308242	TigerClaw says, I wonder what Rob was like when kids didn't return the Nintendo games on time.
9308582	9309463	Were you mean to them?
9310123	9312185	Nope, just one finger for each day late.
9316887	9317668	This is how we roll.
9318548	9318728	Right.
9322110	9324692	So Tony Hawk, um,
9326209	9327010	He's a little sad.
9327831	9328692	Sad, Tony Hawk.
9330715	9336622	He says that Ride was a bit rushed and that people didn't give it a chance.
9337403	9339986	Really, you should try Tony Hawk's Ride.
9340687	9341448	Give it a chance.
9342048	9345753	Because the game may have been a little rushed and the critics didn't like it.
9347219	9347839	Give it a chance.
9348799	9356841	Of course, that didn't stop them from creating a sequel that I would assume wouldn't have been as rushed because, you know, they would have had a whole year to polish it, but still sucked.
9356901	9360461	So I don't see the logic there, but whatever.
9360601	9361301	You know, it was rushed.
9363382	9374844	He's quoted, I think Ride was a bit rushed for a number of reasons, mostly because probably for about the first half of the development process, it was just figuring out how to make a board and how to make it work.
9376784	9378428	We were in uncharted territory.
9380679	9386462	So the game was a bit rushed, but I still feel critics never really gave it a chance in terms of learning how to play.
9387322	9394746	They got on it, and they went straight into expert mode because supposedly they were expert gamers, and they didn't really learn the mechanics of how the board works.
9395266	9401269	And so I felt like already in their mind, they'd made up their decision before it came out.
9402510	9407212	It was a gimmick, and it was a peripheral and whatnot, and they never really took the time to learn how to play it.
9407392	9408273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9424572	9425553	Thanks for watching!
9449008	9451470	You have no excuses, Tony Hawk.
9451631	9452672	The game sucked.
9452812	9453452	It was terrible.
9453472	9461940	It was a dumb idea because Activision thought, hey, we're going to cash in on all these peripheral games because we made money on DJ Hero.
9463182	9465023	Actually, I think DJ Hero came out around the same time.
9465243	9470388	Well, we made money on Guitar Hero, so we're going to put out this peripheral game because people like peripherals.
9470428	9471890	It makes them more interactive.
9473151	9474112	Yeah, it just didn't work out.
9475253	9475633	Get over it.
9475734	9475974	Get over it.
9497893	9499675	Alright, one more story for you guys.
9499695	9504821	And then we're going to open up the phones at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9505282	9507244	This is about a little bit of resolution.
9507264	9510849	I just reported on some legal troubles in one area, but this is about...
9512273	9515034	Resolution to one lawsuit that was going to happen.
9515594	9517675	This was between Bethesda and Mojang.
9517695	9518835	You might remember this.
9519315	9521516	It was over the name Scrolls.
9522436	9522816	Remember?
9522856	9527878	Bethesda felt that the name Scrolls was infringing on its trademark for Elder Scrolls.
9527918	9529578	And people might get confused.
9530439	9538841	Just like when I reviewed Journey earlier in the show, I had to clarify that it's not the one about the 1980s band, you know, because the games are so similar once you've played them.
9540242	9540762	But anyhow...
9542600	9543521	There were some tweets.
9544302	9546884	I love that official statements come from tweets now.
9547865	9550588	That they have settled with yay heart.
9552540	9554862	The settlement is that we give them the trademark.
9554962	9558765	We get to keep the name and won't make an Elder Scrolls competitor using the name.
9559085	9559885	That's the settlement.
9560226	9562247	Usually you don't get to hear about the details of the settlement.
9562307	9565690	I'm just glad no finance stuff were changed or whatever.
9566831	9578159	They don't get to have a trademark on Scrolls, but Bethesda will leave them alone as long as they don't try to infringe on epic epicness of first-person role-playing games, which I don't think Scrolls was supposed to be.
9580390	9584582	there you go fantastic fantastic
9585379	9594003	All right, so we are going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9594843	9596163	And, oh, we're already getting calls.
9596404	9600225	And, by the way, we will go to the Twitter here, also twitter.com slash OLR.
9600265	9601706	But first we have some calls coming in.
9601766	9602726	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9602746	9603086	Who's this?
9603707	9604547	This is Shane.
9604647	9607468	Hey, Shane, it's my co-host from Horde House.
9607928	9608909	It sure isn't.
9610289	9610769	What do you mean?
9610809	9611270	Yes, you are.
9611310	9611950	You're on that show.
9612597	9613957	Oh yeah, I guess I am sometimes.
9613977	9617598	That's right, except this week you could only talk about Mass Effect, which by the way, screw you.
9618259	9623660	I bought Mass Effect this week, which was kind of like peer pressure in a way, and you do that a lot, and I kind of despise you for it.
9624020	9626481	It's kind of because I blew up your phone about it.
9626701	9628301	You really did, my god.
9629622	9630682	I hope you have unlimited texting.
9630702	9632963	Who is Kaiden, and why is Shane in love with him?
9635393	9635734	What's up?
9635754	9637075	What are you calling in for tonight?
9637456	9640920	I was calling because I want to talk about something I don't normally talk about.
9641000	9641401	What's that?
9643103	9643764	Mass Effect.
9644485	9644906	Of course!
9644946	9646708	I've never heard you talk about Mass Effect before.
9647649	9651154	Are you here to monopolize the show with Mass Effect chat just like you did on Horde House this week?
9651647	9651967	Yes.
9652267	9652608	All right.
9652648	9654249	Well, what's up?
9654469	9658892	I wanted to not talk about the story so much or how awesome the game is.
9659152	9660232	Don't spoil it.
9660573	9662914	Don't talk about that ending that everybody's petitioning.
9662934	9664095	I don't know about the ending yet.
9664175	9665095	I have not beat the game.
9665115	9668177	Did you hear that people are petitioning BioWare to change the ending?
9668217	9669018	It's apparently that bad.
9669514	9672475	Yeah, I'm kind of scared.
9673215	9676575	I don't want it to end so I don't get disappointed.
9677855	9679736	But anyway, that's not what I'm talking about.
9680216	9685137	I'm talking about how much respect I have for BioWare now.
9685697	9685817	Oh?
9686637	9697699	Yes, because this is the first game I have ever played in which I feel like they did not take any stereotypes seriously.
9697979	9713354	and put them into their gay characters not a single one and I think they actually humanized them instead of using them for comic relief or something to just flirt with or hook up with what about Dragon Age?
9713934	9717658	No, Dragon Age is totally terrible with that stuff.
9718759	9720881	Zevran in the first game, especially.
9721602	9730271	But in this game, I feel like they're just normal people who happen to be gay, and I don't see that in games.
9730632	9736378	And it really, really makes me feel like BioWare is a company I should support more often.
9738689	9739109	Interesting.
9739129	9740951	I'm not sure what else I can really say to that.
9741351	9749998	Have you only explored the male-male relationships in that game or have you looked into how it compares to male-female or female-female?
9750578	9761227	Well, and I'm only going to say it's for three because I've seen stuff on one where it was pretty, I think I described it at work, skanky.
9761327	9763949	Well, sometimes relationships are skanky.
9764639	9771364	Yes, but I wanted something more, and this game has given it to me.
9771624	9779549	I've only seen male-male, and actually the one I romance technically isn't gay, but it's just because I couldn't resist his charms.
9780590	9786074	And I won't say who, because that could be a spoiler, I guess, but really, romancing people isn't a spoiler.
9787293	9807147	I found it interesting because I asked you in an email this week when you wouldn't shut up about the game, I asked you what kind of different relationship options were available and it seemed like the people that choose to play FemShep who want to be in a relationship with a male, so an opposite sex relationship but with a female lead, was the most limited.
9807167	9807247	Yeah.
9807907	9809490	Yes, in three at least it is.
9809731	9819471	I found that to be kind of sad because, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of ladies out there that would like to romance some men in their games and they don't really get that option in this game.
9819887	9824631	No, they get to romance ice cream tubs now instead because they're sad.
9824991	9825932	That is very sad.
9827193	9828074	Well, maybe DLC.
9828134	9828875	I guess you never know.
9828915	9831577	Is there a possibility they're going to add more romance options in later on?
9832398	9832858	I don't know.
9834960	9840104	I wouldn't imagine so because the first DLC character is...
9841065	9845028	Not Romanceable, to my knowledge, and it'd be really awkward if they were.
9846990	9847930	But you never know.
9848011	9848811	It's Bioware.
9848871	9852514	They can do whatever they want and do it right, apparently.
9853635	9858619	But also, that game's amazing, and I have cried three times during it so far now.
9859019	9859499	Three.
9860060	9862562	It has beaten the previous game's record.
9863643	9864984	What was the previous game before that?
9865644	9866525	Suikoden II.
9867105	9867806	That was twice.
9867826	9868166	Twice.
9868641	9874505	So just to kind of go back to the main point of the call, because, you know, to wrap up soon and all that, why is this so important to you?
9875486	9877967	Because it's something I can relate to.
9878508	9883851	Like, I don't want to relate to, like, the skanky options that people would have before.
9885873	9890936	I want, you know, a really nice story, and that's what I'm getting.
9892017	9897821	What would you say to people who say, why does Bioware have to put gay stuff in every game?
9899462	9901967	Because they want to give more options to everybody.
9904831	9905673	That is what I would say.
9905833	9907976	Oh my god, did somebody get shot in the background?
9908397	9910420	No, that is a washer being...
9913809	9915470	Somebody just shot you for your opinion.
9915490	9916391	That's really unfortunate.
9916411	9917612	What a hideous place we live in.
9918572	9918832	Are you okay?
9918872	9919373	Are you still there?
9920293	9920914	Yeah, I'm still here.
9920974	9923375	I'm just trying to do another conversation at the same time.
9923696	9924676	That works out great.
9925937	9926578	Well, I guess, yeah.
9926638	9937445	I mean, one thing I've sensed, even just from playing the first game before, not even talking about relationships or whatever, is that I do notice there's so many options in the conversation and so forth to play the game in many different ways.
9937745	9939926	And it's something I kind of noticed in Star Wars, too.
9940907	9943549	Although in Star Wars, the paths were very well lit.
9944969	9947550	Yeah, that's another thing.
9948831	9951932	I'm glad you kind of said something about the choices and the paths.
9952772	9965617	The one I took with the character I romanced in 3 for Mass Effect, it wasn't like we were having a normal dialogue conversation, then bam, here's a hook up with you option or a not hook up with you option.
9965637	9968658	It was something that just kind of evolved naturally.
9968818	9972179	And it actually kind of came out of nowhere in my opinion, but not in like a...
9975239	9975700	You alright?
9976300	9976761	He cut out.
9977561	9978162	Oh no, I'm back.
9978202	9981265	Sorry, I hit the wrong button.
9981425	9981946	It was nice.
9982006	9987091	It just kind of went natural, and I didn't have to pick skanky stuff to get there.
9987271	9994639	That's one thing that some people, I guess, might misinterpret, is that there's not the option, like, you know, it isn't on the menu, like...
9996240	9997341	What should we do now?
9997761	10005224	Oh, well, let's go kill aliens, or let's do research on the next mission, or let's go upstairs and fuck like rabbits.
10005744	10006845	It's not like how it plays out.
10008402	10009663	No, it's nothing like that at all.
10009743	10014147	It's like, I'm not, okay, gotta try to do this not spoilery and kind of be general.
10014727	10024695	Something happens that's major, and then, well, if you've played Mass Effect, you can do missions, and then one of your home base of operations is the Citadel.
10024735	10025596	That's not a spoiler.
10025636	10026557	It's always around.
10027758	10042706	So you do some missions and then something happens and then you can, you know, run around the Citadel and we just happen to have a friendly lunch conversation that turned into us going out all of a sudden in a really, really nicely written scene.
10043806	10071465	and what's cool about that too is the actual gay guy in the game I was doing some conversations with him and he said something about looking at some eye candy and one of my options were no I'm interested in women and the other one was like well what about me and I picked up well what about me because I didn't want to screw up what I had already done and he's like well yeah of course I'm looking at you but I know you're with so and so so it's like oh crap the game actually knows the choices I've made and it's like commenting on them
10072607	10073148	Interesting.
10075252	10081605	All right, I guess I'm going to have to hurry up and play one and two so I can see more of this in action in three because one's still kind of basic, but I just started.
10083154	10084956	Alright, we gotta let you go to get more calls.
10085016	10086798	Any other quick thoughts here before we let you go?
10087259	10087839	Nope, nope.
10087960	10099573	Oh, also the multiplayer is really fun, so sadly it's part of the experience to get the best ending from what I understand, but I played it for two hours straight today and had a blast, so I suggest people at least give it a shot.
10100053	10100935	Alright, there you go.
10100995	10101796	Thanks for calling, Shane.
10102336	10102937	Thank you, bye.
10103177	10103357	Bye.
10103797	10103877	Bye.
10128286	10129146	So two questions there.
10129186	10131987	How do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show?
10132487	10133688	That question was asked a couple days ago.
10133728	10134108	Coffee.
10134928	10136049	I've been thinking about that question.
10136489	10137849	I honestly don't know if I have an answer.
10138169	10140350	I don't know what keeps me motivated to do this show.
10141610	10142751	The people, obviously.
10143111	10147032	Seeing you guys come out and chat and support what we're doing here is a huge motivator.
10147372	10154374	Getting to hang with Matt and Jamie and knowing that we're creating this thing on the internet that even if it's just two or three people that enjoy it, people are enjoying it.
10154454	10154815	Coffee.
10154935	10155875	That's a huge motivator.
10156315	10156696	Pinkberry.
10157056	10157457	Pinkberry.
10157737	10158378	Coffee, Pinkberry.
10158598	10160761	Are both very big motivators, certainly.
10160881	10161562	And my own ego.
10162423	10164366	And like the phone line is lighting up right now.
10164666	10165007	Look at that.
10165087	10167590	My screen is like full of like rings right now.
10167630	10168511	So that's a huge motivator as well.
10168531	10169953	And they're all names I recognize.
10170073	10170353	All right.
10171134	10173017	Let's go to another call and see who's on the line.
10173057	10173858	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10173878	10174178	Who's this?
10174892	10175472	Hey, what's up?
10175492	10176133	This is X-Link.
10176193	10177934	Hey, how you doing?
10177954	10178834	Hey, doing well.
10178934	10179394	Long time.
10179594	10180695	I know, it has been a while.
10181616	10182156	Yeah, I know.
10182636	10186938	Hey, it's just kind of ironic, not to talk about Mass Effect 3, because I haven't played it myself.
10187018	10188139	I did play the first two.
10188379	10196363	I just love how they did do the stuff, though, from the choices you make in your first game can affect a lot of outcomes in the second game.
10198826	10202832	and how I supposedly guess how the stuff in the first and second can also impact the third.
10202872	10206858	I like how they added that kind of like a continuous storyline.
10206918	10213548	So it's not like you're replaying something over and over and over again that's brand new for a three-part series.
10213648	10215030	I kind of like the fact that how
10216354	10220637	Everything can have a pro or con effect to something else within the game.
10220858	10226742	That's the entire reason I started with 1, because I will tell you, I was tempted to just jump ahead to 3, but I didn't.
10227383	10234168	Also, it's really cool to know the fact that they took the inventory system and made it better and more flowed and more easy.
10234589	10236410	Thank God, because in 1, it's a bit of a nightmare.
10236430	10239873	From 1 to 2, because 1 and 2 is so night and day, and the controlling was too.
10240633	10244477	I played 1, and then there was a big gap between me playing 1 and Part 2.
10244577	10244937	I'm like,
10245953	10246774	Am I doing this right?
10246974	10247835	Is this the right way?
10247855	10251079	Why does this feel like it's changed so much?
10251600	10253502	It's kind of weird, but you get used to it.
10254103	10256105	It's not too much, though, within the game.
10256526	10257707	So what else have you been playing lately?
10258608	10261072	Because you're not playing Mass Effect 3, but what are you playing these days?
10261832	10262193	Well...
10263422	10265704	Other than WoW, L.A.
10266124	10267925	North.
10268486	10271788	You know me, I'm a human whore.
10272488	10276231	I'm also such as for the Xbox, so right now I'm like
10276803	10281027	My gamer ADD is so bad, I have only ever got every single possible achievement in one game.
10281627	10284690	For my first one, my first one was Assassin's Creed.
10302766	10330260	and that was a bitch mine you would never guess my perfect achievement game the only one is Rally-X on Xbox Live Arcade new Rally-X the remake because I used to legit love that game back in the day when I was a kid and so I'm pretty decent at it but yeah that's the only one yeah I thought my second one was going to be Uno but yeah some people can really mess you up in that game so still to this day so that's kind of intriguing so hmm
10332164	10334265	Play Rusty Hearts 2, which is an awesome game.
10334305	10341186	If you like WoW, I strongly suggest joining up with me whenever you see me on Steam, Rob, because we're friends.
10341266	10342386	Play some Rusty Hearts with me, man.
10342406	10343306	You'll like it, trust me.
10344786	10347447	Is this a free game, or is this like a pay one, or what?
10347527	10347907	Yes, it is.
10348047	10348527	No, no, no.
10348587	10349227	Free to play.
10349427	10350427	It's absolutely awesome.
10350467	10353948	You can actually, believe it or not, I made my own little guild within the game.
10354548	10356468	That's how cool this thing is.
10358029	10360309	It's pretty much sky's the limit, and it's like
10361925	10362926	How do you explain it?
10362966	10374595	It's like WoW type, but also it's like when you're running through the dungeons, it's more feeling like a first-person scroll, like you're going from room to room kind of like, and you're being off on stuff.
10374615	10377417	But the way, if you see him being played, it's really cool, so...
10379750	10380090	All right.
10380590	10384091	Well, X-Link, any other quick shout-outs you want to get out before we get more calls?
10384611	10392793	Not really at this moment, but also they need to quit putting the disc DLC within the disc and stuff and then charging double the money for that of the game.
10393073	10394313	That's getting ridiculous.
10394473	10396134	They really need to quit on that.
10396234	10399834	I understand they're trying to make some extra money, but it's really seriously getting out of hand.
10399854	10401635	I agree with a lot of people on that subject.
10401915	10402695	It's gone too far.
10402975	10403215	All right.
10403675	10403995	Excellent.
10404015	10404695	You take care, buddy.
10404735	10405976	Enjoy the various games.
10406076	10408717	And one of these days I'll catch up in Mass Effect.
10409337	10410077	Yeah, absolutely.
10410117	10410957	Quit playing Tying Tower.
10410977	10411377	Do so.
10411457	10411937	You'll love it.
10412338	10412778	I'll try.
10413018	10415898	But Alan makes me check on my tower.
10416999	10418139	And I'm like, I don't want to play.
10418219	10420040	He's like, show me the people in your tower.
10420100	10421020	Show me the people in your tower.
10421480	10423400	Probably said that way you can play Mass Effect.
10423581	10427682	And then soon if, you know, what was said earlier.
10427782	10428922	Did we get to that earlier?
10430663	10431884	I thought we were going to talk about that.
10432684	10434645	I missed half of your show, unfortunately.
10434985	10439207	I'm running Dragon's Soul with my new guild, unfortunately.
10439227	10440847	The guild master put me in charge of it.
10440867	10441948	He's like, oh, here you go.
10442268	10443088	You're running this team.
10443128	10445029	And I'm like, uh, okay.
10445189	10446630	And you're running it in the weekends.
10446650	10448470	And I'm like, oh, gravy.
10448530	10450851	Yeah, I got to lead a raid this week.
10450871	10452992	And we're going to talk all about it on Horde House this week.
10453312	10453732	Good times.
10453772	10454473	Sounds awesome.
10454593	10455673	We should swap notes.
10455753	10456233	Alright, man.
10456253	10456854	I'll talk to you later.
10457654	10474518	I haven't done a raid since everyone stopped playing on our server I'm sorry, I just went where there was a lot of people I picked based on the times, it was all the times They were like, we raid this and this day from this and this time I'm like, great, that works for my schedule, let's do it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10475998	10478659	Hi, this is Actdeft Hey, Actdeft, how you doing?
10480079	10482420	Pretty fine, pretty good What's on your mind, buddy?
10483973	10492079	Well, I know Jamie is already tired about the Sonic CD soundtrack thing, but... She's gonna go to the bathroom, I'll be back when you're done.
10492339	10493400	Let him have his voice.
10493540	10494380	No, okay, go ahead.
10495601	10495841	Go ahead.
10495941	10508370	Okay, I like both soundtracks, both the Japanese and the American one, but the best Sonic game soundtrack is Sonic 3 and Knuckles.
10509352	10509552	Yes.
10510693	10511314	Yes, totally.
10511474	10512976	Oh my god, finally.
10513156	10517080	It's like you are the peace convention calling into the show.
10518381	10520423	Especially ice cap level, am I right?
10521685	10522045	Oh yeah.
10522185	10523647	Even I can sign on to that.
10524901	10545127	Sonic CD, Japanese, American, they both suck compared to Sonic 3 Ice Cap, Ice Cap Music, so much the best Finally, a peace treaty has been negotiated Now we just need to get Bobby to sign, alright Yeah, we need to We'll see, we'll see Well, what else is on your mind?
10545147	10547188	What have you been playing lately?
10548808	10552149	Mostly Team Fortress 2 and Beat Hazard.
10553110	10554150	Oh yeah, Beat Hazard.
10554450	10555790	They just ported that to iPhone.
10555810	10556771	I have yet to play it though.
10558631	10562012	They need to port it to Android so I can play it there too.
10564153	10565733	I play a lot of Beat Hazard.
10567234	10569134	I think I'm at level 340 right now.
10569614	10569734	Dang.
10573484	10574324	Yeah, that's a lot.
10574464	10578986	And I'm not even on the top of the leaderboard, so yeah.
10580646	10581186	Nice.
10582687	10584408	What are some good songs to play?
10584428	10586668	Because, you know, Beat Hazard, you get to do your own soundtrack.
10587128	10588389	So what are some good songs?
10588509	10590569	What are some of your favorite songs to play in Beat Hazard?
10592210	10601133	Mostly, I'm going to go by genre, electronic music, trance, lots of music with heavy bass.
10603197	10609282	It gets you lots of points, and it's pretty fun to play, especially on suicide mode.
10609982	10610723	Lots of enemies.
10611443	10621111	Well, I would offer to play you sometime, but you probably would absolutely kill me, because I had some problems with some of those achievements for the holiday event, and it was pretty sad.
10621752	10628577	All right, anyhow, Actdeft, I'm going to wrap up to let you go and get more calls, but I leave you with the official Peace Treaty music of OLR.
10632608	10632908	There you go.
10632928	10634849	We're going to jam to this while we wait for our next call.
10635770	10636110	Awesome.
10636330	10636650	All right.
10636930	10637510	Take care, buddy.
10638351	10638751	You too.
10638831	10639031	All right.
10639051	10639311	Bye.
10642092	10642713	Good times.
10643933	10644274	Just kidding.
10644294	10646455	I can only play a clip because, you know, copyright and all that stuff.
10646815	10647575	All right.
10647595	10650556	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10650597	10654939	Going back to the Rob D question from earlier, how do you guys stay motivated each week to do a show?
10657580	10660101	You know, obviously, a lot of it is the people.
10660221	10662022	And I don't know if I have an easy answer for it.
10662062	10664102	You just kind of have to make it a priority.
10664502	10668964	Because if you allow yourself to be like, oh, but the Amazing Race is on tonight.
10668984	10670624	And I really would just rather watch that instead.
10670664	10672245	Then it's going to kind of fall apart.
10672325	10677507	I think all of us have just kind of made a commitment like, we're going to do OLR no matter what.
10677867	10681288	Now, of course, there's going to be some things that are more important.
10681790	10684452	And sometimes it's just because we need a break, like Disneyland.
10684552	10686153	Is Disneyland more important than OLR?
10686293	10686553	Yes.
10686853	10689295	Well, yes and no.
10689755	10690436	You know what I mean, though?
10690496	10692617	If we did it every week, then why would we do OLR?
10692677	10693878	But anyhow.
10694958	10695999	The other half of the question, real quick.
10696359	10699281	Have you ever thought of doing pre-recorded segments on a regular basis?
10699661	10700682	Yes, it's called Horde House.
10701903	10704945	And Jamie had one for a while, too, and maybe she'll have something new in the future.
10705425	10707106	As far as pre-recorded segments for the show...
10708891	10712352	I don't know if that's a suggestion, but I'm always open to ideas.
10713653	10718535	There was, I will admit this, there was a time where we were talking about doing not break music in the middle, but something else.
10719055	10721636	So you never know what might happen here at OLR.
10722176	10723036	We got another call coming in.
10723056	10723576	Let's go to it.
10723616	10724457	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10724477	10724797	Who's this?
10725337	10725957	It's Ranma.
10726057	10726558	Hey, Ranma.
10726578	10727078	What's up, buddy?
10727658	10728418	Not too much.
10729399	10734000	I do have a couple things I want to discuss, but Ranma, yet again, I have a bone to pick with you.
10734280	10734541	Me?
10735201	10735661	Yeah, you.
10735741	10736041	Me?
10736641	10737162	Yeah, you.
10737182	10737902	What do I do now?
10738662	10750914	Alright, I missed part of the show, so before I go charging at you with guns blazing, what is this comparison to hipsters and video games, something like that?
10751235	10752876	Could you kind of explain that to me?
10753357	10755519	Oh, I don't even know, what the hell was that about now?
10757850	10759411	I can't remember what happened two hours ago.
10759431	10760112	I'm getting old for this.
10760212	10774862	It was about comparing – because they were saying that, well, a console without a disk drive would sell well because the – was it the iPad or – not the iPad, one of the MacBook Airs or whatever.
10774882	10778345	Oh, yeah, and you said everybody that owned an iPad was a hipster.
10778605	10780426	So you need to go at Loki, not at me.
10780626	10781167	Well, no, I –
10783136	10784838	Oh lord, passing the buck, huh?
10785718	10786759	That's what I do best.
10786939	10790502	No, I'm saying the people that buy MacBooks are hipsters.
10791243	10793345	Or at least MacBook Airs.
10793665	10796908	Because I've got the thinnest book ever.
10797288	10798609	Great.
10798809	10799830	Are you a hipster, Ranma?
10800871	10806516	No, but I live 20 minutes away from Williamsburg, the East Coast central point for hipsters.
10806796	10808197	Yes, this is very true.
10808738	10808978	Yeah.
10810163	10811743	I don't hate hipsters.
10811923	10812703	I just hate the hip.
10812723	10812983	You should.
10813584	10814144	I'm just kidding.
10815464	10816084	I love everybody.
10816104	10816464	But, Rob.
10816824	10817044	What?
10817304	10820365	Really, the Fairchild Channel F is underappreciated.
10820445	10821465	And I got mine at Whole Foods.
10821485	10822405	It's totally the pinnacle.
10822525	10823285	And it's gluten-free.
10824806	10825786	You go to Whole Foods?
10825806	10826766	No, I don't go to Whole Foods.
10826786	10829806	I was going to farmer's markets way before there was a Whole Foods.
10829886	10830727	Don't get me started.
10830747	10832187	I only like partial foods.
10833907	10834207	All right.
10834227	10837648	Did you just call in to start shit, or do you have something gaming-related to talk about?
10837708	10838608	No, no, no.
10838708	10839088	Oh, no.
10839188	10839508	Double thing.
10839868	10840468	Thank you for watching!
10861713	10881674	and then I'll name the characters Poop, Fart, Lol you know I used to rent Final Fantasy 3 like every time same game every time I went in one day to rent it someone came in like right before me bought the copy with my save on it oh ouch yeah
10884456	10887218	Actdeft in chat says, isn't Seattle hipster central?
10888039	10891822	No, go to Netflix and watch a show called Portlandia.
10892182	10893003	That's all I'm going to say.
10894084	10895305	It's totally true.
10898107	10898708	All right, anyhow.
10901730	10906394	And the last thing I called about was, I know that you're a big fan of Kid Icarus, right?
10906554	10907195	Yeah, I like it.
10907995	10909857	Have you seen the anime trailer?
10911229	10919735	You posted that to my Facebook and I forgot to look because I got distracted because somebody else had posted the new Garbage single and I was like, well, what do I like more?
10920116	10921777	Kid Icarus or Garbage, the band?
10922397	10923338	And Garbage won.
10923958	10924959	So let me look at it now.
10925019	10928162	This is what you posted here the other day from your website?
10928922	10929803	You didn't post me.
10931468	10933489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10959793	10989138	no um I my roommate who has a 3DS told me I need to check out Nintendo Video more so last night I went to check it out and it was too um many episodes I watched I had no idea it was on there I once went in there and saw I think a Kirby anime was in there but I haven't seen the Kid Icarus one yet no I'm gonna totally go look at that yes and uh Jamie I think you'll like the people who did the Kid Icarus videos oh uh Studio IG nice yes hmm alright
10989844	10992011	Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10992352	10993276	But any other quick thoughts?
10994480	10995182	Stay fabulous.
10995785	10996265	Oh, I will.
10996606	10997206	All right, bye.
10997927	10998227	Bye.
10999067	11000548	Thank you guys so much for calling in tonight.
11000728	11003130	Our phones were lit up tonight, so some of you didn't get through.
11003210	11009475	I'm so sorry, but send an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and DarkSakura will read your thoughts next week.
11009515	11013337	But we have got to wrap up, and I've still got some tweets to go here before we wrap up.
11013757	11015479	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
11015499	11016539	There's still several tweets.
11016700	11019361	Damn it, I closed the tweet window to bring up that Kid Icarus story.
11024486	11026568	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
11026608	11027769	There we go with the Disney stuff again.
11028129	11028429	All right.
11029590	11031632	We got a tweet from TechColor.
11032273	11035816	Tweets us and says, do all of you really hate Minecraft?
11036297	11038639	It's actually quite fun for like 10 minutes.
11039560	11039800	Okay.
11041491	11042672	Hate is a strong word.
11042752	11052899	I do not hate Minecraft because saying I hate Minecraft means I think that people that play Minecraft are not smart and that's not the case at all.
11052999	11055201	I get why people like Minecraft.
11055821	11057002	It's not really for me.
11057322	11059023	I cannot like the game.
11059303	11065044	I don't really, keep in mind, I don't ever really like to use hate because I think it's a very strong word and a wasteful emotion.
11066024	11070186	But you cannot like a game and not give a crap about who plays it, you know.
11070626	11072146	If other people like it, that's their thing.
11072586	11074447	But you can completely loathe the game.
11075767	11078370	You know, it doesn't mean that you think anyone else that plays it is stupid.
11078890	11083095	You can say like, I hate Minecraft players, then that's, you know.
11083315	11085617	Hate is a word reserved for like doing my taxes.
11085677	11086918	I thought I was really boring.
11087879	11088460	I was bored.
11088820	11090462	But I love watching Minecraft videos.
11091338	11092178	I'll give you that.
11092699	11094979	I like watching the people that are really into it online.
11095099	11097460	Alan watches a lot of these and some of them are pretty funny.
11097580	11105882	But my mind when it comes to that, I have this big open palette and just do something with it before the goblins tear you up.
11106002	11108003	It's weird.
11108183	11108863	I don't know what to do.
11111004	11117846	I was kind of thinking about trying it again with the high definition textures.
11119033	11121795	I will say I did really try to do Terraria though.
11122116	11122756	I couldn't get into it.
11123016	11123637	I tried it too.
11124137	11125038	You sent me that copy.
11125118	11125458	I did.
11125679	11127620	I even got like a four pack and sent it to my friends.
11127840	11128101	And I tried.
11128121	11129141	None of us could get into it.
11129302	11129722	I tried.
11130943	11136447	It was too, like there just needed to be more structure to kind of like, I needed a little bit of handling.
11136487	11139470	I'm the type of person that wouldn't play Minecraft the way it was supposed to be.
11139590	11142372	I would turn off the enemies and just build shit all day.
11143373	11144094	That's what I would do.
11144554	11145155	You can do that.
11145335	11147497	I like this comment from DKPopMan in the chat.
11147617	11150260	I would think DarkSakura would like it from an artistic standpoint.
11151601	11153583	I'm not really an artist, but you are a designer.
11153603	11156526	Yeah, but the thing is, I have The Sims.
11158008	11160070	I see, so you kind of just have a different outlet for it.
11160572	11162252	and I don't really play the Sims anymore either.
11163172	11169194	I mean, usually if I'm sitting down to do design, I've got InDesign open and I'm making something that I'm going to print.
11170294	11171774	Or putting something in my portfolio.
11172474	11178855	I'm not trying to poo-poo on Minecraft at all, it's just I really couldn't get into it.
11178995	11186957	I might try it again, but to be honest I'm still trying to find a job right now and I don't have the time to devote to anything else that's distracting me.
11188937	11208855	But yet you're still here at this show Yeah, I've been here for 10 years I can't quit now Alright, Tiger Claw says there's a couple news tweets here I want to read Hold on, because I have to do this for something else coming up Okay Going to Tiger Claw, a couple tweets here Minnesota lawmakers seek to ban community broadband What?
11209255	11211117	The title alone, that seems a little silly here
11211637	11226248	I'll leave you the story from GamePolitics.com Minnesota would do legislation meant to forbid community broadband projects joining states like Georgia and North Carolina HF2695 bars any community from building a broadband network within the state
11228351	11240797	Meanwhile, the companies that provide broadband in the state are refusing to expand their networks to underserved and unserved areas within the state.
11240977	11243258	Remember, I don't get to see these in advance because they're Twitter topics.
11243918	11244739	They come in during the show.
11246461	11261521	a trade group representing the industry in the state claims they are not behind the bill before lawmakers activists have their doubts why would this be why would you ban that I don't like I'm not seeing the other side of this what's the good and it sounds like other states have already done this why would you ban it
11264833	11271657	A recent post on a community action group called Stop the Cap revealed that Georgia's bill has been effectively shelved by being turned into what is called a study bill.
11271717	11272818	Okay, so it didn't pass in Georgia.
11273378	11279902	If you're a citizen of one of the many towns not served by a broadband service provider, it would probably be in your best interest to ask your state representative not to vote for this bill.
11280262	11281403	What's the pros about this?
11281423	11282203	I'm not seeing anything.
11282423	11284624	Can anyone think of what a pro would be about this bill?
11284945	11286145	Why would this bill be necessary?
11286225	11290448	Is it that they don't want... I mean, I thought competition was okay.
11292150	11293671	Chatters, help me out, because I'm not thinking of it.
11293691	11299334	Maybe it's the cable providers or whatever, like, saying, hey, why are you giving away free broadband?
11299434	11303296	That makes our expensive broadband look less wonderful.
11305658	11306038	I don't know.
11306078	11309260	I don't really see... I don't even really see a point to this, but...
11311195	11312035	I know, I don't get it either.
11312055	11316396	I'm really waiting to see if somebody in chat can kind of jump in here.
11317337	11317857	Don't steal.
11317877	11319117	The government hates competition.
11320278	11321018	All right.
11321078	11321418	Let's see.
11321478	11322798	Another tweet from Tigerclaw here.
11323559	11327800	Fraud claim dismissed in ex-Infinity Ward heads versus Activision lawsuit.
11328120	11328260	Oh.
11329160	11339669	A state superior court judge dismissed one of the fraud claims by ex-Infinity Ward heads Jason West and Vince Zampella against their former employer, Activision Blizzard.
11339970	11342812	They originally filed a lawsuit citing breach of contract.
11343233	11352340	They added two counts of fraud to that, saying Activision never intended to honor their contract, but the judge dismissed one of the counts.
11353141	11355462	agreeing with Activision that the claim should not go forward.
11355502	11364564	However, there is still another claim of promissory fraud, and that will be on a trial starting May 7th.
11365244	11368225	So one count's been thrown out, but there's still plenty of other counts to go.
11369965	11371865	And the chatters say, we're all as stumped as you.
11373866	11374966	Good, good thought.
11375326	11381888	All right, let's go to a tweet from 101DKPopMan tweets us, tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1.
11384284	11385264	I don't know how to answer this.
11386525	11387765	I don't know enough about the game.
11388145	11388725	But you know what?
11388966	11392747	I do know an expert that we could go to to answer this question.
11392867	11394607	So let's get them back on the line here.
11396488	11397128	If they answer.
11398769	11399529	Hi, Shane?
11400349	11400689	Yes.
11400789	11403970	Okay, I had to call you back because we have a tweet that I can't answer.
11404110	11404671	I need your help.
11405331	11405431	Okay.
11405471	11407131	Okay, because I know you can answer this.
11408072	11411733	101DKPopMan sent us a tweet saying, tell me why I should get Mass Effect 1.
11413581	11439739	because you if you want the full story which you really really do if you're interested in Mass Effect it is good to have one because I did say that you could just get the Genesis comic but no you need to play through one so you get the entire freaking story for this amazing trilogy jank inventory system and all yes because you only have to put up with it for one game
11441783	11442764	How long is the game?
11442904	11443884	How long is Mass Effect 1?
11445346	11470486	I will say that I've only done one playthrough of it and I didn't do hardly any side missions I think I did it in about 10 hours Oh wow, that's a lot shorter than I thought it would be I just ran through it Conversely, Mass Effect 2 I did everything I could minus two DLCs and I did that in about 25 and I'm already past 20 hours on Mass Effect 3 Wow
11471519	11472341	Alright, well, there you go.
11472541	11473203	That's all I wanted.
11474165	11474546	Alright.
11474706	11475568	Alright, bye.
11477513	11478315	From the expert.
11478796	11479999	Alright, one more tweet.
11483021	11486783	Beware, Dyson, this vacuum actually hungers and lives.
11487303	11491085	Yes, someone made a Sinistar Roomba vacuum cleaner.
11491365	11495367	You remember Sinistar, the game that would say, Beware, I live.
11496088	11500790	Well, it looks like somebody has made a Roomba out of that, and I'm linked to a YouTube here I've never seen before.
11501150	11501891	Oh, Lord.
11505773	11509435	It actually has a sticker on it that looks like the Sinistar.
11511596	11512176	That is great.
11512196	11514998	Oh my god, that sounds like an airplane jet about ready to take off.
11517600	11519061	It certainly does suck.
11520361	11524304	Oh, I get it, because it's a vacuum.
11524324	11527426	Okay, that's a horrible noise to be playing on the podcast, so I apologize.
11527466	11528226	But did you hear that?
11528246	11529307	Beware, I live.
11529387	11530768	Beware, I live.
11531208	11532208	Alright, that's it for tweets.
11532249	11534510	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send some in for next week.
11534530	11537832	It'd be funnier if you could do either the Space Corps or Wheatley.
11538592	11540393	Alright, last minute stories.
11540433	11541294	Loki, anything?
11542651	11542831	No?
11544092	11549634	I wanted to play the Portal Mario game thing, which the more I read about it, it looks even cooler.
11549734	11550634	We talked about that last week.
11550734	11550954	I know.
11551054	11551974	So play it for next week.
11552295	11553115	I want a full review.
11553655	11558557	Well, I found out the download that I had done wasn't correct, so I had to redownload it.
11558917	11559177	All right.
11559598	11559878	All right.
11560839	11561259	That's it.
11561319	11562460	We're at three hours plus.
11562620	11563461	We need to wrap up the show.
11563481	11564702	We've had a lot of long shows lately.
11564822	11565823	We're just very opinionated.
11566724	11569446	So we're going to go around to everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up tonight.
11570206	11572048	Final thoughts from me.
11572088	11572789	I'll start tonight.
11572849	11575891	My final thought is just thank you, chatters.
11576231	11578854	And thank you, podcasters who download our show and listen to us.
11578874	11579514	Like, I really mean it.
11579554	11581216	Like, I know I always say it at the end of each show.
11581596	11584438	But just kind of like thinking about the motivation question and all that stuff.
11584498	11586540	Like, you guys really are a big part of it.
11587060	11587301	Like...
11588241	11604009	I know we were still doing a show back when literally there were three people in chat and we still had fun with it and I'd like to think that I would still have fun with it even if it was only one or two people but the fact that more and more people show up and the family is growing and all that is a huge motivator.
11604329	11605149	It's huge.
11605690	11606270	So thank you.
11606570	11606930	I mean it.
11607951	11608751	Loki, your final thought.
11610871	11614592	Making a Grand Theft Auto map editor in Excel is difficult.
11615032	11628096	And probably not the preferred language, or it's not even really a programming language, but the preferred method to do such thing, but programming languages seem to make my head explode, so this is what I'm comfortable with.
11628676	11631338	I'm not sure I even want to know what you're up to over there, to be honest.
11632339	11636682	I'm making an Excel file that will direct... You don't say!
11637162	11638443	Yes, I don't say.
11638744	11647110	That will directly translate the hex code from a map file from Grand Theft Auto into edible form and then back into hex code again.
11647490	11655056	So you can directly import it because the program that someone made did a lot of rounding with numbers and it really fucks everything up.
11655376	11657097	And their program's terribly broken.
11658299	11658599	Alright.
11659280	11660782	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11664889	11665330	That's it?
11667453	11667794	Alright.
11668835	11670057	Stupid daylight savings.
11671099	11671820	Do you want another coffee?
11673263	11676347	I would be very... Alright, that's gonna do it guys.
11676467	11679090	Now here's the line I give you at the end of every show but it's for a reason.
11679150	11681974	Thank you guys as always for tuning in and listening to our show.
11682034	11683535	Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11683836	11684677	It is a free show.
11684737	11685778	We don't have commercials.
11686018	11687941	We're not paid for those food plugs in the beginning.
11688001	11688702	I swear, I swear.
11689102	11689922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11714414	11716556	or, you know, of course, Five Star Reviews and iTunes.
11717416	11718857	Votes and Podcast Alley even.
11718877	11719958	This was brought up last week.
11720238	11723720	We appreciate each and every single way you guys spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.
11724141	11727223	That, my friends, is a huge, huge motivator.
11727523	11735828	And I think I'm motivated to do it all again next week with my co-hosts DarkSakura and Loki for episode 450 of Orange Lounge Radio.
11736509	11741372	We don't have anything big planned yet, but if Loki and DarkSakura keep up the good work, maybe...
11742893	11747156	We can do a full motion video actress where is she now clip.
11747516	11752760	I don't know about the actress, but the actor from Mega Race has actually done quite a few things.
11753000	11754221	We're going to hunt somebody down.
11754241	11755041	We're going to hunt him down.
11755061	11756022	That would be fun.
11756062	11757703	That's what I want for episode 450.
11757743	11758724	We're going to try and make it happen.
11758764	11759344	We'll do our best.
11759364	11760225	That would be fun.
11760245	11760765	451, if nothing else.
11761186	11761786	So we'll see.
11761926	11763587	I heard Dana Plano went underground.
11763687	11764228	Stop it.
11767464	11769545	You're so hipster you only listen to underground bands?
11770385	11770565	What?
11770825	11772305	I said, was she cast in Six Feet Under?
11772345	11773266	You guys are bad.
11774086	11774766	Bad kids.
11775406	11775786	Alright.
11776426	11777427	Be nice to each other.
11777967	11779347	Is she a working stiff now?
11781648	11782408	I'm ending the show.
