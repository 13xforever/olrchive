13951	18415	Tonight, March 4th, 2012, could Valve be entering the home console market?
18715	25480	Some Sony titles are scheduled to be taken offline, and one 80s video game cartoon character is set for an all-new series.
31502	35203	Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35243	37704	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
37764	44126	We are live with episode number 448 of our program on this March the 4th of 2012.
44626	45246	March 4th.
45326	50208	March 4th and join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us.
50428	50868	Crap.
51148	51348	What?
51428	51888	Crap what?
52189	53449	Today's my dad's birthday.
53956	55538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
74576	75837	and she was the raffle fairy.
75897	77778	If you saw the Umlaut thing, she was the raffle fairy.
78258	80659	And yeah, she sent me this shirt and it's great.
80819	81120	Get it?
81180	86262	It's Professor Plum and Colonel... Okay, you'll take a picture and upload it on orangeloungeradio.com.
86282	87143	I have seen that Woot shirt.
87423	89084	Yeah, I think it was a Woot shirt.
89424	90704	Hey, it's Techmaster Loki.
91305	92425	What is up with everybody tonight?
92465	94686	Everybody wants to just jump right in before I introduce them.
95347	95887	That's all right.
96988	112024	professional radio at its best I'm just a woot shirt expert because I check that site all the time and I'm very I have to cut down on the amount of t-shirts I buy because you know I have a lot of t-shirts already but damn there's so many good video game shirts there oh yeah
112644	116825	Now, do they let fans vote on shirts there, or is that only Threadless that does that?
116965	121046	It's basically, yeah, they have a thing that they call, well, they have the derby.
121587	126808	It's usually a theme, and then they'll create a shirt that wins that theme, and then they'll be for sale.
126908	140292	And they also have a thing called the Reckoning, which they have 20 shirts, and people who buy them, whatever shirts are more popular, stay on the list, and the ones that are not popular fall off the list, and they get replaced next week.
140452	140752	Gotcha.
141913	142213	Alright.
142933	148098	You know, I would like the Woot shirts better, though, if I could get, like, better girly style shirts.
148398	152021	Yeah, they don't have, like, girl sizes or anything like that.
152101	157325	So, the Woot shirts end up just being ridiculous for me because I hate the way that regular t-shirts fit.
157706	164831	Because for my ginormous rack, right, if I'm gonna get a shirt that's gonna fit me everywhere else, it's gonna be too tight on the girls.
165092	165272	Mm-hmm.
165752	171755	Otherwise, I look like, you know, it's the 80s and you wear your shirt all slouched out with the little clip on the side.
171995	173336	No, no, no, no, no.
173376	174757	Maybe it's time to bring back that style.
174797	176437	You know, sometimes old-fashioned makes comebacks.
176738	176878	No.
177938	178698	Okay, okay.
178859	180920	How about that rat tail and members only jacket, huh?
181960	188485	Hey, I actually wore a members-only jacket to a Rocky Horror Show, like, that was probably last year at some point, because, you know, that kind of stuff's funny.
188505	191207	Of course, no one's going to get that because they weren't in on that conversation.
191427	191868	All right, look.
192408	194670	Join our chatroom, chat.orangeloundtreater.com.
194710	195470	We are a live show.
195510	197712	We have been for going on almost 10 years now.
197732	204457	And speaking of which, Tigerclaw in our chatroom starts us off tonight saying, Episode 448, you guys just have two more shows until you reach 450.
205658	206859	Any plans for the big 450 show?
208260	208981	No, I do.
209622	210683	No, it's not really a milestone.
211003	212224	I don't, yeah, I don't see 450s a milestone.
212264	213626	It's like diet milestone.
213706	217850	Especially when we have the 10 year coming up in three months.
218410	218591	Yeah.
218731	219572	A little over three months.
219612	223876	We still, we haven't, guys, legit, we have no idea what we're doing for the 10 year anniversary right now.
223916	225718	I'm going to address something right now to Reginator.
226418	226839	Oh, what's up?
227851	230772	Nothing is going to get me to eat ham, bacon, and shellfish.
232492	235673	Because I have something called principles, and it's not a whim.
235953	238314	You did have that bacon milkshake, but there was no real bacon in it.
238434	239635	No, and I tasted it.
239655	241295	There's no real good in that either.
242075	244976	They just took a vanilla milkshake and said, hey, we're going to ruin this.
245396	256800	So there's a difference between getting a vegetarian to eat a piece of beef on a whim, a dare, rather than having someone break a religious tradition.
257580	259641	Well, if you want to piss off one of the hosts, join our chatroom.
259681	263421	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Say something offensive.
263501	264742	Talking about woot shirts here.
265462	268803	They've got, like, already on their reckoning right now.
268863	270103	Here's the shirts that they have.
270123	275084	Number 8, 1985, The Year of the Plumber, which has a bunch of Mario-themed stuff on there.
275964	282806	They've got number 11, which is Hey, Listen, which depicts Link falling asleep in class.
283606	284987	and, uh, let's see here.
285367	286648	They have a number 14.
286808	290370	A lot of this is going around, uh, which is the arrow through the knee stuff.
291150	303517	Uh, and it goes in the dark and, um, not really gaming related, but they have the, uh, it guys, uh, coat of arms, which, you know, refresh, reinstall, reboot.
304998	305278	I don't know.
305298	306999	It's just some awesome stuff on there.
309548	328663	I do you know now I'm starting to sound like a commercial but I will say this I have found some good stuff on just the Woot general site like that's where I got my Tron gaming mouse that I have for like 35 bucks and I think normally it's about 80 dollars and I do check Woot every day for the matching keyboard because I'm like if if the mouse went on clearance then the keyboard's got to go on clearance at some point I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting I want that Tron keyboard
328903	331765	I got some jump drives out there once, but I lost them all again.
332005	335527	I bought like four of them, too, and I lost every single one of them.
336047	336628	All of them.
336668	338629	They just like, poof, disappeared.
339009	341831	I had one disintegrate on me, but the other three were lost.
342506	345850	Alright, instead of talking about video game t-shirts, let's get to video games.
346210	348813	And I want to kick off tonight talking a little bit about GDC.
349654	356002	Game Developers Conference, of course, is a huge industry event that's happening just across the bridge over in San Francisco, not far from us.
357183	358645	And that kicks off this week.
358865	359606	I think Tuesday?
360027	360547	Maybe Wednesday?
360587	362530	But a lot of people are starting to show up in town already for it.
364190	392100	I'm a little bit unknowing to the specifics of GDC because I don't go it's not a media event they don't want media people there it's really for game developers a great way to do some networking I know people in the industry that go to like look for new people and you know hiring event especially with some of the bad news we've had lately in the industry like for example one story that didn't make our show roll tonight but it's been a big pretty big deal in the industry this week Blizzard laid off 600 people this week unfortunately so you know with with
393220	400063	The change and, you know, how these... The subscriber loss and WoW and the fact that Diablo 3 is pretty much in the can and what have you.
400083	401524	They unfortunately laid off 600 people.
401944	407186	But the good news, or I mean, whatever possible good news you can make of that... The upside?
407666	408367	Yeah, the upside.
408387	408947	Let's put it that way.
408967	416210	The upside is that, hey, GDC is this week, so maybe some of those folks can take their resumes up to GDC and do some networking and you never know what you might find.
416250	420872	So that might be, you know, some good to come out of all that.
421392	421492	So...
421832	423433	It's a great networking event.
424293	429834	But in the past couple years, it does seem like big things have come out of it.
430035	432235	And there have been some big media things.
432275	440658	And I even remember one year in particular, I think it was about two years ago, one of those networks, Spiker G4, actually covered a Sony press conference to talk all about the move.
441218	444119	And they had released quite a bit of details about the move at GDC.
444799	454427	And now this year, kind of leading into GDC, we're starting to hear little rumblings about, you know, SimCity 5 information is apparently leaked to the web and, you know, that is supposed to be happening.
454467	457289	There's the Valve thing we'll talk about in a minute, I'm sure is on everybody's mind.
457710	462374	But do you think there's going to be any whopper of news at GDC this year?
463895	466557	As far as announcements go, I don't think so.
468499	468799	I mean...
470296	472877	Maybe... I don't know if Nintendo's going to be showing any Wii U stuff.
472897	474137	I don't think Nintendo's there.
475598	476958	But it would be cool if they were.
477098	479019	They've shown little tidbits in the past.
479039	481760	Like, I want to say, wasn't the Mario 3D game first revealed?
481780	485061	Like, the logo was first at GDC, and it showed the raccoon tail.
485161	486541	Like, that came out of last year's GDC.
486561	487842	I thought that was Tokyo Game Show.
488082	491203	And then the whole... Something about... Or E3.
491963	496349	A Pikmin game is what turned into Mario Sunshine or something.
497610	503777	My memory is a little fuzzy on that, but I seem to remember something about the Pikmin series ended up becoming something else.
503818	505039	Maybe somebody in chat will remember.
506761	508443	Nintendo has dropped little tidbits like that.
508503	511427	Miyamoto did a keynote one year, I seem to recall.
513591	515992	I mean, I hope there's some cool stuff that we'll see out of that.
516572	519313	There's just a lot of different events going on around the same time.
520893	526595	You know, I mean, I don't think we're going to see a lot from Sony, especially on the Vita because they have their own kind of event for that.
527635	541199	We're not going to probably, I would hope, I would hope we'd see something on the Wii U because, I mean, yeah, they're going to show some stuff at E3, but like for developers, they kind of have to say, hey, here's what we have because you're going to have to make some games for this.
542506	543207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
563184	567248	So I don't see any sense in bringing out this big to-do.
567509	571272	Here's the system specs when that's what E3 is going to be about.
571472	573755	Nintendo's got to bring it to this year's E3.
574175	581542	And it's going to be just a full-on, this is the Wii U, this is the final prototype, these are the games that are coming out this holiday.
581842	584265	That is what you have to see from Nintendo at this year's E3.
584545	585005	You have to.
586106	586247	So.
587358	596987	What's interesting to me, though, is that it would have been a good opportunity for them to do this whole last story reveal and all that stuff that kind of came out last week, but they did their own thing, so whatever.
598889	608278	One other question I want to ask about Game Developers Conference, you know, what it really is more about is getting to sit in and hear from seasoned game designers about, you know, how they think about game design and so on.
608838	616202	I know something that you might see, like you would see from Nintendo would be talking about their new Nintendo network or whatever that they're going to have, the infrastructure for that.
616222	616983	That's a great thought.
617163	621305	Because it's more stuff that's going to be catered towards, okay, here's what we can do for you for development.
621705	623586	We're going to allow you to patch your games.
624186	628389	I know this new technology that's first available now on Nintendo.
629089	629429	You know what?
629489	635713	If Nintendo is going to be doing something with independent development, perhaps, like think something like Xbox Indie Games.
635853	636113	I know.
636993	637194	Well...
638634	646481	I know we got one bit of bad news about indie games on the 3DS tonight, but VVVVV, Cave Story, you know, there are some pretty good titles on the 3DS.
646501	650725	I understand that, but I think that they'd be worried that someone's going to trump them at their own game.
650745	655049	And to be honest, yeah, there's a lot of indie developers that could make another Mario game or another...
655849	657771	and Zelda or something of that caliber.
658432	661775	And they wouldn't want it taking away the thunder of some of their own stuff.
661855	664278	But we'll just piggybacking on your thought because I think it's a good thought.
664438	669342	If Nintendo is going to do anything for the indie developers, I think it's going to come out at GDC.
669402	671464	I think there's no better time to announce something like that.
671665	672646	I think that's a great thought.
673567	678792	I would like to see Microsoft do something with the indie games.
680613	682315	There's a lot of games on there.
682355	683616	It'd be nice to promote stuff.
683636	687260	If there's going to be an overhaul at all, this would be the great time to do it.
687340	691784	Changes in Sony Home, although they just really did a bunch of that, so I don't think that could be it.
692605	697490	The PlayStation Home was all revealed at GDC some time ago, about three or four years ago.
698891	726669	I'm not sure what else Sony you know maybe something we haven't thought of yet maybe something with the Vita maybe developing or who knows let me ask this question though I was about to ask this and you jumped in GDC is really about kind of hearing from the seasoned developers and you know what they their methods of game design and so forth if you could go to GDC and listen to one developer talk who would you want to hear lecture at GDC anybody DarkSakura Loki who would you want to go to GDC and see
728945	729385	Kojima.
729886	730406	Kojima?
730466	730866	Why is that?
730886	732447	Just because he's a badass?
732487	733368	Pretty badass.
734949	740332	Honestly, I'd like to get some of the classic developers there to lecture the new school on how the old school did it.
740712	744355	Like, you know, Yuji Naka or Yu Suzuki, you know.
745848	753353	Get the guys who pretty much revolutionized video games.
753393	755194	Without them, we wouldn't have any of this today.
755775	763400	So I think I would want to see the old guard pass on the baton to the new guard with some good advice.
763720	767582	And not necessarily in terms of announcing anything new.
768103	772886	I want to see them say, you need to remember all of this in mind and stop putting out crap.
773766	774467	That's pretty much it.
775205	777168	I'd just like to see anybody talk about Grand Theft Auto 5.
777448	780071	I don't care who it is.
780131	782835	Just somebody show me some stuff and talk about it.
783155	786299	They could be like, and here's what we have footage-wise.
787080	789003	Go.
789243	791246	Blackwolf in our chatroom says Tim Schafer.
791266	792788	Especially with all that's going on with the...
794049	810116	Kickstarter and all that I'd love to hear well I guess I guess the people that paid for that are gonna hear about that first we don't hear about it at GDC you know who I wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe you wouldn't like to hear would not like to hear from yeah let me talk about how important Twisted Metal is I don't care
811156	815501	I, my dream would be Sid Meier, you know, because I have made it no secret on the show.
815701	818744	I am a big fan of all things civilization, but it's not even just that.
818804	825671	Like, I think I would like to go to a Sid Meier panel where he talks about covert action really wasn't that bad of a game.
826872	827712	because it wasn't.
827892	830973	Even Sid Meier thinks covert action, they tried to do too much.
831574	832754	Old school PC game.
833374	833874	It was great.
834014	836755	I'm not going to get into the specifics, but that would be the panel I'd want to see.
836835	837435	Covert action.
837695	838556	It wasn't that bad.
838776	843177	You did hear, though, that he's got some sort of input on the new XCOM game.
843817	845818	I did hear about that.
846298	848519	Hey, we've got this problem.
848559	849419	We need your help.
849839	851820	So that's kind of cool.
852140	854281	Oh, Actdeft brings up Mizuguchi.
854481	855701	That's a great one.
855921	857541	I am a whore for all things Q Entertainment.
857721	859762	I'm unapologetically on the show.
860102	863643	Actually, my one true love, Igarashi.
863903	864323	I knew it.
864423	865243	I was surprised you didn't say that.
865403	871224	It'd be cool if we saw Harmonix there talking about something because they're cooking something up right now and I don't really know what.
871244	871264	E3.
871284	871704	I think E3.
874245	898571	you know GDC is not a media thing it's not really the time to announce your new games your new plat not even platforms your new like integrated services your new services yes your new games not so much so all righty uh BlackWolf in our chat room says I've seen a Sid Meier talk you know rub it in BlackWolf Bobby BlackWolf of course before us live at all games radio five o'clock pacific because when he does his show we're on at six sunday nights
899231	902913	Black Wolf says, Will Wright's talks are really, really, really spastic and all over the place.
903233	907134	Will Wright has like 500 PowerPoint slides for a one hour talk and I'm not exaggerating.
907495	908315	You know, I will say this.
908495	911476	I was fortunate enough one year to see, remember when Spore?
911776	912357	I remember that.
912557	914858	We got to go see Will Wright demoing it.
915058	916478	Was that Will Wright demoing it?
916738	917979	I completely forgot that.
918059	918539	Oh yeah.
918979	921360	We didn't see the one where it was Robin Williams demoing it.
921520	923301	I would have rather seen the Robin Williams one.
923481	925582	I loved seeing Will Wright demo it.
925642	926162	It was his game.
929004	930105	What happened to that game?
930145	931287	I mean, seriously.
931467	935311	Funny enough, I think it's a lot of what I said about covert action a minute ago.
936413	939156	I also think Spore was not that bad, but it just tried to do too much.
940237	942580	It tried to be 17 different games in one.
942640	944262	It just didn't work out so well.
944942	964820	but I loved watching them talk about it you know developers have such a passion for their games you know it's they can even like crappy games like I would watch the guys who made Fusion Frenzy on Xbox 360 or no Fusion Frenzy 2 excuse me the really bad one on 360 I'd watch them talk about their game because they'd be at least enthusiastic about it Barbie Horse Adventures heck yeah
965140	965620	You know what?
965640	966220	What?
966620	968981	This was at a Classic Gaming Expo a few years back.
969081	971082	Actually, the one that we were all at.
971882	978904	I got to see a bunch of the Atari guys talking about developing for the... It was all vector-based and everything.
978964	979344	Oh, good times.
979504	988107	And just listening to those guys reminisce and tease each other and talk about the little bits of code they were able to sneak in and having hardly any room to sneak it in with and...
988747	989967	That was really cool.
990147	992608	And I like hearing about all the behind-the-scenes stuff.
992628	994248	Those guys were fucking rock stars.
994368	997369	Because you have to remember, some of those early games were one dude.
997829	1000050	Yars' Revenge was Howard Scott Warshaw.
1000810	1001850	He also did E.T.
1002090	1003130	We forgive him.
1003751	1007171	David Crane did some of the early... I think he did Slot Machine on Atari.
1008072	1009572	Say what you will about it, but it was an early game.
1009832	1012273	But meeting the guys that did Robotron and...
1014353	1038130	and also um and he's a he's a man I've actually had a long conversation with a few times is uh he did a lot of the Williams pinball tables it was um Steve Ritchie really nice guy he did a lot of the voices for No Fear and Black Knight and um listening to him talk about developing just the pinball tables about the physics that go into it and everything I like hearing about that enthusiasm and
1038850	1044714	Maybe no one else is as into it as they are, but their enthusiasm is contagious.
1045095	1048677	Somebody is if they have these pinball expos across the country.
1049298	1049678	I'm just saying.
1049778	1050038	Go ahead.
1050879	1053741	Even if you're not as interested in it as they are, they're still contagious.
1054461	1055702	Their enthusiasm is contagious.
1055862	1056343	Absolutely.
1056623	1056783	Loki?
1057023	1068631	Well, speaking of that, I actually watched, it was a translated video of the guys doing the urinal games at Sega, and talking about them and how enthusiastic about their project was.
1069352	1070553	I can't wait to go pee!
1070593	1072194	No, seriously, it's funny.
1072254	1077958	They have a good sense of humor about it, because they're like, yeah, we know this is weird, but hey, we're developing it.
1078258	1084262	So, with that in mind, I'd actually want to see the people, I'd want to hear from the guys that are developing these arcade games.
1084282	1086664	Like, the really weird arcade games in Japan, like the ones where you eat the
1086784	1091088	I want to see what the motivation for that is.
1091128	1092489	That's just amazing.
1092850	1095232	Tetris with a giant fucking controller.
1095932	1096813	That's just awesome.
1098194	1099075	It does sound awesome.
1099495	1100817	I love that table flipping game.
1100857	1102738	Oh my god, why won't the arcades here get that?
1103859	1106281	It's a one joke pony, but damn it's a good joke.
1106982	1108143	It's a joke that won't get old.
1108463	1108483	I...
1109309	1128617	Man, if only you had the resources Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks We've talked a lot about GDC, which is great I want to talk about the video games we've been playing this week You know, just talking to the crew a little bit before the show It sounds like we've had a bit of a classic, a little bit of a retro week But let's go around and see what folks have been playing, DarkSakura I've been playing the shit out of Sonic CD What'd I tell ya?
1129517	1130097	Heck yeah!
1130478	1136200	Well, okay, I didn't really play the shit out of it I played like four full levels of Sonic CD What brought on the Sonic CD urge?
1136930	1138011	Last night I was looking at Steam.
1138031	1139631	I was like, holy shit, it's on Steam.
1139711	1140011	Bye.
1141032	1142092	And then Dan yelled at me today.
1142512	1144493	He's like, why are you buying games we already have?
1144693	1145793	That happens a lot on Steam.
1145853	1147034	Oh yeah, like he should talk.
1147094	1149235	I mean, come on.
1149335	1149635	What?
1150015	1152936	Buying games that you guys already have.
1152956	1154517	I'm actually trying to think about that.
1154537	1156417	How many versions of Strider do you own?
1158078	1159459	At Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
1159519	1165601	Technically, the only reason that we have another version of the first Strider is because it came with Strider 2.
1167674	1169034	So, that right there.
1169974	1172815	We also have Strider on Genesis, and we have The Nest Strider, which is a different game.
1173535	1175295	I apologize if I'm blending shows together.
1175336	1178196	I might have brought this up last week, but I loved what you posted on Facebook.
1178216	1180997	You posted on Dan's wall, and it was Strider NES.
1181177	1182137	It wasn't that bad.
1182777	1183757	I think we brought it up last week.
1183777	1184697	Yeah, it was a Capcom blog.
1185277	1186178	Shows blur together.
1186458	1188078	But yeah, and I'm like, agree.
1188378	1190138	Dan says it's a decent game.
1190178	1192559	I mean, I've read some of the Strider Hiryu manga.
1193459	1194700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1215646	1218667	They should have had the moon music play in some of the levels just for fun.
1219147	1219748	That would have been great.
1219828	1221508	Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
1221709	1234154	At any rate, I told them flat out I wanted the Japanese soundtrack because someone did a version of Sonic CD basically using all Sprite rips and everything and the Japanese soundtrack.
1235194	1237215	And it's like a brand new Sonic CD.
1239076	1241217	I'll try to find it and put it on our Tumblr.
1241597	1244078	But you can download the whole thing, burn it, and it'll play on a Sega CD.
1245379	1246579	But I mean, that was Dance Point.
1246599	1247800	We've got it on the Sega CD.
1247900	1249041	Why do we need to have this other one?
1249061	1250322	I don't care if it's got better music.
1251503	1252804	Because it does have better music.
1253265	1257728	Except for the intro and outro, it's no lyrics.
1258269	1259029	It's just instrumental.
1259530	1260510	I was like, boo.
1261471	1267376	But anyway, I also played, I actually was going to play some Bastion and then I was like, no.
1269397	1270278	I did find Blue Dragon.
1270560	1271740	The girl changed her mind.
1273341	1275422	The girl, I'll tab to a different game instead.
1276382	1280483	I actually did play a lot of WoW, but I sort of like... Addict.
1281483	1283464	Dealer, who's been on every time I've been on?
1284384	1286545	Just because I was homesick one day this week, alright?
1286965	1290186	And last night, and... We should run a dungeon!
1290726	1291286	Yes, we should.
1291366	1292007	Well, we did.
1292027	1292927	We did, it was fun.
1293307	1295008	Anyway, even though I hate Old Man.
1295528	1295728	Anyway...
1298590	1304094	I had been hitting this kind of rut where I would log on to an alt, check my box, and then I'm like, okay, I'm done.
1305415	1305755	Shut up.
1305875	1307756	My auction, my mailbox.
1308797	1311259	And then I would log on to another one and go, I'm done.
1311639	1313320	And then log on to another one and go, I'm done.
1313781	1315822	And then just sit on my main chatting with people.
1316242	1317964	I wasn't even playing, I'd just be talking to people.
1318604	1344174	and finally I got on the Drenden gyaru who is going to be dressed like a hobag once she's 85 because she's gal and decided I actually really like Shadow Priest now so I just been I kind of got my love for the game back instead of just you know chatting with people and also a really good friend of mine I found out is on there and so I've been chatting with her
1344594	1366220	sometimes it does just take a change of scenery or a change of character and this is you know true of any MMO you know I know our frame of reference as well but any MMO like you know things unfortunately were starting to get a little stale on the alliance side where I was playing because no one was ever on but you and maybe John and then we weren't raiding anymore so it's like I'll go try this mage over here and raid you know and it's it's kind of reinvigorated like oh now I have something to do in the game
1366758	1371200	Well, we actually have been invited for raiding with another guild now.
1372021	1372961	There's an open invitation.
1373141	1373501	Oh, nice.
1373661	1375762	So if we actually want to do alliance raids, we've got people.
1375922	1376863	I'll tell you more offline.
1377043	1377863	All right.
1378284	1388008	And then I'm actually going to be on Tuesday night, or actually Tuesday during the day before my yoga class, I'm logging on to Star Trek Online to find my Scotsman.
1388849	1393331	And I'm going to be having one day a week at Star Trek Online because they miss me.
1393491	1395252	It's been a year and a half and they miss me.
1395712	1397193	Does anybody yell out, you know?
1397754	1399375	She can't handle anymore, Captain!
1399635	1400796	It doesn't have the power!
1400977	1405580	It's funny, they're mostly architects.
1405701	1413407	When the football place, the dome, collapsed, they were all in TeamSpeak talking about it.
1414208	1415749	Like, I bet it was cheaply made.
1415789	1418011	I bet, you know, they should fire their architect.
1418091	1422034	And I was like, they probably just did it that way because it's America and we build everything cheap.
1422354	1422455	Yeah.
1423852	1424653	Thank you for watching!
1440127	1442248	I've been pretty excited about that.
1443609	1445030	They made a lot of changes to DS9.
1445871	1451454	I mentioned it before, but you can go in the captain's office and there's a lot of cool stuff in there.
1453215	1454796	I played Luminous over here last week.
1455136	1456837	I think I mentioned that.
1460179	1460779	That's about it.
1461560	1464061	I've had a little bit more diverse of a gaming week.
1464741	1465222	Good times.
1465342	1466162	Loki, how about you?
1466302	1466943	How was your gaming week?
1468083	1469104	I didn't play hardly anything.
1470865	1474926	Luminous, I played that actually for at least a couple hours this week.
1475567	1476247	Same game too.
1476347	1478028	Well, one game was an hour.
1479969	1481669	The one I still have paused right now.
1482950	1484711	So I've been playing that.
1485491	1491694	And I downloaded the demo for Reality Fires, which I hear is really terrible, but it's a demo on free.
1491734	1492514	I'm going to want to try it.
1492554	1494655	So hopefully I'll try that this week.
1496528	1511405	Um, really, I mean, aside from playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto while working on mod stuff still, because I've been working on one since like a year ago, and I want to get it done so I don't have to work on it anymore.
1513886	1541972	Call of Duty Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare played that this week played it with my life because we had a bet going that if I lost a game between Wednesday and Friday that I'd have to publicly apologize at our company meetings or party whatever you want to call it on the microphone to everybody but fortunately I'm that good so I didn't have to all I apologize for at the end of the last did you get something out of it?
1542826	1546808	All I did at the very end of it is I just apologized for them sucking so bad.
1547569	1548970	Yeah, they're rubbing it.
1551071	1551731	No, it's just fun.
1551911	1552772	I'm just playing with them.
1552912	1554273	I understand their frustration.
1556154	1559816	It seems like I'm kind of crazy sometimes.
1559836	1562677	Well, I try to be fair.
1562697	1564518	I don't know.
1564638	1569961	They claim shenanigans, but there's no such thing.
1570401	1571142	That's about it.
1571793	1572113	All right.
1572954	1573594	My gaming week.
1573914	1575235	I had an interesting gaming week.
1575515	1577716	I didn't really play a lot of new, new stuff.
1578077	1581959	Maybe a little Final Fantasy XIII too, and I'm continuing to play WoW, as DarkSakura mentioned earlier.
1582439	1586121	But I went back and rediscovered some old stuff that I just skipped.
1586201	1589743	And one of them you guys are seriously going to laugh at me, but you know what?
1589803	1591404	We don't have time to play everything.
1591744	1593487	He's playing Barbie Pony Adventure.
1593507	1595390	I'm not playing Barbie Pony Adventure, shut up.
1595871	1600158	But I am playing Uncharted, the first one, from 2007.
1601000	1604706	Yes, I finally started getting into the Uncharted series this week.
1604886	1605187	Why?
1606525	1606906	I don't know.
1607006	1607546	I was bored.
1627968	1634874	Yeah, I like the storytelling a lot in it, and obviously this is the strength of the series I gather from people as a whole.
1635675	1641240	The camera and controls kind of bug me a little bit, like I really want to spin the camera ways it doesn't want to go sometimes.
1641720	1647345	But other than those little quirks, which I think is the same complaint you probably heard about this game, oh, I don't know, five years ago when it was new.
1647745	1648665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1666913	1668755	I got Mod Nation Racers this week.
1668835	1669956	I'm not talking the Vita one.
1669996	1671597	I'm talking the PlayStation 3 one.
1671617	1675160	I got Mod Nation Racers on PlayStation 3 for like $17 used.
1675980	1680284	There's a great little local chain we have here called Dimple here in Sac, Grimino.
1681045	1689852	And they have all sorts of used games because they have like Super Nintendo games and Dreamcast games and Atari 2600 games, which is awesome.
1690472	1693975	The only unfortunate thing is that the Super Nintendo games...
1694195	1694856	Thanks for watching!
1713809	1714109	and DarkSakura.
1743477	1744077	Thanks for watching!
1766205	1767045	Yeah, there you go.
1767225	1775648	So I've had kind of a renaissance week, I guess, if you want to call 2007 and 2009 or 10, whenever modern age erasers came out, renaissance.
1776328	1777148	Renaissance.
1777908	1780869	Which happened smack dab in the middle of Fred Lee.
1781029	1782249	We're humans with day jobs.
1782329	1784270	We sometimes miss big games.
1784330	1785170	I want a day job.
1786310	1787091	Somebody hire me.
1787651	1789331	But you've been doing a lot of volunteer stuff, so.
1790351	1790592	Okay.
1790952	1791592	Keeping yourself busy.
1791612	1791712	True.
1792852	1793173	All right.
1794033	1796055	Let's move on to some quick housekeeping.
1796095	1799858	I just want to quickly plug our Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1800138	1805623	We're also on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio and also Twitter, OLR on Twitter.
1806804	1814029	Keep in mind you can always find different places to interact with OLR in our community on our website at www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1814410	1817152	Up in the upper right-hand corner is a box called Extended Play.
1817492	1844291	and you'll see logos for all big social networking sites and it helps you find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners and OLR listeners really are the best people because everybody in our little community really subscribes to the theory of don't be a dick when you're playing games online so if you want to play with people who aren't assholes I really urge you to play with the OLR because it's a really great bunch of people there's Steam community there's you know Xbox threads and all that stuff so find some OLR fans and play some games
1845120	1846945	Alright, let's talk about the news.
1847246	1848650	Loki's going to start us off with a whopper.
1849304	1857750	Yeah, apparently there's a lot of rumors going around saying that Valve is working on a Steam Box gaming console.
1858570	1861793	And that it's something that might be announced at GDC this week.
1863354	1866456	Lots and lots and lots of rumors kind of regarding that.
1866496	1874522	The first thing was that there was some sort of like... Coming from this website, The Verge...
1875402	1877604	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1894320	1901425	The hardware they're seeing right now is currently an Intel Core i7 with 8 gigs of RAM and an NVIDIA GPU.
1901985	1912271	And I guess any devices that are built to those standards will run any PC title and will support any other digital distribution platform like EA's Origin Service and stuff like that.
1912611	1914573	So it sounds like it's almost like some sort of...
1917402	1920583	Digital Distribution box, which makes sense because that's what Steam is.
1921743	1930466	Also, they're talking about that they had some sort of different controllers and stuff that they were working on.
1931086	1941629	One that kind of looks a little bit like, I guess, that MLG pad that they have from Mad Catz, the one with the swappable D-pads and analog sticks and stuff like that.
1942009	1946011	So they're going to have some sort of framework or a controller that would allow you to do that.
1946051	1949573	Where you'd be able to have, okay, I want an analog stick.
1949633	1956436	Okay, no, I want a joystick, like an arcade joystick or something like that instead.
1956576	1957417	Or I want something else.
1959278	1960118	So that's kind of neat.
1960818	1961439	The other thing...
1963427	1968470	They're saying also that, well actually there's some photos that maybe have leaked out of this as well.
1969130	1990122	Coming from a Twitter account that was one of the Valve employees, Greg Coomer, apparently from back in November 2nd, he's all, built this tiny PC, an i7 quad core, 8 gigs of RAM, and a Zotac Z68 motherboard with onboard NVIDIA mobile graphics.
1990902	1992283	Runs Portal 2 fast.
1992583	1996705	Well, isn't that convenient that all those specs happen to match up with what the rumors were?
1997445	1999266	And, you know, it would be small enough.
1999446	2003707	Almost looks like, well, it's a micro or mini ITX box.
2003807	2010030	So, you know, it's like an Apple TV size with Wi-Fi and stuff like that.
2010150	2012651	So, I mean, I could see something like that happening.
2013411	2015992	God, can you imagine if that was like an Apple thing?
2016572	2021154	Not necessarily, oh, Steam Box, but it's Apple Steam Box or something like that.
2023932	2042158	I don't know I would think Apple would want to focus on something that ties into its own thing you know for forever I would think that they would open up the game store to work on Apple TV and I think a lot of people have been wondering about that but we may get that announcement this week isn't there like some big yeah there's the iPad 3 but I don't I don't see that no
2044419	2051945	So yeah, there's definitely some hints or whatever coming from that Twitter account that they're working on some sort of console device or something like that.
2052545	2064635	So lots of rumored stuff right now and of course pictures of the controller and this is coming from some patents that are out there.
2064815	2068898	Video game controller having user swappable control components.
2069839	2070119	So
2071560	2073601	So, interesting.
2074041	2075942	It might be something like that.
2077662	2088266	You know, it's interesting that one of the first things, and I heard Bobby talk about this on his show too, and I gotta admit, one of the first things that came to my mind when I read about this was the Phantom console.
2088626	2089446	It was talked about at E3.
2089466	2093628	It was kind of a laughing stock, but in some ways, it wasn't all that different.
2094008	2095750	The Phantom was a little PC box.
2096130	2097471	It was all digital distribution.
2097791	2108360	The one thing, though, that really killed it and why people were like, no thanks, was that they wanted to charge a fee to just have the damn box and then charge for the games on top of that.
2108380	2110081	And I definitely don't see a Steam box doing that.
2110121	2112223	But otherwise, this concept isn't...
2112643	2118747	This is going to be more like OnLive where they have their streaming box and the controller and stuff like that and then you use their service.
2118867	2120148	I think this could be something similar.
2121329	2137399	I don't know if it's going to be something that you're streaming content with, although I could see them doing some sort of streaming service or whatever, but I think this is more of a digital distribution where you download it and this thing is powerful enough to run most games.
2137939	2139280	At least I would hope.
2139320	2139980	I don't know with a...
2141261	2143582	A mobile Nvidia chip?
2143622	2145062	I mean, I guess it's possible.
2145122	2154884	I mean, hell, I have a mobile Nvidia chip in my laptop, and it can run most games, and it's really hot doing so, but it can do it.
2155465	2156665	And this is actually pretty old.
2158485	2159245	At least the chip is.
2159326	2164987	The whole thing would just be very interesting, because you're legitimately just selling somebody a PC that hooks up to their television, which...
2165767	2167629	I know at DarkSakura's house, they already have one.
2167689	2169230	And I've seen a lot of people do that.
2169250	2171932	And most PCs would hook up to a TV nowadays.
2172052	2172792	Most of them have.
2172812	2174374	If it's got HDMI.
2174614	2177876	Yeah, if it's got a dedicated graphics card, they always have HDMI out.
2177916	2178937	It's just all in the marketing.
2178977	2180058	Most people don't think to do that.
2180498	2180678	Yeah.
2180898	2186342	You know, and I'm like, for real, that's, I mean, what is this box giving us that a lot of laptops don't have?
2186362	2201191	But that's the thing, though, is with the specs, though, basically, okay, you need to have this much RAM, this much processing power, this kind of chip release, this, you know, as low as this chip, and then basically I can just download the software.
2201371	2203733	Oh, wait, that's Steam, and I can play games.
2204013	2205034	So, yeah.
2205074	2207255	Which I can play Steam on my TV.
2207315	2208936	Yeah, but you know what?
2208956	2209176	Already.
2210337	2221237	at first I just kind of looked at this like whatever I don't think this is as big of a deal as people make it out to be but then the more I thought about it I was thinking what if this is what they've been saving Half-Life 3 for
2224181	2247073	what if this is the way to get Half-Life 3 and that would be the huge what I mean my god they could sell an entire console out of one game if there's any game in the world that could push a console by itself it would be Half-Life 3 all you have to do announce Half-Life 3 is going to be the pack-in game for this console or it's going to be exclusive window 90 day this thing's going to sell like a mother
2248564	2249285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2262839	2272792	I, I, but the thing is though with the specs, I mean, unless they're making some actual proprietary boards or something like that, which they could be, but I don't think they are.
2273233	2279261	I mean, you can't really, you could almost like say, okay, give me the part list and I'll build one myself.
2279321	2279802	You know what I mean?
2281275	2282616	People would figure it out, though.
2282836	2290962	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, TigerClaw says, Valve should totally make a special edition Steam box shaped like the weighted companion cube.
2291603	2293304	Talk about another way to sell a ton of them.
2293584	2294565	Just make them cute!
2296306	2298148	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Behazard on an HDTV is glorious.
2324895	2332479	Yes, a lot of games look really good on the TV just because, you know, it's got a different way of the way it's kind of projects the images than a monitor.
2332559	2335821	Just, you know, a lot of games look really good, especially when it's a huge TV.
2336922	2342385	Derek H takes a different position in our chat room saying no non-PC gamer knows what Half-Life is.
2342805	2343685	It's no Mario.
2343725	2345126	Hell, it ain't even Sonic.
2345146	2345866	That's not true.
2346147	2346447	I was.
2346587	2346787	Yeah.
2347187	2347968	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
2347988	2348668	The orange box?
2348728	2348908	Yeah.
2349248	2350409	Orange box did have Half-Life.
2350806	2351767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2370465	2381078	Why would people that are fans of a primarily PC franchise, you know, as much as Half-Life was in the orange box, it's still primarily a PC franchise.
2381198	2383080	Why would those people jump ship to buy a new console?
2383120	2383761	Now, here's the thing.
2384102	2389047	I would buy a console, or we'd probably pick up multiple consoles if they were cheap enough.
2389668	2390108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2412647	2433153	you know and I will say again I'm I'm just fueling fanboy fire by my suggestion at Half-Life 3 but it's kind of you know if Valve was gonna do what everybody else did it would make sense but we can just hope that Valve wouldn't do something like that but no no matter what it would sure make a sweet showcase game wouldn't it if nothing else show off the power
2434213	2434494	Anyhow.
2435174	2436135	I just don't see it happening.
2436195	2441341	I mean, I would love for them to prove me wrong and then I can just go see, you know, watch them flop.
2442482	2446346	I mean, yeah, Half-Life 3 would sell to the core Half-Life fans.
2447066	2450590	But, you know, before long they try to figure out some way to get it to run on the PC.
2450730	2456176	They'd be, you know, they try to find ways to, because I mean, if basically if it is going to be a PC, they try to find some way of hacking it.
2456676	2461079	Well, yeah, and I don't, you know, again, my whole thing was just like maybe like a 90-day window.
2461159	2465322	But, you know, yeah, if this thing is just a PC, then, you know, that would be kind of, it wouldn't work.
2465842	2468144	But, you know, I'm just throwing out ideas.
2468644	2476070	And keep in mind, they already, it took them, you know, PlayStation emulation happened on PCs.
2476830	2483315	Anything that will run on a disc or in some digital format, people have tried to emulate on a PC regardless.
2483515	2484796	So someone's going to figure it out.
2486117	2488358	I think they might just realize that.
2488778	2488998	All right.
2489018	2489399	Well, who knows?
2489439	2491740	Maybe we'll see something about it at E3 this year.
2491840	2493741	That would be the time to show off a new console.
2494482	2499024	Speaking of E3, there's some rumors this week that the Wii U is going to have its price revealed at E3.
2499064	2501106	I mean, it has to have its price revealed at E3.
2501446	2504448	But the rumors this week are exactly what that price is set to be.
2505148	2506129	An unnamed source...
2506949	2508570	You gotta love those guys.
2508630	2517857	Disgruntled employee or something told the site Wii U Daily that the Wii U will retail for $299.99 when it comes into North America after E3.
2518137	2519819	I think that's just an educated guess.
2520119	2524382	$299 in the US, $299 euros in Europe, $20,000 yen in Japan.
2524882	2528965	Nintendo has stated before that they're gonna try to price it like it's the 360 or the PlayStation 3.
2529686	2533849	I talked last week on the show about why it cannot be more than $450.
2533909	2534049	Yeah.
2535710	2539655	I think $2.99 sounds a lot more reasonable for what Nintendo is trying to do here.
2540336	2543600	And I'm kind of with you, Loki.
2545482	2550468	I could say an unnamed source told Orange Lounge Radio that, and that would be a pretty darn good risk to take.
2550989	2553292	I mean, $2.99 is a really good educated guess.
2553803	2557585	Because, I mean, we use daily, no offense, no one's really heard of you.
2558505	2562967	You know, if you get it correct, then you're like, oh, hey, look, we said it first.
2563107	2565388	If you get it wrong, no one's going to remember that you said that.
2565668	2577293	Well, yes, and we can tell you from firsthand, because this very show used to blow the lid on something, and nobody knew who we were, and we knew we were right, but by the time it was announced, nobody cared, you know?
2577833	2579533	So, it happens.
2582474	2583855	Crush 3D is cancelled, by the way.
2585195	2585395	What?
2585415	2586215	It's a Sega game.
2586455	2587116	Crush 3D.
2587216	2587836	What the hell is that?
2587856	2588816	I don't even remember what it is.
2588836	2590316	It's a 3DS game they just put a demo out for.
2590936	2592077	They're not publishing it anymore.
2594137	2595578	Wait, where did that come from?
2595738	2597618	Why would they put a demo out if it's been cancelled?
2597718	2598518	That doesn't make any sense.
2599118	2601339	Lots of demos come out for games that end up not happening.
2602062	2603202	I guess, but I don't know.
2603222	2604883	It just seems like the whole... Well, it's not now.
2605163	2605623	Maybe later.
2606383	2606703	Hmm.
2607143	2609984	It could possibly be that the demo was just a way to gauge interest.
2610244	2612245	I guess they said they were going to do that for Mega Man at one point.
2612405	2613765	And the demo didn't even come out for that.
2614665	2615105	That's true.
2615465	2622387	Wait, I have a little more on the Wii U. There may have already been some changes to the Wii U. There's some diagrams that are circulating out there on the internet.
2622667	2629869	The original design of the Wii U had like a raised analog stick, but apparently this new one has those more flat
2630169	2632391	I thought they always had the circle pads.
2650151	2660456	Rumor is that Nintendo could have leaked it themselves to see how the community feels about it, which isn't beyond the realm of possibility, and Neil Gaff would be an excellent place to do it.
2662417	2663777	Apparently two diagrams out there.
2663837	2671921	It would make sense that we have two circle pads to coincide with the redesigned 3DS with two circle pads that will eventually be coming.
2672661	2676723	I mean, that's just like saying, you know, tomorrow is Monday.
2678604	2703830	um I don't really know how I feel about one or the other I think I'm a slight I mean I don't hate the circle pads but I think I'm a slight more fan of the analog sticks because you can grab the analog sticks too you don't just have to use them with your thumb but sometimes for classic games I'll actually kind of pinch the stick and use it that way and you can't do that with a circle pad it's harder to kind of I don't know there's like less resistance on this it's like going from an NES pad to the NES max
2704861	2705401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2735025	2738948	There is that Capcom Namco Sega 3DS game.
2739188	2741250	Well, they've got teasers out in the form of chromosomes.
2741830	2743432	And they're specially colored chromosomes.
2744753	2750578	And for people who don't know what chromosomes look like, they look like weird disjointed X's.
2751939	2753200	There's your biology lesson.
2753480	2756022	They hang from the ceilings in a lot of science classrooms.
2756423	2757744	Yeah, they do.
2759540	2760561	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2782234	2786056	My papa collected Alabama football Coke bottles.
2786777	2788197	So yeah, Bear Bryant foot bottles.
2788437	2791379	I'm sure people relatively know who Bear Bryant was.
2791479	2795161	Yeah, I've heard of the old school bottle, bottle collecting, glass bottle collecting.
2795361	2799663	Anyway, back to Namco, Sega, Capcom, Dai.
2801304	2807729	So these are all colored specially and there's some speculation as to what these colors are indicating.
2808270	2811532	Like one of them is from Namco, maybe a Klonoa one.
2811552	2812233	It's blue and yellow.
2814114	2826744	From Capcom, there is one that's definitely zero colored in the fact that it's red and gold with a little green and a little blue and a little white, which definitely is the distribution on zeros colors.
2827365	2828926	And a Bayonetta one for Sega.
2829946	2832607	One that's all mostly black and sexy.
2833167	2835988	So could this be a weird... How does an ex become sexy?
2837388	2838248	It's Bayonetta.
2838768	2840188	So it would be black and sexy.
2840369	2841729	It doesn't matter what it is, it's Bayonetta.
2841789	2849451	Could this be some weird... I mean, either now we're looking at weird-ass fighting game, Mario... Not Mario, Smash Brothers type thing.
2849671	2850511	It's a breeding game.
2850751	2850811	Or...
2852112	2853455	Seriously, it's like Pokemans.
2853836	2856381	What about like a platformer type of thing?
2856481	2857884	No, I think it's a breeding game.
2858065	2858886	A breeding game?
2859247	2861953	Three companies got together to come up with a freaking breeding game?
2862375	2866217	You can have, like, Bayonetta and Zero get it on and have Bay of Zero.
2866337	2867217	Well, Sega is in this.
2867257	2867557	No, thank you.
2867577	2871159	Perhaps we're going to race these characters derby style.
2871759	2873360	That's probably a fucking kart racer.
2874380	2875060	I don't think so.
2875100	2875660	I don't think so.
2877221	2884984	Honestly, I kind of see, like, okay, if you could have... All right, think in terms of Soul Calibur, how you can make your own custom characters.
2885645	2891087	If you could have, you know, pick the best bits of different, you know, stock characters for these companies...
2892768	2897411	and then make your own fighting game character that you would upload and share on the internet.
2897471	2899833	Oh God, do not steal my ideas, all of you companies.
2900193	2902835	And we'll call it Mega Man Universe and then we'll cancel it.
2904916	2908479	This is just an idea that just suddenly popped through my head that I thought would be cool.
2908939	2914863	What if it's like somebody actually made a game out of Super Mario crossover but it's not Mario?
2914883	2915864	What if it's a puzzle game?
2916204	2934302	Bayonetta and Mario Brothers that'd be weird it's called Puzzle Zone not get Mario Brothers out of your head but the whole crossover like Bayonetta ends up in the Mega Man universe the only thing here's the thing which it was Mega Man universe okay well here's the game there's only one game that kind of reminds me of this and once again the name escapes me but it was for the um
2936047	2942850	I want to say the PlayStation 2, and it was a crossover game with, I want to say Bandai and Hudson.
2943751	2950874	So you had Barbie versus Solid Snake versus Bomberman versus Optimus Prime.
2950894	2952394	I played that at some anime convention.
2952434	2953075	I think that was like...
2953915	2966661	Well, and keep in mind, there's always been the Robot Taisen, the Robot Wars games that have, you know, multiple series worth of, you know, you have Evangelions versus Gundams.
2966721	2969582	And this was a Japanese announcement, right?
2969742	2976845	So it could be something, you know, that's more what we'd see in that market versus what we'd see across, you know, whatever.
2978433	2981657	I don't know, I just, I feel like, why another fighting game?
2981797	2982979	No, it doesn't have to be a fighting game.
2982999	2984541	Remember Namco Cross Capcom?
2984901	2985923	Tactical strategy game.
2986003	2986564	Right, right, right.
2986644	2987124	That failed.
2987385	2987665	Twice.
2989027	2990348	So, maybe they'll do that.
2991330	2994234	Ranma in our chatroom says, Peach and Daisy dress like Bayonetta.
2995395	2996657	I think that's how you pronounce that?
2997967	2999508	But Nintendo's not really involved.
2999528	3007376	It is on the 3DS, but it's not a... Nintendo wasn't involved as one of the companies, so I don't know.
3007996	3009277	It's probably just a fucking kart racer.
3009297	3009878	I'm going with that.
3010719	3013621	If not, I like the idea of a Pokemon game starring Bayonetta.
3015782	3016502	All right, let's move on.
3016522	3017543	Gotta whip them all.
3017843	3021566	Dream Mix TV World Fighters was the game I was thinking of.
3021686	3022766	That game was kind of derpy.
3023687	3024508	Oh, they're orange, right?
3024548	3025368	Said it in chat, too.
3025408	3025688	There it is.
3025748	3030031	It was a Nintendo GameCube game, but I believe it was also PlayStation 2.
3030712	3031872	There was one on the DS, too.
3031892	3033233	It had Twinbee in it.
3034134	3035214	Twinbee is great!
3035795	3037916	This is just fan wank speculation.
3038096	3038877	Let's get to something else.
3040078	3041098	All right.
3041219	3045642	So Sony is going to be announcing some new Vita stuff probably pretty soon, actually this week.
3046143	3050086	March 9th, they're going to be holding their own live streaming Vita reveal event.
3050627	3057192	Kind of sounds like something that Nintendo did last week or the week before last at some point.
3058233	3059554	On the day that the Vita came out.
3059894	3061515	Yes, on the day the Vita came out.
3062396	3063997	Nintendo doesn't have any games coming out on the 9th.
3064077	3065137	Oh wait, they have one.
3065898	3067399	Wait, no they don't have anything.
3068019	3071701	It just reminded me because Mario Party 9 is coming out next week.
3073042	3075103	Anyways, so they're going to be announcing some stuff.
3075143	3081187	It's supposed to happen I guess at 6am Eastern.
3082287	3087030	So, hope you're up early or like me, I'm just going to wake up and read the news the next day.
3090443	3116603	the 24 hour news sites will be all over this to see whoever can post it first so you know it'll be by the time we roll out of bed and translate it and all that good stuff so well I mean we know that there are a lot of games in the pipeline for Vita because when they announced it they were talking about all these freaking games like you know that was 100 games so you know maybe more information about Final Fantasy 10 reimagining and some of these other things we've heard about it
3116874	3119695	Yeah, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection will be this summer, so that's kind of cool.
3119895	3121495	There you go.
3121895	3124996	They've got first party games coming out.
3125356	3132198	Nothing for really April yet, but for May and June they've got that covered already, first party titles.
3132438	3137099	I mean, I guess because kind of in March they have a few first party titles coming out.
3137519	3144421	Well, I would think we're going to hear through the summer and then maybe a couple teasers for holiday and then E3 is when they really blow the lid off of holiday games.
3145001	3147545	I think this conference is really about the summer.
3148326	3153373	I think it's really a way for Sony to reinforce, hey, we're not abandoning the Vita.
3153433	3155316	We're going to have this constant stream of games.
3155817	3158220	LittleBigPlanet, they haven't said a lot about, and it's out really soon.
3159161	3160824	It doesn't have an official street date yet.
3162444	3165225	Right now it's hovering at the end of March, maybe April.
3165605	3168285	So that would be a good April title because there's nothing in April right now.
3168445	3172906	I think that's the game you're going to hear more about at this event for sure.
3173126	3176547	That's a must buy for sure.
3176887	3178347	They have a lot of stuff coming out.
3180087	3180927	It's just going to be exciting.
3181267	3184268	Hopefully it's more exciting than Motorstorm RC, which looks like crap.
3185208	3190209	This might also be where they're going to unveil that they made the PlayStation games backwards compatible.
3191571	3191911	Finally?
3192431	3192752	Maybe?
3192992	3193632	Question mark?
3194552	3195513	Big feature announcement?
3195833	3196273	Question mark?
3196333	3196673	Possibly?
3196793	3197133	Hopefully?
3198074	3198814	PlayStation 2?
3199434	3200595	Okay, now I'm pushing it.
3201555	3202316	You never know though, right?
3202616	3205817	You never know.
3205837	3209158	Speaking of PlayStation 2, there's some games you're not going to be able to play much longer.
3209819	3210459	Some Sony games.
3210819	3215461	Some Sony games are having their servers closed on March 29th of this year.
3215501	3216862	It's Sony Online Entertainment.
3217182	3220023	I actually don't think all of these are PS2 games, but I know
3220643	3223524	EverQuest Online Adventures is closing.
3223724	3228665	I totally forgot that this game was on the PlayStation 2, but it was kind of like a spinoff of the main EverQuest game.
3229065	3231805	Well, if you're a fan of this game, you'll no longer be able to play it after March 29, 2012.
3232385	3237406	The other games that are going away, I, honest to God, have never heard of any of these.
3237766	3242147	Cosmic Rift, Infantry, and Star Chamber, the Harbinger Saga.
3242167	3243528	I've heard of Cosmic Rift.
3243928	3245208	I couldn't tell you what it is.
3245228	3245548	Kind of...
3247076	3247638	Well, let me look.
3248843	3250931	But I've heard of it.
3254567	3282493	I honestly thought that all the games on Playstation 2 had their servers shut off a long time ago like you know when Amplitude went down and you know all the old sports games Cosmic Rift is a two dimensional massively multiplayer video game designed by lead programmer Jeff Peterson it is a science fiction universe it is provided as part of the station pass through Sony Online Entertainment this is a Windows game
3283953	3290977	It was released open beta April 2001 and it's completely free to play as of June 26, 2011.
3292197	3293218	But now they're shutting it down.
3294058	3299441	So it looks kind of like an old school shooter game.
3300041	3302663	and like old school space shooter.
3303384	3307667	So, but obviously these games must have had their fans to keep them going this long.
3307747	3308607	So it's unfortunate.
3308627	3309948	They're probably shaking their fist right now.
3309988	3311229	Like, why haven't you heard of my game?
3311809	3316453	But, you know, unfortunately they're getting shut down now because it just wasn't enough to keep it profitable.
3316853	3317413	That's what happens.
3317754	3320696	That's got to suck when you buy an online game like that, you know?
3321936	3328081	Well, my heart jumped as beat when I saw this headline because I was like, fuck, are they going to shut off Mod Nation Racers a month after I bought it?
3329042	3330743	It's okay, but it was all old stuff.
3330803	3331524	Nothing on PlayStation 3.
3333626	3334327	Dodge that bullet.
3336169	3337110	Alright, let's move on.
3337150	3339953	We're coming up on release dates here after one more story from DarkSakura.
3341335	3341915	Again?
3342216	3342436	Okay.
3342796	3343817	How about some Minecraft news?
3344678	3347221	Because I know we have, like, what, five people that play Minecraft?
3348027	3355717	Anyway, Minecraft Pocket Edition actually hit 1 million paid downloads on Android.
3356418	3359201	And apparently it's doing pretty well on iOS.
3359261	3363626	It's the 26th position in the top paid app charts.
3364367	3366068	So, not bad, huh?
3366729	3374214	There's a tweet that came out from Daniel Kaplan, who is the business developer behind it.
3374494	3378116	It says, Minecraft Pocket Edition has now sold more than 1 million copies.
3378176	3381819	Thanks all the support, and I hope you will like the coming updates.
3382559	3384140	So, good?
3385741	3387302	Hooray for people who like Minecraft.
3389164	3391385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3419140	3424001	Top Gun Hardlock, MLB 2K12, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PSP, Street Fighter X Tekken, PS3, Xbox 360
3441925	3447691	Mass Effect 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC.
3448051	3450594	Also the collector's edition with that as well.
3451235	3453457	Country Dance All-Stars for Kinect.
3454237	3454878	That's out this week.
3455078	3457661	Nicktoons MLB 3D for the 3DS.
3458762	3460544	Lego Harry Potter Years 5 through 7 on the Vita.
3460564	3461144	Unit 13 on the Vita.
3464707	3491959	MLB 12 The Show on PlayStation 3 and the Vita The Sims 3 Showtime they have that expansion coming out also Showtime Plus that includes the regular game as well and the shark jumping The Sims 3 Showtime Katy Perry Collector's Edition that's coming out on PC what basic bitch game is this?
3493649	3494690	Katie Perry what?
3495151	3500516	The Sims 3 Showtime Expansion, Katie Perry Collector's Edition.
3501417	3509125	I don't know what deal there is between EA and Katie Perry, but there was that whole Simlish song she did.
3509465	3510945	Which was cute!
3511005	3512466	She must be a Closet Sims fan.
3512506	3513946	No, it's part of this.
3514046	3515286	It's tying into this thing.
3516067	3516947	I was years ago.
3516967	3521628	You get an exclusive stage and Katy Perry accessories.
3521868	3523288	Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it.
3523328	3524029	I mean, seriously.
3524129	3524889	Katy Perry!
3525809	3528010	Can I... I also need to interject with some breaking news.
3528450	3528630	What?
3529310	3530410	IOS game for free right now.
3530690	3530890	What?
3531010	3533391	Doctor Who The Maze Is In Time is free on the IOS store.
3534631	3536092	Eh, more important news than Katy Perry.
3536112	3536872	For a limited time.
3537452	3537892	Just saying.
3539144	3552475	Also this week, in case you want to save a little bit of money, they have a 2K Sports 2-pack, NBA 2K12, and MLB 2K12, which I think saves you $50 because each one of those games is still full price, which is kind of interesting.
3552495	3556378	And then last but not least, Mario Party 9, one week today.
3557539	3558360	On the Wii, of course.
3558380	3559401	Goddamn, nine of them?
3560041	3560502	Mario Party 9.
3562253	3567154	I remember when the first game looked like it was Mario Party 3, but it was just the horrible art on the box.
3568115	3575076	But you know, Mario Party 9 is not technically the ninth Mario Party game because there was one on the DS as well.
3575136	3576537	Wait a minute, who's making those games now?
3576597	3577217	Isn't it Hudson?
3577677	3580338	Hudson was making them before, and now who's making them?
3582578	3583719	Nintendo's making them.
3583919	3585039	I guess they brought it back.
3585748	3587089	All right, let's look at Japan.
3587129	3589350	Japan's got a busy week, too, on the Xbox 360.
3589550	3591991	Alan Wake gets a price reduction, Platinum Collection.
3592051	3594792	So does Dance Evolution, which we have as Dance Masters here.
3595713	3599595	Dudonpachi Resurrection gets a price reduction, as does Dream Club Zero.
3600035	3605517	And, of course, big release over there for Japan, Street Fighter X Tekken in a regular and collector's package.
3605858	3607038	Two other games coming out this week.
3607198	3612801	I have to admit, I got really excited because my eyes blended these two titles together for a minute.
3613281	3617304	There's Birds of Steel and Blades of Time.
3618105	3619566	And I read that as Blades of Steel.
3620107	3621348	But they are two separate games.
3621748	3630235	Birds of Steel is kind of your Konami's answer to Ace Combat because those old school flight simulator things are pretty popular in Japan.
3630555	3635096	Blades of Time is a little more of a God of War Bayonetta-esque action-y.
3635136	3638096	The unofficial sequel to X-Blades, if you remember that one.
3638116	3638836	Is it?
3638876	3639297	Okay.
3639537	3641377	Actually, that is supposed to be coming out this week as well.
3641417	3641837	I forgot.
3641877	3642697	That's on PS3 and 360.
3643257	3644337	Oh, so here in the US as well.
3644437	3644597	Yes.
3644837	3645238	Very cool.
3645278	3647678	Birds of... Wait, no.
3647738	3648378	Blades of Time.
3648398	3649498	Because I said Blades of Steel.
3650238	3650939	I guess he knew that too.
3650999	3651919	It's confusing.
3651939	3652399	I know.
3652459	3653599	It is.
3654039	3654759	Okay.
3654919	3657060	So, Birds of Steel.
3657480	3658400	That's coming out...
3660580	3661901	later this month.
3662381	3668122	It would be funny if it was like a, you know, it's pigeons playing hockey or something like that.
3668242	3671063	Konami, you need to bring back your hockey classic.
3671303	3672083	I don't think they can.
3672143	3675744	I think that, you know, people have rights to hockey now.
3675904	3680945	Well, can't you put out just like what they did with Tecmo Bowl where they just make up team and players or something?
3681165	3684106	Or make birds play hockey and call it Birds of Steel.
3684566	3687610	All right, look, we got to go to the PlayStation 3 and talk about what they're getting.
3687650	3689753	Birds of Steel and Blades of Time are there as well.
3690434	3694539	Mobile Suit Gundam UC comes out in the Japanese and Asian regions.
3694979	3698143	And Street Fighter X Tekken gets its release on PlayStation 3 as well.
3698584	3701347	Also, Nobunaga no Yabu Online.
3702088	3728346	Hounosho comes out this week this must be another Nobunaga online game I thought they already had one so I don't know if this is an expansion or what but you know these Nobunaga games are crazy over there it is not the Nobunaga Pokemon game because this is not a Nintendo system this is Sony PlayStation 3 coming out on the PlayStation Vita this week Unit 13 in Japan and lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week Girls RPG Cinderella Life
3729209	3733730	Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D Hatsune Miku Future Stars Project Mirai Accessory Sets UK
3747617	3748398	Some stuff.
3748698	3750039	Actually, there's a number of things.
3750239	3752481	On the 6th, we have Unit 13 for the Vita.
3753361	3754963	On the 7th, we have I Am Alive.
3755963	3759266	Trine 2 and Twisted Metal and Velocity.
3759927	3762669	On the 8th is Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.
3763269	3768233	And then on the 9th is Azura's Wrath, Mass Effect 3, and Street Fighter X Tekken.
3770725	3771026	All right.
3771726	3774588	Real quick, I want to mention this going to our chat room.
3774708	3776490	Ranma dropped a tip about Mario Party 9.
3777150	3780393	I guess the folks that are actually developing it is ND Cube.
3780413	3784075	Nintendo might be publishing it because ND Cube is a Nintendo subsidiary.
3784876	3788619	They made in the past, they did some GameCube and Game Boy Advance games.
3789079	3791441	F-Zero Maximum Velocity was one of the games that they did.
3792922	3795124	And Wii Party, I guess, was their game too.
3795764	3796605	You remember Wii Party?
3796625	3796705	Yeah.
3797426	3799854	So this minigame collection thing is right up their alley.
3801781	3802202	There you go.
3803651	3805633	We... Party!
3806894	3810416	We... Let's move on with a few more stories and then our classic game of the week.
3810536	3810777	Loki?
3811457	3820003	Hopefully it doesn't... Well, I know it's going to do a lot better than Wii Party because Wii Party was... Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about patent trolls.
3820123	3826348	Yes, there is another patent troll that came after Nintendo, suing them over the Wii Fit game and balance board.
3826428	3829090	I remember even seeing... It was the XR Station.
3829130	3831352	It was just this big lever thing that people squeeze...
3832453	3846604	It was actually showed, I guess, in 2008 as it was called Squeeze, S-Q-W-E-E-Z-E, and they had a Wii Remote peripheral or something like that.
3846884	3847285	It's weird.
3847705	3850127	But as you can imagine, they lost.
3850347	3852249	So, hooray!
3852609	3856012	I think that's like three trolls down and millions more to go.
3858564	3859084	Thanks for watching!
3878619	3880541	Yeah, that's pretty dumb.
3897002	3898623	Maybe they'll be able to get something pushed through.
3898783	3900925	Don't put it past them.
3901025	3913395	Honestly, as much as I'd hate to see a company controlling the government, if it's for some positive, that would be kind of nice.
3913415	3915296	Do you really want to finish this train of thought?
3917677	3918237	Just saying.
3919398	3920819	Think about what you're really saying.
3921580	3927784	If a corporation controlled the US, it might not be so bad if... If it was positive.
3928045	3929446	Remember, corporations are people.
3929746	3930166	Remember.
3930326	3931427	I'm not going to go there.
3933849	3935030	Did you want to finish your thought?
3936431	3937632	I already finished my thought.
3937652	3938152	Okay, all right.
3939013	3940634	I said if they did it for the positive.
3940674	3946038	Now, if they said, you know, fuck you, we own the patent system now, bitches, then, you know, that's a little different.
3947341	3951544	Alright, well, somebody that got told fuck you this week was the makers of The Binding of Isaac.
3951904	3955086	This is a popular indie title that is already out there on PC.
3955186	3961791	It's very Zelda-inspired, and so it would have felt right at home on the 3DS, but apparently those talks have broken down.
3962171	3972338	Binding of Isaac is from Team Meat, of course, the folks behind Super Meat Boy, and after a long internal debate, according to Twitter, Nintendo has decided not to allow The Binding of Isaac on the 3DS.
3972858	3977221	They're saying it's because of, quote, questionable religious content.
3978562	3982384	Now, Bobby, the guy before us here at All Games Radio, he wanted me to bring this up on the show.
3982465	3983725	He even said it at the end of his show.
3984226	3989689	Is it more questionable religious content or questionable resemblance to Legend of Zelda content?
3990530	3991150	I don't know.
3991431	3996514	I mean, you gotta... I don't know if that... I mean, I haven't really played The Binding of Isaac extensively.
3996554	3998695	I've listened to the soundtrack, though, oddly enough, but I haven't played the game.
3999356	4003539	VVVVV's got a lot in common with Metroid, so I don't know, but...
4005575	4006216	Interesting.
4007757	4014002	I guess part of the story is that it's a child running away after God tells the child's mother to sacrifice him.
4014062	4015443	Or a God-like voice, I should say.
4015503	4017905	Not like the God, but a God-like voice.
4018305	4021668	So maybe some of that questionable sacrifice and things.
4021948	4024190	If he read the Bible, he'd know Isaac got away.
4025150	4025590	Stop.
4025830	4026091	I know.
4027171	4027911	So, yeah.
4028411	4037155	Now, some further stuff that developed this week is that I want to read somewhere that, I don't know if this was Fanboy Wank, so take this with a grain of salt, but Team Meat's already in talks with Sony.
4038226	4041087	Which would be the likely alternative, go to the Vita.
4042328	4042688	Why not?
4043128	4048770	3D.GameHeroes was awfully a lot like a certain Nintendo classic, and it ended up on the PlayStation 3, so why not?
4048970	4057154	The thing, too, they were saying, you know, basically that maybe it's because it was M-rated or something like that, but there's a lot of M-rated content already on there, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D.
4058214	4059755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4078312	4090449	I mean, if you're not going to allow all sorts of content on your shop online what's the point in having all these content filters if you're going to filter it before it even gets out there?
4091232	4095734	It does seem like an interesting reason, but something to take with a grain of salt.
4095754	4097375	Remember, that reason is coming from Team Meat.
4097415	4098635	It's not coming from Nintendo.
4099055	4103017	Once again, though, this is kind of like a whole thing alluding to even the new console.
4103397	4107379	There's so much, even with the Wii, it was like... Well, maybe not so much with the Wii, but like...
4107919	4113583	They were like, okay, listen, we want to shed this kiddie game company thing.
4113763	4122668	We want to shed that kind of perception of us, and we really want to bring the hardcore gamer back into everything with our consoles.
4123108	4128031	And then, sure enough, when the Wii came out, let's put out kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.
4128492	4130473	Oh, and we'll put out all the games that might appeal to everybody.
4130553	4132334	Eh, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.
4132834	4141362	and then, you know, with this new console, hey, we're making a hardcore console that's gonna, you know, support all types of games and it's gonna be, you know, it's really gonna get the hardcore user back behind it.
4141843	4145826	And then it's gonna be kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games in HD.
4146087	4149730	But yeah, you may have, you know, Assassin's Creed or something like that because they can run it now.
4150831	4161557	Let me bring up this because Bobby's really kind of stressing his point here in the chat room about this and shares a screenshot and I totally get it because he's sharing the screenshot and it looks like the fucking Legend of Zelda.
4161677	4170642	I mean, the way on down to the little mini map with the rectangular rooms in the upper left hand corner, little spaces for the A and B buttons and your life meter.
4170682	4176385	I mean, the design of the screen and even the look of the dungeons, everything is the freaking Legend of Zelda.
4176785	4178186	Now, maybe it's not so much
4178726	4182887	The questionable religious content, but I think it might be a combination.
4183287	4186267	It's questionable religious content that sure looks a lot like Zelda.
4186307	4187708	We don't want people thinking Nintendo did this.
4187728	4190388	Now, who made the statement, though, about why it's not on the shop?
4190408	4190728	Team Meat.
4191288	4193269	Yeah, see, that's the thing.
4193549	4200430	I would think if it's Nintendo and they're saying, you know, this looks a little too much like The Legend of Zelda, that might look a little weird.
4201430	4205471	Because Team Meat would go, yeah, we couldn't get it on the store because it looks a little too much like The Legend of Zelda.
4205491	4206271	And people are like...
4206411	4211433	Yeah, I can kind of see that, but when they do the religious content, they're trying to throw some pressure towards...
4231701	4237126	Well, and people would think it's a Zelda game with all this questionable mom sacrifices the child.
4237146	4238368	What the hell kind of game is this?
4238488	4239609	I do agree people are stupid.
4239649	4242652	This is how we get Katy Perry collector's editions of The Sims.
4243633	4244273	This is true.
4246956	4248697	What about a Katy Perry Legend of Zelda?
4248717	4249558	Would that be offensive?
4250379	4251160	It wouldn't happen.
4252071	4253792	Yes, it would be offensive to everybody.
4255153	4255693	Everybody.
4255713	4261937	See, Rob, the only other person that I know who does those what-ifs about things that never happen is my friend's four-year-old.
4264439	4265859	What if this was a racetrack?
4266200	4267220	Then we would be racing.
4268361	4270302	But what if we were racing?
4270522	4271283	We're not racing.
4272412	4276777	So it doesn't really, I mean, yeah, the layout is Zelda-ish, but there's enough different.
4277137	4282983	And on top of that... Well, yeah, this screenshot that Bobby shared in the bottom right-hand corner, it says all stats up.
4283283	4285165	Well, Legend of Zelda didn't have stats.
4285586	4295716	Well, on top of that, if Nintendo was really going to be pushy about that, they could have gone after Newtopia back in the day, which was almost exactly like A Link to the Past.
4297422	4302025	This game is just down to the design of the freaking screen.
4302065	4305686	At least Utopia kind of looked a little different.
4307887	4311989	Team Meat should be ashamed of themselves for blatantly ripping off The Legend of Zelda.
4313270	4313970	No, they shouldn't.
4315751	4316031	Why?
4316111	4318172	I mean, let's play devil's advocate here.
4318713	4325656	If we're giving so much shit to Zynga for ripping off Tiny Tower, then why can't we give them shit for ripping off The Legend of Zelda?
4326212	4328753	They're not ripping it down to a T though.
4328813	4330594	Again, the original Zelda didn't have stats.
4332395	4334756	It did, but they weren't actually visible stats.
4334796	4339779	Because obviously, why would I pick up different armor or different swords if they all had the same stats?
4339839	4341340	I see blood in this game.
4341540	4342660	Did Zelda have blood?
4343141	4343921	Don't think it did.
4344301	4348503	It had sparkles, and sparkles meant violence.
4349264	4349924	And smoke.
4350264	4350944	There was smoke.
4350964	4351905	Where there's smoke, there's fire.
4353905	4354786	All right, I see your point.
4375797	4377318	Maybe a little bit of a rip-off, but let's see.
4377358	4379600	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4379620	4381461	Real quick, sorry to interrupt real quick.
4381841	4382662	But you do it so well.
4382842	4383142	I know.
4383642	4385163	Real quick question to DarkSakura.
4385404	4389366	You were talking about that one game that came out that was very similar to Link to the Past or whatever.
4389866	4391628	Did that have the Nintendo seal of approval?
4391668	4393529	Because that's basically approving the fact that
4393649	4394770	They like games that look like this.
4394870	4397472	It didn't come out on the NES.
4398573	4399533	It should still have the similar rule.
4399573	4400374	It was a TurboGrafx game.
4401135	4402035	Newtopia, Newtopia 2.
4402616	4408220	But they didn't push for any kind of copyright infringement or anything like that.
4409100	4411022	Even though it looked almost identical, it was a different game.
4411882	4412203	Fair enough.
4412363	4413624	Can we talk about the other classics now?
4413784	4415085	Yes, Sonic CD.
4416046	4417226	Oh, Sonic CD it is.
4418167	4419108	So much for that music.
4419528	4421490	We already played a bunch of it while Loki was talking.
4423671	4424992	I have to start from the beginning.
4425572	4428033	The Japanese version had better music.
4428853	4429153	Okay.
4429533	4430633	Rob, if you would do me a favor.
4431114	4434655	Because I'm going to get into the rest of this later, but I'd like for this to stay on.
4435015	4436655	Play the U.S.
4436695	4438196	music first, if you don't mind.
4438216	4440656	I just want to say, the YouTube here is really quiet.
4440796	4441477	Yeah, it is.
4441577	4441917	I'm sorry.
4442397	4443677	Let's see if the English one's any louder.
4443737	4443997	It is.
4444438	4444638	Okay.
4445338	4446678	Okay, now listen to this, everybody.
4449359	4451620	This is the first level in The Bad Future.
4453381	4454482	Skip just a little bit ahead.
4456983	4457583	Do you see that?
4457683	4461885	It has that kind of dark, jungly sound.
4462085	4466006	This sounds like one of those bands, the pan flute bands that play at the strip mall.
4466487	4467867	Play at Downtown Disney.
4468287	4469948	Now play the Japanese one.
4476611	4477791	All right, play the Japanese one.
4477811	4478132	Here you go.
4478152	4478352	Yeah.
4480376	4481496	Sonic the Hedgehog CD
4500582	4504766	and it was the first appearance of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose.
4505647	4512073	It came out in Japan on September 23, 1993, in Europe in October 1993, in North America on November 19, 1993.
4514095	4522203	It came out on the PC in 1996 and was included in the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005 for PS2 and GameCube.
4522363	4524865	There was an enhanced version that was just recently released.
4525726	4532973	and December 2001 on Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, iOS and Android and then we have a PC version that came out January 19, 2012.
4533053	4538899	There is supposed to be a Windows Phone version coming out first quarter 2012.
4540180	4541341	Just thought I would mention that too.
4542100	4545901	So basically, for anyone who's played a Sonic game, this is a freaking Sonic game.
4546161	4547501	He has the spin dash.
4548621	4549642	You collect the rings.
4549682	4552262	You go underwater, which I hate underwater levels.
4552622	4554923	You had the invincibility shield.
4555063	4556963	You had the speed shoes.
4558784	4559444	The music ran out.
4559464	4560804	Should I play some other tracks here?
4560824	4561444	Yeah, play some other.
4561744	4563285	Let's do Palm Tree Panic Zone.
4563305	4563885	That sounds like fun.
4565326	4568427	That's actually the present version of that same level.
4569648	4572910	Which they did a remixed version of this one slower for the American one.
4573930	4575311	So anyway.
4575791	4582235	So yeah, you also have with the spin dash you have the super peel out that lets you zoom into quick speed from a standing point.
4583176	4584797	Either rolling or in running position.
4585137	4588639	And it's faster than the spin dash but it leaves Sonic more vulnerable.
4589324	4616404	and then each of the levels has three acts you have two main levels and a boss act and one thing I have to say is that the boss levels are actually pretty neat because it's kind of a departure from the way that the normal boss levels went like one of the ones that I did right before I left was one where you chase Eggman or Robotnik for people who are sticklers for the American version you chase Eggman all the way through the level until you've got him busted so it's pretty cool
4617389	4619031	Thanks for watching!
4637712	4650815	Now, if you go into the future by default, then you go into a bad future, where it's basically over-industrialized and everything is, you know, dead and decaying and awful.
4652256	4659198	You go into the past, it's like, for example, I always forget the name of it, like something Chaos Collision, I think it is.
4659738	4663759	But I always refer to it as pretty much the Casino Night, because it's like...
4664779	4668082	Every Sonic game that has a pinball theme in there.
4668843	4670504	And it's not the freaking Chemical Zone, thank God.
4670885	4677831	But anyway, instead of it being all pinball-y and, you know, nighttime casino looking, it's...
4680276	4683658	Like this neat looking pristine jungle thing.
4684238	4685358	It's really cool looking.
4687499	4701285	But if you've managed to do a lot of good things and destroy things in the past, then when you go to the future again, instead of going back to the modern... You have to basically go through the past and destroy a robot generator that's hidden in the level.
4701825	4709029	So that when you go back in the regular time and then you go to the future again, you're sort of in this Technogion future where everything is...
4710049	4718956	Technology and nature all working together, synergy, you know, it's just... What kind of hippie stuff is this?
4719237	4723700	Yeah, it's clean energy and, you know, everything is cool.
4724461	4725381	We're sustainable.
4725542	4727763	That's the big, you know, key word, sustainable today.
4730045	4738792	So basically, you know, in the past, when you destroy the robot generator, then that actually kills all the robots in the future.
4740113	4751639	So when you have to go after Robotnik for his level, because his level is always in a bad future, you actually go after him in a good future where he's weaker and you don't have all of the bad guys in your way.
4753095	4754076	It's really unique.
4754817	4764847	So also if you have more than 50 rings, by the end of the act a big gold ring appears and if you jump onto it, then you have to go around and destroy these purple UFOs that are floating around the level.
4765548	4775418	And it's kind of that sort of Mario Kart looking, like old school Mario Kart looking pathway where it's all the pixelated, you know, Mode 70 looking stuff.
4776799	4780701	And you can... You slow down by going through water.
4780761	4781982	You can get speed-ups through there.
4782042	4785424	You can destroy blue UFOs that give you more time.
4786025	4789026	Or you can get speed shoes and different things.
4789066	4795470	But if you destroy all of the purple UFOs, then you get a time stone.
4795690	4798272	And you can get the good ending if you collect all seven time stones.
4798592	4801473	Basically, it's this game's version of Chaos Emeralds.
4803435	4803635	So...
4806801	4810484	Basically, though, you automatically get that good feature if you have all the time.
4810524	4816609	So you also have a backup save using either the internal memory on the Sega CD or a RAM cartridge.
4817670	4819452	And it'll save at the end of every third act.
4819572	4824496	What I can tell you, too, is that it saves automatically the same way on the Steam version.
4825196	4828059	You see the little now-saving icon at the bottom.
4828079	4829980	That's cool.
4831562	4832462	And it does have...
4834961	4844369	An instant game over scenario, so Sonic will just jump off the screen if you leave the game alone for three minutes without it being paused.
4845550	4849132	Now for the newer version, you can actually play as Tails.
4849773	4851694	Or I should say Miles Tails Prower.
4852635	4861602	And he has a spin dash, the spin attack, and he can fly with his little tail rotating, but he doesn't have the super peel out and you cannot earn achievements with him.
4863503	4865725	You can also use the Spin Dash physics from Sonic 2.
4865765	4867145	So that's pretty cool.
4868746	4882393	So basically the way that this goes is that Sonic and Amy, Amy Rose, show up at Never Lake where the little planet, not the little big planet, just the little planet, shows up the last month of every year.
4882433	4884254	So it's month of the time, basically.
4885434	4902800	and uh they basically find out that Eggman's taking it over and things are getting crappy and then Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy oh no so Sonic has to go get the time zones the time stones and the seven jewels that alter time and save Amy and destroy Sonic and free the little big I mean the little planet
4903695	4910261	See, at this game, actually, Yuji Naka moved to the U.S.
4910782	4916066	to found the Sega Technical Institute and worked with Sonic Team to make Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
4916667	4929879	But in Japan, a separate development team that was headed by Oshima Naoto, who was the creator of Sonic, worked on Sonic CD, and they were supposed to be the same game, just a Sega CD version and a cartridge version.
4930379	4931841	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4946683	4947424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4962643	4964446	and Cosmic Eternity Believe in Yourself.
4965267	4974702	And the boss music also sampled the song Work That Sucker to Death by 70s artists Xavier Bootsy Collins and George Clinton.
4974722	4975824	So basically Parliament.
4977006	4977306	Nice.
4977507	4977747	Yeah.
4980203	4992112	So, um, and, uh, now the US one was actually, uh, redone completely by, um, Spencer Nilsson, who did a bunch of Sega Saturn soundtracks.
4993013	4997036	So, uh, and then there was that Sonic Boom song that was redone.
4998647	5004689	So yeah, I really think... I mean, I'm not saying that the American soundtrack was bad by any means.
5004789	5005350	It's not.
5005410	5006210	It was really good.
5006770	5010532	But in comparison to the Japanese soundtrack, there's no comparison.
5010572	5012292	The Japanese soundtrack was way amazing.
5013253	5013793	So, um...
5015254	5027819	There actually, as far as that Sonic You Can Do Anything and the Cosmic Eternity Believe in Yourself, the reason why we have an instrumental version is that the lyrics belong to Casey Rankin, who died in 2009.
5028640	5032521	So the rights haven't been released by the estate.
5033582	5039625	There is a 20th anniversary soundtrack that came out in Japan that actually has a version of Sonic Boom on it.
5040945	5042567	including a remastered Japanese track.
5043467	5044768	So as I said, there were other ports.
5045569	5054597	We had a PC version in 1996, which was the debut Sonic title under Sega PC's brand.
5055818	5061002	It came out in Japan on August 9th, 1996, in North America on August 26th, 1996, and in Europe October 3rd, 1996.
5062763	5067225	and it has a full animated intro and ending sequence.
5067806	5078191	Not just that really clipped looking one that came on the Sega CD because it really didn't handle the heavy animations like that as we've all known for anyone of us who had ever owned a copy of Dragon's Lair.
5078651	5080752	Just saying, Dragon's Lair, not all that great.
5082401	5087025	It was also re-released with the Sonic Gems Collection on the GameCube and PS2 in 2005.
5087666	5093290	And it's the PC version with improved frame rate and action speed.
5095172	5097734	And it did have some emulation errors, though.
5099095	5126149	and the European version actually of that one used the US soundtrack but had higher quality versions of it and then as I said we've got the Xbox Live Arcade version that was playable at PAX Prime 2011 and we've got the versions on PSN, PC, iOS, Windows Phone coming out and there's Android and then the port was actually redeveloped by Scratch using this retro engine
5126949	5129290	So that's why it's so nice and smooth.
5129390	5131110	And now we have it on Steam.
5131911	5133411	And it's excellent on Steam.
5133491	5134051	And it's only $4.
5134912	5135972	You owe it to yourself to buy this.
5136552	5137592	Commercial, commercial, commercial.
5139593	5140853	I'm running out of soundtrack songs here.
5140953	5142234	Okay, well, done.
5143294	5143914	Well, that was quick.
5144295	5144995	All right, there it is.
5145555	5150236	Actually, just telling you, the Sonic CD story was what became the Sonic the comic.
5151217	5155238	And the story was adapted into the Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog comic book.
5156667	5159288	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic CD!
5159468	5161329	Confession, I've never played it.
5162289	5162550	I know.
5163570	5169473	There's a lot of Sonic games out there, and I never owned a Sega system, so I had to kind of play them all at friends' houses, or like, you know, in retrospect.
5169493	5179957	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob
5179977	5180558	I'm poor!
5181759	5182299	Maybe later.
5183060	5183641	I'll tell you what.
5184282	5186304	When I beat Uncharted and Mod Nation Racers, I'll buy it.
5186324	5186804	Good lord.
5186824	5188186	Alright, I gotta beat something.
5188766	5189007	Alright.
5189327	5190348	I got something you can beat.
5190428	5190989	Oh, shut up.
5191069	5195173	Alright, we're gonna take a break and when we come back, we got plenty more of Orange Launch Radio to come.
5195473	5196635	A new segment here on the show.
5196695	5197215	Get excited.
5197796	5200459	Some news about Street Fighter Cross Tech and I don't think you're gonna like.
5200579	5201600	I know Loki doesn't like it.
5202880	5231011	maybe a mailbag segment FUs of the week and I apologize in advance yes we are somehow going to bring up Justin Bieber and relate it to video games I am so so sorry but you really have to hear this story don't disconnect there's a reason just trust me the Justin Bieber singing toothbrush is compatible with Xbox Live Arcade it is not shush don't make stuff up alright we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio stay tuned
5237256	5237796	Thanks for watching!
5256944	5258806	and sometimes we'll field questions from chat.
5258826	5269773	For example, we have somebody in chat right now that's Evil or E3VL wants to know, anyone know if the Vita trophies are separate from PlayStation 3 or is it all cumulative?
5270413	5276557	It's interesting because it looks like they are cumulative because when you look at your trophies on the Vita, you see everything.
5276958	5280200	But when you look at them in the PlayStation 3, you don't see the Vita games.
5280760	5281821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5310800	5312000	You play a lot of PlayStation.
5312761	5317982	Alright, so we're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first I want to bring up a couple quick things.
5318962	5327025	One, I have to follow up to this interesting Twitter discussion that I caught wind of earlier this week between a listener of ours at Orange Lounge Radio and...
5327785	5356592	a guy at another podcast and a lot of you I know are very familiar with the website CheapAssGamer and the guy behind the website CheapyD who I got to admit I don't have time to listen to every podcast I'm sorry so I don't really listen to the show but I've seen the website it's a great concept great idea I'm sure he's done very well for himself off of that he's a fan of Saints Row 3 I know that and so we're in good company I think with that we were big fans of Saints Row 3 too but I guess well
5357092	5359654	I was going to say, actually, I should get that on Steam now that it's half price.
5360194	5360974	I think that's the sale.
5361014	5363256	Boy, you're like a walk-in commercial tonight, young lady.
5363376	5364096	I can't help it.
5364156	5364876	I love Steam.
5364916	5366097	You are a consumer whore.
5366157	5368639	So do they have that console on their way to your house already?
5369199	5370640	So here's the reason why I bring it up.
5370700	5375302	Because I guess something was said on the last show about what's the oldest podcast.
5375722	5378204	And they were wondering if at seven years it might be them.
5378704	5381866	I think, I didn't hear it again, I'm just picking up on what I got for Twitter.
5381886	5384748	So if I misappropriated that quote, I totally apologize in advance.
5385148	5393013	But one of our listeners jumped in and actually tweeted him and said, actually, Orange Lounge Radio has been doing this for 10 years.
5393413	5398617	And I just thought that was really awesome that one of our listeners kind of like jumped in there, Henderson Mann, so big thank you to that.
5399157	5403200	And you know, that's why I'm always very careful about jumping in, you know,
5403680	5404901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5426198	5429639	I did not know what All Games Interactive was before we hooked up with the show.
5430159	5433780	I did not know this whole pseudo stuff and everything that Scott Rubin had before G4.
5434200	5436781	I didn't know any of that stuff before we joined forces with them.
5436821	5438401	So that's why I'm always a little nervous.
5438521	5442442	I think we're the longest running live show about video games.
5442722	5443902	We're one of the.
5444042	5445162	That's the protection.
5445283	5445903	One of the.
5446743	5447483	That's our little protection.
5447503	5448964	Diction, because we don't know what else is out there.
5449044	5450385	Really, we're the most important.
5450846	5451686	Stop it, stop it.
5452247	5455910	But it's alright, you just have to know that we are the official podcast of the planet Earth.
5456330	5461354	That's right, that claim we staked a long time ago and I'm sorry buddy, it's ours.
5461534	5462515	You can lease it for a quarter.
5463135	5480264	Um, just to clear the air on a few things though, just so we set the record straight, the very first Orange Lounge Radio Live, a show all about DDR and music-based games and community and, you know, talking shit at the restaurant after a long night of playing DDR, was June 23rd, 2002, at Live 365, where we used to have a station.
5482605	5510963	and we released our first podcast January 3rd of 2005 it was a separate show at the time called the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition because for a while we were here in studio for about four and a half hours we would do our live three hour music game community show and then we do our hey guys it's only gonna be 20 minutes show on other games that grew into an hour I mean just the the talk about other games really took over and that is why in 2006 we
5511903	5535280	we merged the two shows and because you know the music game stuff was not you know we didn't have enough community things to talk about everything was getting very centralized with people playing at home and so forth so that all started I think we married him in 2006 or so I think it was about a year of the to-go show and then we married him in 2006 I would like to think that this is their bastard stepchild when we did that it was so much fun
5536354	5537515	Yes, it was so much fun.
5537836	5539137	And then you shot yourself in the foot.
5539357	5544681	Now, SSG100Matt says, yeah, but OLR has to be the first live podcast to use Skype.
5545041	5546683	You used Skype when it was in beta form.
5547323	5550446	I do think we have that claim.
5550706	5552107	I really do.
5552127	5557351	Because I was looking around the internet at that time, so I don't think anybody else was using Skype in a radio format to take calls at the time.
5557371	5560814	But again, I'm nervous to stake that claim because I don't know what else is out there.
5561414	5564076	Okay, we are the first proven.
5566418	5567659	We are documented.
5567859	5573243	So if somebody else can provide their documentation that they did it before us, we'll happily relinquish the title.
5573363	5576185	But to be fair, I mean, it's not a title we really use.
5576225	5577186	Relinquish more like share.
5578405	5581008	We really are the podcast of the universe.
5581688	5582429	All right, you guys.
5582449	5586714	Apparently what was supposed to be a humble thing turned into not so much.
5586734	5587335	No, no, no.
5587615	5594023	But look, guys, we don't... There's a reason we don't want to just whore ourselves as we're the longest running video game podcast.
5594043	5594503	Because, you know...
5597086	5626561	everybody that's doing this podcast having done it this long we can tell you first hand it's not that easy it takes a lot of dedication so you know what seven years is a fucking great accomplishment so props to you know and the service that the CheapAssGamer show provides to the community is amazing and you know lots of people really rely on that website you know to drive their game sales so props to their great idea that's taken off and has held for the past seven years I know there's a lot of shows that have been running for a very long time there's a lot of shows on this network
5626921	5627582	DeadPixelLive.com
5644042	5645043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5672900	5675001	What could be more American than that, even though he lives in Japan?
5675261	5678183	My problem is my wife would not let me spend that kind of money on that.
5678804	5681966	If I hadn't met my wife, I'd be in Saints Row the Third.
5683891	5711116	but now you have a mini mat that is true and I still am in Saints Row the Third thanks to their awesome character I don't want to discuss this too much longer because this feels very self-serving but let me address a couple of the comments in chat Technus in chat says so you guys were around during the days when I still listen to Adam Curry's podcast to find more podcasts to listen to yes and in fact we were nominated or we won the best gaming podcast at the first podcast awards Jamie Wint I shook his hand and she sat right behind his hair
5711856	5738204	and his butt actually his butt was by my head for a while you're weird I was sick okay I'm at this thing sick as sick can be in LA so I'm even sicker because LA air you know disagrees with me I turn around and I see this black clad ass look up see the the the shaggy you know Bon Jovi haircut and oh it's Adam Curry I remember watching it on my TV
5739601	5757482	um let's see um Randy says what were podcasts called before podcasts I don't think they really had a name it was audio via RSS but I've I know they tried to do blog cast like for a long time major Nelson would not call a show a podcast or there was Zune cast or you know because you know Xbox Microsoft didn't want to give into the Apple thing
5759002	5759503	Let's see.
5761663	5764904	SSJ100Matt says, it's the Humble Indie Podcast Bundle segment.
5765004	5765904	I love that idea.
5766565	5769245	They should do something like that, the Humble Indie Podcast Bundle.
5770346	5771806	Raise $30,000 for charity.
5771846	5772446	I love that idea.
5774347	5777668	And SSJ100Matt says, I remember getting the show off Podcast Alley.
5777948	5779568	You know Podcast Alley still exists.
5779648	5783509	Go vote for Orange Lounge Radio to go, which is still listed in Podcast Alley.
5783790	5784430	We need your votes.
5784530	5784830	Lord.
5786652	5787953	I didn't smell his fart.
5788534	5789495	Acidic vampire.
5789575	5790696	You chatters are weird.
5791277	5792919	But I was so sick.
5793019	5795081	And after we got the award, I'm like, I'm leaving.
5795141	5796923	I feel so sick.
5797925	5800468	Look, I want to say quickly...
5801966	5821181	I just realized I left shows out of my how long video game I think if there is a show that's been around as long as we have it's video game news radio for real like I know they were on live to survive for a while too I don't know when exactly they started so they may be able to make the claim but they've also they went non video game for a while and then kind of went back but they're
5821801	5825784	It's so funny because we couldn't have more different makeup of shows.
5826305	5827546	They're also on All Games Network.
5827566	5828006	You can hear them.
5828026	5828807	I think they're Monday nights.
5829968	5831429	But I respect them a lot.
5831589	5837573	I know they work very hard at what they do, and it takes a lot to focus on the show every week, and they bring it.
5838234	5846720	Well, speaking, though, of our 10th anniversary coming up, I would like to repeat what I said last week, that I want people to email the mailbag.
5847721	5848001	All right.
5848122	5848542	Okay, I have to...
5871619	5873181	I don't want to do too much of this reflection.
5873221	5875023	This is the last comment on it and then I'm done.
5875263	5879849	I was not sick from smelling his butt.
5880349	5886036	I remember when you guys went to the award show and where they didn't announce your nomination and you guys yelled at them in the back.
5887177	5888498	I won speakers that day.
5888798	5898742	If there is any moment that better defines our legacy, I mean for real, that is the moment that defined Orange Lounge Radio and I'll tell you exactly when it was.
5898782	5902663	It was the Live 365, Best of Live 365 Awards, I want to say 2004.
5903003	5908306	So when we went to that airport hotel out by SFO and we were sitting in the back.
5908346	5909106	Had the big atrium.
5909426	5937257	and we were nominated for station of the year which was amazing but they're reading the nominees for station of the year and the station of the year nominees are Rockland USA and you know all these other stations and then she starts to open the envelope and when you hear the audio recording of it and I wish to god I still had that clip you can hear in the background Loki going hey hey and she goes oh oh yeah yeah and Orange Launch Radio and we all sat there going well we know we didn't fucking win drink
5938777	5940138	I was quite drunk that night.
5940578	5944460	But that was when they did the bingo thing and I won speakers.
5944500	5945060	You did.
5945560	5949402	So we may not have walked out of there with a plastic award, but we did walk out of there with speakers.
5949442	5950423	You walked out of there with speakers.
5950463	5951203	I didn't get shit.
5952064	5953665	I got some cool pictures out on the patio.
5953705	5954165	That's what I got.
5954185	5955686	We got a bunch of sampler CDs.
5956106	5956366	All right.
5956946	5957507	Let's move on.
5957707	5959808	I have one other topic I want to talk about before Rapid Fire News.
5959848	5962169	It's a game I left out of my gaming week, but it's worth mentioning.
5963476	5964616	iPhone game, believe it or not.
5965857	5967517	And I think it's a pretty damn good iPhone game.
5967577	5973198	It's 99 cents right now on the marketplace, which is a really good deal for the Midway Arcade Classics Collection.
5973718	5976519	And yes, it's another one of those retro game collections on the iPhone.
5976559	5980460	And I've got to say, though, they do a pretty damn good job of it, especially for 99 cents.
5981220	5985421	It does a little bit of the, you know, hey, do you want to play Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2?
5986041	5988882	Well, then you pay 99 cents for this pack, right?
5988982	6007351	but actually you can also unlock those machines if you play the others for a god awful long time you save up tickets and you can unlock the cabinets that way or you just pay 99 cents to unlock them right away which is kind of interesting they did it that way but what I really thought was interesting about it is that there's not just the classic arcade games in it but there's
6008712	6024891	air hockey and uh... skeeball and the basketball little games you find in an arcade like they really went kind of a step beyond in making it that whole arcade experience now don't get too excited it's an IOS game and I still cannot stand
6025652	6028134	IOS controls, like trying to emulate the old school arcade games.
6028495	6031257	But some of them that have the limited mobility work pretty well.
6031317	6033719	Like in Joust, you could only go left or right.
6033999	6035941	That's pretty hard to screw up with the touch controls.
6036001	6037122	So it controls alright.
6037522	6039644	Spy Hunter, they do this weird thing with the tilt controls.
6039684	6042406	I'm not sure if I'm a fan, but it is what it is.
6043227	6043547	99 cents.
6044128	6044888	But I was thinking...
6045769	6045829	No.
6045869	6046310	Hell no.
6061008	6062049	I mean, what's up with that?
6062429	6065290	Why is it the games are only bargain cheap on iOS?
6065911	6072414	Is this really... Competition, because they allow them to price their games the way they are.
6073395	6074856	These other platforms have minimums.
6074916	6077217	Okay, you can't price your game lower than such.
6077797	6084421	And because of that, that's why you don't get a lot of 99... Well, that's why you don't get any 99 cent games on these marketplaces.
6084841	6088643	If it was more open and allowed them to do that kind of thing, then yeah, you would have a lot more of those.
6088863	6109598	I still even think for like $4.99 on the 3DS shop this would be a hell of a download with all the stuff that it includes but I just I don't see it happening and it's so odd like this game would be so much better with the tangible controls but like they'll probably put it on a cartridge for $19.99 if they even do that you know I don't know they'll say the 3D costs money
6109818	6136463	it's old arcade games I don't know again I'm hypothesizing but I just I really wish when I play some of these really good iOS games I'm always like damn it why can't this be on the Vita or the Vita would be amazing really with that crisp screen and it's already kind of the oh man it would look great some of those games but I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna hold my breath because I know it ain't gonna happen but I just imagine imagine I could tilt my Vita sideways and use the analog stick to control Spy Hunter it would be great
6137651	6145469	But I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it's not going to happen I'm sorry, I was distracted by everyone telling me that Capcom should hire me
6148140	6148961	Waited to derail.
6149382	6149662	Alright.
6150803	6151884	Ten years of derailment.
6152225	6154467	I have a promise, though.
6155188	6163338	If Capcom hires me, I will make manuals that are available for print and PDF, web-friendly PDF, that have working links.
6164319	6164860	Just for Bobby.
6164980	6165681	And it will be spelled right.
6165981	6166942	And it will be spelled right.
6167062	6167343	Alright.
6167723	6168003	There you go.
6168684	6169925	All right, let's talk about some rapid-fire news.
6170005	6174148	I've babbled long enough about various side topics, so let's get to some rapid-fire news.
6174848	6180112	All right, let's talk a little bit about Ridge Racer.
6180833	6185376	Ridge Racer, a game that was supposed to be launching with the Vita, kind of didn't.
6185576	6194082	It got delayed a little bit, and I had hoped, hey, maybe they'll put out a full game instead of five cars and three tracks.
6197384	6197825	Not so much.
6198145	6201286	Anyways, Ridge Racer is coming to the Vita March 19th.
6201386	6222717	There will be some DLC, free DLC, included with, I guess, if you purchase the initial retail copies will include the Ridge Racer Gold Pass, which allows you to get five additional cars and three bonus tracks and two new songs and an extended remix of an existing song.
6223858	6223938	Um...
6226062	6234669	And apparently, also, I guess you can purchase the game on the PlayStation Network store for, you know, the 10% cheaper, $24.99 as well.
6235469	6237231	And it also includes the Gold Pass stuff.
6237611	6247218	Then, I guess, if you purchase before April 30th, an additional Silver Pass DLC pack will be available as well.
6247358	6249080	They haven't announced the price for it yet.
6249620	6260971	Also, aside from DLC, they're going to have, I guess, a system update which includes better frame rate, better graphics, and that's about it.
6261452	6264274	But, I mean, come on.
6264535	6264975	Really?
6265556	6265956	Really?
6266156	6270280	Your free DLC is three more or five more cars?
6270320	6272743	You're literally doubling the cars and tracks in the game?
6273563	6299377	and you were you know that would be a pretty awesome deal in any air racing game 10 cars and six tracks I mean come on I remember back with Ridge Racer 4 where it was fucking like 200 cars in the goddamn game and tracks I don't even know I mean a lot of them were just you know deviations of one another but I mean come on that few tracks for if you were putting the game out for free
6300003	6300644	All right, fine.
6301085	6301525	That's fine.
6301545	6304950	That's a good starter pack, and I'll buy DLC for it and get some additional cars.
6305030	6305170	But $30?
6305771	6308294	That's ridiculous.
6308795	6311538	I'm not impressed with Namco's approach to this stuff.
6312059	6314282	Again, it's the whole IOS.
6314542	6317065	It's taking the IOS mentality now and putting it on the Vita.
6317766	6318466	It's just weird.
6319546	6321607	I hope people educate themselves.
6322247	6324428	You've got to be a big fucking Ridge Racer fan to want to buy this.
6324908	6326788	Here's something to educate yourselves on.
6327468	6329349	Just wait for the price to drop.
6329809	6339351	Because if it's something like this, people are going to bring in new copies, and they're not going to sell, and they're going to be sitting on shelves, and it'll drop in price, and then you get that DLC on top of it.
6339571	6341151	A comment from Derek H in our chatroom.
6341251	6343732	So they're admitting the graphics are crapped in the first version.
6344132	6347593	That is kind of a weird thing for them to say this in advance.
6347613	6349233	Yeah, crisper graphics.
6350654	6353555	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things they should have kept a secret until it comes out, you know?
6354355	6355255	Yeah.
6355595	6362757	Well, maybe it's some depth of field adjustments or something like that, but... Ahamkara in our chatroom says, Ridge failure!
6364164	6366606	Outlook Not Good Yeah, it's unfortunate
6385765	6386966	Thanks for watching!
6403699	6405000	No, I don't think that's the case in this.
6405320	6408963	I think it's just like, hey, we're just going to sell a bunch of DLC.
6409043	6409923	Cha-ching!
6409943	6412385	That's... I don't know.
6412765	6413506	It's not going to happen.
6413806	6418349	Oh, and of course, are they going to advertise to their fans that this game is going to be that gimped?
6418469	6418929	Of course not.
6419049	6421551	It's up for the blogs to let people know about that.
6422251	6423172	Alright, anyways, enough of that.
6423592	6427595	So let's talk a little bit about a rumored sequel to a franchise.
6427815	6430317	Army of Four has apparently been outed by a...
6433439	6452598	I love this Twitter post actually apparently there is a guy who was I believe one of the actors on Stargate Atlantis John Shepard or Joe Flanagan he plays a guy named John Shepard on Stargate Atlantis
6453319	6462288	And apparently he's been asked to do some, I guess, voice work on the, well, it says AO4 video game for electronic cars.
6462389	6464551	Well, duh, it's going to be Army of Four.
6464591	6467955	I mean, that's, it only makes sense that that's what it's going to be.
6468595	6470638	So, kind of neat.
6471318	6473481	Maybe something we'll see announced at E3.
6475322	6480785	And last but not least, there was tons and tons and tons of leaks before finally it being officially announced.
6480825	6488348	Assassin's Creed 3 will be coming to consoles and PC this October on the 30th.
6488488	6491790	The new game is going to take place during the American Revolution.
6492330	6499253	You're going to play a guy who looks to be Native American and of course having tomahawks and all sorts of cool stuff.
6500133	6500294	And...
6502256	6511393	I guess there's going to be some more info coming in the new Game Informer it's the April cover game but definitely a big franchise
6512236	6514218	Yeah, I was hearing a lot of rumblings about that.
6514258	6520905	Seems like some of the Assassin's Creed fans aren't really... I mean, I don't... Like Uncharted, it's a series I haven't really had time to play.
6521946	6524969	But about five years after the first game, I'll finally get around to it.
6525629	6529613	It seems like a lot of fans I know on Facebook are kind of cautious about the direction this game is taking.
6529954	6533077	I mean, some people are like, yeah, I knew it would be like a Revolutionary War type of game.
6533117	6536100	And some are like, I'm not sure how I feel about this direction.
6538194	6538514	We'll see.
6538795	6539376	Alright, we'll see.
6539536	6541801	I guess at the end of the day, how good is the game?
6541981	6542843	That's the important thing, right?
6542863	6543003	Yep.
6543704	6546009	He could be in space as long as the game is good.
6546049	6547511	Assassin's Creed in space!
6549744	6553447	Assassins in Space Connect Enabled Shopping Carts Connect Enabled Shopping Carts
6570640	6572741	Apparently the cart can see your membership card.
6573041	6574301	It will pull up your shopping list.
6574341	6576782	It will scan objects as you place them in the cart.
6577202	6580503	And I guess the cart will actually follow you around the store.
6581304	6583104	So like while you're walking, it will follow you.
6583164	6584305	This is fucking Skynet right here.
6584325	6585585	I have to go to the bathroom.
6587366	6591467	This is not going to fit in the stall.
6592747	6594188	Stop writing it to me, damn it.
6598615	6599735	The Old Homeless Ladies
6623067	6627229	My farts are organic and smell... What?
6627369	6638953	Well, right along those lines, actually, apparently in the video it talks about the spokesperson puts the wrong type of spaghetti in the cart and the cart warns him, you're trying to go gluten-free.
6640583	6642185	Remember, you're a pansy.
6643927	6644748	I can't not look.
6644808	6646430	I can't not diet.
6646730	6652196	I do have friends who have celiac disease, and it's serious business.
6652216	6653137	It's a serious, I know, I know.
6653157	6654238	Okay, but I don't think that guy does.
6654258	6654719	Let's be real.
6654799	6656120	Some people do it to be trendy.
6656621	6662107	I think, to be honest, a guy that's walking around with a Kinect-enabled shopping cart is probably doing it to be trendy.
6664255	6665056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6682731	6683932	and you could actually look up items.
6683952	6685132	Like it was kind of ahead of its time.
6685152	6689074	That's cool and doesn't look ridiculous like having a Kinect camera strapped to a shopping cart.
6689094	6690895	Where it's following you around the store.
6690915	6691835	I mean, come on.
6692775	6696637	That's the setup for like a really bad 3D horror movie.
6696717	6698918	Like, which by the way, Piranha 3DD.
6699458	6701199	Oh my fucking God, that looks amazing.
6701559	6706061	But this could be like a great shopping cart 3D horror movie.
6706381	6709643	Like the day the shopping carts took over with Christopher Lloyd and...
6710191	6712540	All I gotta say is hobos are gonna go high tech now.
6714594	6718575	It's like the homeless is like, fuck, I got Kinect and a TV.
6719075	6722596	All right, Kid Icarus Uprising, of course, a big game coming out on the 3DS soon.
6722716	6726137	Your copy will come with six AR cards, but here's the thing.
6726457	6729818	There's actually going to be hundreds of AR cards available.
6730158	6734359	There will be events where you can kind of trade and get new cards and this whole thing.
6734419	6742181	So an interesting kind of real-life card Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh magic type of eye of judgment.
6742541	6742761	Ooh!
6744338	6745038	I'm sorry, what?
6746139	6746499	I don't know.
6747179	6750441	Let's see what it adds to the game or if it's just something stupid.
6751021	6756623	But apparently the cards can face each other and the AR figures will battle.
6757543	6759104	Where the fuck did I hear this before?
6759264	6762385	Where did we raz this a million times over?
6762405	6764026	This sounds so familiar.
6764126	6766587	The cards come to life.
6767087	6768308	And they battle.
6768908	6773310	And they do things that you can't just do with the cards on the table.
6773610	6774171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6791723	6796086	For the record, SSJ100Matt says he's still waiting for Supermarket Sweep the game.
6796626	6802390	You know, I have a bad feeling that that Kid Icarus game is just gonna tank.
6803191	6804912	Gonna tank so bad.
6805392	6806193	Because you know why?
6806473	6810015	Because no one gives a damn about Kid Icarus.
6810235	6810976	You shut your mouth.
6811016	6811636	Now, hey, hey.
6812236	6816739	Now, I know that the hardcore gamer cares about Kid Icarus, but that's not who they're targeting.
6817200	6819101	I mean, Kid Icarus is basically...
6821363	6825266	You know, it's fucking... Oh, I don't know.
6826547	6829229	It's a hardcore shmup game and no one's going to give a damn.
6829649	6831831	Could you imagine a Kid Icarus bullet hell game?
6832031	6836635	Since we now know their similarities, would you care to make a wager on if Kid Icarus will sell a million copies?
6837235	6839016	No, I do not care to wager that.
6840237	6840898	Damn, I tried.
6840918	6842859	Because that doesn't have any additional peripherals.
6842979	6846983	And I'm not going to bet whether the cards are going to sell a million copies because there's no way to track that.
6848924	6849725	I'm still buying it.
6851291	6852712	I gotta, look, there's a little bit of a delay.
6852952	6854112	I mean, and here's the thing too.
6855112	6861775	Why would I go buy cards when I can simply download the images of cards and print them out for free?
6862075	6866776	So fuck you, I ain't buying no fucking cards for your stupid game.
6867677	6869197	And also not your game because I don't have a 3DS anymore.
6869217	6874479	But what if there's like a rare one in a glass case at the Nintendo World Store and it's the only place where you can get the Eggplant Wizard...
6874739	6876941	If only we had a camera with us.
6877301	6881144	If only some sort of device that I was carrying had a camera on it.
6881544	6888870	Well, maybe a phone or an MP3 player or perhaps a game console, a portable game console.
6888890	6891112	If only one of those had a camera on it.
6891312	6898757	But goddammit, I live in an age where cameras are only available in camera form and not in any other peripheral whatsoever.
6898958	6900619	I see DDR Dollar Bill liked my idea.
6902605	6917694	I gotta read this comment, it's on the last story, but it's too good Actdeft in our chatroom says, chopping cart, grocery shopping will never be the same As long as it's in 3D with titties Have you seen the Piranha 3DD trailer?
6917894	6922097	Hey, come on, it's Piranha 3DD Have you seen it?
6922737	6925359	I have seen it DarkSakura, have you seen it?
6925919	6926420	Do I care?
6926460	6928341	I'm derailing the fucking show, I don't even care
6928761	6929021	No.
6929441	6929581	No.
6929841	6930122	I care.
6930142	6930702	You have to see this.
6930742	6931422	I can't remember.
6931562	6932742	I have temporary amnesia.
6932762	6937704	This is the most amazing fucking movie trailer I have ever seen in my entire life and it is worth derailing the show.
6937724	6940065	You know the only movie I give a crap about is The Avengers.
6941065	6941786	Because Hawkeye.
6941866	6942166	Here it is.
6942426	6943386	3DD official trailer.
6943406	6944066	Hawkeye.
6944086	6945527	This movie looks fucking amazing.
6946707	6949028	Oh, they should make a video game out of it.
6949108	6950509	There, I've tied it back to the show.
6951269	6955810	In the world's wildest water park, the party has never been hotter.
6956791	6957431	It's a good time.
6958312	6961115	Tell me you did not replace our old life cards with strippers.
6961395	6962817	Water certified strippers.
6965099	6965400	What?
6966041	6971046	And the guests have never been hungrier.
6972167	6973509	Mommy, I got bit.
6973889	6974590	It was a prince.
6974750	6975792	It was not a piranha.
6979239	6984100	Is that Christopher Lloyd?
6984220	6985581	Fuck yes, it's Christopher Lloyd.
6985741	6986781	Okay, I have to see this now.
6987141	6988181	How the mighty have fallen.
6988441	6988801	Ow!
6988921	6989862	Whatever it is, I don't like it.
6989942	6991562	Ladies and gentlemen, the most famous
7008347	7014252	Just when you thought it was safe to put your 3D glasses back on.
7014272	7018136	First of all, I'm not a lifeguard.
7018156	7018616	Never was.
7032452	7035113	Secondly, that is what natural selection is all about.
7036393	7038113	It's double the action.
7038173	7041874	What did you do to them?
7041934	7042934	Double the terror.
7046095	7047595	And double the D's.
7048315	7048895	Oh lord.
7050676	7051956	Bring me my legs.
7052976	7054616	Oh, that's right.
7054636	7055857	With shotgun legs.
7059277	7060538	Ah, yeah, that's right.
7060558	7061158	That's why.
7061398	7062298	That trailer's sicker.
7065165	7069928	Little Piranha in the tub How stupid does that look?
7069988	7091080	I can't wait I don't even like gory movies and I'll see that just because it looks so horribly stupid Bring me my legs I'm sorry, Christopher Lloyd can't even redeem that to me Orange Launch Radio Road Trip Hawkeye Avengers Hawkeye I hope that opens up against Avengers I'll camp out 48 hours in advance for that
7093103	7094323	I'm not hating on Avengers, I swear.
7094544	7094944	Just, you know.
7095884	7096144	All right.
7097425	7098905	You've got to root for the underdog.
7098925	7099646	I mean, seriously.
7100246	7100446	I know.
7100626	7101046	Underfish.
7102166	7102707	Ving Rhames.
7103007	7109149	I mean, I remember when Rose McGowan had the shotgun leg, but Ving Rhames, I think, is a much sexier babe with that shotgun leg.
7109229	7109669	I'm just saying.
7109689	7110710	Get me my legs.
7112750	7112991	All right.
7114411	7115652	Back to rapid fire news.
7119431	7137317	Bioshock Infinite has a release date hey it's October 16th in North America and 19th internationally I know a lot of you Bioshock fans are looking forward to Bioshock Infinite not to hate on Bioshock 2 it was a good game in its own merits but this is in some ways kind of the the true sequel to Bioshock it's just kind of a different little spinoff there
7137908	7155585	games coming out on 360 PC and PS3 the PS3 will have move support and come with the original Bioshock included you know just in case you missed assuming that they stick to the word unlike they did with some of the other games we'll see we'll see all right so there you go that's what I've got for rapid fire news how about you DarkSakura
7156984	7157445	Let's see.
7157926	7160550	We have a rumor that I've mentioned before.
7160950	7167020	Darkstalkers 4 may potentially be happening and the theory is that Yoshinori Ono is behind it.
7167842	7168082	So...
7170806	7171607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7195403	7222867	also Jet Set Radio is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade PSN and PC this summer and Sega's going to have a graffiti contest so they didn't really say if you're going to be able to import your own graffiti images but they're having a contest that is available at Sega.com slash JSR contest where you can put in your designs and last but never least Street Fighter they're doing a Street Fighter Monopoly game the end
7225054	7227196	Are the fighters the pieces or the properties?
7228877	7234822	I would hope that they're the pieces and that, like, you fight for India or Japan or USA.
7234862	7239886	I mean, I guess I shouldn't say properties because you don't really buy and sell people, but maybe, like, buy your team.
7239966	7244370	You know, you're contracting them to join your super fighting squad or whatever.
7246712	7247633	Kylie Minowas Cammy?
7248594	7249214	That would be hot.
7249755	7250115	I'm sorry.
7250355	7251276	She didn't make a good Cammy.
7252702	7256043	Every time I see Cammy, her voice is Kylie Minogue.
7256603	7256943	Sorry.
7257143	7258483	Right after Covert Action.
7258543	7259383	It wasn't that bad.
7259423	7260864	Will be Street Fighter 2, the movie.
7260944	7261844	Kind of underrated.
7262664	7264064	You know Dan went and bought that on Blu-ray.
7264665	7264965	Just saying.
7264985	7266025	I bought it for Alan.
7266405	7268165	It was the first gift I ever bought him.
7268205	7269606	You know I saw that twice in the theater.
7270126	7270666	Did you really?
7270706	7271066	I did.
7271086	7271766	I saw it once.
7271846	7272806	Well, is it the cheapo theater?
7272826	7273246	It was enough.
7273546	7277547	My dad took me to see it because I was only like 11 or 12 when it came out.
7277567	7279788	Well, I saw it the second time at the cheapo theater or something.
7279808	7280488	All right.
7281704	7283266	Hey, new segment on OLR.
7283367	7284008	How exciting.
7284028	7285049	You ready for a new segment?
7285250	7286251	We're going to try something new here.
7286311	7288955	It's kind of a segment ripped off of Horde House a little bit.
7289015	7289797	It's worked well over there.
7289837	7290658	So we're bringing it over here.
7290698	7293002	It's a new segment called the Fugle Question of the Week.
7300356	7303998	A little song to sashay to as we go to Facebook and Google+.
7304018	7306040	This is one of my favorite songs to play in Beatmania.
7306220	7306800	Fugle.
7306820	7308841	I thought I made a good theme music here.
7308862	7309382	So Fugle.
7309422	7311443	You put Facebook and Google together, you get Fugle.
7312004	7313244	Here's our Fugle question of the week.
7313545	7314105	A portmanteau.
7315186	7315366	What?
7315546	7317447	That's what a combination of two words is called, a portmanteau.
7317687	7318067	Oh, okay.
7318248	7319688	Fugle portmanteau.
7319709	7320429	It sounds like a wine thing.
7320529	7323612	Alright, our Facebook and Google Plus question of the week.
7323652	7326055	We post these the day of the show and get your questions.
7326495	7329959	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google Plus.
7330380	7333583	Search for Orange Lounge Radio because there's no custom URLs on Google Plus yet.
7333964	7339610	We'll post the question in both places and look for your answers or read some of our favorites on the show and talk about this topic.
7340591	7342473	Here's our very first Fugle question of the week.
7343735	7344396	Wait, wait, wait.
7360750	7362331	Massive hype behind Mass Effect 3.
7362431	7364892	Are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs?
7365032	7368334	The way they do storytelling and how they use conversation trees in their games.
7368374	7371855	To be honest, I haven't played many of them.
7371935	7372916	Dragon Age, right?
7372956	7374256	Yeah, I played some of Dragon Age.
7374676	7375317	Dragon Age 2.
7376417	7381419	I thought it was interesting for leading to a different game experience each time.
7382480	7383300	But really...
7386337	7388038	You know, I can't say I dislike it.
7388698	7389859	I really can't say I dislike it.
7390199	7390839	It's just different.
7391739	7392440	Okay, Loki?
7393520	7396641	Honestly, I kind of stopped playing Mass Effect.
7397582	7399663	I didn't even really get very far in the first game.
7399723	7400903	It just wasn't for me.
7401403	7407886	Not that the whole dialogue trees or anything were... I wasn't against that because I like adventure games and they had dialogue trees.
7407986	7409507	So, why wouldn't I?
7411047	7411227	But...
7412924	7413305	I don't know.
7413466	7415591	It's just, I mean, the style's fine.
7415691	7417335	I don't think that's really anything holding me back.
7417435	7418237	It's just time.
7419827	7426312	Yeah, for me, those games are huge time sinks, and when you're trying to juggle MMOs and other games, it's a big investment to get into those games.
7427233	7437680	I did play a little bit of Dragon Age, and especially, I will say this, SWTOR was really one that I invested a lot of time in, and I gotta say, the whole conversation tree aspect of the game kept me engaged in a way that WoW doesn't.
7438021	7443485	Like, I love WoW, but I'm not really a lore fiend, and it's not that it's a bad story, it's just one that I tend to skip...
7444045	7444805	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7463870	7468914	The way the story was told was great, and I can see why people get so into Mass Effect and stuff.
7469614	7473797	It's a series I've got to get into at some point, but again, it's a huge time sink.
7473817	7475258	God, I make it sound like I play nothing.
7475318	7476339	I've missed all these big games.
7476359	7477619	I swear I play a lot of the big games.
7477639	7480762	It's just somehow I missed all the ones we're talking about tonight.
7481142	7487266	I kind of like how you have set lore for a while, even though they've been trying to retcon it, but...
7490339	7490879	I don't know.
7491240	7492842	I'm always like, what?
7493022	7493903	I want a story.
7494484	7500332	I mean, if I want a game that's going to give me the option, then I will play it specifically for that.
7500792	7505559	But for the most part, I like it when they've given me a story and playing it is like reading a book.
7506479	7512343	All right, let's read some of the answers from our Facebook and Google, or our foogle, because it is a show where every gamer has a voice.
7512363	7513064	We'll start with Zether.
7526494	7537259	As much as I love the environment and gameplay in the first Mass Effect game, knowing that the third game, which I may never play because of Origin, may be terrible story-wise is pushing me towards the not-sure-if-like side.
7538060	7538240	Hmm.
7538580	7541081	That Origin enhancement really turning people off.
7541341	7552727	I'd be curious for Zether why he wouldn't just pick it up on a console then where he doesn't have to worry about Origin, but maybe the quality thing is... Well, yeah, with consoles you still have to do the EA server thing.
7553087	7553967	Derek H responds, I'm not.
7554467	7559669	Because one, if I'm trying to save the universe, why can I only take two people with me when I have a ship full of marines?
7559689	7563830	And two, it's become a glorified virtual girlfriend simulation.
7563850	7564650	And three, I just don't like RPGs.
7582515	7593103	Interesting that Derek kind of brings up that the whole lovemaking scenes have kind of taken over what the rest of the game is really supposed to be about because it does seem like whenever one of these games come out it's all about who can you fuck?
7594885	7595805	Now it's male-male.
7595885	7598928	It is male-male and apparently the scene is only so-so.
7599208	7599868	It's really boring.
7600889	7605213	There's some pretty hot chick stuff in Dragon Age.
7605893	7608055	If you want the boobies it's all about The Witcher 2, okay?
7608415	7609296	That'll be out in April.
7610096	7612218	That's got some hardcore stuff in there.
7612358	7617360	And Derek does bring up an interesting point where, you know, for being such an open-ended game, it's not that open-ended.
7617600	7620761	I think that's kind of what I read between the lines on the first bullet point.
7620781	7622042	So interesting thoughts there.
7622822	7623302	Let's see.
7623382	7627284	Going to Thomas B. Bioware games are pretty good, especially the Mass Effect series.
7627644	7631185	I like that there generally are at least three paths to take in conversation.
7631465	7633126	Paragon, Renegade, and Paragate.
7633466	7638788	Lots of RPGs are so linear that you may as well have the dialogues automatic or just show cut scenes between the fighting.
7640168	7652234	Robert W says, Mass Effect 1 was amazing, Dragon Age was great as well, then the sequels to both were hugely disappointing to me when it seemed that they had an identity crisis when it tried to appeal to everyone and forgot what the originals were.
7652534	7656015	You know, I've heard that a lot, especially about Dragon Age 2, except from DarkSakura.
7656896	7658756	Well, keep in mind, I didn't play the first one.
7659217	7659717	Ah, okay.
7660157	7660717	You should go back.
7660737	7669081	But see, I heard Mass Effect 2 would be more appealing to me, whereas I thought the first game was a little slow and cumbersome, whereas the second one's more, I guess, like a shooter.
7669775	7670756	Alright, let me read two more here.
7671276	7674238	Well, apparently this third one is like, pick your combination.
7674298	7674958	Do you want more story?
7674978	7675698	Do you want more shooter?
7676199	7678000	That's what sounds really interesting about the third one.
7678040	7680421	I will take shooting and boobies.
7682002	7683183	You don't want to shoot the boobies!
7683443	7683783	No, no, no.
7683963	7684904	Shooting and boobies.
7685184	7686285	Not combined together.
7686625	7689627	Although, topless chick shooting, I'd be fine with that.
7689747	7690667	Why isn't that a game?
7690727	7691788	Topless chick shooting.
7695384	7697448	I'm trying to think if that is a game.
7698029	7698450	Alright, look.
7699472	7700254	Two more answers here.
7701155	7701717	Sill N.
7703671	7707893	I like the way that Bioware tells the stories and how I can interact with NPCs.
7708173	7713635	I've played Dragon Age and felt really connected to my character and her companions because of that way of conversation.
7714015	7717276	I skipped the Mass Effect series because I thought that sci-fi games wouldn't be for me.
7717657	7728801	However, after playing SWTOR and actually really loving the relationships I can get with my companions and being dragged into my character's story, I actually am tempted to pick up Mass Effect 1 and 2 secondhand for my PlayStation 3 and
7729301	7730504	and start playing the series.
7730845	7733029	Is it bad that I'm already pondering who to romance?
7735729	7739473	And lastly, Shane from Horde House, funny enough, replies and says...
7760532	7789871	but in terms of storytelling and use of conversation trees Mass Effect has been spot on for two games I'm looking forward to Tuesday's release of Mass Effect 3 hardcore because of the love they put into developing their characters and world definitely not because of the way the game plays sounds to me like Shane might be more in it for the story mode as opposed to the boobies and gun mode so there you go that's our Fugle question of the week thanks you guys for applying we'll catch you next Sunday with our next Fugle question of the week meanwhile let's get back to some more news Loki
7790714	7797317	Yes, let's talk a little bit about Capcom and about a game being released this week.
7798458	7799598	Street Fighter X Tekken.
7800939	7813825	Of course, there's been a lot of discussion with DLC, including, first off, that the PlayStation versions are going to have some exclusive characters with crappy box art Mega Man and Pac-Man.
7814345	7819268	And then on top of that, the Vita is supposed to be getting 12 characters that are exclusive to it.
7820929	7834739	with those characters being Alina, Guy, Cody, Sakura, Dudley, Blanca, and I guess Alisa, Christy, Jack, Brian, Lars, and Leigh.
7836581	7843285	Those are all, I guess, supposed to be in the Vita version in the fall.
7844707	7845147	However...
7846397	7853659	Apparently, they're already available on the disc as DLC.
7854259	7855499	They're already on the disc.
7855819	7863861	Actually, the Pac-Man and Bad Box Art Mega Man, that's going to be released on the 13th, I believe.
7865362	7866882	Released next week.
7869023	7873624	Those are going to be free DLC if you have the PS3 version available.
7874444	7889035	Funny enough, though, those are also on the Xbox 360 disc, as some people already have those discs and have dug through and actually dumped some of the videos, the intro and ending videos from those characters, and they're on both discs.
7889816	7891157	So, it comes down to...
7893358	7893879	What the hell?
7894219	7895560	It's all paid unlock content.
7895620	7898883	All this shit was done way before you released the game.
7899443	7902346	Usually in games like this, it would be unlock characters.
7902386	7904687	You play well and you get some new characters.
7905148	7913214	But because we're in a day and age where it's fun to charge money for shit that would normally be free, then that's what they did.
7913334	7914415	It's on the actual disc.
7914575	7915896	And here's the best part about it, too.
7916217	7920080	There's actually the Xbox 360 version, I believe.
7920540	7920600	Um...
7921721	7923042	Wait, wait, the one from Street Fighter 3?
7941198	7941398	Yes.
7941598	7942158	I loved her.
7960626	7962048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7985511	8002612	and this is one of those things before it's just the perception of it it doesn't seem like it's something that was added later on but if it's something on the disc that you're under unlocking people feel entitled because they own the disc well they think they own the disc you're really licensing the disc but fuck that you own the disc
8003052	8006593	Okay, and you have the data on the disc already.
8007734	8011075	Why aren't you being, you know, why is it being locked out?
8011175	8016337	It would be like if you bought a house and there's a room that's locked that you have to pay money to get the key to.
8017397	8018198	Yeah, it's your house.
8018318	8021799	You own it, but you can't access that room because too bad it's locked.
8021839	8026961	It's the classic example of pay to unlock content, which Namco especially has been guilty of a lot in the past.
8027301	8031563	Now, I realize that Street Fighter X Tekken is the Capcom version of the game, but they've done some of this too.
8032503	8033624	Yeah, well, yeah.
8033824	8034664	It's disappointing.
8035425	8035925	It really is.
8036165	8037626	I mean, it's disappointing.
8037686	8046632	First off, it doesn't really... First off, the extra 12 characters that they're talking about, once I found out who they were, I was like, eh, the Vita version doesn't seem that great.
8046712	8049753	But it's something that, you know, that, well, they're not really exclusive.
8049794	8052055	It's just going to be available to everybody eventually for a price.
8052775	8053956	So, who knows?
8054396	8057678	And here's the even sadder part, if you really want to look at it that way.
8058439	8060300	You know this is going to be up on, you know,
8065121	8072323	All those characters are going to be unlocked on the pirated copies the first week.
8073403	8076604	This just confirms for me I'm not going to buy the game when it comes out.
8076804	8081745	Because I was considering getting it, even though I knew this in the back of my mind.
8081865	8085966	There'll be a year edition, best of the year edition or whatever, inevitably.
8086446	8096713	and I think now that the discs are already practically made that way, there's for sure going to be a year-end edition at the end of the year once all these characters are released that will include everything.
8096813	8098594	It'll be the same disc with the key in there.
8098634	8099455	Exactly right.
8099775	8103277	Because that's how they don't have to press it twice and they can reuse the old copies.
8104218	8108401	I think that's exactly the grand scheme of what's going on here and it just confirms for me, you know what, Rob, you need to wait.
8109502	8116086	And I wonder if there's going to be other people that are where I'm at that'll send a clear message when we don't buy this game.
8116366	8123052	And I understand that, you know, the developers will come out and they will say, well, listen, we plan to have DLC.
8124193	8126315	I have a problem when they always say they plan to have DLC.
8126375	8130498	Yeah, I, you know, I understand like Bethesda, we plan to have expansions to Skyrim.
8130518	8133221	Yeah, okay, that makes sense that you're going to plan to have expansions.
8133721	8136284	But that fucking content was not already on the disc.
8136544	8137545	It was not on the disc.
8137625	8139867	It's stuff that's added after the fact.
8140267	8141809	You'd be like, hey, you know what we thought?
8142369	8143871	These characters would be cool to have in the game.
8143891	8145072	We didn't have time to put them in there.
8145092	8148295	So we're going to go ahead and create those characters and we're going to sell them as DLC.
8148595	8153920	Remember what fucking happened with, was it Jill Valentine and Shima Gareth or whatever?
8154300	8156943	Where that was already on the disc as well with Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
8157363	8157623	Yes.
8158664	8161286	And they were like, five bucks for each fucking character?
8161766	8164608	Five dollars per character.
8165048	8170612	Capcom, never forget that they charge five dollars for those fucking characters.
8170672	8172653	Do you think that this is going to be any different?
8173053	8175374	Five dollars per character.
8175414	8175975	How much was it?
8176175	8177516	Five dollars per character.
8177536	8177516	$4.99?
8177996	8179877	$4.99 US dollars, $4.99 US dollars.
8183132	8189535	No, so I'm just saying, don't think that they won't try this shit, because they will.
8189795	8197518	And come on, I hope that you're smart enough to know that if this is a deal breaker for you, if these, and to be honest, they're older characters.
8197578	8201779	It's not like, oh my god, it's now Klonoa's in there and shit.
8201819	8207441	It's not anything, and that would really be the only thing that would kind of get me to be like, hey, a bunch of new characters.
8207461	8208642	I mean, come on, Blanka, meh.
8209282	8214105	If I want to play as Blanca in a game like that, I could just play Street Fighter 4 or something like that.
8215386	8218368	I do want to make something clear here before I get the nasty emails.
8218548	8222731	It's like, well, Rob, you bought Final Fantasy XIII too, and now they're putting out all this DLC for it.
8223531	8227334	It's inevitable that all that's going to be repackaged at the end of the year too.
8227774	8229055	There's two things I have to say to that.
8229335	8231136	One, it's actually DLC.
8231336	8235139	You are downloading this extra stuff, like the fights and the side content and all that.
8235539	8245766	and B, I have a much bigger love of role-playing games and I, unlike a lot of you, really liked Final Fantasy XIII and so I was really excited about Final Fantasy XIII too.
8246126	8250329	Whereas with fighting games, I'm a little worn out on fighting games right now.
8250469	8256813	I still have a lot of Soul Calibur V I need to explore and some of these other fighting games I've got that I haven't played enough of.
8256853	8262837	So it's like, do I need to be the first one to own Street Fighter X Tekken when I realize that there's going to be more to come later on?
8263118	8264719	No, I don't think I need to be the first to own it.
8265899	8293843	and so maybe it's a double standard but I think it's a question a lot of people are asking themselves and you know and you have to you can't go into this not knowing what their their MO is nowadays with these fighting games they release a fucking version of a game then they upgrade it slightly later on they'll be balancing tweaks or whatever I mean they fucking did that with Street Fighter 4 they had Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition then they had you know Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and
8294563	8296284	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
8316599	8319261	Yeah, are you going to be missing out on the game for a while?
8319421	8320482	Yeah, but you know what?
8321623	8326127	If that's such a big deal, then you need to get over the fact that you need to have stuff day one.
8326387	8332452	As soon as you get over the fact that you need to have games day one, oh my god, your options get so much cheaper and so much better.
8332492	8336595	Because you're looking at games that are released like, for example, Mortal Kombat.
8336615	8340298	If you want to get in on Mortal Kombat right now, yeah, it came out about a year ago.
8340598	8346702	But you can get it now for the same price, maybe even less now, with all the DLC thrown in.
8346822	8348363	So you're saving yourself some money.
8350384	8353826	Instead of having to buy season passes for games.
8354026	8356107	Yeah, pre-order download content.
8356127	8357828	That's what a fucking season pass is.
8358448	8361130	They did that with Saints Row III, Gears of War.
8361170	8365392	Well, you know, there's a little difference, though, between Gears of War and, like, Call of Duty Elite Service.
8365412	8367093	At least that, you kind of know what you're getting.
8367173	8367594	But Gears, or...
8368314	8369195	Saints Row the Third.
8369335	8375539	It's been cheap-ass DLC expansions with like 30 minutes of content for $7 each.
8376160	8376640	No thanks.
8377120	8377781	You know what's interesting?
8378061	8382644	If I've counted this up correctly, there's 38 characters in Street Fighter X Tekken by default.
8383165	8387508	And then there's an additional, what, we have 12 characters on the Vita and then five...
8388328	8389770	And three months from now, Ultimate Edition.
8409947	8417592	For real, a quarter of the game is on the disc and you're going to have to pay possibly, possibly $5 per character.
8417852	8419874	Possibly, if track record is to be followed.
8421234	8426318	Yeah, I mean, let's just say that they're going to be reasonable and do two character packs, five bucks each.
8427389	8436094	That's still, I mean, buying all the DLC will be the price of the full re-release of the game when it comes out in the year.
8437035	8441357	Or less because, you know, look at Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom.
8441658	8443559	That only came out about nine months later.
8444119	8448442	February was, or I believe it was February that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was released.
8448502	8452104	November was when the sequel came out, or the upgrade came out.
8452384	8453004	And you know what?
8453144	8457186	To be fair, with Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, at least they added something to that.
8457666	8460547	You know, the DLC characters were thrown in, and a whole lot more.
8460827	8464828	Which made it kind of sting even more for the people who bought the original Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
8466589	8475072	Now, to be fair, there could be another element that is included with the unlock that is actually downloaded.
8475132	8475812	We don't know.
8476432	8480034	I mean, I know it's Snowball's chance in hell, but we don't know.
8480234	8480914	It could happen.
8481394	8500431	That could enrich what we're assuming is the straight up unlock And that's not where it ends If you think about it, remember they have this whole gem system now And they're going to be selling those gem cards or whatever That's Cha-ching, show me the money I hate that our console games are turning into
8501793	8502914	and DarkSakura.
8528268	8528708	I don't know.
8545279	8546140	Thank you for watching!
8562165	8566447	But unfortunately, this is the way things are going, and that's it.
8566527	8567748	So you just got to play smart.
8568148	8579294	You buy the game, you know, either buy it used later on, buy it for cheap, buy it later when the Game of the Year edition comes out, and just give it some time.
8579995	8583757	Going to our chat room, SSJ100Matt says, Rob, you're talking me out of my pre-order.
8583837	8584357	You know, I'm not...
8586871	8590953	Well, I talked myself out of it earlier this week, so I'm just trying to be honest.
8591113	8594014	I'm not saying if you buy this, you're dumb or anything like that.
8594114	8597495	No, I think you just have to ask yourself, how much is this game worth to you?
8597555	8600316	Because Capcom's about to try and charge you double for it, basically.
8600776	8601797	And for some people...
8603497	8605158	That is worth it to them.
8605398	8609140	And some passionate fighting game fans are going to be lined up day one.
8609620	8610961	There is nothing wrong with that.
8611301	8614422	But for me, I don't consider it to be a worthy investment.
8614822	8620084	Some people would side-eye me going, what are you doing ordering this collector's edition of Final Fantasy XIII too?
8620104	8621505	Did you play the first game or wasn't that good?
8621785	8622665	But I'm like, you know what?
8622825	8623586	I enjoyed it enough.
8623606	8625687	I'm going to take a risk on it.
8625827	8628608	So you really just have to value for you
8630009	8630730	Is it worth it?
8631110	8632471	When you know this is coming.
8635173	8636094	That's what it's really about.
8637495	8638075	Is it worth it?
8639216	8640657	I don't think so, but that's me.
8642478	8643379	Every gamer gets a voice.
8643399	8647442	I mean, it looks like a neat game, but maybe we should just wait.
8648183	8649143	Wait and pick it up at Christmas.
8649244	8653767	I don't have time to play it right now anyways, so... I don't know.
8653867	8655989	I'm telling you, I'll get it when the year-end edition comes out.
8656609	8657009	But I'll...
8659031	8662512	I don't know what series, if fighting games, I'm willing to buy day one anymore.
8663172	8666173	Maybe Soul Calibur, and that's about it, but I really like Soul Calibur.
8666273	8673155	Well, there's a lot of games, I know a lot of series of games that are going to come out, they're going to have Game of the Year editions.
8674055	8678596	Borderlands 2, I know, is going to have a Game of the Year edition at some point, but you know what?
8678857	8681017	That's a game where the DLC was worth it.
8681377	8685498	That was something that wasn't on the disc already, and they put some effort into that shit.
8685518	8686859	You know Skyrim is going to be...
8687959	8690461	DarkSakura, you look like you want to comment on this or jump in here?
8713257	8716439	Actually, it was something that I wanted to mention speaking of Skyrim.
8716579	8716779	Sure.
8716799	8718000	This is just before I forget it.
8718440	8724043	Someone's done a Berserk patch for Skyrim for PC where you can play as Gatsu from Berserk.
8724303	8724583	Nice.
8724643	8725124	Just saying.
8725444	8729526	You need to go look at... Alan, by the way, is almost 200 hours in Skyrim.
8729566	8730227	It's pretty awesome.
8731107	8734989	You got to go see the portal thingy he downloaded, the Valve mod official thing.
8735189	8736690	He's got Wheatley in his bag.
8737070	8737671	That's awesome.
8737691	8737871	Yeah.
8738411	8742335	Anyhow, all right, we need to move on in the interest of time to cover some other stories.
8742675	8745317	If you want to send us a mailbag on this topic, I'm sure a lot of you have something to say.
8745397	8746918	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
8746938	8747419	Where do you stand?
8747439	8749721	Maybe that'll be the question of the week next week, the Fugle thing.
8749761	8750021	I don't know.
8750041	8750321	We'll see.
8750922	8752323	All right, let's move on.
8753484	8754045	and DarkSakura.com
8775825	8780932	3 winners will get prize money and you'll actually get to publish your games on the iOS Apple Store.
8810106	8810266	I see.
8829623	8830203	and Atari.
8831044	8832044	Atari's not doing too well.
8832785	8834786	I don't know if anybody's noticed.
8835266	8848173	All that Atari has right now going for it is The Witcher 2, which is coming to consoles as well now, well, Xbox 360, and Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends, which...
8849171	8850673	That's not exactly a strong title.
8851074	8851735	That is it.
8852055	8855920	I mean, so... Maybe they're going to relaunch Pong?
8855961	8861308	I mean, they tried it with Centipede and that bombed, so... I always think of that Pong on the PlayStation years and years ago.
8861728	8862049	I mean...
8864705	8865085	I don't know.
8865885	8872308	Honestly, you could probably get away with putting a long version out there on the iOS platform and they probably wouldn't even notice.
8872588	8874128	You know what this all sounds like to me?
8874308	8877109	It sounds like American Idol.
8877850	8888393	You know how on American Idol, if you're in the top 50, you have to sign some type of contract that Fox owns your ass for a year and then all those people don't get through and they're fucked.
8888413	8889694	They can't do anything.
8890154	8894055	They can't put out their own because they've had the limited exposure on the show, but they weren't in the top 12.
8894856	8899017	Like, I know that's a fucking weird comparison, but it's kind of the same thing.
8899457	8905219	Like, if you're the runner up in this contest, Atari's going to own your game and you don't get much out of it.
8907421	8908121	But let's be fair.
8908362	8912584	I mean, I don't think coding a Pong game is going to be too much of a challenge.
8912604	8913485	What about Boob Pong?
8913785	8921229	For the person who's going to reinvent it, which by the way, whoever made Pong Combat in the 1990s just needs to revive that idea.
8921329	8922890	Remember Pong Combat on the PC?
8923210	8923390	Nope.
8923690	8924131	Oh my God.
8924571	8926812	It had Pong paddle fatalities and everything.
8928153	8929134	It was hilarious.
8929854	8930274	Oh my God.
8930314	8932896	It was like, oh God, I was in like junior high or high school.
8932976	8935157	It was like 94, 95 when this game was out.
8935297	8936558	The Pong Combat was great.
8940160	8943783	Alright, somebody in our chat room must know what I'm talking about.
8944624	8947086	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8947126	8948147	Do we have emails tonight?
8948307	8950469	We got one, but it's from Bobby.
8952011	8953952	Alright, well a Bobby email we'll have to do tonight.
8953992	8958016	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you guys send us emails every week.
8958716	8959097	Here we go.
8959989	8969495	Since Rob won't read my chat comments because Loki already started another story, the reason you don't see many 99 cent games on 3DS Vita but do on iOS is because of licensing fees.
8969956	8973898	It costs $99 a year to get as many apps as you want on the App Store.
8974238	8977901	You have to pay more than that per title to be on the 3DS Vita.
8978341	8981243	So the prices have to be higher to recoup licensing fees.
8981363	8983765	Now Rob, I need your help on something to circumvent something.
8984265	8985486	So read the last paragraph please.
8989760	8990961	You know he's trolling you with this.
8991501	8992182	All right, here we go.
8992382	8992802	I'll read this.
8992822	8994124	This is why I'm having you read it.
8995765	8996906	This is total troll bait.
8996926	8997866	Are you sure you want to go here?
8997887	8999027	That's why I'm having you read it.
8999148	8999568	All right.
8999888	9001609	So that it completely negates a statement.
9001649	9003291	You know they say don't feed the trolls.
9003991	9005613	I'm negating a statement by having you read it.
9005673	9008355	All right, here's the last paragraph of Bobby Blackwolf.
9009947	9020037	Oh, and the US soundtrack to Sonic CD is far, far, far superior to the Japanese soundtrack.
9020457	9025221	This is a verifiable fact, and since DarkSakura just said this in her voice, it is doubly true.
9026417	9026857	Haha!
9028479	9029180	Counter-troll!
9030781	9031522	Counter-troll!
9031822	9034145	Well played, DarkSakura.
9034185	9034765	Lies!
9035126	9036827	So, wait, my voice doesn't mean anything?
9037648	9038669	But I'm the Sega nerd.
9038689	9038749	Oh...
9045175	9045795	It's a trap.
9045895	9048816	Sweet, sweet vengeance.
9048876	9051037	Bobby Blackwolf is protesting live in our chat room.
9051057	9056899	If you want to start a protest here at Orange Lounge Radio, Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio is the place to send your angst.
9057820	9060821	Do not try to outsmart the DarkSakura.
9061321	9064282	Speaking of angst... I have been trolling since I was born.
9065502	9066883	True, I pooped on my granny once.
9068837	9070481	You really want to share that on this program?
9070522	9071985	My mom already did on this program.
9072006	9072366	That's right.
9072607	9073409	It's been a long 10 years.
9073469	9073730	Alright.
9075234	9076377	Speaking of angst...
9093075	9096396	F you to the potential of having to take a job in customer service again.
9096536	9098157	I really... I mean, okay.
9099037	9099717	I'm good at it.
9099897	9103919	I'm good at dealing with people, all appearances on the show to the contrary.
9105439	9107640	I'm really freaking good at customer service.
9108360	9113342	But I've done it for a long time and I don't want to keep doing it.
9113422	9114823	I want to work in design.
9115643	9118104	So tell Capcom or whoever...
9119880	9127725	I have amazing grammatical skills, know how to use my spell checker, and know how to use a dictionary and a thesaurus.
9128385	9133528	You may be screwed by association for Capcom based on earlier rants on this program.
9134849	9135870	I didn't say anything.
9135890	9137331	The views and opinions expressed.
9140372	9146296	Keep in mind, I have probably every fighting game Capcom's ever made, including Cyberbots, Capcom's number one game.
9148789	9149730	I have the deluxe version, too.
9149750	9150490	I have two copies of it.
9150991	9151231	Anyway.
9152431	9154393	So, um... You should go to GDC.
9154873	9155333	I wish.
9156694	9162678	But, um... It's just really difficult because I have experience in my field.
9163419	9171584	I've got clients who will vouch for me, but they want that extra piece of paper that says that I've basically taken classes and stuff I know how to do.
9172785	9173125	Gee!
9173486	9176147	Well, I've done a bunch of classes and stuff I already know how to do.
9176207	9178189	Do I have to do more classes and stuff I know how to do?
9179008	9182611	So, and, you know, I have nothing against going to school.
9182931	9191177	I love going to school, and I love taking classes, and I like learning from not just my teachers, but from the other people in my classes, the people around me, you know, my peers.
9191998	9199043	But at the same time, I really, really would like to have the stuff that I can do be recognized.
9199204	9199564	That's all.
9201445	9201666	Mr. Loki?
9201686	9201726	Um...
9214926	9216346	Well, because we don't have room in our fridge for it.
9243473	9244093	You're gonna toss?
9244274	9245715	Maybe Alan will eat it for lunch tomorrow.
9245895	9247076	Yeah, you can have the rest.
9247176	9249277	I mean, it's just, I don't have room for the fridge.
9249297	9250038	Got any crazy bread left?
9250378	9250939	F you to the credit.
9250959	9251819	I have almost a full bag.
9252280	9253560	F you to the credit music starting early.
9254081	9254801	Um, that's really it.
9255302	9260506	F you to pizza, but bless you to that amazing crazy bread, which I will also have another piece of.
9260526	9262627	Alright, awesome.
9263808	9264128	Alright.
9265556	9267417	Oh my god, Crazy Bread.
9267977	9271579	Crazy Bread is good hot, cold, lukewarm, wet.
9271999	9276421	If you love Crazy Bread, I'm telling you, you gotta try their new breadsticks that they have.
9277316	9278477	Less food, more games.
9278597	9279218	Oh, no, no.
9280059	9280499	It's epic.
9280579	9281540	It's got pepperoni in it.
9281600	9283281	Who's paying you guys off tonight?
9283582	9284963	They don't have to.
9284983	9285764	It's delicious.
9286004	9286444	Wow.
9286784	9287245	Hormones.
9288326	9288646	All right.
9288686	9289627	Hormones have been paying you off.
9289907	9290147	All right.
9290247	9294611	Five stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line.
9294992	9296433	The 800 number is busted tonight.
9296573	9297654	We do have a standby number.
9297714	9302058	I will give it to you when it gets closer to the Skype line or hurry up and add us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.
9302578	9303199	We'll get there in a minute.
9303759	9319771	for now, Loki I don't want to talk about this but Justin Bieber is being sued by a game company that put out a game called Joustin' Beaver it's a beaver that's jousting things with a pole
9321352	9344499	and uh yes obviously it's parody and it's cheap and a ripoff of the Justin Bieber name but um anyway so what ended up happening is Justin Bieber or his lawyers I should say um feels that the game is infringing on his trademark and publicity oh wait so it's the other way around
9344659	9346521	Justin Bieber is suing Justin Bieber
9359856	9377673	and they say of course the parody app portrays a beaver floating down a log on a river and the beaver presents um or is presented with bangs and a lance and a purple sweater and the beaver knocks off uh fought hogs and attempts to uh or to take his uh
9377893	9378294	Oh my god.
9397134	9405977	Okay, so just to be clear, just because I thought when you originally said this, you said that the Joust and Beaver folks were suing Justin Bieber, which I thought was ridiculous because that's his name.
9406037	9406897	No, that is what they're doing.
9406917	9408898	They're suing him because— What?
9408938	9410279	Wait, but they're suing each other.
9410659	9419702	Yeah, because the fact that they're trying to cease and desist this, and they're saying, well, we're protected by the First Amendment rights, and so we're out to—
9420882	9426467	So, Justin Bieber's company sued these guys, and now it's a countersuit saying you're full of shit.
9426507	9428809	Really, they should be sued by the people who made Tubin.
9430431	9430591	Right?
9430671	9431192	Honestly, yeah.
9431212	9432473	It looks like Tubin.
9434415	9434935	And really...
9436912	9440354	Also, Justin Bieber, his teeth aren't that bad.
9440654	9441274	Let's be real.
9441394	9443755	I mean, I can't believe I'm fucking defending Tron.
9443855	9446437	I know, the Bieber's teeth are not as bad as the real thing.
9446457	9447857	Why does this picture exist?
9448718	9454780	This picture of Justin Bieber dressed up like he's going to Tron with fucking Ozzy Osbourne like...
9457182	9459945	Like some creepy devil guy that's in Tron or something.
9459966	9468136	You know who should be suing Joustin' Beaver is Sue Sylvester from Glee because that looks more like Sue Sylvester than Justin Bieber.
9468877	9469839	I mean, let's be real.
9470159	9470439	You know...
9471841	9476343	I mean, it's fun to hate on the popular singer and yeah, whatever.
9477303	9481344	It's not music that's our demographic at all, so that's fine.
9481604	9482044	Whatever.
9483965	9486626	But at the same time, come on, man.
9487046	9490207	You released an app that's just different enough.
9490227	9492768	You're just cashing in on the, ha ha, it's Justin Bieber.
9492868	9495169	I'm going to download this because it's a beaver.
9495669	9497731	But it's not really Justin Bieber.
9497831	9498432	It's funny.
9498952	9499573	And you know what?
9499693	9504177	It just appeals to those people that are that fucking dumb that will buy any of this stupid bullshit.
9504197	9509262	These are the people that are... Pokemon Yellow thing.
9509463	9516149	These are the people that are also dumb enough to buy on-disc download content for Street Fighter Crosstek.
9516169	9516229	So...
9518171	9520093	Comedy gold from our chat room tonight.
9520133	9522074	There's a two-drink minimum in chat tonight.
9522114	9523135	Just wait for this stuff.
9523836	9524136	Let's see.
9524176	9526318	Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
9527319	9529441	SSJ100Matt says, 12-year-old beavers.
9529741	9531403	This show has gone down a dark path.
9531603	9532444	You know what I meant.
9533645	9533965	Jerk.
9535246	9535647	Let's see.
9535867	9538289	DDRDollarBill says, I sue you.
9538649	9539490	You sue me.
9539850	9541572	Let's go and sue everybody.
9542458	9543839	I really did just sing that on the show.
9545420	9548321	SSJ100Matt says, I want to sue both of them for wasting my time.
9548422	9548862	Well said.
9549422	9551884	And Blackwolf says, Rob likes Glee, LOL.
9551984	9552624	No, I do not.
9553585	9555005	I like the first half of the first season.
9555025	9555666	Glee is hideous.
9555686	9558487	I like the first half of the first season, and then I'm like, this joke is done.
9559048	9559848	This joke is over.
9560349	9562590	This is the guy that won't leave the party.
9562610	9562710	Yeah.
9563752	9565715	and Justin Bieber's company hasn't sued them yet.
9565815	9575170	It's just that they received a cease and desist letter and so now that company is filing a countersuit or a suit before the other suits.
9576712	9577454	Eh, whatever.
9579699	9594147	Alright, let's move on to something less... And I feel bad that we even talked about that game because now there's like, oh hey, we got our game talked about, people are going to be interested in it, and really it should just die with all those other really crappy knockoff games.
9594347	9596228	I haven't played it.
9596788	9597669	I haven't played it.
9597769	9599350	I can't knock on a game until I've played it.
9600000	9600461	Pac-Man
9617179	9621480	Pac-Man is getting a new 3D animated series.
9621640	9625020	It is produced by a former Marvel executive.
9625300	9627141	Avi Arad is doing this.
9627921	9630861	Namco Bandai actually announced that it is going to be shown.
9631421	9633422	The pilot has been picked up for a full series.
9633742	9636322	It's going to be on Disney XD in fall 2013.
9637863	9640603	I love Disney XD because it makes me think of the face, XD.
9641003	9643523	But Disney XD is also where the Tron anime thing is going to be.
9643583	9645264	So they're picking up some newer cartoons.
9645284	9646244	And Phineas and Ferb.
9647064	9649665	This is called Pac... Where does Adventure Time show?
9649685	9650746	Because I like that show.
9650786	9651326	Cartoon Network.
9651526	9654567	Okay, I only ever watch it on Netflix and stuff, but that show's pretty good.
9654607	9657569	And I did watch Phineas and Ferb one day, and it actually was pretty good.
9657669	9658909	Phineas and Ferb is awesome.
9659170	9660970	Anyhow, back to Pac-Man.
9661290	9664372	This new series is called Pac-Man The Adventure Begins.
9665332	9670915	I don't think it has anything to do with the old 80s cartoon, but it should be noted, you know, Pac-Man has been a cartoon once before.
9671535	9672916	But this is going that whole...
9674016	9699112	Pixar route although I don't know if this will be it's just because that shit's cheaper to produce nowadays than actually hand drawing anything that's why it's all CG animated it's kind of sad but true it doesn't make or it doesn't not make sense okay Ranma you saying Avi Arad left Marvel Disney owns Marvel remember Disney owns Marvel
9701348	9701688	The end.
9728188	9728749	DarkSakura, you're next.
9756471	9757993	I'm sorry, I'm wondering where Perry is.
9758554	9762139	Okay, this is a sad chapter in gaming.
9763641	9765684	Basically, and I can never pronounce this.
9766185	9768228	I don't know how to pronounce this guy's name right.
9768348	9772414	His name is Eris Bactanians, I guess.
9774042	9782025	He was interviewed as part of a fighting game thing going on, the cross-assault reality show that Capcom does.
9782726	9785347	And they were doing a promotion for Street Fighter X Tekken.
9785407	9785507	And...
9789068	9789649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9805623	9826046	and so finally a Capcom person basically said the views and opinions expressed by cast members in the live segment of Cross Assault do not reflect those of Capcom as a company Capcom believes that everyone should be treated with respect and basically they said we're sorry if anyone got offended on our show we are completely distancing ourselves from this guy.
9826618	9843633	you know what this reminds me of speaking of like crazy analogies since I compared something to American Idol earlier this really reminds me of things that have happened on the CBS show Big Brother where contested because you know the cameras are always on on Big Brother my understanding about this reality show is it's not like the tester it's something that's always live
9844413	9859598	and some people on Big Brother have said some really dumb things like one gal in one season said these really ignorant things about Jewish people and just got you know and the clip was on YouTube and she got taken to the cleaners I mean this poor gal probably didn't find work oh I shouldn't say this poor gal because she said it and it was a dumb thing to say
9860278	9885636	and she couldn't find work after the show and then some some other guy in another season said like Dumbledore was a bad influence and shouldn't be in a kid's book because he's gay I am paraphrasing I'm not giving you that quote but guys people in these reality shows have put their foot in their mouth before and the networks have to say hey this isn't our opinion this is just you know some people were throwing money at to you know make fools of themselves on television
9886070	9886731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9907649	9910531	No, I never experienced any of that.
9910652	9918358	I've had a perfectly wonderful experience in the fighting game community for as long as I've been in it because the people that I hung out with were not assholes like you.
9920599	9921020	End of story.
9922981	9923782	He's just an asshole.
9925680	9928921	He is a misogynistic, head-up-his-ass asshole.
9929341	9933562	Like, he could probably smell his own, you know, shit really, really well.
9933582	9935862	I don't know, he probably thinks it doesn't stink.
9936682	9949825	Like, part of me, you know, part of me wants to be that whole hippie angle, like, oh, well, maybe the guy was just under a lot of pressure, and, you know, being on a reality show has got to be a lot of pressure, and maybe some dumb stuff leaves your mouth and all this stuff.
9949845	9952086	But then the more I think about it, I'm like, nah, because...
9952626	9953287	and DarkSakura.com.
9974483	9975464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9990855	9994596	I think it's also kind of ignorant to think that this is only part of the fighting game community.
9994936	9996957	Like, have you ever signed into Xbox Live?
9997797	9999877	Have you ever played a game on Xbox Live?
10001558	10012801	It's just people complaining that it's people that end up getting their asses kicked in games or whatever because... And so they talk up a big storm and then they get their ass handed to them.
10013141	10014261	I've dealt with them...
10019605	10038819	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says but apparently plenty of people in the fighting game community agreed with him, many professional players too well it's interesting what people will say behind the monitor but as far as the professional players go you know
10040789	10053759	The silver lining to this story if you can find one is that it does seem like the gaming community as a whole is largely rejecting this and saying we don't fucking tolerate this.
10054419	10057402	And I think that's exactly what needs to happen in all communities.
10057442	10061685	And those professional gamers out there might want to watch what they say.
10061725	10067129	Maybe you shouldn't lend your comment to a story like this considering that you have people sponsoring you and
10068210	10075616	Some companies, maybe like MadCatz or whatever, might not want to sponsor someone that says, oh, I think women should go get raped or something like that.
10077698	10078478	Whatever, I don't know.
10078899	10083662	Making, like how they basically say that whenever anyone uses Phoenix in NBC3.
10086024	10093886	Just to put an ironic spin of sorts on this, this isn't restricted to the fighting game community.
10093966	10096367	You remember this show was about the DDR community.
10097187	10099828	And there's been a lot of great things in the DDR community.
10099908	10103069	I've met a lot of wonderful people, such as my co-host here on this show.
10103529	10106390	I've met some awesome friends for life from playing that game.
10107070	10109891	But I've also met people who will call me fat and ugly.
10111465	10116173	just based on things that they may or may not know about me.
10116333	10122283	And it's just really interesting how some of that comes back up all this time later.
10125123	10125403	Wow.
10126625	10133953	I was reading a little bit further into this, and apparently to basically get out of the match, she just started losing on purpose.
10134554	10139459	Because it was really the girl that he made all those comments about.
10139900	10143444	She eventually started losing on purpose, and the winner handed over all of his prizes to her.
10145038	10148523	and I thought that was pretty... At the same time, you know what?
10149004	10152628	And I understand that she felt offended by all this name-calling stuff.
10152668	10153930	It's fucking... Well, on TV.
10154391	10158176	Okay, I don't care if it's on... Someone marginalizing her where the public can see it.
10158196	10159638	That's national embarrassment.
10159878	10160839	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10186018	10187139	Well, then he's just an asshole.
10187219	10190201	So he was an asshole embarrassing a teammate.
10192062	10194063	Well, he's an idiot then.
10194083	10195224	There's no room for it.
10196024	10202448	Even while playing the game and you're trying to psych somebody out, there's just a line that has to be drawn, and this guy's crossing it.
10202949	10210894	I mean, I'm all for playful ribbing, but dear God, some of the stuff you hear on Xbox Live is just repulsive.
10213095	10214775	It's not somebody trying to get in your head.
10214915	10219957	It's just somebody trolling and saying things that they know are unacceptable in culture.
10221417	10231820	Things that they say because they're cowards and they're hiding behind their headset and their little monitors and saying these ridiculous things that would get their ass kicked in any public setting.
10232901	10234042	I'll give you an example.
10234923	10241288	When I'd play, because I told you my first experience playing a LAN game was playing Duke Nukem 3D.
10242269	10246712	And when we were in there playing, it was quiet except for the voice macros.
10247113	10254959	But then I went later on and they had a private room LAN and you just got people talking shit through the mic the whole time.
10255880	10258962	And I was like, and it was some of the same people that I'd played with before.
10259482	10263325	It's just when you get them, it's like a different reality.
10264225	10269929	And it's really, but to have this done to your face and in front of all these people, that's even worse.
10269969	10271750	That's like the worst kind of marginalization.
10271870	10278714	And this guy, honestly, if I were a more violent person, I would just cut his tongue out.
10280506	10281506	That's a bit extreme.
10281526	10282467	I'd cut his tongue out in uterum.
10282747	10283107	End of story.
10283967	10284867	That's a little crazy.
10285008	10285448	I'm sorry.
10285488	10288589	That's why I said if I was more violent, I would cut his tongue out in uterum.
10289509	10291330	Xenocore, I think this is important to say.
10292130	10294411	Guys, the main thing that needs attention here is the following.
10294691	10295591	One, and this is from our chat room.
10296091	10300313	One, the person at fault here was the team coach, someone in a supervisory position.
10300353	10301313	Oh shit, I didn't know that.
10302073	10304295	Two, he was still there after the occurrence.
10304655	10311099	The fact that an entity will not remove someone that is acting appropriately should not be tolerated in a professional position.
10312239	10313560	I will just throw this out there.
10313580	10323746	I'm not going to say I agree or disagree, but in that crazy CBS comparison I made a minute ago, those house guests who said the anti-Jewish and the anti-gay things were not thrown out of the house.
10324006	10327909	Just not saying that's right or wrong, just that... It makes for better TV.
10327929	10328129	Mm-hmm.
10333847	10334487	Change the channel.
10335527	10337488	Well, why do you think I don't play online, honestly?
10338528	10340169	I don't play online either unless I know the people.
10340509	10341810	I mean, it's just gotten to that point.
10342170	10342850	It's gross.
10343931	10349433	And there are certain communities of games I will... That's one thing I do kind of agree with.
10349893	10352414	That in some communities you don't get it as much as in others.
10353295	10353515	Like...
10355516	10360941	For example, when I played PSU, for the most part, I knew the kind of players I was playing with.
10361502	10363984	There were people who were in the same kind of games that I was.
10364585	10367208	And if we had somebody like that, we would block them.
10367348	10369310	I do that on WoW.
10369650	10376697	I'll even find people in trade chat that are just being complete assholes and block them just because I don't want them to remotely message me or anything.
10376717	10377778	I don't want to be around these people.
10379198	10380819	I was going to a situation where that was going to happen.
10402146	10409390	Well, first of all, I do have to say in myself when I have been in those situations, I have stuck up for myself and have pretty much torn people apart.
10410430	10411510	Because I don't take shit.
10411771	10412271	I really don't.
10412371	10413491	I don't take crap.
10413851	10414712	I don't care where I am.
10414792	10415332	I won't take it.
10416372	10423936	But, you know, when you've got a larger guy going off on you, it's really hard to kind of stand up.
10425016	10425316	You know?
10426537	10429178	She really either needed an advocate or he needed to be thrown out.
10429730	10432671	And he sort of does look like Hagrid from Harry Potter.
10433131	10433652	Just saying.
10433792	10434772	Or the guy from Lost.
10435092	10435892	All right, knock it off.
10435952	10436273	All right.
10437453	10441275	This is a very polarizing variety of opinions out there in the community.
10441315	10442775	I'm sure a lot of you have something to say.
10442815	10444336	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
10444796	10447677	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to have your say.
10447857	10449678	Or we'll be opening up the Skype line in just a minute.
10450198	10454599	at username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or our not toll-free number.
10454659	10459760	It's our sub-number tonight because the toll-free is down.
10459780	10461141	916-226-9067 is the phone number.
10461221	10463301	Again, that is not toll-free.
10463381	10466782	However, many of you with cell phones probably have nationwide long distance.
10466882	10470563	Please, please look up the rules of your carrier before you give us a call.
10470583	10471003	916-226-9067.
10471543	10474704	We have two more stories before we get there.
10474784	10475004	Loki.
10475544	10482305	So Zynga is trying to get away from being supported purely by Facebook, or at least majorly by Facebook.
10483106	10485486	They are coming out with the Zynga platform.
10485706	10498349	It's basically like a website, like a portal that you'll be able to kind of interact socially with other people and be able to play games, you know, like wards with friends and stuff like that.
10498969	10525671	I'll feature a live social stream where you'll be able to see your friends activities, player profiles also selection of games from other companies as well and I'll be launching at Zynga.com and probably in no way will copy Facebook because Zynga is a company that puts out completely original games they would in no way rip off a social media website or anything that's very successful
10526523	10527484	Not in least.
10528204	10529125	Nope, not even.
10529265	10531926	Zynga Minus will be the name of it.
10532687	10533847	Face Zynga Minus.
10533887	10538470	They'll have a thing that's called the Timestream instead of the Timeline.
10540471	10540792	You know.
10542473	10544954	They'll have approves instead of likes.
10546715	10547736	Thumbs up.
10547936	10548456	Smiles.
10548476	10550998	And frowny faces.
10553859	10553879	I
10556333	10557174	Good riddance, bye.
10557895	10560938	I just don't know anyone who would go off to Zynga to do this.
10561638	10567204	I mean, I think part of why Google Plus is struggling is because Facebook has its foot so damn jammed in the door.
10567324	10570487	And why would you, like, are they going to pull their games from Facebook?
10570547	10571628	Is that what they're planning on doing?
10571648	10575852	Because why would I go somewhere, assuming I'd play these games, which I'm not...
10577173	10580715	Why would I go somewhere other than Facebook or Google Plus?
10580735	10585678	First five levels on Facebook, next 20 levels on Zynga Minus or whatever it's called.
10586159	10587059	Fazinga Minus.
10588340	10591202	Well, I don't think that Facebook would let them do that.
10592856	10593196	All right.
10594517	10595918	One more story for you guys tonight.
10595978	10597439	Hey, this is kind of fun.
10597679	10598860	I like these types of hacks.
10599401	10601402	It's Mario meets Portal.
10601582	10605645	It's Mari Zero, Mario, or Mario and LeetSpeak.
10606085	10609207	It's a game of Super Mario Brothers played with the Portal gun.
10611489	10613410	I don't know how I feel about the makers of this game.
10613450	10616152	It's called StabYourself.net made this game.
10617413	10619514	What a family-friendly vibe I get from that.
10620515	10622756	Is that the same guy that made Nesticle in Genesis?
10622956	10623356	I don't know.
10623877	10626058	StabYourself.net released Mario.
10627218	10630960	And you can actually, there's this whole little YouTube-y trailer that shows you how it works.
10631820	10634382	Which is weird because they replace scenes from The Wizard.
10634822	10635462	Alright, whatever.
10636603	10640725	But it's fun because it's Portal and the little Cheep Cheeps go flying in and out of portals.
10640965	10646107	They have all sorts of cool stuff with that.
10646507	10647848	It is a neat idea.
10647868	10648028	Yeah.
10648929	10651230	and there's like level editors and stuff like that.
10651310	10652870	In fact, they show all that stuff.
10653391	10657532	Well, it keeps scrolling to the end of the... All right, let me go to the end of this little trailer here.
10659192	10659893	Level editor.
10659913	10662634	Oh, yeah, look at that.
10662654	10665515	I like how little Mario kind of moves his hand as the guy's painting.
10665575	10666195	Different shaders.
10666235	10667195	Of course, hats.
10668756	10669176	Oh, that's cool.
10669276	10671597	A little super, like literally Super Mario.
10671957	10673357	And four-player co-op.
10674057	10674477	Really?
10675158	10675758	That's kind of fun.
10677916	10680938	Slow Mario All for free.
10681619	10683160	Get it before Nintendo shuts it down.
10684320	10685001	Run, don't walk.
10687603	10692406	Although, it has hit the internet now, so once it's on the internet, it's on the internet.
10693747	10696789	How long before a cease and desist goes out?
10696809	10703233	There's no leaving the internet, except in the case of being Bobby Brown, which all episodes have vanished from the internet.
10704670	10706672	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

10737333	10738073	All one word.
10738374	10741215	The Skype line is open now for your calls.
10741295	10747098	Again, I'm only going to give that number one more time and I'll post it in chat too.
10747118	10747398	916-226-9067.
10747938	10748198	All right.
10749139	10751160	Let's go to some tweets.
10751720	10754301	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10755422	10755802	Let's see.
10756162	10756302	Um...
10757623	10759564	Reading some chatroom comments here.
10761164	10764385	Redertainment tweeted us, kind of talking about something we were talking about earlier.
10764766	10767947	Rumor has it that Valve is working on a console called the Steam.
10768567	10772228	Also, Walmart is working on a console called the Stoner Employee.
10775109	10776590	It's Redertainment live in our chatroom.
10776630	10777610	Hey, we got calls coming in.
10777650	10778650	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10778671	10779011	Who's this?
10780331	10780991	It's Shane.
10781471	10782012	Hey, Shane.
10782032	10782712	What's on your mind, buddy?
10783982	10787105	Mass Effect 3.
10787345	10788566	Oh my god.
10788686	10799154	I'm just thinking about how, you know, Tuesday I'm going to spend all day trying to romance Caden.
10799474	10800015	That's it.
10800535	10802056	Don't even care about the story that day.
10802096	10803978	That's just trying to get my...
10804755	10805055	I don't know.
10805095	10809798	Well, not for the same ones because this will be the first time my male shepherd can actually get with any guys.
10834057	10838118	Yeah, but couldn't... Wasn't there, like, female-on-female romance in the first game?
10838138	10839038	It was all over everywhere.
10839058	10840599	Yeah, but that's disgusting.
10840619	10841539	Why would I play that?
10842499	10845060	To you, maybe, but to other people, it's kind of hot.
10846260	10856843	Well, it was... I guess you could, like, romance the sorry chick, Liara, but she's, like, kind of a female, but kind of not.
10856923	10862724	And then in the second one, there is a girl named Kelly who is worthless.
10863206	10866027	that you can also let die, that you can have a fling with, I guess.
10866087	10872869	But nobody cares about that, because Kaden can be romanced in three, and that's the most important development in this entire series.
10872889	10877710	And that is confirmed, absolutely confirmed, you can have hot, gay, sexy times with Kaden.
10879310	10886132	From everything I'm reading, the official strategy guide says no, but those aren't always the final versions they get.
10886512	10891874	But people are finding sound files, there's been pictures posted, I guess, and then somebody unlocked an achievement.
10892526	10894266	and Romancing Him with the Male Shepherd.
10894326	10900188	So, yes, this is what I've been looking forward to for weeks now because that's as long as I've been into the series.
10900488	10902969	Why is it limited to only certain characters?
10903129	10907850	Do you think it's just kind of like an assets thing because there's so much voice acting that goes into it and all this stuff?
10909410	10920113	It could be that, but honestly, they're trying to build a world there and as they probably saw with Dragon Age 2, if you make everybody bisexual, it really takes away from
10920825	10925907	I'm going to assume that Gay Lovins isn't the only reason you play Mass Effect, although maybe it is.
10926247	10929688	No, it's like the best sci-fi story I have experienced since probably Battlestar Galactica.
10929708	10930848	I'm really into the characters and
10951980	10952801	Here's my question.
10953061	10955543	I, you know, have kind of missed the boat on Mass Effect.
10956764	10959907	Convince me I should play Mass Effect, and what game should I start with?
10959967	10963030	Should I go back and start with one, or should I just jump right into three?
10964051	10973439	No, you should not just jump right into three, because every game carries information over from the previous one, with the exception of one, obviously.
10973899	10974700	And three...
10975436	10986443	and that one will give you default choices that you could have made in the previous games and you will come off like such an evil, terrible person if you start with the default choices from what I've read.
10986523	10992746	Like, you let some of your team members die, you don't care about a lot of things, you're pretty much just a complete jerk.
10994207	10995628	But, what would you be playing it on?
10995648	10997089	That's how I'll tell you what to start with.
10997109	11003973	Well, because I was going to say I want to play it on PlayStation 3 because that's kind of my console right now but they don't have Mass Effect 1 on it.
11005111	11014314	No, but if you pick up 2, it has this thing called Mass Effect Genesis where you play an interactive graphic novel of the first game.
11014374	11021216	So you make choices that are important in the first game through that graphic novel that will carry into the second one.
11021336	11024577	But I would say play it on PC.
11024997	11025957	But play it on PC.
11025977	11027297	I don't think about it.
11027357	11029138	Because you can usually get them pretty cheap.
11029198	11031558	I've seen a lot of $5 sales for both 1 and 2.
11031959	11033159	But then I don't get trophies!
11035053	11036174	They have achievements, though.
11037495	11038636	Do you really need trophies?
11038936	11040297	I need to increase my trophy level.
11040997	11042578	My trophy level's pathetic, Shane.
11043799	11045620	I think mine is, too, but I don't care.
11046140	11048042	Rob's trophies are atrophied.
11048142	11049643	Like, started beyond one trophy.
11050623	11054326	Hitstun in our chatroom says, so there's actually an achievement for the gay option now?
11054426	11056547	Now all the completionists will see it too.
11056607	11057067	Is that true?
11058088	11058528	No, no.
11058568	11062571	The Paramore, it's just the Paramore achievement, from what I understand, which is
11062950	11088955	when you romance any character as any shepherd so I could have got that with stupid that Chobot chick from IGN her character oh no, it won't be but it'll have some important decisions that you actually get to make decisions on now remember, I'm terrible Shane, I am terrible at shooters well the first one
11091055	11092616	barely qualifies as a shooter.
11092776	11095518	So if you got that on PC, you would be fine.
11095538	11097300	You don't even have to worry about ammo.
11097340	11098841	You worry about overheating your gun.
11099041	11104425	And there are classes that play like mages or kind of play like rogues and stuff like that.
11104485	11106006	So that you can handle.
11106066	11112931	Two is more shooty than the first game, but it also goes a lot quicker.
11113499	11122501	like the combat so it's not so bad 3 is just pretty much a shooter from what I can tell from the demo but it's still really fun but you can also disable the shooter right?
11123641	11123861	what?
11124021	11143244	you can also disable the shooter from what I hear like there's like story only mode or shooting mode you can and it's funny because they give you that option in the demo but I haven't even tried the story only or the shooting only I just go back to the default Mass Effect experience I should probably do that at some point
11143995	11151460	I made one decision in the first game that is haunting me now, and I kind of want to start the entire series over, but I only have tomorrow.
11151480	11152561	That's such a you thing.
11152621	11153422	So I can't do it.
11153802	11154042	All right.
11154302	11160147	Shane, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I will give it some thought if I can tear myself away from WoW.
11161067	11163129	And you saw those pictures of Caden, so...
11163891	11171501	you know what you're missing out on send me more, I think I might need more when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy when what?
11171741	11174064	when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy
11175020	11176700	I'll take Fraps pictures with it.
11176900	11177961	Alright, sounds exciting.
11178041	11178301	Alright.
11178321	11179441	Alright.
11179701	11179961	Bye.
11179981	11181061	Bye.
11182061	11185362	I thought at first he said Faps pictures, and I'm like, oh, that's kind of awkward.
11185402	11187062	I don't need to, I don't, we're friends.
11187143	11188303	Fap, fap, fap.
11188523	11189303	No, Fraps.
11189823	11189943	Oh.
11190103	11190503	Fraps.
11190763	11191883	That's what he said, Fraps.
11193044	11193644	More calls.
11193964	11195484	The Skype lines lighten up tonight.
11195524	11196364	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11196384	11196704	Who's this?
11197645	11199285	Yo, guys, it's Preston from OKC.
11199305	11199705	How you doing?
11199745	11200285	Hey, how you doing?
11200325	11200985	Better known as Xenocore.
11201005	11203306	Of course, Xenocore from Oklahoma City.
11203346	11204006	What's on your mind tonight?
11204813	11205514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11225839	11226799	I haven't played that in ages.
11226879	11227819	It's a really good game, though.
11252432	11255754	It's pretty much the first RTS that was created on a console.
11256094	11257755	At least on the 16-bit consoles, anyway.
11258255	11260557	Yeah, it was on Genesis.
11261157	11261457	Correct.
11261577	11261778	Yes.
11262618	11263298	I know I have it.
11264159	11265780	I haven't touched it in ages.
11266100	11268021	But yeah, it's pretty good.
11268441	11269982	I should lend you my Genesis so you can play it.
11270923	11274605	Well, I have this thing called an emulator, and I know it's questionably legal, but let's be real.
11274785	11276346	Rob, how many Geneses do I have?
11276746	11277187	That's true.
11277227	11277767	You have a lot.
11278934	11286138	Yeah, but because they actually have it in the browser, I thought it was actually going to come out on marketplaces for the different systems.
11286158	11291281	I was browsing around to find out for now it's beta so you can play it for free, which is kind of awesome.
11292161	11292862	That's pretty cool.
11292942	11294643	So what's the website where I can play this at?
11295499	11301689	Well, actually, you open up your Chrome browser and type in Airmech Chrome and it takes you right to the link in the marketplace to get it.
11302169	11307037	Oh, because it's one of those, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's one of those like Chrome store things, like they're kind of version iOS.
11307077	11307898	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
11307938	11309240	All right, I'll check that out.
11310367	11311408	It plays really simple.
11311468	11312569	It's not too complicated.
11313369	11315771	And its speed is really quick, too.
11316331	11321355	I haven't had a chance to play with too many other people since it is in beta, and I'm guessing they're not usually playing when I am.
11321415	11323836	But, yeah, it really feels good.
11323876	11324957	It feels like the old school game.
11325017	11327519	All I'm missing is the soundtrack, pretty much, and it'd be awesome.
11327939	11328459	Right, right.
11329340	11330461	What else have you been playing this week?
11330501	11332402	Are you on the Mass Effect 3 hype train, or...?
11333246	11335547	Not really, because my roommate's gonna ruin it for me.
11335727	11340148	Because he's been posting all over, just, two more days, man!
11340288	11341468	It's like he's partying already.
11342728	11347050	But he plays through it non-stop, and we all get sucked in because we know it's a solid story.
11348090	11360013	And we're all... Because me and our roomies are all ex-military guys, half the stuff that happens in the action and half the words, we just giggle and laugh all day long because we heard it elsewhere, too.
11360073	11360193	So...
11361387	11365168	I'm going to hide in my room until they come out with a Game of the Year edition and maybe I'll pick it up then.
11365348	11367589	Kind of what we were saying earlier about Street Fighter X Tekken.
11367609	11369830	You're taking that approach to the Game of the Year edition.
11370270	11375232	Well, I don't really see any difference between on-disc content and content that's downloaded later.
11375312	11376592	Either way, they're screwing you.
11376772	11382434	It really doesn't matter what medium you happen to, whether it comes early on the disc or later through a download.
11383616	11388357	It's stuff they're holding back and it's nowhere near what they used to do with expansion packs back in the day.
11388397	11390138	So as far as I'm concerned, I can wait for it all.
11403741	11407564	is that content worth the $50, $60 I'm being asked to pay for it?
11407864	11416229	And you know, for example, Mass Effect 3 has been very controversial for this very thing about the whole, they have the day one DLC and some people are like, that's a rip off and it should be free and dah, dah, dah.
11416549	11417590	You really just have to weigh.
11418190	11420912	Well, throwing that aside, it's not pay to unlock content.
11421072	11422473	Is the content on the disc worth $60?
11423034	11428917	And for example, Shane, our last caller, I'm sure would say yes, but other people might look at that and go, you know what?
11428997	11429798	No, not so much.
11429878	11431179	I'm going to wait for the game of the year edition.
11432520	11443286	I remember hearing, I was listening to the early coverage of the beta that TotalBiscuit was doing online, and he was ratting and raving about the content on the disc being unlockable.
11443406	11446007	It's like, dude, the game was finished three months ago.
11446027	11448389	If there's more project space to fill, they're going to fill it.
11451948	11457192	Not to mention the fact that one of the characters is a character essential.
11457292	11459013	It's not even essential to the storyline.
11459353	11466137	It's just a character they threw in as DLC that happened to be finished before the release date, so they put it on the master disc.
11466997	11492166	so half the people that are bitching because of what what i'm trying not to be too spoilery about it but half the people that are you know whining and moaning it's like what it's it's this guy it should be in the main game no it doesn't have to be in the main game it was made after the fact when the main game was finished so deal i mean if you if you want it buy it if you don't you know hold on to your money and wait for them to package it all together the game of the year edition like i did with batman arkham asylum
11493516	11495920	Oh yeah, it's another one that's had a lot of DLC.
11496241	11497944	I love Arkham City.
11498004	11502291	The base game was worth it to me, but I can see where some people get turned off by all that DLC.
11502672	11503273	Lots and lots of it.
11503632	11505794	Yeah, I might end up buying Arkham City 2.
11505854	11508077	I'm not really waiting on any DLC or anything.
11510279	11512161	It's a solid game without all the DLC.
11512561	11517847	I mean, the Catwoman stuff, I like it a lot, and I think it's kind of worth the new price.
11517967	11521411	But I think even if you took it all out, I still think you'd have a solid game.
11521871	11524334	Oh, I thought she was still playable a bit in the main game.
11524914	11542484	I think she's cut out completely see the thing is if you have her DLC they integrate her very slickly into the main story but if you don't have her DLC all her little stuff is kind of cut out just skipped over so I think you see her and you interact with her but you never do the stuff where you play as her and see Poison Ivy and all that
11543004	11549005	Yeah, because, yeah, when I saw her combat mechanics, like, you know what, that's an interesting way to rework the way this mechanic works.
11549025	11551566	That was kind of cool, so I was kind of curious to see that.
11551886	11559368	So, remember what I was saying earlier about how, oh, yeah, it's going to take them, you know, a couple, you know, about a week to have it on?
11559508	11560608	But they already have it all unlocked.
11561108	11561848	Hackers already got it.
11562348	11562629	All done.
11562649	11563509	Street Fighter X Tekken?
11563629	11565709	Yep, and there's, oh, by the way, they're selling costumes, too.
11565729	11566829	There's always a way with code.
11567050	11568410	There is always a way with code.
11568670	11568950	All right.
11569450	11571731	Xenocore, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
11571831	11573272	Any quick final thoughts you want to get out?
11574472	11576133	Yeah, just hold on to your money, people.
11576173	11577174	Go buy food and stuff.
11577194	11578754	Let's stop getting more expensive every day.
11579315	11580595	Yeah, the rising cost of gas.
11580655	11582956	It's going to cost more to drive to the game store than to buy the game.
11583396	11583677	All right.
11584197	11585077	Xenocore, take care, buddy.
11585097	11585637	Thanks for calling.
11586138	11586638	All right, later.
11586838	11587018	Later.
11588479	11589639	We can squeeze in one more call.
11590139	11591480	Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 916-226-9067.
11591560	11593321	Not toll-free.
11593401	11597243	You know what's even funnier, too, is the fact that...
11599989	11600870	I just lost my train of thought.
11600910	11601230	Never mind.
11602231	11603432	Alrighty then, I'll go back to Twitter.
11603592	11605414	Alright.
11605454	11609797	We got a tweet here from Tony Texture saying, Hey guys, just listening live for the first time.
11610138	11611499	Hopefully I can get in on Skype.
11611559	11612940	Did I mention I'm an Aussie?
11613400	11614181	Well, I hope you do get through.
11614201	11614922	I want to hear the accent.
11616445	11618446	because you know Americans love the Aussie accents.
11618526	11618946	I don't know.
11619026	11629189	The DLC, the codes or whatever, the actual hashes or whatever for all the DLC characters was in a CSV file in the main directory of the game.
11629289	11630389	Oh, you've got to be kidding.
11630409	11631530	That seems so lazy.
11632910	11633190	All right.
11633871	11636972	Let's go to the phones and take one more call here tonight.
11637072	11638072	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11638112	11638512	Who's this?
11641233	11641753	Soulthrow.
11643374	11643674	I'm sorry.
11643734	11644114	Who's this?
11645091	11651537	Soul Throw Soul Throw, what's on your mind buddy?
11652077	11653579	Is it the guy that I just read his tweet?
11653679	11656582	Yes Are you Tony Texture on Twitter?
11657402	11659584	Yes, yes I am Hi!
11659704	11666791	Talk about timing, good lord Well, there must be a hideous delay going across the pond, but that's alright What's on your mind?
11667291	11668613	Welcome to the show, how you doing?
11669189	11669469	Thank you.
11670910	11672791	I just want to say I'm a big fan.
11672971	11677134	I've been listening since episode 250, so it's been a while.
11677334	11679396	Oh my god, it took you this long to call us?
11680196	11681357	Yeah, I know, I know.
11682117	11684559	But I thought I'd just, you know, call.
11684699	11688682	I've actually, this is the second call I've ever used on Skype, so yeah.
11688982	11689702	Well, it works.
11689903	11695306	If the first call was to the Echo123 lady and the second call was to us, we can let you know it worked.
11696127	11698168	Well, what kind of games are you playing lately?
11699677	11703039	I'm playing Gears 3, so I'm just going through the Horde mode with some buddies.
11705061	11707203	Saints Row, I'm about a quarter way into that.
11707603	11708304	Saints Row the 3rd.
11708724	11709345	So amazing.
11711166	11715370	And just going through Street Fighter, Super Street Fighter.
11716650	11717130	Classic.
11717710	11722612	Let me ask you about this, since you are from Aussie land.
11722752	11727853	Australia's been in the news even up here a lot lately with this whole ratings board stuff that's going on.
11728393	11729993	Oh yeah, good times, good times.
11730013	11730434	Good times.
11730694	11735755	The fact that some games, you guys, now it's true, you guys have not been able to buy Mortal Kombat yet, right?
11736263	11737184	No, no.
11737584	11739906	There's many other ways to get to it.
11740286	11742868	Some of the ways that Loki was talking about with unlock content, yes.
11743729	11752356	But now apparently it seems like the motion has started to create a new rating there so that you can get some of the more adult games.
11752917	11755819	How do you kind of feel about how your country's been handling a lot of that?
11756823	11757223	Thanks for watching!
11778320	11797042	some of them yeah I've already played Mortal Kombat if that's what you're asking I was gonna say if you're playing Saints Row the third I wonder how that one got through because that one's pretty bad but yeah Mortal Kombat I guess is even more extreme yeah I don't know I think it's sort of like you know a bit more stylized where Mortal Kombat's got a lot of blood you know
11798604	11798884	Right.
11799624	11799864	Wow.
11800385	11804666	You know, a lot of folks in the chat room are commenting, loving the fact that somebody from Australia is on the line.
11804806	11805726	Australia in the house.
11806226	11810907	And some folks in chat, Frisbee says, I'm so glad the internet is fast as it is.
11811228	11811928	I mean, think about it.
11811968	11814588	From Australia to California in only a few seconds of delay.
11814949	11817569	You know, that's one of the really humbling things about doing this show, I gotta say.
11817649	11826672	You know, we went from doing a show or, you know, being friends, playing at one arcade in one little city in one state, you know, to having this worldwide...
11827572	11828572	Shit Talkin' Fest.
11829633	11831173	We've drawn people in from Australia.
11831193	11833134	I was actually worried about the lag.
11835555	11837775	So I've got a question for you three.
11838136	11838516	Go for it.
11840236	11843097	What's the game you love but everyone else hates?
11844998	11848159	For me, it's Alone in the Dark for 360.
11848719	11851580	Everyone else hates it, but I loved it, so I don't know.
11852200	11853521	Why did you love Alone in the Dark?
11855214	11855515	I don't know.
11855555	11856875	I was a big fan of the original one.
11857095	11860838	The one that was actually 3D, but it was terrible 3D, but I liked it.
11860858	11864500	It was pretty scary at the time, so I just thought I'd buy it.
11864700	11867681	I bought it cheap, but everyone was telling me, don't buy it.
11867921	11871804	I only bought it for about $12 Aussie, so I'm not sure what that is in the US.
11872484	11874365	Probably like $15 or something.
11875225	11875766	Sounds about right.
11877028	11885960	yeah so what games do you love and everyone else hates good damn question what game do you love that everybody else hates anyone want to take a stab at it
11887435	11893697	I have had some people give me crap for liking Fantasy Zone because honestly, I love Fantasy Zone.
11894017	11896257	Yeah, I used to have that on the Master System.
11896397	11898438	People are like, that game's kind of derpy.
11898598	11903859	And I actually like the Tengen version for the NES even though it's probably not one of the greatest versions.
11906120	11907960	I'll answer this for you, Blue Dragon.
11908200	11909181	I love Blue Dragon.
11909961	11910061	Oh.
11911661	11911921	See?
11911981	11912542	What'd I tell you?
11912562	11913022	What'd I tell you?
11913223	11914163	I got one, mate.
11914304	11915925	He loves it, and everyone else is like, nah.
11916386	11916946	I won't touch it.
11917607	11920590	I liked the Evolution games that were on Dreamcast.
11921110	11921751	They were pretty good.
11922952	11923953	And I liked...
11926839	11930943	I have a number of games that every time I bring them up, my husband goes, oh, that's so bad.
11931644	11932705	I'm like, you suck.
11934767	11935307	I'm trying to think.
11935347	11939271	There was one that I mentioned earlier that I absolutely love, and he was just going off on it.
11940412	11941794	For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
11943215	11946338	The usual way conversations go in my house is I love games that he hates.
11947740	11948380	Nice.
11948400	11948921	That's the way to go.
11950231	11952132	For me, I guess I have a couple answers.
11952553	11954674	I think one of them would honestly be Final Fantasy XIII.
11954994	11959576	I think I really loved Final Fantasy XIII, and there were so many people that just despised it.
11960316	11962037	Yeah, you defend that with the sword and shield.
11962237	11963578	I do.
11964879	11965479	Here's the thing, though.
11965519	11968781	As much as I defend the game, I get why it has haters.
11969301	11969361	DDR
11990862	11991903	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
12016604	12017385	Loki, do you have an answer?
12017725	12018846	A game that you love that everybody hates?
12018906	12022929	I'd say it's either going to be Earth Defense Force or... I love that.
12024070	12025591	Excite Truck.
12026032	12027713	I think a lot of people liked Excite Truck.
12027753	12031116	Excite Truck would be one that was definitely...
12032496	12032797	I don't know.
12032837	12034457	I thought a lot of people liked Excite Truck.
12034737	12035158	It's hard to say.
12035178	12036238	It just didn't sell well.
12036878	12039300	It's hard to pick a game that people don't like.
12039760	12040720	Maybe Gal's Panic.
12041060	12042321	Not a lot of people like Gal's Panic.
12043021	12043542	Gal Gun.
12044882	12046163	Gal Gun, it's not bad.
12046363	12048104	I don't know if I liked that game.
12048184	12048784	It was fun.
12052087	12052748	Let's see.
12053690	12055132	I'm reading some of the comments in chat.
12055192	12055854	I really love this.
12056575	12062565	DDR Dollar Bill says, I love Tony Hawk Underground 2, Infinell, Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
12063246	12064328	That's a good one.
12065103	12066043	Yeah, I remember.
12066123	12069804	Wasn't there a time that you were playing the crap out of that game?
12069944	12070504	Yeah, there was.
12071385	12072625	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is awesome.
12073405	12073785	Let's see.
12074525	12076806	Ranma says Duke Nukem Forever for me.
12077946	12079947	DDR Dollabill says Robocop on the NES.
12080367	12083027	Chiggers says EVO on Super Nintendo.
12083868	12086448	Lots of comments in the chatroom on that.
12087608	12087888	What's that?
12088209	12089149	Street Fighter EX3?
12090229	12091009	I thought that was pretty cool.
12091049	12094730	EX3 was pretty good, but a lot of people gave it a lot of trouble.
12095130	12097251	I really liked that it integrated.
12097651	12101411	Didn't it start sharing the engine that Rival Schools was using?
12102332	12106353	Yeah, when they did, was it Project something or other for Dreamcast?
12106373	12107353	Yeah, Project Justice.
12107433	12108593	Is that what you're talking about?
12110113	12117735	Yeah, because I think that EX3 started using the same fighting engine that Project Justice was using.
12119312	12126353	Yeah, I was hoping that one of those characters would pop over to Street Fighter Tekken or maybe Marvel vs. Capcom.
12126853	12134895	But they might be owned by the other developer or whatever that helped do the EX3s.
12135195	12137795	Well, who was your main character in that series?
12137895	12139095	Because I used Hokuto a lot.
12139175	12140096	I don't know the names.
12141196	12142956	I used the Kendo girl.
12144916	12145196	Ah, yes.
12145776	12146597	She was pretty awesome.
12147177	12148417	The chick with the bow?
12149738	12152585	had amazing super specials.
12152845	12157036	The one that you like sort of joust them into the air and then you...
12158035	12159675	Punch Em Down From Earth or something like that.
12159695	12160236	From the Moon.
12161056	12161616	It was crazy.
12161856	12163817	That game was just so underappreciated.
12163977	12165937	I'm glad to find somebody else who likes that series.
12166557	12166797	All right.
12167318	12170558	Well, we could nostalgia all night long, but unfortunately we've got to wrap up the show here.
12170979	12174119	But, Tony, I'm so glad you were able to get through, and thank you for calling.
12174199	12175120	What time is it over there?
12175260	12176860	It's Monday over there, right?
12178221	12178981	Yeah, it is Monday.
12179161	12180821	I didn't have work today, so that was pretty good.
12181601	12184702	It's 4 o'clock p.m., so it's pretty easy.
12184982	12185883	Wow, that's not too bad.
12185963	12186843	So it's almost dinner time.
12186863	12187283	That's not too bad.
12187443	12191245	And I gotta say, we do have another Australian that's very close to OLR.
12191365	12193166	Deke Mann was originally from Australia.
12193546	12195107	He's moved to Canada since.
12195187	12198309	He's an Aussie in Canada, but he's the guy who built our website.
12199569	12201930	We've had a lot of great contributions from Australia.
12202030	12202891	Now your phone call tonight.
12203291	12207413	So Tony, have a great one and thanks so much for the call and I hope you're able to listen again sometime.
12208394	12208914	Thanks for having me.
12209094	12209854	Take care, anytime.
12210595	12210855	Bye-bye.
12212665	12222997	I love the worldly calls it leaves me on warm fuzzies that oh my god this show is like really out there it's crazy I have always wanted to go to Australia I really have
12225455	12225796	Amazing.
12226356	12228598	Alright, let me finish up a few of these tweets.
12228618	12230259	We do have a few more tweets I gotta read here.
12230919	12232060	TigerClaw sends us a tweet.
12232180	12234362	Dust514 goes free to play.
12234702	12236943	The Vita version is a companion app.
12237364	12238605	I don't remember Dust514.
12238965	12241006	Oh, this is the EVE Online tie-in game.
12241627	12242808	Oh, it's gonna be free.
12242968	12243488	Interesting.
12244028	12246970	The game was originally gonna be $20, but now it is going to be free.
12247050	12251994	It will still have microtransactions, but it's not a pay-to-win game, meaning it's not a Facebook game.
12252374	12253315	So, we'll see what that...
12253735	12255276	really adds up being in the future.
12255616	12256236	Thanks for the tweet.
12256276	12258417	I had no idea about that, and I was curious about that game.
12259918	12261559	Actdeft sends us a couple tweets here.
12261639	12264080	One of them is on Darkstalkers 4, which we already talked about.
12264120	12265480	I want to wrap up the show here quickly.
12266061	12269962	He also sends us a trailer for Forza Horizon.
12270423	12271163	Did you watch it already?
12271463	12294650	yeah I mean here's the thing it's like I don't know if that's it doesn't look real to me I mean really it's it's all like stock footage and then like the title Forza uh Forza Horizon and it's just like someone typed it out so I mean yeah yeah well the new Forza game coming sure I'll buy that but I don't know I don't even know if that's a legit trailer or not
12294890	12297591	Oh, and since I didn't mention it before, I did close the skyline, guys.
12297631	12298711	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
12298731	12299291	I'm very sorry.
12299311	12300632	But hey, we have worldly calls tonight.
12301252	12302572	Please send us an email with your thoughts.
12302612	12305033	Mailbag at Orangelandradio.com or a tweet for next week.
12306433	12307414	Other quick thoughts here.
12307454	12315876	Dark Tetsuya says, for those going to Game Developers Conference, the glorious Trainwrecks kiosk, I remember him plugging this on an earlier show, will be at Play Kiosk 23.
12316396	12318597	I'm most proud of Ball Buster Invasion.
12319017	12320977	Think Breakout meets Space Invaders.
12321197	12321998	That could be interesting.
12322138	12322558	Very cool.
12323258	12325259	I wish I was going to GDC, unfortunately I'm not.
12325739	12328720	And Actdeft sends us the Jet Set Radio HD trailer.
12328780	12330920	Is this different from that teaser we saw earlier in the week?
12330940	12332021	Yeah, it's actual game footage.
12332121	12332661	I did not see it.
12332681	12333741	Let me look at this real quick here.
12333761	12335702	I would like to peek at this.
12335782	12341624	I just want to know if they're going to have the music.
12343359	12343979	This was from it.
12345540	12354265	Well, you know, somebody brought up a good point last week, and that is, you know, there were licenses, yes, but there was a lot of Sega in-house music done for it that was still really good.
12354325	12357107	And somebody brought that up in chat last week, and I think that's important to remember.
12357447	12359028	So we will get the Sega stuff for sure.
12363331	12364251	That game was so awesome.
12374776	12376077	I'm excited to play this again.
12385408	12386870	I love the cel-shaded style.
12387350	12388652	Yeah, it's a great art style.
12388692	12389112	I love that.
12389172	12390314	Summer 2012 for that.
12390354	12391915	Well, that'll be part of Summer of Arcade.
12392596	12393057	You think?
12393925	12394125	Yeah.
12394806	12395226	You think?
12396266	12396627	Alright.
12397967	12399808	That's it for the Twitter topics tonight.
12399868	12401429	Let me go to last minute stories.
12401449	12402270	We've covered a lot tonight.
12402330	12403391	Loki, anything to add?
12403511	12404131	Yeah, real quick.
12404471	12410415	Apparently it was outed by the Xbox Live Marketplace that a new Fable game is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
12410875	12412176	That being Fable Heroes.
12412236	12416338	It's like a Mario Party type game that's a beat-em-up also.
12417078	12422101	And maybe expecting an announcement that it's going to be coming maybe during GDC.
12422241	12423082	Will it be on Reels?
12424694	12428098	It probably is because it's a board game, so yes.
12428319	12429360	I had to go there, sorry.
12431940	12432260	That's it?
12433021	12444186	And yeah, it says players will be earning gold coins that can be spent to upgrade characters and items in both that game and Fable the Journey, which will be coming for Kinect sometime later this year.
12445246	12445727	So, that's it.
12446027	12446327	Alright.
12446927	12447527	That's going to do it.
12448068	12449628	Two hours for Part B alone.
12449669	12451169	It's been a long ass show tonight, but you know what?
12451309	12455411	We had some big stories to talk about tonight, so thank you guys for staying up late with us.
12456592	12458193	Thank God we don't have the afterbirth anymore, huh?
12459173	12460775	Let's go around and start to wrap up the show.
12460835	12461796	We want to go around.
12462117	12467363	First off, and thank you guys for listening to the show and spending, what, three and a half hours or however long it's been with us tonight.
12467803	12469125	Thank you so much for listening to our show.
12469425	12470787	You know, we do our thing for free.
12470907	12474451	If you like what you heard, all we ask, help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
12474491	12475752	Tell a friend or two about the show.
12476073	12478055	Word of mouth is all we got because we don't have...
12479196	12485901	A website with, you know, things that people want to visit every single day and read about cheap deals and stuff I was talking about earlier.
12486682	12489904	Or even just magazines that tie in and all that.
12490224	12491165	We don't have any of that.
12491225	12492406	So word of mouth's all we got.
12492446	12493907	And that's all we've had for the past 10 years.
12493927	12496649	And just really appreciate you guys who tell people about the show.
12496709	12503334	Let's grow the OLR Army family with, as unfortunately has been kind of a theme tonight, people that aren't jerks.
12504095	12505676	Because we've heard about some real jerks tonight.
12506294	12508918	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for tonight's program.
12509199	12510581	Loki, I see you packing up over there.
12510621	12511482	What's your final thought?
12511562	12513305	My final thought is it's hot in here.
12513726	12514226	I'm sorry.
12514667	12515328	I got the fan on.
12515348	12517191	I'm trying.
12517251	12518713	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
12519054	12520176	Corporations are not people.
12521583	12528190	My final thought tonight is Final Fantasy XII was also pretty underrated because Balthier and Fran were awesome!
12529071	12530412	Alright, that's it.
12530712	12532434	Thank you guys for listening to us tonight.
12532514	12534276	We'll be back next week to do it all again.
12534336	12535977	Until then, have a wonderful week.
12536358	12537779	Treat each other with respect.
12538199	12538700	Have fun.
12538740	12539501	It's just a game.
12539801	12540562	We'll see you next time.
