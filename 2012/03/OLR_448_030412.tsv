56000	59000	By the way that is Jamie Summers also known as DarkSakura
59000	60000	I am Rob Roberts
60000	61000	Hi
61000	62000	Hi how are you?
62000	66000	What is Colonel Muster doing to Professor Plum on your shirt?
66000	67000	Oh you're talking about my shirt
67000	69000	In the library with the wrench?
69000	71000	The lovely Amanda sent me this shirt
71000	73000	I can't remember if it was Christmas or birthday
73000	74000	I think it was Christmas
74000	77000	And she was the raffle fairy if you saw the umlaut thing
77000	78000	She was the raffle fairy
78000	80000	And yeah she sent me this shirt and it's great
80000	86000	Get it? It's Professor Plum and Colonel Muster? Okay you'll take a picture and upload it on orangeloungeradio.com
86000	87000	I have seen that Woot shirt
87000	89000	Yeah I think it was a Woot shirt
89000	90000	It is a Woot shirt
90000	91000	Hey it's Techmaster Loki
91000	95000	What is up with everybody tonight? Everybody wants to just jump right in before I introduce them
95000	96000	That's alright
96000	98000	Professional radio at its best
98000	101000	I'm just a Woot shirt expert because I check that site all the time
101000	102000	And I'm very
102000	106000	I have to cut down on the amount of t-shirts that I buy because
106000	108000	You know I have a lot of t-shirts already
108000	111000	But damn there's so many good video game shirts there
111000	112000	Oh yeah
112000	117000	Is that, now do they let fans vote on shirts there or is that only Threadless that does that?
117000	120000	It's basically they, yeah they have a thing that they call
120000	121000	Well they have the Derby
121000	127000	It's usually a theme and then they'll create a shirt that wins that theme and then they'll be for sale
127000	129000	And they also have a thing called the Reckoning which
129000	135000	They have 20 shirts and they, people you know who buy them whatever shirts are more popular
135000	140000	Stay on the list and the ones that are not popular fall off the list and they get replaced next week
140000	141000	Gotcha
141000	142000	Alright
142000	146000	You know I would like the Woot shirts better though if I could get like
146000	148000	Better girly style shirts
148000	152000	Yeah they don't have like girl sizes or anything like that
152000	157000	So the Woot shirts end up just being ridiculous for me because I hate the way that regular t-shirts fit
157000	159000	Because for my ginormous
159000	160000	You got the boobies
160000	161000	Rack right
161000	165000	If I'm gonna get a shirt that's gonna fit me everywhere else it's gonna be too tight on the girls
165000	171000	Otherwise I look like you know it's the 80s and you wear your shirt all slouched out with the little clip on the side
171000	173000	No no no no
173000	176000	Maybe it's time to bring back that style you know sometimes old-fashioned makes comebacks
176000	177000	No
177000	181000	Okay okay how about that rat tail and members only jacket huh
181000	185000	Hey I actually wore a members only jacket to a Rocky Horror Show like
185000	188000	It was probably last year at some point because you know that kind of stuff's funny
188000	191000	Of course no one's gonna get that because they weren't in on that conversation
191000	192000	Alright look
192000	194000	Join our chat room chat.orangelaunchery.com
194000	197000	We are a live show we have been for going on almost 10 years now
197000	200000	And speaking of which Tiger Claw in our chat room starts us off tonight saying
200000	205000	Episode 448 you guys just have two more shows until you reach 450
205000	208000	Any plans for the big 450 show?
208000	209000	No I do
209000	210000	No that's not really a milestone
210000	212000	I don't yeah I don't see 450 as a milestone
212000	213000	It's like diet milestone
213000	216000	Especially when we have the 10 year coming up in
216000	218000	Three months
218000	219000	Yeah
219000	224000	A little over three months we still we haven't guys legit we have no idea what we're doing for the 10 year anniversary right now
224000	226000	I'm gonna address something right now to Raginator
226000	227000	Oh what's up
227000	231000	Nothing is going to get me to eat ham bacon and shellfish
231000	234000	Because I have something called principles
234000	235000	You did have
235000	236000	And it's not a whim
236000	238000	You didn't have that bacon milkshake but there was no real bacon in it
238000	240000	No and I tasted it
240000	242000	There's no real good in that either
242000	245000	They just took a vanilla milkshake and said hey we're gonna ruin this
245000	252000	So there's a difference between like getting a vegetarian to eat you know a piece of beef on a whim a dare
252000	257000	Rather than having someone break you know a religious tradition
257000	262000	Well if you want to piss off one of the hosts join our chat room chat.com or just launch radio.com
262000	263000	Say something offensive
263000	265000	Talking about woot shirts here
265000	270000	They've got like already on their reckoning right now here's the shirts that they have
270000	275000	Number 8 1985 the year of the plumber which you know has a bunch of Mario themed stuff on there
275000	283000	They've got number 11 which is hey listen which depicts Link falling asleep in class
283000	285000	And let's see here
285000	291000	They have a number 14 a lot of this is going around which is the arrow through the knee stuff
291000	293000	And it goes in the dark
293000	304000	And not really gaming related but they have the IT guys coat of arms which you know refresh reinstall reboot
304000	309000	I don't know it's just some awesome stuff on there
309000	314000	I do you know now I'm starting to sound like a commercial but I will say this I have found some good stuff on just the woot general site
314000	319000	Like that's where I got my Tron gaming mouse that I have for like 35 bucks and I think normally it's about $80
319000	326000	And I do check woot every day for the matching keyboard because I'm like if the mouse went on clearance then the keyboards got to go on clearance at some point
326000	329000	I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting I want that Tron keyboard
329000	332000	I got some jump drives off there once but I lost them all again
332000	339000	I bought like four of them too and I lost every single one of them all of them they're just like poof disappeared
339000	342000	I had one disintegrate on me but the other three were lost
342000	349000	Alright instead of talking about video game t-shirts let's get to video games and I want to kick off tonight talking a little bit about GDC
349000	356000	Game Developers Conference of course is a huge you know industry event that's happening just across the bridge over in San Francisco not far from us
356000	363000	And that kicks off this week I think Tuesday maybe Wednesday but a lot of people are starting to show up in town already for it
363000	371000	I'm a little bit unknowing to the specifics of GDC because I don't go it's not a media event they don't want media people there
371000	378000	It's really for game developers a great way to do some networking I know people in the industry that go to like look for new people
378000	383000	And you know hiring event especially with some of the bad news we've had lately in the industry
383000	388000	Like for example one story that didn't make our show roll tonight it's been a big pretty big deal in the industry this week
388000	397000	Blizzard laid off 600 people this week unfortunately so you know with the change and you know how these subscriber loss and wow
397000	401000	And the fact that Diablo 3 is pretty much in the can and what have you they unfortunately laid off 600 people
401000	406000	But the good news or I mean the whatever possible good news you can make of that
406000	407000	The upside?
407000	414000	Yeah the upside let's put it that way the upside is that hey GDC is this week so maybe some of those folks can you know take their resumes up to GDC and do some networking
414000	423000	And you never know what you might find so that might be you know some some good to come out of all that so it's a great networking event
423000	432000	But in the past couple years it does seem like big things have come out of it and there have been some big media things
432000	439000	And I even remember one year in particular I think it was about two years ago one of those networks Spiker G4 actually covered a Sony press conference
439000	444000	To talk all about the move and they had released quite a bit of details about the move at GDC
444000	454000	And now this year kind of leading into GDC we're starting to hear little rumblings about you know SimCity 5 information is apparently leaked to the web and you know that is supposed to be happening
454000	462000	There's the Valve thing we'll talk about in a minute I'm sure is on everybody's mind but do you think there's going to be any whopper of news at GDC this year?
462000	477000	As far as announcements go I don't think so I mean maybe I don't know if Nintendo's gonna be showing any Wii U stuff I don't think Nintendo's there but it would be cool if they were
477000	487000	They've shown little tidbits in the past like I want to say wasn't the Mario 3D game first revealed like the logo was first at GDC and it showed the raccoon tail like that that came out of last year's GDC
487000	488000	I thought that was Tokyo Game Show
488000	504000	And then the whole something about a Pikmin game is what turned into Mario Sunshine or something my memory's a little fuzzy on that but I seem to remember something about the Pikmin series ended up becoming something else
504000	513000	Maybe somebody in chat will remember but Nintendo has dropped little tidbits like that Miyamoto did a keynote one year I seem to recall
513000	525000	I mean I hope there's some cool stuff that we'll see out of that there's just a lot of different events going on around the same time you know I mean I don't think we're gonna see a lot from Sony especially on the Vita
525000	542000	Because they have their own kind of event for that we're not gonna probably I would hope I would hope we'd see something on the Wii U because I mean yeah they're gonna show some stuff at E3 but like for developers they kind of have to say hey here's what we have because you're gonna have to make some games for this
542000	558000	Yeah you might see a little more about the Wii U controller but even that I think is a real stretch like I just from what I'm hearing is that the Wii U stuff is you know changing as is the next Xbox 360 or whatever it's called the lube or whatever the next system is is evolving
558000	570000	And that's normal that's nothing unheard of you know all the systems change right up to the last minute so I don't see any sense in bringing out this big to do here's the system specs when that's what E3 is gonna be about
570000	584000	Yeah E3 you know Nintendo's got to bring it to this year's E3 and it's gonna be just a full on this is the Wii U this is the final prototype this these are the games that are coming out this holiday that is what you have to see from Nintendo at this year's E3
584000	597000	You have to so what's interesting to me though is that it would have been a good opportunity for them to do this whole last story reveal and all that stuff that kind of came out last week with their but they did their own thing so whatever
597000	608000	One other question I want to ask about Game Developers Conference you know what it really is more about is getting to sit in and hear from seasoned game designers about you know how they think about game design and so on
608000	616000	Like I know something that you might see like you would see through Nintendo would be talking about their new Nintendo network or whatever that they're gonna have the infrastructure for that
616000	617000	That's a great thought
617000	628000	Because it's more stuff that's gonna be catered towards okay here's what we can do for you for development we're gonna allow you to patch your games I know this new technology that's first available now on Nintendo
628000	636000	You know what if Nintendo is gonna be doing something with independent development perhaps like think something like Xbox indie games I know
636000	647000	Well to be fair I know we got one bit of bad news about indie games on the 3DS tonight but VVVVVV Cave Story you know there are some pretty good titles on the 3DS
647000	658000	I understand that but I think that they'd be worried that someone's gonna trump them at their own game and to be honest yeah there's a lot of indie developers that could make another Mario game or another you know Zelda or something of that caliber
658000	662000	And they wouldn't want it you know taking away the thunder of some of their own stuff
662000	673000	Well just piggybacking on your thought because I think it's a good thought if Nintendo is gonna do anything for the indie developers I think it's gonna come out at GDC I think there's no better time to announce something like that I think that's a great thought
673000	674000	So we'll see
674000	684000	I would like to see Microsoft do something with the indie games you know I mean it's there's a lot of games on there it'd be nice to promote stuff
684000	687000	If there's gonna be an overhaul at all this would be the great time to do it
687000	698000	Changes in Sony Home although they just really did a bunch of that so I don't think that could be it but that was the PlayStation Home was all revealed at GDC some time ago about three or four years ago
698000	706000	I'm not sure what else Sony you know maybe something we haven't thought of yet maybe something with the Vita maybe developing who knows
706000	711000	Let me ask this question though I was about to ask this and you jumped in
711000	723000	GDC is really about kind of hearing from the season developers and you know what they their methods of game design and so forth if you could go to GDC and listen to one developer talk who would you want to hear lecture at GDC
723000	729000	Anybody? Dark Sakura? Loki? Who would you want to go to GDC and see?
729000	730000	Kojima
730000	732000	Kojima why is that just because he's a badass
732000	745000	Pretty badass well honestly I'd like to get some of the classic you know developers there to lecture the new school on how the old school did it like you know Yuji Naka or Yu Suzuki you know
745000	763000	Get the get the you know the the guys who pretty much revolutionized video games you know without them we wouldn't have any of this today so I think that's I would want to see the the old guard pass on the baton to the new guard with some good advice
763000	775000	And not necessarily in terms of announcing anything new I want to see them say you know you need to remember all of this in mind and stop putting out crap that's pretty much it
775000	788000	I'd just like to see anybody talk about Grand Theft Auto 5 I don't care who it is just somebody show me some stuff and talk about it you know they could be like and here's we have footage wise go
788000	801000	Black Wolf in our chat room says Tim Schafer you know especially with all that's going on with the Kickstarter and all that I'd love to hear well I guess I guess the people that paid for that are going to hear about that first we will hear about it at GDC
801000	807000	You know who I wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe you wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe
807000	811000	Let me talk about how important Twisted Metal is I don't care
811000	827000	My dream would be Sid Meier you know because I have made it no secret on the show I am a big fan of all things Civilization but it's not even just that like I think I would like to go to a Sid Meier panel where he talks about covert action really wasn't that bad of a game
827000	843000	Because it wasn't and even Sid Meier thinks covert action they tried to do too much old school PC game it was great I'm not going to get into specifics but that would be the panel I'd want to see covert action it wasn't that bad you did hear though that he's got some sort of input on the new XCOM game
843000	860000	I didn't hear about that Hey we got this problem we need your help and so that's kind of cool Oh act deft brings up Mizuguchi that's a great one I am a whore for all things Q entertainment I'm unapologetically on the show
860000	874000	Actually, Maya, one true love, Igarashi I knew it I was surprised you didn't say that for sure You know what would be cool is if we saw Harmonix there talking about something because they're cooking something up right now I don't really know what
874000	892000	You know GDC is not a media thing it's not really the time to announce your new games your new platforms not even platforms your new like integrated services your new services yes your new games not so much so alrighty Black Wolf in our chat room says I've seen a Sid Meier talk you know rub it in Black Wolf
892000	907000	Bobby Black Wolf of course before us live at all games radio five o'clock Pacific is when he does his show we're on at six Sunday nights Black Wolf says Will Wright's talks are really really really spastic and all over the place Will Wright has like 500 PowerPoint slides for a one hour talk and I'm not exaggerating
907000	928000	You know I will say this, I was fortunate enough one year to see remember when Spore I remember that we got to go see Will Wright demoing it and was that Will Wright demoing it? I completely forgot that Oh yeah, we didn't see the one where it was Robin Williams demoing it I would have rather see the Robin Williams one I loved seeing Will Wright demo it I was like it was his it was his game
928000	944000	and what happened to that game I mean seriously funny enough I think it's a lot of what I said about covert action a minute ago I also think Spore was not that bad but it just tried to do too much it tried to be 17 different games in one it just didn't didn't work out so well
944000	965000	but I loved watching them talk about it you know developers have such a passion for their games you know it's they can even like crappy games like I would watch the guys who made Fusion Frenzy on Xbox 360 or no Fusion Frenzy 2 excuse me the really bad one on 360 I'd watch them talk about their game because they'd be at least enthusiastic about it Barbie Horse Adventures. Heck yeah
965000	992000	you know what what this was at a classic gaming Expo a few years back actually the one that we were all at I got to see a bunch of the Atari guys talking about developing for the how they were it was all vector based and everything and just listening to those guys reminisce and tease each other and talk about the little bits of code they were able to sneak in and like having hardly any room to sneak it in with and that was really cool and I like hearing about all the behind the scenes stuff
992000	1020000	those guys were fucking rock stars because you have to remember some of those early games were one dude Yars revenge was Howard Scott Warshaw he also did ET but you know forgive him David Crane did some of the early I think he did like slot machine on Atari which you know and say what you will about it but it was an early game but then meeting the guys that did Robotron and you know and also and he's he's a man I've actually had a long conversation with a few times is
1020000	1038000	he did a lot of the Williams pinball tables was Steve Ritchie really nice guy he did a lot of the voices for no fear and Black Knight and listening to him talk about developing just the pinball tables about the physics that go into and everything I like hearing about that enthusiasm
1038000	1057000	you know maybe no one else is as into it as they are but it's but their enthusiasm is contagious somebody is if they have these pinball expos across the country yeah but I'm just saying go ahead is even if you're not as interested in it as they are they're still contagious their enthusiasm is contagious absolutely Loki
1057000	1075000	speaking of you know that I actually watched it was a translated video of the guys doing the urinal games at Sega and talking about them and how enthusiastic was and it's no it's seriously it's funny they have like I mean they have a good sense of humor about it
1075000	1088000	like yeah we know this is weird but you know hey we're developing so with that in mind I'd actually want to see the people like I'd want to hear from the guys they were developing these arcade games like the really weird arcade games in Japan like the ones read the flip the table over
1088000	1108000	I want to see what the motivation for that I mean that's just amazing or like Tetris with a giant fucking controller I mean that that's just awesome it does sound awesome I like that table flipping game oh my god why won't the arcades here get that it's like it's a one joke pony but damn it's a good joke it's a joke that won't get old
1108000	1126000	I man if only had the resources. Alright let's get into our gaming weeks we talked a lot about GDC which is great I want to talk about the video games we've been playing this week you know just talking to the crew a little bit before the show it sounds like we had a bit of a classic a little bit of a retro week but let's go around and see what folks have been playing Dark Sakura
1126000	1149000	I've been playing the shit out of Sonic CD. What'd I tell you? Heck yeah well okay I didn't really play the shit out of it I played like four full levels of Sonic CD. What brought on the Sonic CD urge? Um last night I was looking at Steam I was like holy shit it's on Steam bye and then Dan yelled at me today he's like why are you buying games we already have? That happens a lot on Steam. Oh yeah like he should talk I mean come on.
1149000	1173000	What? Buying games that you guys already have. I'm actually trying to think about that. How many versions of Strider do you own? A Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Technically the only reason that we have another version of the first Strider is because it came with Strider 2. So that right there. We also have Strider on Genesis and we have the next Strider which is a different game.
1173000	1185000	I apologize if I'm blending shows together I might have brought this up last week but I loved what you posted on Facebook you posted on Dan's wall and it was Strider NES. It wasn't that bad. I think we brought it up last week. Yeah it was a Capcom blog.
1185000	1205000	Show us Blur together. Dan says it's a decent game I mean I've read some of the Strider Hiryu manga which is what that game is based off of. What I never realized about the Strider NES game is that damn there really is some assets they just ripped right off of Bionic Commando and DuckTales.
1205000	1219000	Like you can see some of the assets right in that game it's amazing. What's Scrooge McDuck doing in there? How come Hiryu is using a cane to jump over little things on the moon? They should have had the moon music play in some of the levels just for fun.
1219000	1239000	That would have been great. At any rate I told them flat out I wanted the Japanese soundtrack because someone did a version of Sonic CD basically using all sprite rips and everything and the Japanese soundtrack and it's like a brand new Sonic CD.
1239000	1251000	I'll try to find it and put it on our tumblr but you can download the whole thing burn it and it will play on a Sega CD. But I mean that was Dan's point we've got it on the Sega CD why do we need to have this other one I don't care if it's got better music.
1251000	1261000	Because it does have better music. Except for the intro and outro it's no lyrics. It's just instrumental. I was like BOO.
1261000	1271000	But anyway I also played I actually was going to play Sebastian and then I was like no. I did find Blue Dragon.
1271000	1276000	The girl changed her mind. The girl alt tabbed to a different game instead.
1276000	1280000	I actually did play a lot of WoW but I sort of like.
1280000	1281000	Addict.
1281000	1284000	Dealer who's been on every time I've been on.
1284000	1287000	Just because I was home sick one day this week alright.
1287000	1291000	And then last night and we should run a dungeon. Yes we should.
1291000	1292000	Well we did.
1292000	1293000	It was fun.
1293000	1295000	Anyway even though I hate Olde Man.
1295000	1296000	Anyway.
1296000	1304000	But I sort of like I had been hitting this kind of rut like where I would log on to an alt like check my box and then I'm like okay I'm done.
1304000	1308000	Log. Shut up. My auction. My mailbox.
1308000	1311000	And then I would log on to another one and go I'm done.
1311000	1313000	And then log on to another one and go I'm done.
1313000	1318000	And then just sit on my main chatting with people. Like I wasn't even playing I just used to be talking to people.
1318000	1322000	And finally I got on the Drendon Gyaru.
1322000	1326000	Who is going to be dressed like a hoe bag once she's 85.
1326000	1328000	Because she's a gal.
1328000	1332000	And decided I actually really like Shadow Priest now.
1332000	1339000	So I just been I kind of got my love for the game back instead of just you know chatting with people.
1339000	1344000	And also a really good friend of mine I found out is on there. And so I've been chatting with her.
1344000	1347000	Sometimes it does just take a change of scenery or a change of character.
1347000	1349000	And this is you know true of any MMO.
1349000	1352000	You know I know our frame of reference as well but any MMO.
1352000	1356000	Like you know things unfortunately were starting to get a little stale on the alliance side where I was playing.
1356000	1359000	Because no one was ever on but you and maybe Jon.
1359000	1362000	And then we weren't raiding anymore so it's like well I'll go try this mage over here.
1362000	1366000	And raid you know and it's kind of reinvigorated like oh now I have something to do in the game.
1366000	1371000	Well we actually have been invited for raiding with another guild now.
1371000	1373000	There's an open invitation.
1373000	1374000	Oh nice.
1374000	1376000	So if we actually want to do alliance raids we've got people.
1376000	1377000	I'll play more offline.
1377000	1378000	Alright.
1378000	1382000	And then I was I'm actually going to be on Tuesday night.
1382000	1387000	Or actually Tuesday during the day before my yoga class I'm logging on to Star Trek Online.
1387000	1388000	To find my Scotsman.
1388000	1391000	And I'm going to be having one day a week at Star Trek Online.
1391000	1393000	Because they miss me.
1393000	1395000	It's been a year and a half and they miss me.
1395000	1397000	Does anybody yell out you know.
1397000	1399000	She can't handle anymore captain.
1399000	1401000	It doesn't have the power.
1401000	1403000	It's funny they're all they're mostly architects.
1405000	1409000	When the football place the dome collapsed.
1409000	1413000	They were all in team speak talking about it.
1413000	1414000	Huh.
1414000	1416000	Like I bet it was cheaply made.
1416000	1422000	I bet you know they should fire their architect and you know like they probably just did it that way because it's America and we build everything cheap.
1422000	1426000	Nothing is built to last here geez.
1426000	1433000	So that's coming up so I've actually been doing some stuff to get my game ready and they're starting episode five.
1433000	1435000	I think it's episode five yeah.
1435000	1439000	A new episode's coming out I think in a week.
1439000	1441000	So yeah I've been pretty excited about that.
1441000	1445000	And they made a lot of changes to DS9.
1445000	1449000	Like I mentioned it before but you can go in the captain's office and there's a lot of cool stuff in there.
1449000	1454000	And then I played Luminous over here last week.
1454000	1456000	I think I mentioned that.
1456000	1460000	And then just that's about it.
1460000	1461000	All right.
1461000	1464000	But I've had a little bit more diverse in the gaming week.
1464000	1465000	Good times.
1465000	1466000	Loki how about you?
1466000	1467000	How was your gaming week?
1467000	1469000	I didn't play hardly anything.
1469000	1475000	Luminous I played that actually for at least a couple hours this week.
1475000	1476000	Same game too.
1476000	1478000	Well one game was an hour.
1478000	1482000	The one I still have paused right now.
1482000	1485000	So I've been playing that.
1485000	1491000	And I downloaded the demo for Reality Fires which I hear is really terrible but you know it's a demo.
1491000	1492000	I'm free.
1492000	1498000	I don't want to try it so hopefully I'll try that this week.
1498000	1504000	Really I mean aside from playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto while working on mod stuff still.
1504000	1510000	Because I've been working on one since like a year ago and I want to get it done.
1510000	1513000	So I don't have to work on it anymore.
1513000	1516000	Call of Duty.
1516000	1518000	Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
1518000	1520000	I played that this week.
1520000	1527000	Played it with my life because we had a bet going that if I lost a game between Wednesday and Friday.
1527000	1535000	That I'd have to publicly apologize at our company meetings or party whatever you want to call it on the microphone to everybody.
1535000	1539000	But fortunately I'm that good so I didn't have to.
1539000	1541000	All I apologize for at the end of the last...
1541000	1542000	Did you get something out of it?
1542000	1547000	No all I did at the very end of it is I just apologize for them sucking so bad.
1547000	1550000	Yeah they're rubbing it.
1550000	1552000	No it's just fun.
1552000	1553000	I'm just playing with them.
1553000	1558000	I understand their frustration. It seems like I'm kind of...
1558000	1559000	So humble.
1559000	1564000	Crazy sometimes. Well I try to be fair.
1564000	1570000	They claim shenanigans but there's no such thing.
1570000	1572000	That's about it.
1572000	1574000	Alright my gaming week.
1574000	1576000	I had an interesting gaming week.
1576000	1578000	I didn't really play a lot of new new stuff.
1578000	1580000	Maybe a little Final Fantasy 13 too.
1580000	1583000	I'm continuing to play WoW as Star Saga mentioned earlier.
1583000	1586000	But I went back and rediscovered some old stuff that I just skipped.
1586000	1589000	And one of them you guys are seriously going to laugh at me.
1589000	1592000	But you know what? We don't have time to play everything.
1592000	1594000	He's playing Barbie Pony Adventure.
1594000	1596000	I'm not playing Barbie Pony Adventure. Shut up.
1596000	1598000	But I am playing Uncharted.
1598000	1601000	The first one from 2007.
1601000	1605000	Yes I finally started getting into the Uncharted series this week.
1605000	1606000	Why?
1606000	1608000	I don't know. I was bored.
1608000	1610000	Alan had a copy of the game on the shelf.
1610000	1612000	And I was like, you know what? I finally need to play Uncharted.
1612000	1614000	Everybody seems to love this game. I'm going to play this game.
1614000	1620000	Now granted I am fully aware that the series really takes off on Uncharted 2 and 3.
1620000	1624000	But I can't play Uncharted 2 until I play Uncharted 1.
1624000	1626000	So I played Uncharted 1.
1626000	1630000	I like the storytelling a lot in it.
1630000	1635000	Obviously this is the strength of the series I gather from people as a whole.
1635000	1638000	The camera and controls kind of bug me a little bit.
1638000	1641000	Like I really want to spin the camera ways it doesn't want to go sometimes.
1641000	1647000	But other than those little quirks, which I think is the same complaint you probably heard about this game five years ago when it was new.
1647000	1651000	But other than those little things I'm really into the story.
1651000	1653000	And I'm having fun with it.
1653000	1656000	So I definitely want to play more of Uncharted and possibly beat it.
1656000	1660000	We'll see depending on what a busy game playing schedule I do or don't have this month.
1660000	1666000	The other game I've been playing a bit of, which is also at least three years old if not like four.
1666000	1668000	I got ModNation Racers this week.
1668000	1671000	I'm not talking the Vita one. I'm talking the PlayStation 3 one.
1671000	1675000	I got ModNation Racers on PlayStation 3 for like $17 used.
1675000	1680000	There's a great little local chain we have here called Dimple here in Sacramento.
1680000	1683000	And they have all sorts of used games.
1683000	1689000	Because they have Super Nintendo games, Dreamcast games, and Atari 2600 games.
1689000	1690000	Which is awesome.
1690000	1694000	The only unfortunate thing is that the Super Nintendo games.
1694000	1697000	Because we have a Super Nintendo hooked up to our TV and it still works great.
1697000	1701000	But the only games I tend to find are like old sports games.
1701000	1704000	Are the only things I like very rarely.
1704000	1708000	I did see Pilotwings today and I don't have a copy of Pilotwings.
1708000	1709000	And I was really tempted.
1709000	1713000	But then I saw ModNation Racers for $17 and I was like I've wanted this game for a while.
1713000	1718000	I don't want to give you my full impressions on ModNation Racers because PlayStation Network has been down all day.
1718000	1723000	And that's what I've been playing most of the day while Alan was doing another podcast in the computer room.
1723000	1727000	So I haven't been able to connect online.
1727000	1730000	So that's kind of the most essential part of the game.
1730000	1736000	But with the offline mode I didn't realize I had all these silly little cut scenes and things.
1736000	1743000	It's definitely got heavy little big planet influence when it comes to exactly how you like customize your character and all that.
1743000	1745000	But you know I have fun with it.
1745000	1747000	The controls are a little weird when driving.
1747000	1749000	It's a little different than Mario Kart.
1749000	1751000	I expected it to be a total clone.
1751000	1753000	But no they have like a button for drifting which is weird.
1753000	1759000	I can't think of another racing game off the top of my head that's had like a specific button for drifting which is strange.
1759000	1761000	But I'm into it.
1761000	1764000	And I think the creation part will be fun later.
1764000	1767000	So yeah there you go.
1767000	1775000	So I've had kind of a renaissance week I guess if you want to call 2007 and 2009 or 10 whenever ModNation Racers came out.
1775000	1776000	Renaissance.
1776000	1778000	Renaissance.
1778000	1781000	Which happened smack dab in the middle of Freddily.
1781000	1784000	We're humans with day jobs. We sometimes miss big games.
1784000	1786000	I want a day job.
1786000	1788000	Somebody hire me.
1788000	1790000	But you've been doing a lot of volunteer stuff so.
1790000	1791000	Okay.
1791000	1793000	Keeping yourself busy.
1793000	1796000	Alright let's move on to some quick housekeeping.
1796000	1800000	I just want to quickly plug our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
1800000	1806000	We're also on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio and also Twitter. OLR on Twitter.
1806000	1814000	Keep in mind you can always find different places to interact with OLR in our community on our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
1814000	1817000	Up in the upper right hand corner is a box called extended play.
1817000	1820000	And you'll see logos for all big social networking sites.
1820000	1823000	And it helps you find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners.
1823000	1832000	And OLR listeners really are the best people because everybody in our little community really subscribes to the theory of don't be a dick when you're playing games online.
1832000	1838000	So if you want to play with people who aren't assholes I really urge you to play with the OLR because it's a really great bunch of people.
1838000	1842000	There's steam community. There's you know Xbox threads and all that stuff.
1842000	1845000	So find some OLR fans and play some games.
1845000	1847000	Alright let's talk about the news.
1847000	1849000	Loki's going to start us off with a whopper.
1849000	1858000	Yeah apparently there's a lot of rumors going around saying that Valve is working on a steam box gaming console.
1858000	1862000	And that it's something that might be announced at GDC this week.
1862000	1866000	Lots and lots and lots of rumors kind of regarding that.
1866000	1875000	The first thing was that there was some sort of like coming from this website The Verge.
1875000	1883000	Basically it's not necessarily going to be a console or it can be a console but it's also like a framework.
1883000	1891000	So you know other companies if you will can manufacture something to those specs and it will be compatible with the console.
1891000	1893000	Because it's going to be like a PC.
1893000	1901000	The hardware they're seeing right now is currently an Intel Core i7 with 8 gigs of RAM and an Nvidia GPU.
1901000	1912000	And I guess any devices that are built to those standards will run any PC title and will support any other digital distribution platform like EA's Origin service and stuff like that.
1912000	1921000	So it sounds like it's almost like some sort of you know digital distribution box which makes sense because that's what Steam is.
1921000	1930000	Also they're you know talking about that they had some sort of different controllers and stuff that they were working on.
1930000	1938000	One that kind of looks a little bit like I guess that MLG pad that they have from Mad Catz.
1938000	1942000	The one with the swappable D-pads and analog sticks and stuff like that.
1942000	1946000	So they're going to have some sort of framework or a controller that would allow you to do that.
1946000	1949000	Where you'd be able to have okay I want an analog stick.
1949000	1956000	Okay no I want a joystick you know like an arcade joystick or something like that instead.
1956000	1959000	Or I want something else.
1959000	1961000	So that's kind of neat.
1961000	1969000	The other thing they're saying also that well actually there's some photos that maybe have leaked out of this as well.
1969000	1990000	Coming from a Twitter account that was one of the Valve employees Greg Coomer apparently from back in November 2nd he's all built this tiny PC an i7 quad core 8 gigs of RAM and a Zotac Z68 motherboard with onboard Nvidia mobile graphics.
1990000	1992000	Runs Portal 2 fast.
1992000	1997000	Well isn't that convenient that all those specs happen in the match up with the rumors were.
1997000	2004000	And you know it would be small enough almost looks like well it's a micro or mini ITX box.
2004000	2010000	So you know it's like an Apple TV size with Wi-Fi and stuff like that.
2010000	2013000	So I mean I could see something like that happening.
2013000	2016000	God can you imagine if that was like an Apple thing.
2016000	2022000	Not necessarily oh Steam Box but it's Apple Steam Box or something like that.
2022000	2028000	I don't know. I would think Apple would want to focus on something that ties into its own thing.
2028000	2035000	You know for forever I would think that they would open up the game store to work on Apple TV and I think a lot of people have been wondering about that.
2035000	2039000	Well we may get that announcement this week isn't there like some big iPad.
2039000	2042000	Yeah there's the iPad 3 but I don't see that.
2042000	2052000	So yeah there's definitely some hints or whatever coming from that Twitter account that they're working on some sort of console device or something like that.
2052000	2058000	So lots of rumored stuff right now and of course you have pictures of the controller.
2058000	2064000	And you know this is coming from some patents that are out there.
2064000	2069000	Video game controller having user swappable control components.
2069000	2076000	So interesting that might be something like that.
2076000	2083000	You know it's interesting that one of the first and I heard Bobby talk about this on his show too.
2083000	2088000	And I got to admit one of the first things that came to my mind when I read about this was the Phantom console.
2088000	2093000	It was talked about E3 it was kind of a laughing stock but in some ways it wasn't all that different.
2093000	2097000	The Phantom was a little PC box it was all digital distribution.
2097000	2105000	The one thing though that really killed it and why people were like no thanks was that they wanted to charge a fee to just have the damn box.
2105000	2110000	And then charge for the games on top of that and I definitely don't see a steam box doing that.
2110000	2113000	But otherwise this concept isn't totally new.
2113000	2118000	This is going to be more like on live where they have their streaming box and the controller and stuff like that and then you use their service.
2118000	2126000	I think this could be something similar that I don't I don't know if it's going to be something that you're streaming content with.
2126000	2129000	Although I could see them doing some sort of streaming service or whatever.
2129000	2137000	But I think this is more of a digital distribution where you download it and this thing is powerful enough to run most games.
2137000	2139000	At least I would hope.
2139000	2145000	I don't know with a mobile graph a mobile Nvidia chip I mean I guess it's possible.
2145000	2155000	I mean hell I have a mobile you know Nvidia chip in my laptop and it can run most you know games and it's really hot doing so but it can do it.
2155000	2158000	So and this is actually pretty old.
2158000	2172000	Then at least the chip is the whole thing would just be very interesting because you're legitimately just selling somebody a PC that hooks up to their television which you know like I know a dark sacrifice house they already have one and I've seen a lot of and most PCs would hook up to a TV nowadays.
2172000	2174000	Most of them have if it's got HDMI.
2174000	2178000	Yeah if it's got dedicated graphics card they always have HDMI out.
2178000	2180000	It's just all in the marketing most people don't think to do that.
2180000	2186000	Yeah you know and I'm like for real that's I mean what is this box giving us that a lot of laptops.
2186000	2201000	But that's the thing though is with the specs though basically okay you need to have this much RAM this much processing power this kind of chip release this you know as low as this chip and then basically I can just download the software.
2201000	2204000	Oh wait that's steam and I can play games.
2204000	2208000	So yeah which I can play steam on my TV.
2208000	2210000	Yeah, you know ready.
2210000	2227000	At first I just kind of looked at this like whatever I don't think this is as big of a deal as people make it out to be but then the more I thought about it I was thinking what if this is what they've been saving half life three for what if this is the way to get half life three.
2227000	2239000	And that would be the huge what I mean my God they could sell an entire console at a one game if there's any game in the world that could push a console by itself it would be half life three.
2239000	2245000	All you have to do announce half life three is going to be the pack in game for this console or it's going to be exclusive window 90 day.
2245000	2248000	This thing's going to sell like a mother.
2248000	2260000	That has to put a keyboard and mouse attachments, because I mean seriously, it's a PC it's a PC any USB keyboard or USB slot you're set there.
2260000	2263000	I don't, that would just be a very dick move.
2263000	2279000	But the thing is so with the specs, I mean less they're making some actual proprietary boards or something like that which they could be but I don't think they are. I mean, you can't really you could almost like say okay give me the part list and I'll build on myself,
2279000	2281000	you know what I mean.
2281000	2292000	Go to our channel and figure it out though, go to our chat room at chat that orange on twitter.com Tiger class as valve should totally make a special edition steam box shaped like the weighted companion cube.
2292000	2296000	Talk about another way to sell a ton of homes, just make them cute.
2296000	2312000	I mean come on that's going to be one of the first it's a case mod for a mic, a micro, you know, it x PC or something like that. You can seriously just most of the case mods out there are like the hell I put one in an Xbox.
2312000	2319000	Although then I broke the motherboard, few weeks back but I had one in an Xbox at one point.
2319000	2325000	At depth in our chat room says be hazard on an HDTV is glorious.
2325000	2337000	Yes, a lot of games look really good on the TV just because you know it's it's got a different way of the way it's kind of projects the images than a monitor just you know a lot of games look really good, especially when it's a huge TV.
2337000	2346000	Derek H takes a different position in our chat room saying no non PC gamer knows what half life is. It's no Mario hell, it ain't even Sonic. That's not true.
2346000	2355000	I was, yeah, I was, are you thinking why I'm thinking the orange box. Yeah, orange box did have half life. I knew a lot of people who have only ever heard of half life.
2355000	2370000	When the orange box came out, I have to admit, I knew what half life was but I didn't play it till I played the orange box. So take that for what it is, but I think I do get the point of and I think this might more be the point.
2370000	2383000	Why would people that are fans of a primarily PC franchise you know as much as half life was in the orange, orange box is still primarily a PC franchise. How, why, why would those people jump ship to buy a new console.
2383000	2396000	Now here's the thing, I would buy a console or we probably get pick up multiple consoles, if they were cheap enough, you know if they were somehow getting some sort of discount on the parts and everything where they can manufacture it cheaper than I can build it myself.
2396000	2406000	You know then that way, oh hey, I can buy PC versions of like Call of Duty or something like that on Steam and we can just play that instead of having to buy a console or whatever.
2406000	2412000	And you know since there's really small form factor I mean that would be pretty awesome.
2412000	2426000	You know and I will say again I'm just fueling fanboy fire by my suggestion at half life 3 but it's kind of you know if Valve was going to do what everybody else did it would make sense but we can just hope that Valve wouldn't do something like that.
2426000	2435000	But no matter what it would sure make a sweet showcase game wouldn't it. If nothing else show off the power. Anyhow.
2435000	2442000	I just don't see it happening. I mean I would love for them to prove me wrong and then I can just go see you know watch them flop.
2442000	2451000	I mean yeah half life 3 would sell to the core half life fans but you know before long they try to figure out some way to get it to run on the PC.
2451000	2457000	You know they try to find ways to, basically if it is going to be a PC they try to find some way of hacking it.
2457000	2466000	And I don't you know again my whole thing was just like maybe like a 90 day window but you know yeah if this thing is just a PC then you know that would be kind of it wouldn't work.
2466000	2470000	But you know I'm just throwing out ideas and keep in mind.
2470000	2477000	They already it took them. They you know PlayStation emulation happened on PCs.
2477000	2486000	Anything that will run on a disk or in some digital format people have tried to emulate on a PC regardless so someone's going to figure it out.
2486000	2489000	I think they would they might just realize that.
2489000	2494000	All right well who knows maybe we'll see something about it at E3 this year that would be the time to show off a new console.
2494000	2499000	Speaking of E3 there's some rumors this week that the Wii U is going to have its price revealed at E3.
2499000	2501000	I mean it has to have its price revealed at E3.
2501000	2505000	But the rumors this week are exactly what that price is set to be.
2505000	2518000	An unnamed source you gotta love those guys disgruntled employee or something told the site Wii U daily that the Wii U will retail for $299.99 when it comes into North America after E3.
2518000	2519000	I think that's just an educated guess.
2519000	2524000	$299 in the US, $299 in Europe, 20,000 yen in Japan.
2524000	2529000	Nintendo has stated before that they're going to try to price it like it's the 360 of the PlayStation 3.
2529000	2535000	I talked last week on the show about why it cannot be more than $450.
2535000	2540000	I think $299 sounds a lot more reasonable for what Nintendo is trying to do here.
2540000	2550000	And I'm kind of with you Loki this is not I could say an unnamed source told Orange Lounge Radio that and that would be a pretty darn good risk to take.
2550000	2553000	I mean $299 is a really good educated guess.
2553000	2558000	Because I mean Wii U daily no offense no one's really heard of you.
2558000	2565000	You know if you get it correct then like oh hey look we said it first if you get it wrong no one's gonna remember that you said that.
2565000	2574000	Well yes and we can tell you from first hand because this very show used to blow the lid on something and nobody knew who we were and we knew we were right.
2574000	2580000	But by the time it was announced nobody cared you know so it happens.
2580000	2584000	Crush 3D or Crush 3D is cancelled by the way.
2584000	2585000	What?
2585000	2587000	It's a Sega game Crush 3D.
2587000	2588000	What the hell's that I don't even remember.
2588000	2592000	It's a 3DS game they just put demo out for they're not publishing it anymore.
2592000	2595000	Wait wait wait where did that come from?
2595000	2597000	Why would they put a demo out if it's been cancelled?
2597000	2598000	That doesn't make any sense.
2598000	2601000	Lots of demos come out for games that end up not happening.
2601000	2604000	I guess but I don't know it just seems like the whole.
2604000	2605000	Well it's not now maybe later.
2605000	2610000	It could possibly be that the demo was just a way to gauge interest.
2610000	2612000	I guess they said they were gonna do that for Mega Man at one point.
2612000	2614000	And the demo didn't even come out for that.
2614000	2615000	That's true.
2615000	2617000	Wait I have a little more on the Wii U.
2617000	2619000	There may have already been some changes to the Wii U.
2619000	2622000	There's some diagrams that are circulating out there on the internet.
2622000	2626000	The original design of the Wii U had like a raised analog stick.
2626000	2630000	But apparently this new one has those more flat circle pads.
2630000	2632000	I thought they always have the circle pads.
2632000	2635000	Like you see on the DS or on the 3DS excuse me.
2635000	2638000	A NeoGAF forum poster did this.
2638000	2642000	Which you know I gotta say NeoGAF there are a lot of industry types that hang out there.
2642000	2649000	So they tend to be a little more on the right direction than maybe a website you never heard of with an unnamed source.
2649000	2655000	Rumor is that Nintendo could have leaked it themselves to see how the community feels about it.
2655000	2659000	Which isn't beyond the realm of possibility and that would be an excellent.
2659000	2662000	NeoGAF would be an excellent place to do it.
2662000	2664000	And apparently two diagrams out there.
2664000	2672000	It would make sense that we have two circle pads to coincide with the redesigned 3DS with two circle pads that will eventually be coming.
2672000	2677000	I mean that's just like saying you know tomorrow is Monday.
2677000	2681000	Um I don't really know how I feel about one or the other.
2681000	2685000	I think I'm a slight I mean I don't hate the circle pads.
2685000	2688000	But I think I'm a slight more fan of the analog sticks.
2688000	2692000	Because you can grab the analog sticks too you don't just have to use them with your thumb.
2692000	2695000	But sometimes for classic games I'll actually kind of pinch the stick and use it that way.
2695000	2697000	And you can't do that with a circle pad.
2697000	2701000	It's harder to kind of I don't know there's like less resistance on this.
2701000	2704000	It's like going from an NES pad to the NES Max.
2704000	2708000	I don't even remember I know what the NES Max is but boy oh boy.
2708000	2710000	What about the NES Advantage?
2710000	2712000	Advantage well that's a joystick.
2712000	2713000	I know.
2713000	2717000	So that's not so bad but the Max had that round slidey thing and ugh.
2717000	2719000	Yuck.
2719000	2723000	So well there you go some rumors about the Wii U.
2723000	2725000	That was only good for versions of Street Fighter.
2725000	2728000	We will see at E3 I'm sure.
2728000	2730000	So let's move on Dark Sakura.
2730000	2733000	Some crap happened and then things happened in the end.
2733000	2734000	No I'm kidding.
2734000	2739000	Um there is that Capcom Namco Sega 3DS game.
2739000	2741000	Well they've got teasers out in the form of chromosomes.
2741000	2744000	And they're specially colored chromosomes.
2744000	2751000	And for people who don't know what chromosomes look like they look like weird disjointed X's.
2751000	2753000	There's your biology lesson.
2753000	2756000	They hang from the ceilings in a lot of science classrooms.
2756000	2759000	Yeah they do.
2759000	2762000	In my science classroom my teacher had like a model.
2762000	2765000	No we had pencils hanging from our ceilings.
2765000	2768000	She also collected Coke cans which is an interesting hobby.
2768000	2769000	Weird.
2769000	2772000	Not like Coca-Cola but all the different types like everything that had ever been discontinued.
2772000	2774000	Like a crystal Pepsi can up on the wall.
2774000	2776000	She was an interesting character.
2776000	2778000	She also collected cocaine which is also weird.
2778000	2781000	I don't want to slander anyone on this program but maybe.
2781000	2786000	My papa collected Alabama football Coke bottles.
2786000	2788000	So he has Bear Bryant foot bottles.
2788000	2791000	I'm sure people relatively know who Bear Bryant was.
2791000	2794000	Yeah I've heard of the old school bottle bottle collecting.
2794000	2795000	Class bottle collecting.
2795000	2800000	Anyway back to Namco Sega Capcom Die.
2800000	2808000	So these are all colored specially and there's some speculation as to what these colors are indicating.
2808000	2813000	Like one of them is from Namco maybe a Klonoa one it's blue and yellow.
2813000	2823000	From Capcom there is one that's definitely zero colored and the fact that it's red and gold with a little green and a little blue and a little white.
2823000	2827000	Which definitely is the distribution on zeros colors.
2827000	2833000	And a Bayonetta one for Sega one that's all mostly black and sexy.
2833000	2837000	So could this be a weird as an ex become sexy.
2837000	2838000	It's time.
2838000	2840000	So it would be black and sexy.
2840000	2842000	It doesn't matter what it is it's Bayonetta.
2842000	2843000	Could this be some weird.
2843000	2849000	I mean either now we're looking at weird ass fighting game Mario or Mario Smash Brothers type thing.
2849000	2852000	It's a breeding game or.
2852000	2854000	Seriously it's like Pokemans.
2854000	2856000	What about like a platformer type of thing.
2856000	2858000	No I think it's a breeding game.
2858000	2859000	A breeding game.
2859000	2862000	Three companies got together to come up with a freaking breeding game.
2862000	2866000	You can have like Bayonetta and Zero get it on and have Baya Zero.
2866000	2867000	Well Sega is in this.
2867000	2868000	No thank you.
2868000	2871000	Perhaps we're going to race these characters derby style.
2871000	2873000	It's probably a fucking kart racer.
2873000	2876000	I don't think so I don't think so.
2876000	2881000	Honestly I kind of see like okay if you could have.
2881000	2885000	Alright think in terms of Soul Calibur how you can make your own custom characters.
2885000	2891000	If you could have you know pick the best bits of different you know stock characters for these companies.
2891000	2897000	And then make your own fighting game character that you would upload and share on the internet.
2897000	2899000	Oh god do not steal my ideas all of you companies.
2899000	2903000	And we'll call it Mega Man universe and then we'll cancel it.
2903000	2908000	This is just an idea that just suddenly popped through my head that would be I thought would be cool.
2908000	2914000	What if it's like somebody actually made a game out of Super Mario crossover but it's not Mario.
2914000	2916000	What if it's a puzzle game.
2916000	2918000	Bayonetta and Mario Brothers that'd be weird.
2918000	2919000	It's called Puzzle Zone.
2919000	2924000	Not get Mario Brothers out of your head but the whole crossover like Bayonetta ends up in a Mega Man universe.
2924000	2925000	The only thing that here's the thing.
2925000	2927000	It was Mega Man universe.
2927000	2928000	Okay well here's the game.
2928000	2935000	There's only one game that kind of reminds me of this and once again the name escapes me but it was for the.
2935000	2943000	I want to say the PlayStation 2 and it was a crossover game with I want to say Bandai and Hudson.
2943000	2951000	So you had Barbie versus Solid Snake versus Bomberman versus you know Optimus Prime.
2951000	2953000	I played that at some anime convention. I think that was like.
2953000	2955000	No I had.
2955000	2960000	And keep in mind there's always been this Robot Tyson.
2960000	2966000	The Robot Wars games that have you know multiple series worth of you know you have Evangelions versus Gundams.
2966000	2968000	And this was a Japanese announcement.
2968000	2974000	Right. So it could be something you know that's more what we'd see in that market versus what we see.
2974000	2975000	DNA Fighter.
2975000	2977000	You know whatever.
2977000	2981000	I don't know I just I feel like why another fighting game.
2981000	2984000	No it doesn't have to be a fighting game. Remember Namco Cross Capcom.
2984000	2985000	Tactical strategy game.
2985000	2986000	Right right right.
2986000	2987000	That failed. Twice.
2987000	2990000	So maybe they'll do that.
2990000	2994000	Rama in our chat room says Peach and Daisy dress like Bayonetta.
2994000	2996000	I think I think that's how you pronounce that.
2996000	2998000	That's how you pronounce that.
2998000	3000000	But Nintendo is not really involved.
3000000	3002000	It is on.
3002000	3008000	It is on the 3DS but it's not a Nintendo wasn't involved as one of the companies so I don't know.
3008000	3010000	It's probably just a fucking kart racer I'm going with that.
3010000	3016000	If not I like I like the idea of a Pokemon game starring Bayonetta.
3016000	3017000	All right let's move on.
3017000	3018000	Gotta whip them all.
3018000	3022000	Dream Mix TV World Fighters was the game I was thinking of.
3022000	3024000	That game was kind of derpy.
3024000	3026000	Orange Right said it in chat too. There it is.
3026000	3028000	It was a Nintendo GameCube game.
3028000	3030000	But I believe it was also PlayStation 2.
3030000	3032000	There was one on the DS too.
3032000	3034000	Twinbee in it.
3034000	3036000	Twinbee is great.
3036000	3038000	This is just fan wanks.
3038000	3040000	Let's get to something else.
3040000	3041000	All right.
3041000	3045000	So Sony is going to be announcing some new Vita stuff probably pretty soon.
3045000	3046000	Actually this week.
3046000	3050000	March 9th they're going to be holding their own live streaming Vita reveal event.
3050000	3054000	Kind of sounds like something Nintendo did last week.
3054000	3056000	Or the week before last.
3056000	3058000	At some point.
3058000	3060000	On the day that the Vita came out.
3060000	3062000	Yes on the day the Vita came out.
3062000	3064000	Nintendo doesn't have any games coming out on the 9th.
3064000	3066000	Oh wait they have one.
3066000	3068000	Wait. No they don't have anything.
3068000	3071000	Just remind me because Mario Party 9 is coming out next week.
3071000	3073000	But yeah.
3073000	3075000	Anyways so they're going to be announcing some stuff.
3075000	3077000	It's supposed to happen.
3077000	3081000	I guess at 6am Eastern.
3081000	3087000	So hope you're up early or like me I'm just going to wake up and read the news the next day.
3087000	3094000	The 24 hour news sites will be all over this to see whoever can post it first.
3094000	3097000	So you know it will be out by the time we roll out of bed.
3097000	3099000	And translated and all that good stuff.
3099000	3105000	Well I mean we know that there are a lot of games in the pipeline for Vita.
3105000	3108000	Because when they announced it they were talking about all these freaking games.
3108000	3110000	Like you know that was like 100 games.
3110000	3114000	So you know maybe more information about Final Fantasy 10.
3114000	3117000	Reimagining and some of these other things we've heard about it.
3117000	3119000	Yeah Metal Gear Solid HD Collection will be this summer.
3119000	3121000	So that's kind of cool.
3121000	3125000	They got like first party games coming out.
3125000	3128000	Nothing for really April yet.
3128000	3131000	But for May and June they've got that covered already.
3131000	3133000	First party titles.
3133000	3137000	I guess because kind of in March they have a few first party titles coming out.
3137000	3139000	Well I think we're going to hear through the summer.
3139000	3141000	And then maybe a couple teasers for holiday.
3141000	3144000	And then E3 is when they really blow the lid off of holiday games.
3144000	3147000	So I think this conference is really about the summer.
3147000	3150000	And I think it's really a way for Sony to reinforce.
3150000	3153000	Hey we're not abandoning the Vita.
3153000	3155000	We're going to have this constant stream of games.
3155000	3158000	LittleBigPlanet they haven't said a lot about and it's out really soon.
3158000	3161000	It doesn't have an official street date yet.
3161000	3165000	But right now it's hovering at the end of March, maybe April.
3165000	3168000	So that would be a good April title because there's nothing in April right now.
3168000	3172000	I think that's the game you're going to hear more about at this event for sure.
3172000	3175000	LittleBigPlanet, that's a must buy for sure.
3175000	3179000	So they have a lot of stuff coming out.
3179000	3181000	It's just going to be exciting.
3181000	3184000	Hopefully it's more exciting than Motorstar Marcy which looks like crap.
3184000	3190000	This might also be where they're going to unveil that they made the PlayStation games backwards compatible.
3190000	3194000	Finally? Maybe? Question mark?
3194000	3198000	You know, big feature announcement? Question mark? Possibly? Hopefully?
3198000	3201000	PlayStation 2? Okay now I'm pushing it.
3201000	3203000	You never know though right?
3203000	3205000	You never know.
3205000	3209000	Alright well speaking of PlayStation 2, there's some games you're not going to be able to play much longer.
3209000	3211000	Some Sony games.
3211000	3215000	Some Sony games are having their servers closed on March 29th of this year.
3215000	3217000	Sony Online Entertainment.
3217000	3223000	I actually don't think all of these are PS2 games but I know EverQuest Online Adventures is closing.
3223000	3229000	I totally forgot that this game was on the PlayStation 2 but it was kind of like a spinoff of the main EverQuest game.
3229000	3233000	Well if you're a fan of this game you'll no longer be able to play it after March 29th, 2012.
3233000	3237000	The other games that are going away, I honest to god have never heard of any of these.
3237000	3242000	Cosmic Rift, Infantry, and Star Chamber the Harbinger Saga.
3242000	3245000	I've heard of Cosmic Rift. I couldn't tell you what it is.
3245000	3247000	It's kind of...
3247000	3249000	Well let me look.
3249000	3253000	But uh, I've heard of it.
3253000	3255000	Yeah.
3255000	3263000	I honestly thought that all the games on PlayStation 2 had their servers shut off a long time ago.
3263000	3267000	Like you know when Amplitude went down and all the old sports games.
3267000	3269000	Are you talking about there's still PS2 games coming out?
3269000	3275000	Cosmic Rift is a two dimensional massively multiplayer video game designed by lead programmer Jeff Peterson.
3275000	3277000	It is a science fiction universe.
3277000	3281000	It is provided as part of the Station Pass through Sony Online Entertainment.
3281000	3283000	This is a Windows game.
3283000	3292000	It was released open beta April 2001 and it's completely free to play as of June 26th, 2011.
3292000	3294000	But now they're shutting it down.
3294000	3300000	So it looks kind of like an old school shooter game.
3300000	3303000	Like old school space shooter.
3303000	3308000	But obviously these games must have had their fans to keep them going this long.
3308000	3310000	So it's unfortunate they're probably shaking their fist right now.
3310000	3312000	Like why haven't you heard of my game?
3312000	3317000	But unfortunately they're getting shut down now because it just wasn't enough to keep it profitable.
3317000	3318000	That's what happens.
3318000	3321000	That's got to suck when you buy an online game like that.
3321000	3325000	Well my heart jumped a beat when I saw this headline because I was like,
3325000	3328000	fuck, are they going to shut off ModNation Racers a month after I bought it?
3328000	3330000	Phew, it's okay, but it was all old stuff.
3330000	3332000	Nothing on PlayStation 3.
3332000	3335000	Yeah, I don't think they would dodge that bullet.
3335000	3337000	Alright, let's move on.
3337000	3340000	We're coming up on release dates here after one more story from Dark Saga.
3340000	3342000	Again? Okay.
3342000	3344000	How about some Minecraft news?
3344000	3347000	Because I know we have like what, five people to play Minecraft?
3347000	3349000	Anyway, Minecraft Pocket Edition.
3349000	3355000	Minecraft Pocket Edition actually hit one million paid downloads on Android.
3355000	3359000	And apparently it's doing pretty well on iOS.
3359000	3363000	It's the 26th position in the top paid app charts.
3363000	3366000	So, not bad, huh?
3366000	3374000	There's a tweet that came out from Daniel Kaplan, who is the business developer behind it.
3374000	3378000	It says Minecraft Pocket Edition has now sold more than one million copies.
3378000	3382000	Thanks all the support, and I hope you will like the coming updates.
3382000	3385000	So, good?
3385000	3389000	Hooray for people who like Minecraft.
3389000	3392000	That's not bad for, you know, an Android title that, you know,
3392000	3395000	based on a port that I'm sure is better on the PC,
3395000	3399000	but it seems to be doing pretty well on mobile, so good for them.
3399000	3402000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3402000	3404000	We'll start with the US.
3404000	3406000	This week we've got quite a few things coming out,
3406000	3412000	starting with a brand new Xbox 360 special edition Kinect bundle with Kinect Sports,
3412000	3415000	and it's a white console with a white Kinect.
3415000	3418000	That's out this week, 300 bucks for that.
3418000	3423000	And then, of course, Top Gun Hard Lock on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
3423000	3427000	MLB 2K12 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3,
3427000	3434000	Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP, and PC as well.
3434000	3438000	Street Fighter X Tekken, both regular and special edition,
3438000	3442000	out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3442000	3448000	Mass Effect 3 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the PC,
3448000	3451000	also the collector's edition with that as well.
3451000	3455000	Country Dance All Stars for Kinect, that's out this week.
3455000	3458000	Nicktoons MLB 3D for the 3DS.
3458000	3462000	LEGO Harry Potter years 5 through 7 on the Vita.
3462000	3464000	Unit 13 on the Vita.
3464000	3468000	MLB 12 The Show on PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
3468000	3474000	The Sims 3 Showtime, they have that expansion coming out.
3474000	3478000	Also Showtime Plus, that includes the regular game as well.
3478000	3486000	And the shark jumping, The Sims 3 Showtime, Katy Perry collector's edition,
3486000	3491000	that's coming out on PC as well.
3491000	3493000	The classic bitch game is this.
3493000	3495000	Katy Perry what?
3495000	3501000	The Sims 3 Showtime expansion, Katy Perry collector's edition.
3501000	3505000	I don't know what deal there is between EA and Katy Perry,
3505000	3509000	but there was that whole Simlish song she did.
3509000	3511000	Which was cute.
3511000	3513000	She must be a closet Sims fan.
3513000	3516000	No, it's part of this. It's tying into this thing.
3516000	3522000	I was getting exclusive stage and Katy Perry accessories.
3522000	3524000	Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it.
3524000	3526000	Katy Perry!
3526000	3528000	Also I need to interject with some breaking news.
3528000	3529000	What?
3529000	3531000	IOS game for free right now.
3531000	3534000	Doctor Who The Maze Is In Time is free on the IOS store.
3534000	3536000	More important news than Katy Perry.
3536000	3538000	For a limited time.
3538000	3543000	Also this week, in case you want to save a little bit of money,
3543000	3547000	we have a 2K Sports 2-Pack NBA 2K12 and MLB 2K12,
3547000	3549000	which I think saves you 50 bucks.
3549000	3551000	Each one of those games is still full price.
3551000	3553000	Which is kind of interesting.
3553000	3555000	And then last but not least, Mario Party 9.
3555000	3557000	One week today.
3557000	3559000	On the Wii, of course.
3559000	3560000	God damn, nine of them?
3560000	3562000	Mario Party 9.
3562000	3565000	I remember when the first game looked like it was Mario Party 3,
3565000	3568000	but it was just the horrible art on the box.
3568000	3571000	But you know, Mario Party 9 is not technically the ninth Mario Party game,
3571000	3575000	because there was one on the DS as well.
3575000	3577000	Wait a minute, who's making those games now? Isn't it Hudson?
3577000	3580000	Hudson was making them before, and now who's making them?
3580000	3582000	Uh...
3582000	3584000	Nintendo's making them.
3584000	3585000	I guess they brought it back.
3585000	3587000	All right, let's look at Japan.
3587000	3589000	Japan's got a busy week too on the Xbox 360.
3589000	3591000	Alan Wake gets a price reduction.
3591000	3592000	Platinum Collection.
3592000	3595000	So does Dance Evolution, which we have as dance masters here.
3595000	3598000	Doo-Dahm Pachi Resurrection gets a price reduction,
3598000	3600000	as does Dream Club Zero.
3600000	3602000	And of course, a big release over there for Japan.
3602000	3605000	Street Fighter X Tekken in a regular and collector's package.
3605000	3607000	Two other games coming out this week.
3607000	3609000	I have to admit, I got really excited,
3609000	3613000	because my eyes blended these two titles together for a minute.
3613000	3618000	There's Birds of Steel and Blades of Time.
3618000	3620000	And I read that as Blades of Steel.
3620000	3622000	But they are two separate games.
3622000	3625000	Birds of Steel is kind of your Konami's answer to Ace Combat,
3625000	3630000	because those old school flight simulator things are pretty popular in Japan.
3630000	3635000	Blades of Time is a little more of a God of War, Bayonetta-esque action-y.
3635000	3638000	It is the unofficial sequel to X-Blades, if you remember that one.
3638000	3639000	Is it? Oh, okay.
3639000	3641000	Actually, that is supposed to be coming out this week as well.
3641000	3643000	I forgot, that's on PS3 and 360.
3643000	3644000	Oh, so here in the US as well?
3644000	3645000	Yes.
3645000	3646000	Very cool.
3646000	3648000	Birds of... wait, no, Blades of Time.
3648000	3650000	Because I said Blades of Steel.
3650000	3651000	I guess he used it too.
3651000	3652000	It's confusing, I know.
3652000	3653000	It is.
3653000	3662000	Okay, so Birds of Steel, that's coming out later this month.
3662000	3665000	It would be funny if it was like a, you know,
3665000	3668000	it's pigeons playing hockey or something like that.
3668000	3671000	Konami, you need to bring back your hockey classic.
3671000	3672000	I don't think they can.
3672000	3676000	I think that, you know, people have rights to hockey now.
3676000	3678000	Well, can't you put out just like what they did with Tecmo Bowl,
3678000	3681000	where they just make up teaming players or something?
3681000	3684000	Or make birds play hockey and call it Birds of Steel.
3684000	3685000	Alright, look.
3685000	3687000	We got to go to the PlayStation 3 and talk about what they're getting.
3687000	3690000	Birds of Steel and Blades of Time are there as well.
3690000	3694000	Mobile Suit Gundam UC comes out in the Japanese and Asian regions.
3694000	3698000	And Street Fighter X Tekken gets its release on PlayStation 3 as well.
3698000	3704000	Also, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Ho no Shou comes out this week.
3704000	3706000	This must be another Nobunaga Online game.
3706000	3709000	I thought they already had one, so I don't know if this is an expansion or what,
3709000	3712000	but you know these Nobunaga games are crazy over there.
3712000	3717000	It is not the Nobunaga Pokemon game because this is not a Nintendo system.
3717000	3719000	This is Sony PlayStation 3.
3719000	3723000	Coming out on the PlayStation Vita this week, Unit 13 in Japan.
3723000	3729000	And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Girls RPG, Cinderella Life.
3729000	3731000	That is for real the name of it.
3731000	3733000	Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.
3733000	3735000	That will be kind of a big deal I think.
3735000	3741000	And lastly Hatsune Miku and Future Stars Project Mirai comes out this week
3741000	3745000	in regular and accessory sets.
3745000	3747000	How about the UK?
3747000	3750000	Some stuff, actually there's a number of things.
3750000	3753000	On the 6th we have Unit 13 for the Vita.
3753000	3756000	On the 7th we have I Am Alive.
3756000	3760000	Trine 2 and Twisted Metal and Velocity.
3760000	3763000	On the 8th is Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.
3763000	3770000	And then on the 9th is Azura's Wrath, Mass Effect 3, and Street Fighter X Tekken.
3770000	3771000	The end.
3771000	3772000	All right.
3772000	3775000	Real quick I want to mention this going to our chat room.
3775000	3777000	Rama dropped a tip about Mario Party 9.
3777000	3781000	I guess the folks that are actually developing it is ND Cube.
3781000	3785000	Nintendo might be publishing it because ND Cube is a Nintendo subsidiary.
3785000	3789000	They made in the past, they did some GameCube and Game Boy Advance games.
3789000	3792000	F-Zero, Maximum Velocity was one of the games that they did.
3792000	3795000	And Wii Party I guess was their game too.
3795000	3797000	You remember Wii Party?
3797000	3800000	So this minigame collection thing is right up their alley.
3800000	3803000	So there you go.
3803000	3805000	Wii Party.
3805000	3807000	Party.
3807000	3810000	Let's move on with a few more stories and then our classic game of the week.
3810000	3811000	Loki?
3811000	3816000	Hopefully it doesn't, well I know it's going to do a lot better than Wii Party.
3816000	3820000	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about patent trolls.
3820000	3826000	Yes, there was another patent troll that came after Nintendo suing them over the Wii Fit game and Balance Board.
3826000	3829000	I remember even seeing it was the XR Station.
3829000	3832000	It was just this big lever thing that people squeeze.
3832000	3839000	It was actually showed I guess in 2008 as it was called Squeeze.
3839000	3842000	S-Q-W-E-E-Z-E.
3842000	3846000	And like a Wii remote peripheral or something like that.
3846000	3847000	It's weird.
3847000	3850000	But as you can imagine, they lost.
3850000	3852000	So hooray!
3852000	3856000	I think that's like three trolls down and millions more to go.
3858000	3865000	Didn't some other patent troll pop up this week with about like they own the patent on Facebook games or something like that?
3865000	3866000	I don't know.
3866000	3873000	Or the whole like there's a picture of Doom and then it's all give us 99 cents for more ammunition was the way the artwork looked.
3873000	3876000	And it's basically like every Facebook game ever would have to pay money.
3876000	3878000	If this came to...
3878000	3880000	Yeah, it's pretty dumb.
3880000	3884000	So how long before patent reform here in the US ever?
3884000	3891000	Well you would think that that would be really quick but unfortunately it's been like this for years so I don't see any sort of change.
3891000	3896000	With Apple getting bigger and bigger and bigger and turning into the behemoth Skynet that it's turning into.
3896000	3899000	Maybe they'll be able to get something pushed through.
3899000	3901000	Don't put it past them.
3901000	3913000	Honestly, as bad as I'd hate to see a company controlling the government, if it's for some positive that would be kind of nice.
3913000	3916000	Do you really want to finish this train of thought?
3917000	3919000	Just saying.
3919000	3921000	Think about what you're really saying.
3921000	3926000	If a corporation controlled the US, it might not be so bad if...
3926000	3928000	If it was positive.
3928000	3930000	Remember, corporations are people. Remember.
3930000	3932000	I'm not gonna go there.
3933000	3935000	Did you want to finish your thought?
3936000	3938000	I already finished my thought.
3938000	3946000	I said if they did it for the positive, now if they said, you know, fuck you we own the patent system now bitches, then that's a little different.
3947000	3951000	Alright, well somebody that got told fuck you this week was the makers of The Binding of Isaac.
3951000	3955000	This is a popular indie title that is already out there on PC.
3955000	3962000	It's very Zelda inspired, and so it would have felt right at home on the 3DS, but apparently those talks have broken down.
3962000	3965000	Binding of Isaac is from Team Meat, of course the folks behind Super Meat Boy.
3965000	3972000	And after a long internal debate, according to Twitter, Nintendo has decided not to allow The Binding of Isaac on the 3DS.
3972000	3977000	They're saying it's because of, quote, questionable religious content.
3978000	3982000	Now Bobby, the guy before us here at All Games Radio, he wanted me to bring this up on the show.
3982000	3984000	He even said it at the end of his show.
3984000	3990000	Is it more questionable religious content or questionable resemblance to Legend of Zelda content?
3990000	3992000	I don't know. I mean you gotta...
3992000	3996000	I don't know if that... I mean I haven't really played The Binding of Isaac extensively.
3996000	3999000	I've listened to the soundtrack though, oddly enough, but I haven't played the game.
3999000	4004000	VVVVV's got a lot in common with Metroid, so I don't know, but...
4005000	4007000	Interesting.
4007000	4014000	I guess part of the story is that it's a child running away after God tells the child's mother to sacrifice him.
4014000	4018000	Or a God-like voice, I should say. Not like THE God, you know, but a God-like voice.
4018000	4022000	So maybe some of that questionable sacrifice and things is a little much.
4022000	4025000	If he read the Bible, he'd know Isaac got away.
4025000	4026000	Stop.
4026000	4027000	I know.
4027000	4028000	So, uh, yeah.
4028000	4034000	And now, some further stuff that developed this week is that I want to read somewhere that, I don't know if this is fanboy wank, so...
4034000	4038000	Take this with a grain of salt, but Team Meat's already in talks with Sony.
4038000	4042000	Which would be the likely alternative. Go to the Vita.
4042000	4048000	Why not? 3D Dot Game Heroes was awfully a lot like a certain Nintendo classic, and it ended up on the PlayStation 3, so...
4048000	4049000	Why not?
4049000	4054000	The thing too, they were saying, you know, they're basically that maybe it's because it was M-rated or something like that,
4054000	4058000	but there's a lot of M-rated content already on there, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D thing.
4058000	4066000	And here's what my problem with it is, is that if it is M-rated, oh, you know, it's gonna hurt our fans.
4066000	4069000	We don't want the little kids playing a game like this, then...
4069000	4074000	You know, you did build parental controls into your system.
4074000	4077000	You know people could use those.
4077000	4085000	I mean, if you're not going to allow all sorts of content on your, you know, shop online,
4085000	4091000	then what's the point in having all these content filters if you're going to filter it before it even gets out there?
4091000	4095000	It does seem like an interesting reason, but something to take with a grain of salt.
4095000	4098000	Remember that reason is coming from Team Meat, it's not coming from Nintendo.
4098000	4103000	Once again, once again, though, this is kind of like a whole thing alluding to even the new console.
4103000	4107000	There's so much, even with the Wii, it was like, well, maybe not so much with the Wii,
4107000	4113000	but like, they were like, okay, listen, we want to shed this, you know, kiddie game company thing.
4113000	4122000	We want to shed that kind of perception of us, and we really want to, you know, bring the hardcore gamer back into, you know, everything with our consoles.
4122000	4128000	And then, sure enough, when the Wii came out, let's put out kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.
4128000	4130000	Oh, and we'll put out another game that might appeal to everybody.
4130000	4132000	Eh, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.
4132000	4138000	And then, you know, with this new console, hey, we're making a hardcore console that's going to, you know, support all types of games,
4138000	4141000	and it's going to be, you know, it's really going to get the hardcore user back behind it.
4141000	4146000	And then it's going to be kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games in HD.
4146000	4150000	But, yeah, you may have, you know, Assassin's Creed or something like that, because it can run it now.
4150000	4155000	Let me bring up this, because Bobby's really kind of stressing his point here in the chat room about this,
4155000	4161000	and shares a screenshot, and I totally get it, because he's sharing the screenshot, and it looks like the fucking Legend of Zelda.
4161000	4167000	I mean, the way, on down to the little mini-map with the rectangular rooms in the upper left-hand corner,
4167000	4172000	little spaces for the A and B buttons, and your life meter, I mean, the design of the screen,
4172000	4176000	and even the look of the dungeons, everything is the freaking Legend of Zelda.
4176000	4183000	Now, maybe it's not so much the questionable religious content, but it's, I think it might be a combination.
4183000	4188000	It's questionable religious content that sure looks a lot like Zelda, and we don't want people thinking Nintendo did this.
4188000	4191000	Now, who made the statement, though, about why it's not on the shop?
4191000	4199000	Yeah, see, that's the thing, is I would think if it's Nintendo, and they're saying, you know, this looks a little too much like the Legend of Zelda,
4199000	4202000	you know, that might look a little weird, you know, because Team Meat would go,
4202000	4206000	yeah, we couldn't get on the server because it looks a little too much like the Legend of Zelda, and people are like,
4206000	4211000	yeah, I can kind of see that, but when they do the religious content, they're trying to throw some pressure towards...
4211000	4217000	Well, yeah, I really think it's, yeah, I think it's one of those things where maybe it was a combination, you know.
4217000	4221000	It's not the fact alone that it looked and felt like Zelda that made Nintendo uncomfortable.
4221000	4225000	It's just that they're worried that people are going to misinterpret it as a Zelda remake,
4225000	4230000	because people are that silly sometimes. Not everybody listens to podcasts.
4230000	4232000	You were going to say they were stupid.
4232000	4237000	Well, and people would think it's a Zelda game with all this questionable mom sacrifices the child.
4237000	4239000	What the hell kind of game is this?
4239000	4243000	I do agree people are stupid. This is how we get Katy Perry collector's editions of The Sims.
4243000	4246000	This is true.
4246000	4250000	What about a Katy Perry Legend of Zelda? Would that be offensive?
4250000	4252000	It wouldn't happen.
4252000	4255000	Yes, it would be offensive to everybody. Everybody.
4255000	4264000	See, Rob, the only other person that I know who does those what-ifs about things that never happen is my friend's four-year-old.
4264000	4268000	What if this was a racetrack? Then we would be racing.
4268000	4272000	But what if we were racing? We're not racing.
4272000	4277000	Yeah, the layout is Zelda-ish, but there's enough difference.
4277000	4282000	This screenshot that Bobby shared in the bottom right-hand corner, it says,
4282000	4285000	All stats up. Well, Legend of Zelda didn't have stats.
4285000	4292000	On top of that, if Nintendo was really going to be pushy about that, they could have gone after Newtopia back in the day,
4292000	4296000	which was almost exactly like A Link to the Past.
4296000	4307000	But this game is just down to the design of the freaking screen. At least Newtopia kind of looked a little different.
4307000	4312000	Team Meat should be ashamed of themselves for blatantly ripping off The Legend of Zelda.
4312000	4315000	No, they shouldn't.
4315000	4318000	Why? I mean, let's play devil's advocate here.
4318000	4325000	If we're giving so much shit to Zynga for ripping off Tiny Tower, then why can't we give them shit for ripping off The Legend of Zelda?
4325000	4331000	They're not ripping it down to a T, though. Again, the original Zelda didn't have stats.
4331000	4339000	It did, but they weren't actually visible stats, because obviously, why would I pick up different armor or different swords if they all had the same stats?
4339000	4344000	I see blood in this game. Did Zelda have blood? Don't think it did.
4344000	4352000	It had sparkles, and sparkles meant violence. And smoke. There was smoke? Where's there smoke? There's fire.
4352000	4359000	Alright, you're right. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Alright.
4359000	4363000	Let's go back to a time when gaming was a lot simpler.
4363000	4368000	We didn't have quite the ripoffs that we have now. Actually, we totally did have ripoff games back in the day.
4368000	4369000	Probably more so.
4369000	4377000	Probably right. But hey, Dark Soccer's gonna pick a game that wasn't really a ripoff. It was a goddamn pioneer. Maybe a little bit of a ripoff.
4377000	4380000	But let's see, Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4380000	4382000	Sorry, sorry to interrupt real quick.
4382000	4383000	But you do it so well.
4383000	4390000	I know. Real quick question on the Dark Soccer. You were talking about that one game that came out that was very similar to Link to the Past or whatever.
4390000	4395000	Did that have the Nintendo seal of approval? Because that's basically approving the fact that they like games that look like that.
4395000	4398000	It didn't come out on the NES.
4398000	4400000	It should still have the seal of approval.
4400000	4403000	It was a TurboGrafx game. It was Nootopia and Nootopia 2.
4403000	4411000	But they didn't push for any kind of copyright infringement or anything like that. Because even though it looked almost identical, it was a different game.
4411000	4412000	Alright, fair enough.
4412000	4413000	Can we talk about the other classics now?
4413000	4415000	Yes, Sonic CD.
4415000	4419000	Oh, Sonic CD it is. So much for that music.
4419000	4422000	Well, we already played a bunch of it while Loki was talking.
4422000	4428000	So, okay, I have to start from the beginning. The Japanese version had better music.
4428000	4435000	Okay, Rob, if you would do me a favor. Because I'm going to get into the rest of this later, but I'd like for this to stay on.
4435000	4438000	Play the US music first, if you don't mind.
4438000	4440000	I just want to say the YouTube here is really quiet.
4440000	4442000	Yeah, it is. I'm sorry.
4442000	4443000	Let's see if the English one is any louder.
4443000	4444000	It is.
4444000	4445000	Okay.
4445000	4449000	Okay, now listen to this everybody.
4449000	4453000	This is the first level in the bad future.
4453000	4457000	Skip just a little bit ahead.
4457000	4462000	Do you see that? It has that kind of dark jungle-y sound.
4462000	4466000	This sounds like one of those bands, the pan flute bands that play at the strip mall.
4466000	4468000	That play at downtown Disney.
4468000	4476000	Now play the Japanese one.
4476000	4478000	Alright, play the Japanese one. Here you go.
4478000	4480000	Yeah.
4480000	4483000	Maybe quite a bit more lively.
4483000	4485000	This is more like the rave that's happening in House of Blues.
4485000	4487000	Okay.
4487000	4490000	So yeah, the game is Sonic CD.
4490000	4495000	Well, I should say Sonic the Hedgehog CD that came out in 1993.
4495000	4500000	And it was developed by Sonic Team for the Mega CD slash Sega CD.
4500000	4505000	And it was the first appearance of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose.
4505000	4509000	It came out in Japan on September 23, 1993.
4509000	4511000	In Europe in October 1993.
4511000	4514000	In North America on November 19, 1993.
4514000	4517000	It came out on the PC in 1996.
4517000	4522000	And was included in the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005 for PS2 and GameCube.
4522000	4527000	There was an enhanced version that was just recently released in December 2001.
4527000	4531000	Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, iOS, and Android.
4531000	4535000	And then we have a PC version that came out January 19, 2012.
4535000	4540000	There is supposed to be a Windows Phone version coming out first quarter 2012.
4540000	4542000	Just thought I would mention that too.
4542000	4546000	So basically, for anyone who's played a Sonic game, this is a freakin' Sonic game.
4546000	4548000	He has the spin dash.
4548000	4552000	You collect the rings. You go underwater, which are the underwater levels.
4552000	4557000	You had the invincibility shield. You had the speed shoes.
4557000	4560000	The music ran out. Should I play some other tracks here?
4560000	4562000	Yeah, play some other.
4562000	4564000	Let's do Palm Tree Panic Zone. That sounds like fun.
4564000	4569000	That's actually the present version of that same level.
4569000	4573000	Which they did a remixed version of this one slower for the American one.
4573000	4575000	So anyway.
4575000	4582000	So yeah, you also have with the spin dash, you have the super peel out that lets you zoom into quick speed from a standing point.
4582000	4585000	Either rolling or in running position.
4585000	4589000	And it's faster than the spin dash, but it leaves Sonic more vulnerable.
4589000	4593000	And then each of the levels has three acts. You have two main levels and a boss act.
4593000	4597000	And one thing I have to say is that the boss levels are actually pretty neat.
4597000	4601000	Because it's kind of a departure from the way that the normal boss levels went.
4601000	4610000	Like one of the ones that I did right before I left was one where you chase Eggman or Robotnik for people who are sticklers for the American version.
4610000	4615000	You chase Eggman all the way through the level until you've got him busted.
4615000	4617000	So it's pretty cool.
4617000	4625000	The big thing that makes this one different is that you've got a sort of time travel aspect where you go into the past and the future.
4625000	4630000	And basically when you hit a past or future sign, you have to run really fast and these sparkles travel behind you.
4630000	4633000	It looks like Sonic is farting glitter.
4633000	4637000	And then you end up in the past or the future.
4637000	4643000	Now if you go into the future by default, then you go into a bad future.
4643000	4651000	Where it's basically over industrialized and everything is dead and decaying and awful.
4651000	4657000	You go into the past, it's like, for example, I always forget the name of it.
4657000	4659000	Like something Chaos Collision I think it is.
4659000	4663000	But I always refer to it as pretty much the casino night.
4663000	4668000	Because it's like every Sonic game that has a pinball theme in there.
4668000	4670000	And it's not the freaking chemical zone, thank god.
4670000	4684000	But anyway, instead of it being all pinball-y and nighttime casino looking, it's like this neat looking pristine jungle thing.
4684000	4686000	It's really cool looking.
4686000	4694000	But if you've managed to do a lot of good things and destroy things in the past, then when you go to the future again,
4694000	4701000	instead of going back to the modern, you have to basically go through the past and destroy a robot generator that's hidden in the level.
4701000	4708000	So that when you go back in the regular time and then you go to the future again, you're sort of in this technogion future.
4708000	4717000	Where everything is technology and nature all working together, synergy, you know, it's just...
4717000	4719000	What kind of hippie stuff is this?
4719000	4724000	Yeah, it's clean energy and everything is cool.
4724000	4728000	We're sustainable. That's the big key word, sustainable today.
4728000	4739000	So basically, in the past when you destroy the robot generator, then that actually kills all the robots in the future.
4739000	4745000	So when you have to go after Robotnik for his level, because his level is always in a bad future,
4745000	4752000	you actually go after him in a good future where he's weaker and you don't have all of the bad guys in your way.
4752000	4754000	It's really unique.
4754000	4760000	So also if you have more than 50 rings, by the end of the act a big gold ring appears and if you jump onto it,
4760000	4765000	then you have to go around and destroy these purple UFOs that are floating around the level.
4765000	4776000	And it's kind of that sort of Mario Kart looking, like old school Mario Kart looking pathway where it's all the pixelated mode 70 looking stuff.
4776000	4782000	And you can slow down by going through water, you can get speed ups through there,
4782000	4789000	you can destroy blue UFOs that give you more time or you can get speed shoes and different things.
4789000	4798000	But if you destroy all of the purple UFOs, then you get a time stone and you can get the good ending if you collect all seven time stones.
4798000	4802000	Basically, it's this game's version of Chaos Emeralds.
4802000	4811000	So basically though, you automatically get that good future if you have all the time stones.
4811000	4817000	You also have a backup save using either the internal memory on the Sega CD or RAM cartridge.
4817000	4825000	And it will save at the end of every third act. What I can tell you too, is that it saves automatically the same way on the Steam version.
4825000	4829000	You see the little now saving icon at the bottom, that's cool.
4829000	4845000	And it does have an instant game over scenario, so Sonic will just jump off the screen if you leave the game alone for three minutes without it being paused.
4845000	4852000	Now for the newer version, you can actually play as Tails, or I should say Miles Tails Prower.
4852000	4862000	And he has a spin dash, the spin attack, and he can fly with his little tail rotating, but he doesn't have the super peel out and you cannot earn achievements with him.
4862000	4868000	You can also use the spin dash physics from Sonic 2, so that's pretty cool.
4868000	4879000	So basically, the way that this goes is that Sonic and Amy, Amy Rose, show up at Never Lake where the little planet, not the little big planet, just the little planet,
4879000	4885000	shows up, you know, the last month of every year, so it's the month of the time, basically.
4885000	4892000	And they basically find out that Eggman's taking it over and things are getting crappy, and then Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy!
4892000	4903000	Oh no, so Sonic has to go get the time zones, the time stones, and the seven jewels that alter time and save Amy and destroy Sonic and free the little planet.
4903000	4916000	So yeah, this game, actually, Yuji Naka moved to the US to found the Sega Technical Institute and worked with Sonic Team to make Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
4916000	4926000	But in Japan, a separate development team that was headed by Oshima Naoto, who was the creator of Sonic, worked on Sonic CD, and they were supposed to be the same game,
4926000	4932000	just a Sega CD version and a cartridge version, but this really turned into something different.
4932000	4939000	And for anime buffs out there, the opening animated sequence was done by Toei.
4939000	4948000	Now, as I said from the very, very beginning, it had two soundtracks.
4948000	4958000	There was the Japanese and European soundtrack, which is the same one, and it had Sonic You Can Do Anything, which is the name of it.
4958000	4962000	It was also the Toot Toot Sonic Warrior, which we don't mention in Play Company.
4962000	4974000	And Cosmic Eternity, Believe in Yourself. And the boss music also sampled the song Work That Sucker to Death by 70s artists Xavier, Pootsie Collins, and George Clinton.
4974000	4976000	So basically, Parliament.
4976000	4977000	Nice.
4977000	4992000	Yeah. So, now the US one was actually redone completely by Spencer Nelson, who did a bunch of Sega Saturn soundtracks.
4992000	4997000	And then there was that Sonic Boom song that was redone.
4997000	5004000	So yeah, I really think, I mean, I'm not saying that the American soundtrack was bad by any means.
5004000	5010000	It's not. It was really good. But in comparison to the Japanese soundtrack, there's no comparison.
5010000	5012000	The Japanese soundtrack was way amazing.
5012000	5021000	So there actually, as far as that Sonic You Can Do Anything and the Cosmic Eternity, Believe in Yourself,
5021000	5028000	the reason why we have an instrumental version is the lyrics belong to K.C. Rankin, who died in 2009.
5028000	5032000	So the rights haven't been released by the estate.
5032000	5039000	There is a 20th anniversary soundtrack that came out in Japan that actually has a version of Sonic Boom on it,
5039000	5042000	including a remastered Japanese track.
5042000	5052000	So as I said, there were other ports. We had a PC version in 1996, which was the debut Sonic title under Sega PC's brand.
5052000	5062000	It came out in Japan on August 9th, 1996, in North America on August 26th, 1996, and in Europe October 3rd, 1996.
5062000	5071000	And it has a full animated intro and ending sequence, not just that really clipped looking one that came on the Sega CD,
5071000	5078000	because it could handle the heavy animations like that, as we've all known for anyone of us who had ever owned a copy of Dragon's Lair.
5078000	5082000	Just saying, Dragon's Lair, not all that great.
5082000	5087000	It was also re-released with the Sonic Gems Collection on the GameCube and PS2 in 2005,
5087000	5094000	and it's the PC version with improved frame rate and action speed.
5094000	5098000	And it did have some emulation errors, though.
5098000	5107000	And the European version actually of that one used the US soundtrack, but had higher quality versions of it.
5107000	5114000	And then, as I said, we've got the Xbox Live Arcade version that was playable at PAX Prime 2011,
5114000	5119000	and we've got the versions on PSN, PC, iOS, Windows Phone coming out, and there's Android.
5119000	5126000	And then the port was actually re-developed by Scratch using this retro engine.
5126000	5129000	So that's why it's so nice and smooth.
5129000	5131000	And now we have it on Steam.
5131000	5136000	And it's excellent on Steam, and it's only $4 you owe it to yourself to buy this.
5136000	5138000	Commercial, commercial, commercial.
5138000	5141000	Okay, I'm running out of soundtrack songs here, so wrap up.
5141000	5143000	Okay, well, done.
5143000	5144000	Well, that was quick.
5144000	5145000	Alright, there it is.
5145000	5151000	Actually, just telling you, the Sonic CD story was what became the Sonic the Comic,
5151000	5156000	and the story was adapted into the Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog comic book.
5156000	5159000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic CD!
5159000	5162000	Confession, I've never played it.
5162000	5163000	I know.
5163000	5166000	There's a lot of Sonic games out there, and I never owned a Sega system,
5166000	5170000	so I had to kind of play them all at friends' houses, or in retrospect.
5170000	5174000	Rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob.
5174000	5176000	What do you want?
5176000	5178000	I want to watch you buy it.
5178000	5180000	I'm poor.
5180000	5181000	I'm poor!
5181000	5183000	Maybe later.
5183000	5186000	I'll tell you what, when I beat Uncharted and Modulation Racers, I'll buy it.
5186000	5187000	Good lord.
5187000	5189000	Alright, I've got to beat something.
5189000	5190000	I've got something you could beat.
5190000	5191000	Oh, shut up.
5191000	5195900	All right, we're gonna take a break and when we come back we got plenty more of Orange L'Antrido to come a new segment
5195900	5201600	Here on the show get excited some news about Street Fighter cross Tekken. I don't think you're gonna like I know Loki doesn't like it
5202560	5206840	Maybe a mailbag segment at views of the week, and I apologize in advance
5207740	5212660	Yes, we are somehow gonna bring up Justin Bieber and related to video games. I am so
5213260	5219580	So sorry, but you you really have to hear this story. Don't don't disconnect. There's a reason just trust me the Justin Bieber
5219580	5221020	singing
5221020	5226880	Singing a toothbrush is compatible with Xbox Live Arcade. It is not shush. Don't make stuff up all right
5227300	5230940	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange L'Antrido stay tuned
5237040	5241040	Welcome back everybody to Orange L'Antrido. We are live taping the
5241540	5244260	448th episode of our show on March 4th
5244260	5249620	2012 here at all games radio is where we're always live every Sunday night
5249620	5252860	We hope you will join us for a live show sometime and join us in our chat room
5252860	5256480	we do talk live with our chatters at chat dot orange lounge radio calm and
5257020	5262580	Sometimes we'll field questions from chat for example. We have somebody in chat right now. That's evil or e3 ville
5263380	5269500	E3 vl wants to know anyone know if the Vita trophies are separate from PlayStation 3 or is it all cumulative?
5269500	5276220	It's interesting because it looks like they are cumulative because when you look at your trophies on the vita you see everything
5276500	5280020	But when you look at them in the PlayStation 3 you don't see the vita games
5280020	5284300	I don't know if that's what today's maintenance was there to correct, but I I have to imagine
5284300	5286980	There's going to be a forthcoming patch. That's going to
5287580	5289860	Link the two to bet together a little better
5289860	5293900	But for right now you do see it all in the vita and they all pump into that same
5293900	5301020	Trophy level or whatever and percentage and all that which man after you go through those first few trophy levels it takes forever
5301300	5306340	To gain up levels and I look at those people that are I'm like level six or seven which maybe I shouldn't admit
5306340	5309460	I'm that low a level, but I look at some people online. They're like level 13
5309460	5313740	I'm like damn you play a lot of PlayStation alright, so I'm
5314260	5317620	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, but first I want to bring up a couple quick things
5318340	5323460	One I have to follow up to this interesting Twitter discussion that I caught wind of earlier this week
5323460	5330420	between a listener of ours at Orange Lounge radio and a guy at another podcast and a lot of you
5330420	5336420	I know are very familiar with the website cheapassgamer and the guy behind the website chibidi who um yeah
5336420	5339420	I'm I got to admit. I don't have time to listen to every podcast
5339420	5345500	I'm sorry, so I don't really listen to the show, but I've seen the website. It's a great concept great idea
5345500	5350420	I'm sure he's done very well for himself off of that. He's a fan of Saints Row 3
5350420	5355220	I know that and so I we're in good company. I think with that we were big fans of Saints Row 3 too
5355220	5359540	But I guess what I was gonna say actually I should get that on steam now that it's half price
5359540	5364060	I think that's the sale boy. You're like a walking commercial tonight young lady. I can't help it
5364060	5368540	I love steam you are a consumer whore so that console on your way to your house already
5368540	5373420	So so here's the reason why I bring it up because I guess something was said on the last show about
5373420	5380120	What's the oldest podcast and they were wondering if it's seven years it might be them. I think I didn't hear it again
5380120	5383420	I'm just picking up on what I got for Twitter, so if I miss appropriated that quote
5383420	5388900	I totally apologize in advance, but one of our listeners jumped in and actually tweeted him and said
5389580	5390540	actually
5390540	5392540	Orange launch radio has been doing this for ten years
5392660	5396380	And I just thought that was really awesome that one of our listeners kind of like jumped in there
5396780	5398780	Henderson man so big thank you to that
5398940	5404540	And you know that's why I'm always very careful about jumping it. You know dude made an honest mistake
5404540	5405980	It's no big deal whatever
5405980	5411900	But that's why I'm always very nervous about staking that claim of we are the longest running show on the internet because I'm always worried
5411900	5416180	Like what the hell else is out there that I don't know that it exists because like for real
5416180	5420300	I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys although. We have a great partnership with all games radio
5420300	5425660	We're here at all games calm. I had no fucking idea that there was ever this whole like game
5425660	5429540	I did not know what all games interactive was before we hooked up with the show
5429540	5433700	I did not know this whole pseudo stuff and everything that Scott Rubin had before g4
5433700	5436700	I didn't know any of that stuff before we joined forces with them
5436700	5441980	So that's why I'm always a little nervous like I think we're the longest-running live show about video games
5441980	5445780	But we're one of where we asked what was the protect one of the?
5446340	5452220	That's our little protection because we don't know what else really we're the most important stop it stop it all right
5452220	5455780	But it's all right. You just have to know that we are the official podcast of the planet Earth
5455900	5460060	That's right that claim we staked a long time ago, and I'm sorry buddy. It's ours
5460060	5462700	So yeah, I just you know you can lease it for a quarter um
5462700	5464220	um
5464220	5466060	Just to clear the air on a few things though
5466060	5470760	Just so we set the record straight the very first orange launch radio live show all about
5471020	5478460	DDR and music based games and community and you know talking shit at the restaurant after a long night of playing DDR was June 23rd
5478700	5481980	2002 at live through 65 where we used to have a station and
5482540	5486740	We released our first podcast January 3rd of 2005
5486740	5491500	It was a separate show at the time called the orange launch radio to go edition because for a while
5491500	5493940	We were here in studio for about four and a half hours
5493940	5499460	We would do our live three-hour music game community show and then we do our hey guys
5499460	5503220	It's only going to be 20 minutes show on other games
5503780	5506660	Bullshit that grew into an hour
5506660	5513460	I mean just the the talk about other games really took over and that is why in 2006 we merged the two shows and
5513700	5519120	Because you know the music game stuff was not you know we didn't have enough community things to talk about everything was getting very
5519120	5520360	very
5520360	5524720	Centralized with people playing at home and so forth so that all started
5524720	5526360	I think we married him in
5526360	5529400	2006 or so I think it was about a year of the to-go show and then we married him in
5529560	5532360	2006 I would like to think that this is their bastard stepchild
5533520	5535520	When we did that it was so much fun
5536000	5541360	Yes, it was so much fun, and then you shot yourself in the foot now SSG 100 Matt says yeah
5541360	5546600	But olr has to be the first live podcast to use Skype you use Skype when it was in beta form
5546600	5551360	I do think we do. Oh, I do think we have that claim. I really do
5551360	5553800	I don't think I cuz I was looking around the internet at that time
5553800	5557280	So I don't think anybody else was using Skype in a radio format to take calls at the time
5557280	5564000	But again, I'm nervous to stake that claim cuz I don't know what else is out there. Okay. We are the first proven
5566000	5567080	We are
5567080	5571120	Documented so if somebody else can provide their documentation that they did it before us
5571400	5575100	We'll happily relinquish the title but to be fair. I mean it's not a title
5575100	5582300	We really use you know relinquish more like share, but we we really are the the podcast of the universe all right you guys
5583360	5586640	Apparently what was supposed to be a humble thing turned into not so much
5587200	5589000	But look guys we don't
5589000	5595880	There's a reason we don't want to just like whore ourselves as we're the longest running video game podcast nanny nanny poo poo cuz you know
5596960	5598960	Everybody that's doing this pocket it
5599600	5604940	Having done it this long we can tell you firsthand. It's not that easy it takes a lot of dedication
5604940	5607960	So you know what seven years is a fucking great accomplishment?
5607960	5613680	So props to you know and in the service that the cheapass gamershow provides to the community is is amazing
5613680	5616000	And you know lots of people really rely on that website
5616000	5621860	You know to drive their game sales so props to their great idea that's taken off and has held for the past seven years
5622120	5625120	I know there's a lot of shows that have been running for a very long time
5625120	5626600	There's a lot of shows on this network
5626600	5631940	I know dead pixel lives got something like 600 episodes under their belt because they were daily for a while video game outsiders
5631940	5635880	I know it's been around for at least six years Bobby's been doing this for six years
5636880	5642440	Plus gamer tag radio has been around since podcasting was first around even though. They're not on the network
5642440	5647040	They're another show that comes to mind. I know there's a lot of folks that have been doing this a
5647660	5651440	Long time and I know many of you don't make any money off of it
5651440	5657320	So you know what props to all of you power to the indie podcasters you guys are on people make some money
5657440	5659840	Some people make a little bit. I bet she BD makes a little bit of money
5659840	5662080	I mean he did he did buy his way into the Saints Row the third
5662240	5666740	But you know you know what hey if I had that kind of money. I would have been sniped at what?
5667120	5671400	You know what he had a great idea. He did the website
5671800	5676840	Prop what what could be more American than that even though he lives in Japan my problem is my wife would not let me
5676840	5681840	Spend that kind of money on that if I hadn't met my wife. I would be in Saints Row the third
5681840	5689440	And then they have a mini a mini mat that is true, and I still am in Saints Row the third
5689440	5690360	Thanks to their awesome
5690360	5695020	I don't want to discuss this too much longer because this feels very self-serving, but let me address a couple of the comments in chat
5695440	5701040	Technus in chat says so you guys were around during the days when I still listen to Adam Curry's podcast to find more podcast to listen
5701040	5706840	To yes, and in fact we were nominated or we won the best gaming podcast for at the first podcast awards
5706960	5709080	Jamie went I shook his hand
5709080	5714320	And he she and right behind his hair and his butt actually his butt was by my head for a while
5714840	5716840	You're weird. I was sick
5717100	5721040	Okay, I'm at this thing sick as sick can be in
5721960	5729720	La so I'm even sicker because la aired you know disagrees with me. I turn around and I see this black clad ass
5730280	5736600	Look up see the the the shaggy. You know Bon Jovi haircut, and oh, it's Adam curry
5736600	5740040	I remember watching it on a TV um let's see
5741520	5747100	Randy says what were podcast called before podcast. I don't think they really had a name it was audio via RSS
5747160	5749400	But I've I know they tried to do
5749680	5755440	Blogcasts like for a long time major Nelson would not call a show a podcast or there was a zoom cast you know cuz you know
5755440	5757440	Xbox Microsoft didn't want to give in to the Apple thing
5758620	5760620	Let's see
5761400	5764880	SSJ 100 Matt says it's the humble indie podcast bundle segment
5764880	5769220	I love that idea they should do something like that the humble indie podcast bundle
5769960	5772400	Raised $30,000 for charity. I love that idea
5773840	5777520	And s J 100 Matt says I remember getting the show off podcast alley
5777520	5783360	You know podcast alley still exists go vote for orange lounge radio to go which is still listed in podcast alley
5783360	5785360	We need your votes Lord
5786000	5789320	All right, I didn't smell his farts acidic vampire
5789320	5794840	It shatters are weird all right, but I was I was so sick and after we got the award. I'm like I'm leaving
5794840	5798880	I feel so sick all right um look. I I want to say
5799800	5801680	quickly I
5801680	5804640	Just realized I left shows out of my how long video
5804640	5807920	I think if there is a show that's been around as long as we have its video game news radio
5808080	5810980	For real like I know they were on life just five for a while, too
5810980	5816160	I don't know when exactly they started so they may be able to make the claim, but they've also
5816160	5820640	They went non-video game for a while, and then kind of went back
5820640	5825580	But they're it's so funny because we couldn't have more different of makeup of shows
5825920	5828720	They're they're also on all games Network. You can hear them. I think they're Monday nights
5829560	5834120	But I respect them a lot. I know they work very hard at what they do and you know it takes a lot to
5835000	5838340	Focus on the show every week, and they they bring it so well
5838980	5842000	Speaking though of our ten of her Sri mm-hmm coming up
5842000	5846640	I would like to repeat what I said last week that I want people to email the mailbag
5847800	5854160	Under the title olr memories because I am working on something to commemorate our to our ten of her Sri
5855240	5860440	Alright, I want your favorite. Olr memory, and yes if you use really crappy grammar
5860440	5861960	I am going to edit it
5861960	5866960	And I'm going to send you a copy so that you know what I did so I can make sure that your intent was clear
5866960	5873160	Okay, I have because nothing that I put in print is gonna have bad grammar. I don't want to do too much of this reflection
5873160	5875780	This is the last comment on it, and then I'm done s to 100 Matt
5875780	5880000	So I was not sick from smelling his butt he did not say that s to 100 Matt says I
5880360	5885920	Remember when you guys went to the award show and where they didn't announce your nomination, and you guys yelled at them in the back
5886640	5892440	If there was speakers that day if there is any moment that better defines our legacy
5892440	5898640	I mean for real that is the moment that defined orange lounge radio, and I'll tell you exactly what it was
5898640	5902000	It was a life 365 best of life 365 awards
5902000	5906600	I want to say 2004 so when we went to that Airport hotel out by SFO
5906600	5911100	And we were sitting in the back had the big atrium and we were nominated for station of the year
5911100	5916680	Which was amazing, but they're reading the nominees for station of the year and the station of the year nominees are Rockland
5916680	5918640	USA and you know all these other stations
5918640	5923240	And then she starts to open the envelope and when you hear the audio recording of it, and I wish to God
5923240	5926480	I still had that clip you can hear in the background Loki going hey
5929280	5930440	Hey
5930440	5935400	And she goes oh, yeah, yeah, and and orange launch radio, and we're all sat there going well
5935400	5937480	We know we didn't fucking win drink. I
5938480	5940160	Was quite table
5940160	5945800	But that wasn't we had that was when they did like the bingo thing and I won speakers you did so it wasn't so we
5945800	5949360	May not have walked out of there with a plastic award, but we didn't walk out of there with speakers
5949360	5953560	You walked out of there speakers. I didn't get shit. I got some cool pictures out on the patio
5953560	5957400	That's what I got we got a bunch of sampler CDs all right. Let's move on
5957400	5960160	I have one other topic. I want to talk about before rapid-fire news is a game
5960160	5962160	I left out of my gaming week, but it's worth mentioning
5963280	5967480	iPhone game believe it or not and I think it's a pretty damn good iPhone game
5967480	5974000	It's 99 cents right now on the marketplace, which is a really good deal for the Midway arcade classics collection, and yes
5974000	5977320	It's another one of those retro game collections on the iPhone, and I've got to say though
5977320	5980440	They do a pretty damn good job of it especially for 99 cents
5980440	5983800	It does a little bit of the you know hey
5983800	5988120	Do you want to play gauntlet and gauntlet 2 well then you pay 99 cents for this pack?
5988520	5994940	But actually you can also unlock those machines if you play the others for a god-awful long time
5995040	5999920	You save up tickets and you can unlock the cabinets that way or you just pay 99 cents to unlock them right away
5999960	6001880	Which is kind of interesting they did it that way?
6001880	6007480	but what I really thought was interesting about it is that there's not just the classic arcade games in it, but there's I
6008120	6010120	air hockey and
6010680	6012240	ski ball and
6012240	6019280	The basketball little games you find in an arcade like they really went kind of a step beyond in making it that whole arcade
6019440	6024620	Experience now don't get too excited. It's an ios game, and I still cannot stand
6025240	6028000	Ios controls like trying to emulate the old-school arcade games
6028000	6033600	But some of them that have the limited mobility work pretty well like in joust you could only go left or right
6033600	6037980	That's pretty hard to screw up with the touch controls, so it controls all right spy hunter
6037980	6039560	They do this weird thing with the tilt controls
6039560	6044860	I'm not sure if I'm a fan, but you know it is what it is 99 cents, but I was thinking
6045440	6051160	My god this collection would be great on a system that has tangible controls like oh
6051160	6054200	I don't know the 3ds the vita
6054200	6060100	But I'm thinking with this title ever come out for just 99 cents on the vita. No hell. No I
6060680	6062040	Mean what's up with that?
6062040	6068160	Why is it the games are only bargain cheap on ios is this really competition because they that?
6068280	6072320	That they allow them to price their games the way they they are
6073000	6075120	These other platforms have minimums, okay?
6075120	6080960	You can't price your game lower than such and because of that that's why I don't get a lot of 99
6080960	6086920	Well, that's why I don't get any 99 cent games on these marketplaces if it was more open and allowed them to do that kind
6086920	6088560	Of thing then yeah, you would have a lot more of those
6088560	6093600	I still even think for like $4.99 on the 3ds shop this would be a hell of a download
6093980	6097120	With all the stuff that it includes, but I just I don't see it happening
6097120	6101620	And it's so odd like this game would be so much better with the tangible controls
6101620	6106600	But like they'll probably put it on a cartridge for $19.99 if they even if they even do that
6106600	6111500	You know I don't know they'll say the 3d costs money. It's old arcade games. I don't know again
6111500	6116160	I'm hypothesizing, but I just I really wish when I play some of these really good ios games
6116160	6117460	I'm always like damn it
6117460	6121980	Why can't this be on the vita or the vita would be amazing really with that crisp screen?
6121980	6123660	And it's already kind of the oh man
6123660	6128300	It would look great some of those games, but I'm not going to get I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it
6128300	6129300	Ain't going to happen
6129300	6135500	But I just imagine imagine I could tilt my vita sideways and use the analog stick to control spy hunter
6135500	6136860	It would be great
6136860	6140020	Yeah, but I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it's not going to happen
6141740	6145420	I'm sorry. I was distracted by everyone telling me that capcom should hire me
6147700	6149860	Way to derail all right I
6150700	6156260	Had years of derailment. I have I have a promise though if capcom hires me
6156260	6163280	I will make manuals that are available for print and PDF web friendly PDF. They have working links
6163280	6168800	Just for Bobby and it'll be spelled right it will be spelled right all right there you go all right
6168800	6175080	Let's talk about some rapid-fire news. I've babbled long enough about various side topics, so let's get to some rapid-fire news all right
6175080	6177480	Let's uh let's talk a little bit about
6179120	6183680	Ridge Racer Ridge Racer a game that was supposed to be launching with the vita
6184400	6188200	Kind of didn't it got delayed a little bit, and I had hoped hey
6188200	6195400	Maybe they'll put out a full game instead of three cars and five track or five cars of three tracks
6196960	6204720	Not so much anyways Ridge Racer is coming to the vita March 19th. There will be some DLC free DLC included with
6205280	6208200	I guess if you pot or purchase the initial
6208360	6213620	This is great the initial retail copies will include the Ridge Racer gold pass
6213620	6219820	which allows you to get five additional cars and three bonus tracks and two new songs and
6219900	6222500	an extended remix of an existing song
6223700	6225700	and
6226140	6233060	Apparently also, I guess you can purchase the game on the PlayStation Network store for you know the 10% cheaper
6233700	6238340	$24.99 as well, and it also includes the gold pass stuff, then I guess
6238940	6240180	if
6240180	6247060	You purchase before April 30th an additional silver pass DLC pack will be available as well
6247060	6251460	They haven't announced the price for yet also aside from DLC
6251460	6258220	they're gonna have I guess a system update which include or includes better frame rate better graphics and
6259860	6261860	You know that's about it, but I
6263020	6267220	Come on really really your free DLC is
6267220	6272900	Three more or five more cars. You're literally doubling the cars and tracks in the game and
6273500	6277540	You were and that would be a pretty awesome deal in any air racing game
6278060	6281300	Ten cars and six tracks. I mean come on
6281860	6288580	I remember back with Ridge Racer 4 where it was fucking like 200 cars in the goddamn game and tracks
6288580	6294020	I don't even know I mean a lot of them were just deep you know deviations of one another, but I mean come on
6294020	6301420	That few tracks for if you were putting the game out for free all right fine. You know that's fine
6301420	6305140	That's a good starter pack, and I'll buy DLC for it and get some additional cars, but
6306020	6307100	$30
6307100	6312820	It's ridiculous, and I'm not impressed with Namco's approach to this stuff, and it's again. It's the whole
6313540	6318620	IOS it's taking the IOS mentality now and putting it on the Vita, and it's just weird I
6318620	6324280	Don't I hope people educate themselves before that I mean you got to be a big fucking Ridge Racer fan to want to buy this
6324280	6332220	Well, here's something to educate yourselves on just wait for the price to drop because if it's something like this people are gonna bring
6332220	6332900	in new copies
6332900	6336860	And they're not gonna sell and they're gonna be sitting on shelves and it'll drop in price
6336860	6341100	And then you get that DLC on top of it comment from Derek H in our chat room
6341100	6343540	So they're admitting the graphics are crapped in the first version
6343540	6349140	And that is kind of a weird thing for them to say this yeah fans that they're crisper graphics
6350220	6353420	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things. They should have kept a secret until it comes out. You know
6354060	6359060	Yeah, well, maybe it's some depth of field adjustments or something like that, but
6359980	6362640	Ahamkara in our chat room says Ridge failure
6363660	6369740	It might I I can't say that until I've played the game, but let's just say I'm shaking my add magic eight ball
6369740	6374780	This is outlook. Not good. Let's just put this way the reviews for the Japanese word have been too great
6374780	6377020	I think a lot of it's because there's
6377540	6380020	You know three tracks and five cars
6380940	6382940	three tracks and five cars
6383340	6385880	Seriously, yeah, it's unfortunate now
6386140	6391820	Here's where I would give them a pass on those cars and stuff if they were tweakable like you can tweak all the different
6392020	6396340	You know aspects to it cuz a lot of those cars are just like it's been slightly faster. This was
6396340	6401820	It's slightly better at turning or whatever so they're not you don't really need all of them, but
6403140	6409540	You know I don't think that's the case in this. I think it's just like hey. We're just gonna sell a bunch of DLC cha-ching
6410980	6412620	That's
6412620	6417780	Not gonna happen. Oh and of course are they gonna advertise to their fans that you know this game is gonna
6417780	6423180	Be that gimp of course not it's up for the blogs to let people know about that all right anyways enough of that
6423180	6425260	So let's talk a little bit about a rumored
6425260	6430020	a sequel to a franchise army of four has apparently been outed by
6430780	6432780	a
6433820	6436140	Twitter post actually apparently
6437500	6440700	There is a guy who was I believe
6441420	6446320	One of the actors on Stargate a lot or Stargate Atlantis John Shepard
6448380	6452740	He or Joe Flanagan he plays a guy named John Shepard on Stargate Atlantis and
6452740	6457500	apparently he's been asked to do some I guess voice work on the
6458140	6464940	Well, this is a o4 video game for our electric Tronic Arts. Well. It's gonna be army of four. I mean, that's
6465740	6468620	It only makes sense that that's what it's gonna be so
6469820	6472120	Kind of neat. It's maybe something we'll see
6472740	6474740	announced at e3 and
6475380	6482220	Last but not least there's there was tons and tons and tons of leaks before finally it being officially announced Assassin's Creed 3
6482220	6484220	will be coming to
6484620	6491060	Consoles and PC this October on the 30th the new game is gonna take place during the American Revolution
6491900	6499420	you're gonna play a guy who looks to be Native American and of course having tomahawks and all sorts of cool stuff and
6500380	6501900	I
6501900	6505260	Guess there's gonna be some more info coming in the new game informer
6505900	6508580	It's the April cover April cover game
6508580	6513900	But uh definitely a big franchise. Yeah, I was hearing a lot of rumblings about that
6513900	6519660	Um seems like some of the Assassin's Creed fans aren't really I mean, I don't that's not like uncharted. It's a series
6519660	6521540	I haven't really had time to play
6521540	6526340	But about five years after the first game. I'll finally get around to it. It seems like a lot of fans
6526340	6530980	I know on Facebook are kind of cautious about the direction this game is taking I mean some people are like yeah
6530980	6535900	I knew it would be like a Revolutionary War type of game and some are like I'm not sure how I feel about this direction
6535900	6537820	So
6537820	6541660	We'll see. All right. We'll see I guess at the end of the day. How good is the game?
6541660	6546940	That's the important thing, right? Yep. He could be in space as long as the game that's in screen is
6549460	6551460	That's spoiler spoiler
6551460	6558340	Assassin's in for face. All right, some other quick news for you guys here connect enabled shopping carts
6560060	6565700	Okay, so like apparently there's this whole Microsoft thing where there's a prototype of a shopping cart
6565700	6570080	That has connect in it. It's a monitor a motor and a Kinect sensor
6570500	6574100	Apparently the cart can see your membership card. It will pull up your shopping list
6574100	6580240	It will scan objects as you place them in the cart and I guess the cart will actually follow you around the store
6580860	6585100	So like while you're walking it will follow you. This is fucking sky. I have to go to the bathroom
6585100	6594140	Not gonna not get to fit in the stall stop bringing it to me damn it
6598180	6603740	The old homeless ladies just watching it walk right out of the store with them. I can't wait to like
6604260	6606260	Alright ready run away
6608100	6613020	Hunter be hunted. I guess there's even a video on it, but it's I can't watch it. It's gonna be too hilarious
6613020	6620540	I think they mentioned Whole Foods, which that does seem to be that is a very I like to smell my own farts kind of thing
6622700	6629200	My farts are organic and smell what well right right along those lines actually
6629660	6632780	Apparently in the video it talks about the the spokesperson
6633020	6638660	Puts the wrong type of spaghetti in the cart and the cart warrants him. You're trying to go gluten-free
6638660	6642100	Remember your pansy
6646580	6652460	You know I do have friends who have celiac disease yeah, and it's a serious
6652460	6656060	I know I know okay, but I don't think I gotta be real some people do it to be trendy
6656060	6662100	I think yeah to be honest a guy that's walking around with a connect and able shopping carts probably doing to be trendy
6663740	6668020	It will not bag your groceries however, but there you go. I actually do remember today
6668020	6672900	I will say this I will remember a day when they did have the shopping carts used to have these at Rayleigh's Bel Air some time
6672900	6673100	ago
6673100	6674140	They had the little um
6674140	6680380	Little screens on them that as you're walking through the store the screen would know what aisle you're in and it would like update to
6680380	6682260	Show you the specials that were in the aisle
6682260	6685380	And you could actually look up items like it was kind of ahead of its time cool
6685380	6691700	Doesn't look ridiculous like having a Kinect camera strapped to a shopping cart where it's following you around the store. Oh come on
6691700	6698780	This is that's the setup for like a really bad 3d horror movie like which by the way piranha 3dd
6698780	6703160	Oh my fucking god. That looks amazing, but this could be like a great
6703780	6709240	Shopping cart 3d horror movie like the day the shopping carts took over with Christopher Lloyd
6709240	6712460	And all I gotta say is hobos are gonna. Go high-tech now
6714180	6716740	It's like the homeless it's like fuck I got Kinect
6716740	6723940	And a TV all right Kid Icarus uprising of course a big game coming out on the 3ds soon your copy will come with six
6723940	6729780	AR cards, but here's the thing there's actually gonna be hundreds of AR cards available
6729780	6736620	There will be events where you can kind of trade and get new cards and this whole thing so an interesting kind of real-life
6736900	6738400	card Pokemon
6738400	6742140	Yu-Gi-Oh magic type of I have judgment
6742140	6746420	Oh, I'm sorry what I don't know
6746420	6750260	I mean, let's see what it adds to the game or if it's just something stupid
6750580	6756580	But apparently the cards can oh god the cards can face each other and the AR figures will battle
6757140	6764820	Where the fuck did I hear this before where did we razz this a million times so familiar the cards?
6765300	6769820	Come to life, and they do the battle and they cameras
6769820	6775660	That you can't just do with the cards on the table. I'm sorry. I'm just judging this right now with my eyes
6777180	6780740	I'm judging it right now. I'm gonna keep my eye on this
6780740	6784980	I think well there is actually a little Cyclops looking thing if you need an extra eye
6787100	6789240	But it's not brown it's not brown that's red
6790900	6792900	It's for the record
6793180	6796780	SSJ 100 Matt says he's still waiting for supermarket sweep the game for you know
6796780	6801420	I have I have a bad feeling that that Kid Icarus game is just gonna tank
6802780	6804780	Gonna tank so bad
6805100	6811060	Because you know why cuz no one gives a damn about Kid Icarus you shut your mouth now
6811060	6816660	Hey, hey, you know I know that the hardcore gamer cares about Kid Icarus, but that's not who they're targeting
6816660	6820380	I mean Kid Icarus is basically their dress for a new generation
6820940	6823260	You know it's it's fucking oh
6824020	6826020	I don't know
6826020	6829100	It's a hardcore shmup game and no one's gonna. Give a damn
6829100	6832980	Did could you imagine the Kid Icarus bullet hell game since we now know their?
6833220	6837280	Similarities would you care to make a wager on if Kid Icarus will sell a million copies no
6837280	6839280	I do not care to wager that
6839860	6842740	Damn, I try because that doesn't have any additional peripherals
6842740	6847180	And I'm not gonna bet whether the cards are gonna sell million copies because there's no way to track that so
6848380	6850380	I'm still buying it
6850380	6854060	I got it look. There's a little bit of a I mean and here's the thing too
6854060	6858060	Why would I go buy cards when I can simply?
6858700	6862860	Download the images of guards and print them out for free so fuck you
6862860	6868540	I ain't buying no fucking cards for your stupid game and also not your game because
6869100	6871660	Rare one in a glass case of the Nintendo World Store
6871660	6876820	And it's the only place where you can get the eggplant wizard if only we had a camera with us
6876820	6881140	If only some sort of device that I was carrying had a camera on it
6881140	6885940	Well, maybe a phone or an mp3 player or perhaps or my station
6885940	6892140	But perhaps a game console a portable game console only one of those had a camera on it, but goddamn it
6892140	6898620	I live in an age where cameras are only available in camera form and not in any other peripheral whatsoever
6898620	6900620	I see DDR dollar bill liked my idea
6901140	6903500	All right, I gotta read this comment
6903500	6913220	It's on the last story, but it's too good act deaf in our chat room says chopping cart grocery shopping will never be the same as
6914900	6918980	Have you seen the piranha 3dd trailer hey come on it's piranha
6919460	6924700	3 double D. Have you have you seen it? I have seen it. Okay. I'm just dark soccer

6935020	6937380	I have ever seen in my entire life, and it is worth derailing
6937380	6939980	It is the only movie. I give a crap about is the Avengers
6940820	6946020	Because Hawkeye here. It is 3dd official truck. I movie looks fucking amazing and yet oh
6947140	6950260	They should make a video game out of it there. I've tied it back to the show
6950260	6959180	In the world's wildest water park the party a water card hotter water
6959180	6962740	You did not replace our old life cards with strippers water-certified strippers
6964740	6970820	But the guests have never been hungrier

7024100	7026540	To put your 3d glasses back on

7032300	7034980	Secondly that is what natural selection is all about
7035940	7037940	It's double the okay. That's great

7070980	7075460	I don't even like gory movies, and I'll see that just cuz it looks so horribly stupid
7075460	7081740	Oh bring me money. I'm sorry you Christopher Lloyd can't even redeem that to me, so
7082740	7084740	Orange launch radio road trip
7085740	7090860	Avengers Hawkeye, I hope that opens up against Avengers. I'll camp out 48 hours in advance for that
7092620	7094880	I'm not hating on Avengers. I swear just you know
7095620	7100960	Alright, it's just got a root. You got a root for the underdog. I mean seriously under fish
7100960	7105920	Ving Rhames, I mean I remember when Rose McGowan had the shotgun leg, but Ving Rhames
7105920	7110480	I think is a much sexier, babe with that shotgun leg. I'm just saying get me my legs
7112280	7115480	All right back to rapid-fire news
7119320	7122620	Bioshock infinite has a release date. Hey, it's October 16th
7123440	7126040	In North America and 19th internationally
7126040	7130640	I know a lot of you Bioshock fans are looking forward to Bioshock infinite not to hate on Bioshock, too
7130640	7135200	It was a good game in its own merits, but this is in some ways kind of the the true sequel to Bioshock
7135200	7140080	It's just kind of a different little spin-off there games coming out on 360 PC and ps3
7140720	7144800	The ps3 will have move support and come with the original Bioshock included
7144800	7150000	You know just in case you miss assuming that they stick to the word unlike they did with some of the other games
7150000	7155500	We'll see we'll see all right, so there you go. That's what I've got for rapid-fire news. How about you Darcyra?
7155500	7160260	Um let's see we have a rumor that I've mentioned before
7160620	7168660	Dark Stalkers 4 may potentially be happening and the theory is that Yoshinori Ono is behind it so I
7170420	7173780	Don't think they've actually really had anything confirmed for it yet
7173980	7180020	but then again the original Dark Stalkers was re-released and they like to re-release original versions right before there's gonna be a new one so
7180020	7181260	who knows and
7181260	7186620	There was an ESRB rating that's gonna say a re-release of Dark Stalkers 3 is gonna come out
7187100	7194000	Again, who knows it could be they could just be teasing us. They could be trolling like that like that half-life shirt trolling us
7195120	7202880	Also, Jet Set Radio is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade PSN and PC this summer and Sega is gonna have a graffiti contest
7203500	7204860	so
7204860	7208920	They didn't really say if you're gonna be able to import your own graffiti images
7208920	7216980	but they're having a contest that is available at sega.com slash JSR contest where you can put in your
7216980	7222820	Designs and last but never least a street fighter and they're doing a street fighter Monopoly game the end
7224540	7227400	Are the fighters the pieces or the properties I
7228580	7234700	Would hope that they're the pieces and that like you fight for India or Japan or USA
7234700	7239540	I mean, I guess I shouldn't say properties cuz you don't really buy and sell people but maybe like by your team
7239540	7244260	You know, you're you're contracting them to join your super fighting squad or whatever
7245580	7247580	Mmm, Kylie Minogue's cami
7248180	7251140	That would be hot. I'm sorry. She didn't make a good cami
7252380	7258420	Every time I see cami her voice is Kylie Minogue. Sorry right after covert action
7258420	7261820	It wasn't that bad will be Street Fighter 2 the movie kind of underrated
7261820	7265960	You know, Dan went bought that on blu-ray. Just I got it for Alan
7266780	7270980	First gift I ever bought, you know, I saw that twice in the theater. Did you really I did
7271460	7275700	Was it the cheapo enough? My dad took me to see it because I was only like
7276200	7279780	11 or 12 when it came out. I saw it the second time at the cheapo theaters. All right
7281280	7286220	Hey new segment on olr how exciting you ready for a new segment? I'm gonna try something new here
7286220	7289740	It's a kind of a segment ripped off a hoard house a little bit. It's worked well over there
7289740	7292860	So we're bringing it over here. It's a new segment called the frugal question of the week
7300100	7303460	Little song to sashay to as we go to Facebook
7304060	7308780	Plus favorite songs to play and beat mania Google thought it made a good theme music here
7308780	7314040	So frugal you put Facebook and Google together you get frugal. Here's our frugal question of the week a portmanteau
7314040	7319600	What that's what a combination of two words is called a portmanteau. Oh, okay frugal portmanteau
7319600	7321160	It sounds like a wine. All right
7321160	7326000	Our Facebook and Google Plus question of the week we post these the day of the show and get your questions
7326380	7333520	Facebook comm slash orange lounge radio or Google Plus search for orange lounge radio because there's no custom URLs on Google Plus yet
7333520	7339040	We'll post the question in both places and look for your answers or read some of our favorites on the show and talk about this
7339040	7340200	topic
7340200	7342400	Here's our very first frugal question of the week
7342400	7347920	There's a lot of massive hype behind Mass Effect 3 coming out this week
7347920	7354620	Are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs namely the method of storytelling and use of conversation trees in their games?
7354840	7356420	Why or why not?
7356420	7362240	Loki dark soccer want to take a stab at this really listeners reap massive hype behind Mass Effect 3
7362240	7368720	Okay, are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs the way they do storytelling and how they use conversation trees their game honest
7368720	7375520	I haven't I haven't played many of them. Um, I played yeah played some of Dragon Age Dragon Age. Uh, too
7375520	7381240	I thought it was interesting for leading to you know a different game experience each time
7382080	7384080	but really
7385880	7390640	You know, I can't say I dislike it I really can't say I dislike it it's just different
7391400	7393320	Okay, Loki
7393320	7399560	Honestly, I kind of stopped playing Mass Effect after well. I didn't even really get very far in the first game
7399560	7400960	Just wasn't for me
7400960	7404640	Not that the whole dialogue trees or anything work and you know
7404640	7409460	I wasn't against that because you know, I like adventure games and they had dialogue trees. So why wouldn't I?
7410640	7412640	but I
7412640	7418520	Don't know. It's just I mean the style is fine. I don't think that's really anything holding me back. I'm playing just time
7418520	7423960	Yeah for me. Those games are huge time sinks. So when you're trying to juggle MMOs and other games
7423960	7426220	It's it's it's a big investment to get into those games
7426520	7428360	I did play a little bit of Dragon Age
7428360	7432440	Especially I will say this swot or was really one that I invest a lot of time in and I gotta say
7432800	7439200	The whole conversation tree aspect of the game kept me engaged in a way that Wow doesn't like I'm not I love Wow
7439200	7441760	But I'm not really a morphine and it's not that it's a bad story
7441760	7445720	It's just one that I tend to skip but in swot or I was really into it
7445720	7450760	Like I would I would sit there and listen to all the dialogue and then I choose my options carefully and me
7450760	7455000	I was always going for the dark side because I'm bad, you know, and I was really into it
7455000	7457000	Yeah, I thought it really kind of
7457360	7461800	Enriched the game on a different level. Unfortunately the game itself got a little stale for me
7462000	7468720	But I thought that the way the story was told was great and I can see why people get so into like Mass Effect and stuff
7468720	7473760	It's it's a series. I've got to get into at some point, but I just you know again a huge time scene
7473760	7476280	God, I make it sound like I play nothing. I've like missed all these big game
7476280	7478280	I swear I play a lot of the big games. It's just
7478760	7482060	somehow I missed all the ones I see I I kind of like
7482760	7487460	how the you have set lore for a while, even though they've been trying to retcon it, but I
7489640	7493760	Don't I don't know I'm always like what I want a story
7493760	7500200	I mean if I want a game that's gonna give me the option then I will play it specifically for that
7500200	7505440	But for the most part I I like it when they've given me a story and playing it is like reading a book
7506000	7508000	All right. Let's read some of the answers from our
7508440	7513000	Facebook and Google or a foogle because it is to show where every gamer has a voice. We'll start with zither
7513000	7516640	I like Mass Effect so far since I bought both games on Steam
7516640	7519200	But I'm not entirely sure if I really like BioWare's RPGs
7519280	7525880	The general consensus seems to be that after EA bought them out their RPGs began to suck in both gameplay and story aspects
7525880	7530760	As much as I love the environment and gameplay in the first Mass Effect a game knowing that the third game
7530760	7537080	Which I may never play because of origin may be terrible story wise is pushing me towards the not sure if like side
7538080	7540960	At origin enhancement really turning people off
7540960	7545920	I'd be curious for zither why he wouldn't just pick it up on a console then where he doesn't have to worry about origin
7545920	7552660	But maybe the quality thing is is well, yeah with consoles. You still have to do the EA server thing
7552660	7559660	That's true in fact with SSX. I just download the demo for they wanted me to sign up for that and do the server thing
7559660	7561660	I'm like nah play offline
7561700	7567180	All right, I've had enough of the theme music. I think we should just run it once all right, uh Derek H
7568060	7571700	Responds, I'm not because one if I'm trying to save the universe
7571700	7578460	Why can I only take two people with me when I have a ship full of Marines and two it's become a glorified virtual girlfriend
7578660	7581300	Simulation and three I just don't like RPGs
7581300	7582740	interesting
7582740	7585620	That Derek kind of brings up that the whole lovemaking
7585820	7590480	Scenes have kind of taken over what the rest of the game is really supposed to be about cuz it does seem like whenever one
7590480	7592900	Of these games come out. It's all about who can you fuck?
7594460	7599660	Now it's male male and it is male male and apparently the scene is only so so and it's really boring
7599660	7602560	Yeah, and there's some pretty hot chick stuff
7603660	7609260	You know, but if you want the boobies, it's all about the witcher to okay. I'll be out in April
7609260	7615260	That's some that's got some hardcore stuff in there and Derek does bring up an interesting point where you know for being such an open-ended
7615260	7617300	Game, it's not that open-ended
7617300	7621940	I think that's kind of what I read in the between the lines on the first bullet point so interesting thoughts there
7622380	7627200	Let's see going to Thomas B. Bioware games are pretty good. Especially the Mass Effect series
7627200	7631060	I like that there generally are at least three paths to take in conversation
7631340	7638340	Paragon renegade and paragade lots of RPGs are so linear that you may as well have the dialogues automatic or just show cutscenes between the
7638340	7639940	fighting
7639940	7644380	Robert w says Mass Effect 1 was amazing Dragon Age was great as well
7644380	7646140	Then the sequels to both were hugely
7646140	7652140	Disappointing to me when it seemed that they had an identity crisis when it tried to appeal to everyone and forgot what the originals were
7652140	7655820	You know, I've heard that a lot especially about Dragon Age 2 except from Dark Sakura
7656500	7660620	Why keep in mind I didn't play the first one. Okay, you should go back
7660620	7662460	See I heard Mass Effect 2 would be more
7662460	7668940	So me where I thought the first game is a little slow and cumbersome. Where is the second one's more? I guess like a shooter
7669300	7674180	All right. Let me read two more here. Um, so well, apparently this third one is like pick your combination
7674180	7680360	Do you want more story you want more shooter? That's what it sounds really interesting about the third. I will takes shooting and boobies
7681540	7686000	You don't want to shoot the boobies. No, no, no, she's she's not combined together
7686000	7692200	Although topless six shooting bots. I'd be fine with that. Why isn't that a game topless chick shooting?
7693200	7698380	Or is it only time I'm trying to think if I'm trying to think if that is a game. All right, look
7699040	7700840	two more answers here
7700840	7702840	still in
7703120	7707780	Resplies, I like the way that Bioware tells the stories and how I can interact with NPCs
7707780	7713600	I've played Dragon Age and felt really connected to my character and her companions because of that way of conversation
7713600	7717220	I skipped the Mass Effect series because I thought that sci-fi games wouldn't be for me
7717440	7721040	However, after playing swo tour and actually really loving the relationships
7721040	7724440	I can get with my companions and being dragged into my character's story
7724440	7730400	I actually am tempted to pick up Mass Effect 1 & 2 secondhand for my PlayStation 3 and start playing the series
7730400	7732920	Is it bad that I'm already pondering who to romance?
7734200	7741560	Not at all and lastly Shane from courthouse funny enough for applies and says for the most part at least for me
7741560	7748520	Bioware creates the most immersive RPGs on the market if you care about your character because the argument could be made that like Bethesda
7748640	7752480	Creates the most immersive RPGs minus things to do with your characters development
7752480	7756720	They faltered a bit on Dragon Age 2 by taking away a lot to do with the development of your character
7756720	7760020	And thought it'd be cool to add a terrible story compared to Dragon Age origins
7760080	7765220	But in terms of storytelling and use of conversation trees Mass Effect has been spot-on for two games
7765220	7768580	I'm looking forward to Tuesday's release of Mass Effect 3 hardcore
7768580	7774540	Because of the love they put into developing their characters in world definitely not because of the way the game plays
7775020	7780760	Sounds to me like Shane might be more in it for the story mode as opposed to the boobies and gun mode. So there you go
7782340	7785020	That's our frugal question of the week. Thanks you guys for applying
7785020	7789880	We'll catch you next Sunday with our next frugal question of the week. Meanwhile, let's get back with some more news Loki
7790380	7792380	Yes, let's talk a little bit about
7793060	7797180	Capcom and about a game being released this week
7797180	7799540	Street Fighter X Tekken
7800420	7804820	Of course, there's been a lot of discussion with DLC including, you know
7804820	7809580	first off that the PlayStation versions are gonna have some exclusive characters with
7810260	7812260	crappy box art Mega Man and
7812820	7819140	Pac Man and then on top of that the Vita is supposed to be getting 12 characters that are exclusive to it
7820540	7822700	with those characters being
7822700	7829100	Alina, Guy, Cody, Sakura, Dudley, Blanca, and I guess
7830500	7834540	Alisa, Christy, Jack, Brian, Lars, and Ley
7836220	7838220	Those are all I guess
7839620	7841620	Supposed to be in the Vita version in
7842460	7844460	the fall
7844500	7846300	however
7846300	7848300	apparently
7848300	7853540	Apparently that they're already available on the disc as DLC
7853860	7858140	They're already on the disc. I'm actually the Pac Man and
7858700	7863660	Bad box art Mega Man is that's gonna be released on the 13th, I believe
7864820	7866820	or at least next week and
7868660	7872860	Those are gonna be free DLC if you have the ps3 version
7872860	7880380	Funny enough though those are also on the Xbox 360 disc as some people already have those discs and have
7880580	7884700	dug through and actually dumped some of the videos the intro and
7885220	7890740	Ending videos from those characters, and they're on both discs, so it comes down to
7892620	7896780	You know what the hell it's all paid unlock content all this shit was done way before
7897380	7902220	You release the game and usually in games like this it would be like unlock characters
7902220	7904620	You play well, and you get some new you know characters
7904700	7910580	But because we're in a day and age where it's fun to charge money for a shit that would normally be free
7911220	7915820	Then that's what they did. It's on the actual disc and here's the best part about it, too
7915820	7919900	There's actually the Xbox 360 version I believe
7921340	7927820	There's a way to glitch out the game to actually play as one of the unlocked characters or play as Alina
7927820	7932340	I guess or not really Alina, but as
7933940	7938100	It's a trick to load Alina's character data instead of poisons, so
7938620	7940620	Wait the one from Street Fighter 3
7940820	7947580	Yes, I loved her yes, so there's a way to unlock. I guess her player data, so you can play with all of her moves as
7948460	7949940	poison
7949940	7953700	But you know through a glitch in the game, so
7953700	7959300	That's kind of weird that all these characters that they claim were your PlayStation exclusive of course
7960180	7964380	Come on folks. I mean are you that surprised that these are gonna be on both systems
7964380	7969780	You look at Namco and look what they do Soulcalibur 4 and fucking the Yoda and Darth Vader
7969780	7975620	You knew that those were gonna be downloadable on the other systems because they can make a buck off of it
7975620	7979020	So why not, but I just have a problem with them
7979020	7984420	Just doing this as far as putting the content on the disk already because it doesn't to me
7984420	7989180	And this is one of the things before it. It's just the perception of it
7989180	7992320	It doesn't seem like it's something that was added later on
7993060	7998440	But if it's something on the disk that you're under you're unlocking people feel entitled because they own the disk well
7998440	8003500	They think they own the disk you're really licensing the disk, but fuck that you own the disk okay, and
8004540	8006540	You have the data on the disk already
8006540	8010980	Why aren't you being you know? Why is it being locked out?
8010980	8016020	It would be like if you bought a house, and there's a room. That's locked that you have to pay money to get the key to
8016980	8021180	Yeah, it's your house. You own it, but you can't access that room because too bad
8021180	8027340	It's locked it's the classic example of pay to unlock content which Namco especially has been guilty of a lot in the past now
8027340	8031500	I realize the Street Fighter cross Tekken is the Capcom version of the game, but they've they've done some of this too
8031500	8038860	Yeah, so well. Yes. It's disappointing. It really is. I mean. It's it's disappointing first off that it doesn't really
8039660	8043460	First off the extra 12 characters that they're talking about once. I found out who they were I was like yeah
8044260	8049740	The Vita version doesn't seem that great, but it's something that you know that well. They're not really exclusive
8049740	8051900	It's just gonna be available to everybody eventually for a price
8052380	8057520	So who knows and here's the even sadder part if you really want to look at it that way you know
8057980	8060220	You know this is gonna be up on you know
8060220	8066300	The scene sites and stuff like that right they hack keys for games like easy
8066940	8070580	This is all those characters are gonna be unlocked on the pirated copies
8071180	8074780	The first week I this just confirms for me
8074780	8078660	I'm not gonna buy the game when it comes out because you know I was
8079300	8081660	Considering getting it even though I knew this in the back of my mind
8081660	8085860	There'll be a year edition best of the year edition or whatever inevitably
8085860	8089460	And I think now that the discs are already practically made that way
8089460	8094980	There's for sure gonna be a year-end edition at the end of the year once all these characters are released
8095100	8101180	That will include everything it'll be the same disc with the in there exactly right because that's how they don't have to press it
8101180	8103180	Twice and they can reuse the old copies
8103180	8107300	But I think I think that's exactly the grand scheme of what's going on here, and it just confirms for me
8107300	8109300	you know what Rob you need to wait and
8109420	8110700	I
8110700	8116940	Wonder if there's gonna be other people that are where I'm at that'll send a clear message when we don't buy this game and I
8116940	8123180	Understand that you know the developers will come out and they will say well listen. We plan to have DLC I
8123900	8128520	Have a problem when they always say they plan to have DLC. Yeah, I you know I understand like Bethesda
8128520	8133200	We plan to have expansions to Skyrim. Yeah, okay that makes sense that you're gonna plan to have it expansions
8133300	8137460	But that fucking content was not already on the disc it was not on the disc
8137460	8140860	It's stuff that's added you know after the fact you'll be like hey
8140860	8143800	You know what we thought these characters would be cool to have in the game
8143800	8147160	We didn't have time to put them in there, so we're gonna go ahead and create those characters
8147160	8151420	and we're gonna sell them as DLC remember fucking happened with was it Jill Valentine and
8152420	8157560	Shima graph or whatever where that was already on the disc as well with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 yes
8158220	8161260	And they were like five bucks for each fucking character
8162380	8164020	$5 per
8164020	8165040	character
8165040	8167040	Capcom never forget that they charge
8167040	8173200	Five dollars for those fucking characters. Do you think that this is gonna be any different five?
8173720	8177200	Dollars per character how much was it five dollars per character?
8177960	8179280	$4.99
8179280	8181400	for 99 US dollars for 99
8182680	8184680	No, so I'm just saying it's
8186720	8190400	Don't think that they won't try this shit because they will and come on
8190400	8196040	I hope that you're smart enough to know that if this is you know a deal-breaker for you if these and they'll be honest
8196040	8201320	They're they're older characters. It's not like oh my god. It's now. You know Klonoa's in there and shit
8201320	8205320	You know it's not anything and that would really be the only thing that would kind of get me
8205320	8207420	They'll be all hey a bunch of new characters
8207420	8210840	I mean come on Blanca me you know if I want to play as Blanca in a game like that
8210840	8213920	I could just play you know Street Fighter 4 or something like that
8214520	8218240	Um I do want to make something clear here before I get the nasty emails
8218240	8222700	And it's like you know well Rob you bought Final Fantasy 13 too, and now they're putting out all this DLC for it
8222700	8227240	And it's inevitable that all that's gonna be repackaged at the end of the year, too
8227240	8229280	And there's two things I have to say to that one
8229360	8233060	It's actually DLC you are downloading this extra stuff
8233060	8235800	You know like the fights and the side content and all that and B
8235800	8239880	I also you know I have a much bigger love of art role-playing games
8239880	8245640	And I unlike a lot of you really liked Final Fantasy 13 and so I was really excited about Final Fantasy 13 too
8245920	8250640	Whereas with fighting games. I'm a little worn out on fighting games right now like yeah
8250640	8255320	I still got I still have a lot of Soulcalibur 5. I need to explore and you know some of these other fighting games
8255320	8259360	I've got that I haven't played enough of so it's like do I need to be the first one to own Street Fighter cross Tekken
8259480	8264720	When I realize that there's gonna be more to come later on no, I don't think I need to be the first to own it
8265360	8267120	and so
8267120	8268520	Maybe it's a double standard
8268520	8273880	But I think it's it's a question a lot of people are asking and you know and you have to you can't go into this
8273880	8275360	not knowing
8275360	8282640	What their their mo is nowadays with these fighting games they release a fucking version of a game then they upgrade it slightly later on
8282640	8286760	They'll be balancing tweaks or whatever. I mean they fucking did that was Street Fighter 4
8286760	8291800	They have Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 arcade edition
8291800	8295680	Then they have you know Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and ultimate Marvel vs.
8295680	8300560	Capcom 3 with extra characters and DLC and stuff like that of course they're gonna do that shit
8300560	8306320	They're they're gonna do it and so why should we be so naive to think that oh?
8306320	8312800	I need to pay $60 for this game right now when you can pay $60 down the road or maybe $50 who knows
8313360	8315360	And just pick up the game with all the DLC
8316240	8319160	Yeah, are you gonna be missing out in the game? You know for a while?
8319160	8319600	Yeah
8319600	8322720	But you know what you need to get if that's such a big deal
8322720	8327520	Then you need to get over the fact that you need to have stuff day one as soon as you get over the fact that
8327520	8332560	You need to have games day one. Oh my god your options get so much cheaper and so much better because
8332960	8338600	You're looking at games that are released like for example Mortal Kombat if you want to get it in on Mortal Kombat right now
8338600	8342640	Yeah, it came out about a year ago, but you can get it now for the same price
8343600	8348280	Maybe even less now with all the DLC thrown in so you're saving yourself some money
8350080	8356080	Instead of having to buy season passes for four games. Yeah pre-order download content
8356080	8361280	That's what a fucking season pass is they did that with Saints Row the third Gears of War well
8361280	8366480	You know there's a little difference though between Gears of War and like Call of Duty Elite service at least that you kind of know
8366480	8370360	What you're getting, but gears are Saints Row the third. It's been cheap ass
8371200	8375360	DLC expansions with like 30 minutes of content for $7 each
8375720	8379280	No, thanks. I you know what's interesting if I've counted this up correctly
8379280	8382520	There's 38 characters in Street Fighter X Tekken by default
8382520	8387280	And then there's an additional what we have 12 characters on the Vita and then five
8388080	8392800	Extra guest characters so about 17, so that's about I mean I'm doing sloppy math here
8392800	8398000	But that's about so what 50 characters total 55 characters 17 of them are behind a paywall
8398000	8402040	That's a quarter of the game a quarter of the game is paid to unlock
8402520	8408560	That is crazy that I think that that's too far and three months from now ultimate edition
8409360	8411360	the for real a
8411360	8417320	Quarter of the game is on the disc and you're gonna have to pay possibly possibly five dollars per character
8417720	8419720	Possibly if track record is to be followed
8420800	8426200	Yeah, I mean, let's just let's just say that they're gonna be reasonable and do two character packs five bucks each
8426920	8428920	That's still I
8429240	8432760	Mean buying all the DLC will be the price of the full
8432960	8439880	You know re-release of the game when it comes out in the year or less because you know look at you know
8439880	8443260	Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom that only came out about nine months later
8444000	8450160	February was or I believe is February that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was released November was when the sequel came out or the
8450880	8456900	Upgrade came out and you know what to be fair with ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at least they added something to that
8457220	8460240	You know the DLC characters were thrown in and a whole lot more
8460420	8465080	Which made it kind of sting even more for the people about the original Marvel vs. Capcom 3
8465080	8470920	They now to be fair. There could be another element
8470920	8477480	That is download like included with the unlock that is actually downloaded. We don't know. I mean, I know it it's
8478160	8483760	Snowballs chance in hell, but we don't know it could happen that could enrich what we're assuming and straight up
8483760	8488520	And that's not where it ends. You know if you think about it. Remember they have this whole gem system now and
8489440	8492080	They're gonna be selling those gem cards or whatever
8492080	8494080	that's
8495080	8500140	Cha-ching show me the money. I hate that our console games are turning into
8501320	8503960	Crap Facebook games. Here's the problem though
8503960	8509360	And the problem is because people are such hardcore fans out there for these games that they're willing to pay this kind of money
8509360	8511660	So people are willing to do that. Look at Skylanders
8512000	8515720	Skylanders is a ridiculous cash-in thing and people cannot get a
8516200	8519440	Enough of that game and I'm telling you these people right now
8519440	8522760	You are the downfall of this goddamn, you know industry
8522800	8527240	This is what's gonna turn into because you cannot fucking get some I
8527960	8532120	Don't sense to yourself that you're like, I don't have these stupid figures that don't do anything
8532120	8536960	I mean you're collecting little figures that don't do anything and what are they gonna do?
8536960	8543420	They're gonna sell more expensive figures that don't do anything the next time around and you're gonna buy them because you're a consumer whore
8543720	8548560	But you know what if you don't buy into it, they'll stop doing it and maybe this shit will go away
8548560	8550880	They'll start actually saying hey, you know what?
8550880	8557480	let's put everything out of this because when we start adding, you know DLC that's already all of this people don't fucking like it and then
8558000	8560000	that's not a viable means of
8560360	8564200	your revenue anymore, but unfortunately, this is the way things are going and
8565640	8568800	That's it. So you just gotta play smart you buy the game
8569680	8570880	you know
8570880	8577200	either buy it used later on buy it for cheap buy it later when the game of the year edition comes out and just
8577200	8583640	Give it some time. I'm going to our chat room SSJ 100 Matt says Rob. You're talking me out of my pre-order. You know, I'm not I
8585280	8586440	I
8586440	8590840	Well, I talked myself out of it earlier this week. So I'm just trying to be honest
8590840	8593720	I'm not saying like if you buy this you're dumb or anything like that
8593720	8594160	No
8594160	8595640	I think you just have to ask yourself
8595640	8601720	How much is this game worth to you because Capcom is about to try and charge you double for it basically and for some people?
8601720	8609000	That is that is worth it to them and that some passionate fighting game fans are gonna be lined up day one
8609200	8613960	There is nothing wrong with that. But for me, I don't consider it to be a worthy investment
8614480	8620040	Some people would side-eye me going. What are you doing ordering this collector's edition of Final Fantasy 13, too
8620040	8623520	Did you play the first game? Oh, isn't that good? But I'm like, you know what? I enjoyed it enough
8623520	8628840	I'm gonna take a risk on it, you know, so you really just have to value for you. Is
8628840	8632440	Is it worth it when you know, this is coming?
8634760	8640560	That's what it's really about is it worth it? I don't think so, but that's me
8642120	8644120	Every gamer gets a voice. I
8644680	8647280	Mean, it looks like a neat game, but maybe we should just wait
8647800	8650880	We can pick it up at Christmas. I don't time to play it right now anyways, so
8650880	8657840	Oh, I I'm telling I'll get it when the year-end edition comes out, but I I
8658720	8664680	Don't know what series if fighting games. I'm willing to buy day one anymore. Maybe Soul Calibur and that's about it
8664680	8666000	But I really like Soul Calibur
8666000	8671200	Well, there's a lot of games like I'm not I know a lot of series of games that are gonna come out
8671200	8672840	They're gonna have like game of the year additions
8672840	8677920	Like, you know Borderlands 2 I know is gonna have a game of the year edition at some point
8677920	8681000	But you know what? That's a game where the DLC was worth it
8681000	8686880	That was something it wasn't on the disc already and they put some effort into that shit. You know Skyrim is gonna be
8687600	8692520	Flipping epic DLC. Yeah, they're gonna have a game of the year edition of Skyrim because they got the room to do it
8692520	8696560	They can put it on one disc. It's gonna be awesome. And that's fine. But like
8697080	8698560	you know
8698560	8704280	Fighting games. I'm not gonna give my money to because I know that they're gonna come out with some sort of addition
8704280	8708960	That's gonna be cheaper later on and just like stuff that I'm kind of ho-hum about. I'm just gonna wait on
8709440	8712800	Dark Sakura, you look like you want to comment on this or jump in here?
8712800	8718000	Actually, it was something that I wanted to mention speaking of Skyrim. This is just before I forget it
8718240	8724440	Someone's done a berserk patch for Skyrim for PC where you can play as got to from berserk nice
8724440	8730040	Just saying you need to go look at Alan by the way is almost 200 hours Skyrim. It's pretty awesome
8730040	8737560	You got to go see the portal thingy. He downloaded the valve mod official thing. He's got like Wheatley in his bag. That's awesome
8737560	8740120	Yeah, anyhow. All right, we need to move on in the interest of time
8740940	8744180	To cover some other stories if you want to send us a mailbag on this topic
8744180	8746840	I'm sure a lot of you have something to say mailbag at orange laundry calm
8746840	8750280	Where do you stand? Maybe that'll be the question of the week next week the food old thing. I don't know. We'll see
8750600	8752600	Alright, let's move on. Um
8753160	8759260	This is kind of controversial this contest going on at Atari and it's in a nutshell make your own version of pong to win
8759260	8763480	Six digits a hundred thousand dollars and a publishing agreement with Atari
8764120	8772320	You do your own version of pong you submit to March 31st your own take on pong and it's gonna be judged by a panel
8772320	8775120	That includes Nolan Bush Bushnell who did the first pong?
8775280	8781440	Three winners will get prize money and you'll actually get to publish your games on the iOS Apple Store now
8781640	8788560	There's a lot of controversy going on with this because some websites are reporting the whole little contract for this game. Is that
8788560	8790320	Let's see
8790320	8792120	according to gamasutra
8792120	8800000	Atari's pong indie developer challenge seeks to get all entrants to give away game ideas to Atari that Atari can then exploit and the entrant
8800120	8803360	relinquishes all further interest in the idea Atari then selects 20
8803840	8809600	Semifinalists to put in months of work into building out their ideas and a playable versions that Atari has full ownership over
8809720	8815040	Half of those finalists then get a modest 5k payment for putting in even more work to complete their game
8815040	8820960	finally the top three winners will receive half of the advertised prize as a result of their work and are then subjected to a
8821040	8824600	Horrendous royalty structure as they seek to earn out the rest of their awarded prize
8824680	8828840	so in other words you're having to develop this whole game and you might get nothing and Atari owns it and
8829520	8830800	Atari
8830800	8835360	Atari's not doing too. Well, okay. I don't know if any ways notice Atari Atari
8835360	8840740	All that Atari has right now going for it is the witcher 2 which is coming, you know to
8841720	8843720	Consoles as well now. Well Xbox 360
8843720	8845040	and
8845040	8848080	test drive Ferrari Racing Legends, which
8848800	8852640	It's not exactly a strong title. That is it. I mean, so
8853400	8858000	Yeah, maybe they're gonna relaunch pong. I mean they try to a centipede in that bombed
8858000	8862280	So I always think that pong on the PlayStation years ago. I mean, I
8864400	8870680	Don't know you honestly you could probably get away with pong version out there on the iOS platform
8870680	8874840	And they probably wouldn't even notice. You know what this all sounds like to me is it sounds like
8876240	8877400	American Idol
8877400	8880200	You know how like on American Idol if you're in the top
8880360	8886480	50 you have to sign some type of contract that you're like Fox owns your ass for a year and then all those people don't
8886480	8889440	Get through and they're fucked like they can't do anything
8889700	8893060	They can't put out their own because they've had the limited exposure on the show
8893060	8897600	But they weren't in the top 12 like I know that's a fucking weird comparison
8897600	8902320	but it's kind of the same thing like if you're the runner-up in this contest Atari's gonna own your game and
8903720	8905720	You don't get much out of it
8906960	8908040	But let's be fair
8908040	8908560	I mean
8908560	8912400	I don't think coding a pong game is gonna be too much of a challenge
8912840	8920560	Punk for the person who's gonna reinvent it which by the way whoever made pong combat in the 1990s just needs to revive that idea
8920560	8928440	Yeah, I remember pong combat on the PC. Nope. Oh my god. I have it had pong paddle fatalities and everything it was hilarious
8928800	8932600	Oh my god. It was like oh god. I was in like junior high or high school
8932600	8936480	It's like 94 95 when this game was out the pong combat was great
8939680	8943600	All right somebody in our somebody in our chat room must know what I'm talking about
8944160	8945840	All right
8945840	8947920	Let's go to the mailbag. Do we have emails tonight?
8947920	8950280	We got one, but it's from Bobby
8951760	8957900	Alright, well a Bobby email will have to do tonight mailbag at orange lounge radio comm is where you guys send us emails every week
8958320	8959640	Here we go
8959640	8963320	Since Rob won't read my chat comments because Loki already started another story
8963400	8969400	The reason you don't see many 99 cent games on 3ds vita, but do on iOS is it's because of licensing fees
8969440	8973560	It costs $99 a year to get as many apps as you want on the App Store
8973560	8977760	You have to pay more than that per title to be on the 3ds slash vita
8977880	8981600	So the prices have to be higher to recoup licensing fees now Rob
8981600	8985440	I need your help on something to circumvent something. So read the last paragraph, please
8988120	8994100	Allow he's you know, he's trolling you with this. All right, here we go. I'll read this is why I'm having you read it
8995360	8998960	This is total troll bait. Are you sure you want to go? I'm having you read it
8998960	9004960	All right, so that it completely negates a statement, you know, they say don't read feed the trolls. I'm negating a statement
9004960	9008280	But having you read it. All right, here's the last last paragraph of Bobby black wolf
9009480	9013600	Host of the Bobby black will show at all games radio whose opinions are his own. Yes
9013600	9019920	Oh and the US soundtrack to sonic CD is far far far superior to the Japanese soundtrack
9020000	9025140	This is a verifiable fact. And since dark soccer just said this in her voice. It is doubly true
9026200	9028200	haha

9051000	9056880	If you want to start a protest here at Orange, Ontario mailbag at Orange lounge radio is the place to send your angst
9056880	9064120	Do not try to outsmart the ducks dark Sakura speaking of I have been trolling since I was born
9065160	9067160	true I pooped on my granny once
9068360	9073640	You really want to share that on this program my mom already did on this program, right? It's been a long ten years. All right
9073640	9090400	And speaking of angst
9092400	9098100	If you to the potential of having to take a job in customer service again, I really I mean, okay
9098440	9101360	I'm good at it. I'm good at dealing with people all
9101360	9107240	Appearances on the show to the contrary, you know, I'm really freaking good at customer service
9107960	9114640	But I did it. I've done it for a long time and I don't want to keep doing it. I want to work in design
9115240	9117960	So tell Capcom or whoever
9119040	9123760	that I have amazing grammatical skills know how to use my spell checker and
9124600	9127640	Know how to use a dictionary and a thesaurus
9127640	9133760	You may be screwed by Association for Capcom based on earlier rants on this program. I
9134720	9137240	Didn't say the views and opinions. Hello
9139960	9146520	Keep in mind I have probably every fighting game cap comes ever made including cyber BOTS Capcom's number one game. I
9148440	9155140	Have the deluxe version to have two copies of it anyway, so go to GDC I wish
9155140	9157140	but
9158140	9162540	It's it's just really difficult because I have experience in my field
9162540	9165620	I have I've got clients who will vouch for me
9165620	9171540	But they want that extra piece of paper that says that I've you know, basically taking classes and stuff. I know how to do
9172460	9177580	Gee, well, I've done a bunch of classes and stuff. I already know how to do do I have to do more classes and stuff?
9177580	9182540	I know how to do so and and you know, I have nothing against going to school
9182540	9187700	I love going to school and I love taking classes and I like learning from not just my teachers
9187700	9191060	But from the other people in my classes the people around me, you know my peers
9191580	9194460	But at the same time I really really
9195220	9199500	Would like to have the stuff that I can do be recognized. That's all
9200860	9207260	I've got a few people who are who are giving me some work. So that's good. But I need I need some regular work
9207780	9209780	Just saying done

9234980	9241780	But I had pizza earlier in the week. Maybe really take it home. Well, because it we don't have room in our fridge for it

9302160	9306600	We'll get there in a minute for now Loki. I don't want to talk about this, but
9307120	9311260	Justin Bieber, it's being sued by a game company
9312160	9315100	That put out a game called joustin beaver
9315100	9319980	It's a beaver. That's jousting things with a pole and
9322220	9327580	Yes, obviously it's parody and it's cheap and the ripoff
9328420	9330420	the Justin Bieber name
9330440	9332440	but
9332440	9337620	Anyway, so wind up happening is Justin Bieber are his lawyers. I should say
9338300	9340300	Fields of the game is infringing on
9340660	9342060	his
9342060	9348500	Trademark and publicity. So it's the other way around. It's the other way around. Oh, just so so they Justin Bieber is doing Justin Bieber
9348500	9349940	well, they sent
9349940	9351540	you know a
9351540	9354380	C synthesis or whatever and the company ours
9354860	9359300	RC3 that made the game feels that the game is parody and protected under the First Amendment and
9359540	9365340	they said of course the parody app portrays beaver floating now a log on a river and the beaver presents
9365340	9371380	Are just presented with bangs and the lance in a purple sweater the beaver knocks off
9372620	9374620	fought hogs and
9374860	9382380	Attempts to or to take his do young lady do young twelve-year-old lady beavers faint in his presence
9382380	9385700	you're basically fighting like the paparazzi as pigs and
9387660	9393500	Yeah, so I guess the beaver also signs otter graphs and
9393500	9395500	Yeah, my god
9396060	9403420	It's just so just to be clear just because I thought when you originally said this you said that that the joustin beaver folks were
9403420	9406780	Suing Justin Bieber, which I thought was ridiculous. That's his name. No, that is what they're doing
9406780	9410220	They're suing him because because they're suing each other
9410260	9417780	Yeah, because the fact that they're trying to you know, cease and desist this and they're saying well, we're protected by the first amendment rights
9417780	9423980	Okay, and so we're I get to you know, so Justin Bieber's company sued these guys
9423980	9428760	And now it's a counter suit saying you're full of shit. Really. They should be sued by the people who'd made tuben
9430620	9432620	Honestly, it looks like yeah
9433380	9435380	and really I
9436020	9441160	Mean also Justin be just his teeth aren't that bad. Let's be real
9441160	9447780	I mean, I can't believe I'm fucking defending. I know the the beavers teeth are not as bad as the real thing picture exists
9448300	9450300	this picture of
9450420	9456260	Justin Bieber dressed up like he's going into Tron with fucking he looks like the Ozzy Osbourne like
9456780	9460180	Like some creepy devil guy that's in Tron or you know
9460180	9467860	Who should be suing joustin beaver is sue Sylvester from glee because that looks more like sue Sylvester than Justin Bieber
9467860	9470700	I mean, let's be real, you know, I
9471540	9478620	Mean, it's fun to hate on the other popular singer and yeah, whatever, you know, it's not it's not music
9478620	9482740	That's our demographic at all. So that's fine. Whatever, you know
9483620	9490140	But at the same time hey, come on, man, you released an app. That's just it's just different enough
9490140	9492580	You're just cashing in on the high. It's Justin Bieber
9492580	9498300	I'm gonna download this because it's a beaver but it's not really Justin Bieber is funny
9498300	9499500	And you know what?
9499500	9504420	It just appeals to those people there that fucking dumb that will buy any of this stupid bullshit or that poke
9504420	9509100	These are the people they're on gold thing. Yes. Yes, the yellow yellow. Pokemon yellow thing
9509100	9511300	These are the people that are also dumb enough to buy
9512020	9516540	Fucking down our on diss download content for Street Fighter cross Tekken. So
9516540	9523020	a comedy gold from our chat room tonight. There's a to drink minimum in chat tonight. Just wait for this stuff
9523420	9526180	Let's see going to our chat. I'm a chat that orange lounge radio.com
9527060	9532340	Sj100 Matt says 12 year old beavers. This show has gone down a dark path. You know what I meant?
9533340	9534820	jerk
9534820	9541300	Let's see. DDR dollar bill says I sue you you sue me. Let's go and sue everybody
9541300	9543760	I really did just sing that on the show
9543760	9545080	Um
9545080	9549040	message a 100 Matt says I want to sue both of them for wasting my time well said and
9549480	9554480	Blackwolf says Rob likes glee. Lol. No, I do not. I like the first half
9554960	9559640	I'd like the first half of the first season and then I'm like this joke is done. This joke is over
9559920	9562580	This is like this is this is the guy that won't leave the party
9563240	9565680	And Justin Bieber's company hasn't sued them yet
9565680	9571800	it's just that they received this a cease and desist letter and so now, you know that company is flying filing a
9571800	9575000	Counter suit or a suit before the other suits, so
9576080	9578080	Yeah, whatever
9579160	9580960	All right, let's move on to something less
9580960	9587240	You know and I feel bad that we even talked about that game because now there's like oh hey
9587240	9591120	We got our game talked about people are going to be interested in and really it should just die
9591400	9597560	With all those other really crappy knockoff games. I have like I have a punch Obama. I haven't played it
9597560	9602620	I can't knock on a game till I play. Yeah. Yeah, you can. Okay, maybe a little bit. All right
9603400	9608820	Well, believe it or not. This is something older much older than Justin Bieber who turned 18 this week
9608820	9611320	Can you believe it but this guy's turning 30?
9612240	9615600	No, it's not me. That was already happened the Pac Man
9616840	9621280	Pac Man is getting a new 3d animated series
9621280	9627080	It is produced by a former Marvel executive Avi Arad is doing this
9627080	9633240	Now I'm called bond. I actually announced that it is going to be shown. It's got the pilot has been picked up for a full series
9633280	9636200	It's gonna be on Disney XD in fall
9636840	9640540	2013 I love Disney XD because it makes me think of the face XD
9640560	9644360	But Disney XD is also where the Tron on a main thing is gonna be so they're you know
9644360	9646360	Picking up some new work and Phineas and Ferb
9646640	9651280	This is called pack. Where does Adventure Time show because I like that show but I are to network
9651280	9651680	Okay
9651680	9656480	I only ever watch it on like Netflix and stuff but that shows I know and I did I did watch Phineas and Ferb one day
9656480	9660800	And it actually was pretty good Phineas and Ferb is awesome. Anyhow back to Pac Man
9660880	9664080	This new series is called Pac Man. The Adventure begins
9664080	9668920	I don't think it has anything to do with the old 80s cartoon, but it should be noted
9668920	9672700	You know Pac Man has been a cartoon once before but this is going that whole
9674000	9680480	Pixar route, although I don't know if this will be it's just because that shit's cheaper to produce nowadays and actually hand drawing anything
9681200	9683860	That's why it's all CG animated kind of sad
9683860	9686160	but true it doesn't make
9686980	9692340	All right, doesn't not make sense. Okay, Ron Matt. Well you saying Avi Arad left Marvel
9692900	9694900	Disney owns Marvel
9696820	9699120	Remember Disney owns Marvel
9700900	9704140	The end that's true get some Marvel rides at Disneyland
9704820	9706960	Yeah, hey, I always you know
9706960	9712300	If they end up building a third park in Anaheim, which has been rumored for years as soon as they get to Disney, California
9712300	9714300	So where are they gonna put parking in space?
9714620	9716340	underground
9716340	9719340	Underground in space. There's no there's a whole nother law
9719340	9721140	All they have to do is build another parking structure
9721140	9725220	Well, one of the lot where the Toy Story lot is now and they have a whole other space back in there
9725940	9727740	That they could use
9727740	9730740	They could build another a third part subterranean park
9730740	9734980	I don't think it'll be right next door to the other parks, but Florida's kind of spread out a little bit
9734980	9738820	So it could work. Anyway, this isn't a Disney podcast. I'm trying to make it one
9738820	9743060	But I could see a Marvel theme park competing with Six Flags
9743780	9750060	Hmm makes sense. Mm-hmm all those Six Flags has the DC properties because they have the Batman ride that is air the Superman ride
9750580	9752580	and anyway
9753100	9758700	Let's move on more stories dark soccer. You're next. I'm sorry. I'm wondering where Perry is. Okay
9759220	9762100	This is a sad chapter in gaming
9762100	9769320	Basically, and I can never pronounce this. I don't know how to pronounce this guy's name, right? His name is Aris
9771380	9773380	Bactanians, I guess
9773620	9775220	he was
9775220	9783460	Interviewed as part of a fighting game thing going on the cross-assault reality show that Capcom does and they were doing a promotion
9783540	9786740	for Tekken cross assert fright for sheep right across Tekken and
9786740	9790780	And he apparently was saying some
9791260	9797140	rather lewd things about the only female that was participating in that who happened to be his team member and
9798860	9800000	Like
9800000	9804740	Talking about how she should take off her shirt and all kinds of really just awful hideous things
9804740	9808420	And so finally a Capcom person, you know
9808420	9814860	basically said the views and opinions expressed by cast members in the live segment of cross-assault do not reflect those of Capcom as
9814860	9816060	a
9816060	9821260	Company Capcom believes that everyone should be treated with respect and you basically they said we're sorry
9821260	9825960	If anyone got offended on our show, we are completely distancing ourselves from this guy
9826180	9830900	You know what? This reminds me of speaking of like crazy analogies since I compared something American Idol earlier
9831060	9835620	This really reminds me of things that have happened on the CBS show big brother
9836380	9839180	We're contested because you know, the cameras are always on a big brother
9839180	9842180	My understanding about this reality show is it's not like the tester
9842180	9849580	it's something that's always live and some people on Big Brother have said some really dumb things like one gal in one season said these really
9849580	9854820	Ignorant things about Jewish people and just got you know, and the clip was on YouTube and she got taken to the cleaners
9854820	9856820	I mean this poor guy probably didn't find work
9856820	9859540	Oh, I shouldn't say this poor gal because she said it and it was a dumb thing to say
9860060	9862060	And she couldn't find work after the show
9862340	9869260	And then some some other guy in another season said like Dumbledore was a bad influence and shouldn't be in a kids book
9869260	9870900	Cuz he's gay I am paraphrasing
9870900	9877220	I'm not giving you the exact quote but guys people in these reality shows have put their foot in their mouth before and the networks
9877220	9879140	Have to say hey, hey
9879140	9884140	This isn't our opinion. This is just you know, some people were throwing money at to you know
9884140	9886980	Make fools of themselves on television. Well, just one of his quotes here
9886980	9889220	So this is a community that's you know
9889300	9894820	15 or 20 years old and the sexual harassment is part of a culture and if you remove that from the fighting game community
9894820	9896940	It's not the fighting game community at Starcraft
9896940	9901140	Um, you know what I'm gonna say this as
9901740	9906900	I've worked in Namco arcades and regularly kicked people's asses when taken three came out
9907260	9912140	No, I never experienced any of that. I've had a perfectly wonderful
9913060	9917940	Experience in the fighting game community for as long as I've been in it because the people that I hung out with were not assholes
9917940	9919940	like you
9920140	9922140	End of story
9922580	9924580	He's just an asshole
9924580	9928820	He is a misogynistic head up his ass asshole
9928900	9933460	Like he could probably smell his own, you know shit really really well
9933460	9937380	I don't know. He probably thinks it doesn't stink do it like part of me
9937380	9940860	you know part of me wants to be that whole hippie angle like oh
9941020	9946260	Well, maybe the guy was just under a lot of pressure and you know being on a reality show
9946260	9949780	It's got to be a lot of pressure and maybe some dumb stuff leaves your mouth and all this stuff
9949780	9955580	But then the more I think about I'm like nah cuz he's trying to kind of throw the gaming community under the bus
9955780	9957580	for something that
9957580	9962020	Seems to be something out of coming out of his mouth now granted later on in the talk
9962020	9969900	It talks about how it's been overheard at tournaments some really hideous things about particular characters that are female in games
9970100	9976500	They'll say really bad things. I don't care to repeat on this program, you know about about girl fighters
9976500	9982420	And I'm not talking about girls playing the game but girl fighters in the game will get called things that men fighters
9982420	9988900	Don't get called that are that are like ten times more hideous, you know, and and that's really unfortunate but I
9990580	9994540	Think it's also kind of ignorant to think that this is only part of the fighting game community
9994540	9996780	Like have you ever signed into Xbox Live?
9997340	9999700	Have you ever played a game on Xbox Live?
9999700	10008780	It's just people complaining that it's it's people that end up getting their asses kicked in games or whatever because and so they talk
10008780	10012780	Up a big, you know, they talk about big storm and then they get their ass handed to them
10012780	10017460	I've dealt with them all the time and you know Call of Duty or
10018380	10022660	Grand Theft Auto and stuff. It's just like oh, I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna kick your ass
10022660	10026300	You little bitch and blah blah and then you just beat the shit out of them and they quit
10026300	10033060	As 100 Matt in our chat room says but apparently plenty of people in the fighting game community agreed with him many professional players, too
10033420	10038980	Well, it's interesting what people will say behind the monitor. But as far as the professional players go, you know, I
10040300	10045620	What I the the silver lining to this story has if you can find one
10045900	10053620	Is that it does seem like the gaming community as a whole is largely rejecting this and saying we don't fucking tolerate this
10053620	10059340	Yeah, and I think that's exactly what needs to happen in all community and those professional gamers out
10059340	10061660	There might want to watch what they say
10061660	10067100	maybe maybe you shouldn't lend your comment to a story like this considering that you know, you have people sponsoring you and
10067900	10072680	Some companies maybe like mad cats or whatever might not want to sponsor someone that says oh
10072680	10077940	I think women women should go get raped or something like that, you know, because they were there whatever
10077940	10082420	I don't know making like how they basically say that whenever anyone uses Phoenix in
10082420	10084420	in NBC 3 I
10085700	10087700	Just to put a
10088180	10090780	Ironic spin of sorts on this, you know, this isn't
10091420	10096540	this isn't restricted to the fighting game community you remember this show was about the DDR community and
10097100	10099800	There's been a lot of great things in the DDR community
10099800	10102960	I've let him met a lot of wonderful people such as my co-host here on this show
10102960	10109700	I have met some awesome friends for life from playing that game, but I've also met people who will call me fat and ugly
10109700	10111620	just
10111620	10113220	based on
10113220	10116780	you know things that they may or may not know about me and it's just
10117500	10119500	Really interesting how some of that?
10120420	10122420	Comes back up all this time later
10124700	10130540	Wow, I was reading a little bit further into this and apparently she to basically
10131600	10136760	Get out of the match. She just started losing on purpose because it was really the the girl that was
10136760	10142880	You know made all that he made all those comments about she eventually started losing on purpose and the winner handed over all of his
10142880	10144880	prizes to her and
10145080	10146680	I thought that was
10146680	10153680	Pretty same time. You know what and and I understand that she felt offended by all this name-calling so it's fuck well on TV
10154080	10160920	Okay, I don't care if it's I'm a marginalizing her where the public can see it. That's national embarrassment. I understand. It's embarrassment
10160920	10165720	It's embarrassment to the person that's actually seen it. But you know what? It's a fucking embarrassed. He was an asshole
10165720	10170520	Okay, well then that's fine. He's fine being an asshole. But you know what it's getting into someone's head
10170520	10175160	That's part of playing a game and I understand that this kind of language is unacceptable as far as you know
10175160	10180800	It being on display and stuff, but at the same time you've got to fight through that. In fact, they weren't even playing
10181880	10184840	Okay, well still though. It's still he was saying it during an interview
10185600	10187880	Well, then he's just an asshole. So he was an asshole
10188680	10190680	Embarrassing a teammate
10190680	10195200	Well, he's an idiot then yeah, I mean there's no room for it
10195200	10198920	You have to drop even while playing the game and you're trying to psych somebody out
10198920	10202400	There's just a line that has to be drawn and this guy's crossing it
10202400	10204280	I mean, I'm all for you know
10204280	10210840	I'm all for playful ribbing but dear God some of the stuff you hear on Xbox Live is just repulsive
10211000	10214640	It's that's not that is it's not somebody trying to get in your head
10214640	10220720	It's just somebody trolling and saying things that they know are unacceptable in culture, you know and just things
10221360	10228080	that they they say because they're cowards and they're hiding behind their headset and their little monitors and saying these
10228480	10233560	Ridiculous things that would get their ass kicked in any public setting. Well, like I'll give you an example
10234560	10241440	when I'd play because I told you my first experience playing a land game was playing a Duke Nukem 3d and
10241440	10246600	When we were in there playing it was quiet except for the voice macros
10246680	10250840	but then I went later on and they had a private room land and
10251360	10254820	You just got people talking shit through the mic the whole time
10254820	10261360	And I was like it and it was some of the same people that played with before it's just when you get them set
10261720	10263720	it's like a different reality and
10264000	10269760	It's really nice but to have this done to your face and in front of all these people that's even worse
10269760	10273600	that's like the worst kind of marginalization and this guy honestly if
10274600	10278660	If I were a more violent person, I would just cut his tongue out
10280080	10285320	That's a bit extreme. I'd cut his tongue out in a story. That's that's a little crazy. I'm sorry
10285320	10288560	That's why I said if I was more violent, I would cut his tongue out in a room
10289400	10291400	Xenocore I think this is important to say
10291760	10296080	Guys, the main thing that needs attention here is the following one and this from our chair one
10296080	10301100	The person at fault here was the team coach someone in a supervisory position. Oh shit. I didn't know that
10301720	10307600	Too he was still there after the occurrence the fact that an entity will not remove someone that is acting appropriately
10307920	10311260	Should not be tolerated in a professional position. I
10311920	10317060	Will just throw this out there. I'm not gonna say I agree or disagree but in that crazy CBS comparison
10317060	10324160	I made a minute ago those houseguests who said the anti Jewish and the anti gay things were not thrown out of the house just
10324160	10327880	Not saying that's right or wrong. Just that it makes for better TV
10333520	10335120	Change channel
10335120	10340140	Well, why do you think I don't play online? Honestly, I I don't play online either unless I know the people
10340140	10343040	I mean, it's gotten to that point. It's it's gross and
10344040	10346200	There are certain communities of games
10346200	10352320	I will that's one thing I do kind of agree with that in some communities. You don't get it as much as in others
10352320	10354320	like
10355160	10360860	For example when I played on PSU for the most part I knew the kind of players I was playing with
10361120	10366160	There are people who were in the same kind of games that I was and if we had somebody like that
10366160	10368160	We would block them. I do that on Wow
10368600	10373360	You know, I'll even find people in trade chat that are just being complete assholes and block them for no
10373360	10377760	You know just because I don't want them to remotely message me or anything. I don't want to be around these people
10377760	10382120	and cuz sometimes I read trade chat because it's funny, but
10383680	10388520	It's a matter of putting yourself in that environment and I think that she went into this environment
10388840	10393320	Not expecting to pretty much be blasted in front of everybody that was there
10394360	10396120	so I
10396120	10400640	Mean if I knew I was gonna get I was going to a situation where that was gonna happen
10401760	10405760	Well, first of all, I do have to say in myself when I have been in those situations
10405760	10409080	I have stuck up for myself and have pretty much torn people apart
10410160	10415300	Because I don't take shit. I really don't I don't take crap. I don't care where I am. I won't take it
10415960	10417120	but
10417120	10420300	You know when you've got when you're you know, got a larger guy
10421000	10423840	Going off on you. It's really hard to kind of stand up
10424560	10426120	You know
10426120	10432280	She really either needed an advocate or he needed to be thrown out and he sort of does look like Hagrid from Harry Potter
10432280	10436160	Just saying or the guy from lost. I knock it off. All right
10437040	10439040	This is a very polarizing
10439300	10441260	Variety of opinions out there in the community
10441260	10444180	I'm sure a lot of you have something to say it is the show where every gamer has a voice
10444400	10449460	mail bag at orange laundry calm if you want to have your say or we'll be opening up the skype line in just a
10449460	10454580	Minute at username orange lounge radio on skype or are not toll-free number
10454580	10461420	It's our sub number tonight because the toll-free is down nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven is the phone number again
10461420	10467080	That is not toll-free. However, many of you with cell phones probably have nationwide long-distance, please
10467400	10472800	Please look up the rules of your carrier before you give us a call nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven
10472800	10475020	We have two more stories before we get there Loki
10475120	10482260	So Zynga is trying to get away from being supported purely by Facebook release majorly by Facebook
10482680	10487880	They are coming out with the Zynga platform. It's basically like a website
10487880	10493080	A run like a portal that you'll be able to kind of interact socially with other people
10494080	10496080	And be able to play games, you know
10496560	10498560	Like words with friends and stuff like that
10498600	10503560	It'll feature a live social stream where you'll be able to see your friends activities player profiles
10505480	10509000	Also selection of games from other companies as well and
10509760	10510880	they'll be
10510880	10513060	launching at Zynga comm
10513060	10519500	And probably in no way will copy Facebook because you know Zynga is a company that puts out completely original games
10519540	10521540	They would in no way rip off
10522340	10525260	You know social media website or anything. That's very successful
10526100	10533780	Not in least no not even Zynga minus will be the name of it face Zynga minus
10533780	10538620	they'll have a thing that's called the time stream instead of the timeline and
10540020	10542020	You know
10542020	10548160	They'll have approves instead of likes or you know thumbs up miles smiles
10549620	10551620	frowny faces I
10553540	10555540	I
10555900	10560780	Good riddance by I just don't know anyone who would go off to Zynga to do this
10560780	10561780	I mean
10561780	10567220	I think part of why Google Plus is struggling is because Facebook has its foot so damn jammed in the door
10567220	10570340	Why would you like are they gonna pull their games from Facebook?
10570340	10575760	Is that what they're planning on doing because why would I go somewhere assuming I'd play these games, which I'm not
10576780	10584700	Why would I go somewhere other than Facebook or first five levels on Facebook next 20 levels on Zynga minus?
10584700	10587000	Or whatever it's called for Zynga minus
10587940	10591100	Well, I don't think that Facebook would let them do that
10592380	10594060	All right
10594060	10598720	One more story for you guys tonight. Hey, this is this is kind of fun. I like these types of hacks
10598720	10602600	It's Mario meets portal. It's Mari zero
10603760	10610320	Mario or Mario and Leet speak it's a game of Super Mario Brothers played with the portal gun. I I
10611160	10616000	Don't know how I feel about the makers of this game. It's called stab yourself dotnet made this game
10616480	10619400	What a what a family-friendly vibe I get from that
10620040	10625800	It's that the same guy that made nesticle in Genesis. I don't know stab yourself dotnet released Mario
10625800	10630760	And you can actually there's this whole little youtubey trailer that shows you how it works
10631400	10635240	Which which is weird because they replace scenes from the wizard and all right, whatever
10636160	10640920	but it's fun because it's portal and the little cheap cheeps go flying in and out of portals and
10643920	10646680	They have like all sorts of cool stuff with that it is
10646680	10655400	A neat idea and there's like level editors and stuff like that in fact show all that stuff well keep scrolling through the end of
10655400	10657440	The let me go to the end of this little trailer here
10658840	10660840	level editor
10662040	10666200	I like have a little Mario kind of moves his hand at the guys painting different shares
10666200	10675720	Horse hats that's cool little super like literally Super Mario and four player co-op really it's kind of fun
10677640	10679640	Slow Mario
10679880	10684880	All for free get it before Nintendo shuts it down run don't walk
10687320	10692320	Although it has hit the internet now so once it's on the internet. It's on the internet
10692320	10698960	There's no how long how long before a cease-and-desist go there's no leaving the internet except in the case of
10699600	10703120	Being Bobby Brown which all episodes have vanished from the internet
10704200	10707960	Has it really and well they have pretty good lawyers apparently?
10711120	10716400	The kiss my ass clip hasn't left the internet though. No that has not it's good. It's good to know all right

10753520	10755040	Olr
10755040	10757040	Let's see
10757360	10759560	Reading some chatroom comments here
10761240	10767760	Retertainment tweeted us kind of talking about something we were talking about earlier rumor has it the valve is working on a console called the steam
10768320	10771880	Also, Walmart is working on a console called the stoner employee
10771880	10778960	But a bunch it's a redder tainment live in our Chatham. Hey, we got calls coming in hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
10779840	10782640	It's Shane. Hey Shane. What's on your mind, buddy?
10783560	10791000	Yeah, effect three massive a god Mass Effect 3. Well. We read your comment earlier. What's what's what you thinking about Mass Effect 3?
10791760	10794000	I'm just thinking about how
10794800	10799080	You know Tuesday. I'm gonna spend all day trying to romance Caden
10799080	10803720	That's it don't even care about the story that day. That's a to try to get my
10804680	10808640	Sex on with Caden I guess now since I don't which sex should you take I?
10809200	10813920	Know since I don't follow the Mass Effect story very closely explain to me like
10814600	10816600	how these
10816900	10823380	Same gender opposite gender storyline or love mances are kind of integrated into the story I
10823380	10829100	Don't know well not for the family because this will be the first time by
10829420	10832820	Now Shepard can actually get with any guys
10833420	10839020	It's near the tree. Yeah, but couldn't wasn't there like female on female romance in the first game. It was all yeah everywhere
10839140	10841340	But that's disgusting why would I say that?
10842100	10844860	To you, maybe but to other people it's kind of hot
10845860	10847860	well it was I
10847860	10853500	Guess you could like romance this the sorry chick Liara
10853500	10859220	but she's like kind of you know the kind of not and then in the second one there is a
10860020	10862420	Girl named Kelly who is worthless
10862780	10867580	they can also let die that you can like have a fling with I guess but nobody cares about that because
10868340	10873940	Caden can be romanced in three and that's the most important development in this entire series and that is confirmed absolutely
10873940	10877660	Confirmed you can have hot gay sexy times with Caden
10878900	10882500	From everything I'm reading the official strategy guide says no
10882500	10887940	But you know those aren't always like a final versions that get but people are finding sound files
10887940	10891820	There's been pictures posted I guess and then somebody unlocked an achievement
10892600	10894600	Romancing him with the male Shepard, so
10895020	10900020	Yes, this is what I've been looking forward to for weeks now because that's as long as I've been into the series
10900020	10906100	Why is it limited to only certain characters? Do you think it's just kind of like an assets thing like because there's so much voice
10906100	10908100	Acting that goes into it and all this stuff
10908940	10913340	it could be that but honestly they're trying to build a world there and
10913940	10919620	As they probably saw with Dragon Age 2 if you make everybody bisexual it really takes away from
10920340	10925780	Like real true character development not everybody should be romancable by everybody else
10925780	10930960	All right, if you play the games Caden clearly wants you as a male Shepard. He just won't act on it
10931020	10935740	I'm gonna assume that gay Lovins isn't the only reason you play Mass Effect. Although maybe it is
10936380	10943620	Why no, it's it's like the best sci-fi story. I have experienced since probably Battlestar Galactica
10943620	10951140	There you go. I'm really into the characters and the different races and like just the back story is really interesting
10951620	10955420	Here's my question. I you know have kind of missed the boat on Mass Effect
10955420	10959820	Um, it convinced me I should play Mass Effect and what game should I start with?
10959820	10962980	Should I go back and start with one or should I just jump right into three?
10964420	10968700	No, you should not just jump right into three because every game carries
10970300	10977140	Information over from the previous one with the exception of one obviously and three and that one will give you default
10978060	10983700	Choices that you will could have made in the previous games and you will come up like such an evil terrible person
10983700	10988740	If you start with the default choices from what I've read like you let some of your team members die
10989020	10992660	You don't care about a lot of things. You're pretty much just a complete jerk
10993180	10996980	But what what would you be playing it on? That's how I'll tell you what to start with
10996980	11002220	Well, cuz I was gonna say I want to play it on PlayStation 3 because that's kind of my console right now
11002220	11004220	But they don't have Mass Effect 1 on it
11004700	11005220	No
11005220	11011820	But if you pick up two it has this thing called Mass Effect Genesis where you play an inert like an interactive
11011820	11015280	graphic novel of the first thing so you make
11015820	11021140	Choices that are important in the first game through that graphic novel that will carry into the second one
11021140	11025900	But but then I would say play it on PC, but play it on PC
11026900	11031740	Because you can usually get them pretty cheap like I've seen a lot of $5.00 sales for both one and two
11031740	11033740	But then I don't know trophies
11034620	11036620	They have achievements though
11036620	11042740	You really need trophies. I need to increase my trophy level my trophy levels pathetic Shane. I
11043540	11045540	Think mine is too, but I don't care
11047740	11049740	Like started beyond one trophy
11050220	11055980	Hits done in our chat room says so there's actually an achievement for the gay option now now all the completionists will see it true
11055980	11057620	Is it to is that true?
11057620	11059620	No, no the paramour
11059820	11066020	It's just a pair more achievement from where I understand which is when you romance any character as any Shepherd. There you go
11066020	11072340	So I could have got that with stupid that Chobot chick from IGN her character
11073340	11077220	Acidic vampire in chat says Genesis is still not the same as the full experience
11077220	11084340	Oh, no, it won't be but it'll still have some important decisions that you actually get to make decisions off now
11084340	11088940	Remember, I know I'm terrible Shane. I am terrible at shooters. Well, I still okay
11088940	11096060	All right, well the first one barely qualifies as a shooter. So if you got that on PC, you would be fine. Um
11096060	11099740	You don't have to worry about ammo you worry about overheating your gun and there are classes
11100100	11106300	That play like mages or kind of play like rogues and stuff like that. So it's that you can handle to
11107100	11114180	More shooting than the first game, but it also goes a lot quicker like the combat
11114180	11118980	So it's not so bad 3 is just pretty much a shooter from what I can tell from the demo
11118980	11122440	But it's still really fun. You know, it's a shooter, right?
11123300	11128560	What you can also disable the shooter from what I hear like there's like story only mode or short for shooting mode
11129180	11133420	You can't it's funny because they give you that option to demo but I haven't even tried
11134060	11138380	The the story only or the shooting only I just go back to the the default
11138380	11143900	That's the effect experience. I should probably do that at some point. All right
11143900	11149820	I need one decision in the first game that is hunting me now and I kind of want to start the entire series over
11149820	11154460	But I only have tomorrow. That's such a you know, I can't do it. All right, Shane
11154460	11155780	I gotta let you go so we can get more calls
11155780	11160020	But um, I I will give it some thought if I can tear myself away from Wow
11160580	11165940	And you saw those pictures of Kayden, so, you know what you're missing out on send me more
11165940	11169860	I think I might need more when you unlock the special scene. Send me a copy
11170660	11178260	When what when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy. I'll pick fraps pictures with it. All right, sounds exciting. All right
11178780	11180460	All right. Bye
11180460	11185060	All right. I thought at first he said faps pictures and I'm like, oh that's kind of awkward
11185060	11191740	I don't need to I don't know that's we're friends not like that. No fraps Oh fraps. That's what he said fraps
11191740	11196620	More calls the skylines lighting up tonight. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
11197220	11200300	Yo guys is Preston from OKC. How you doing? Hey, how you doing?
11200300	11205340	Xenocore, of course Xenocore from Oklahoma City. What's on your mind tonight? Not much, man
11205340	11208980	I wasn't sure if I talked about on this show, but I've been playing a bit of air mech
11210500	11214820	Here's Ogg's way clone that got made last year. No, I don't know about this. Tell me more about this
11215140	11221260	Alright, it's on the the Android the Chrome Android marketplace and it plays within the Chrome browser
11221260	11224620	But essentially it's here's Ogg's way in a 3d environment
11225460	11230500	Not a full 3d game might you still place like the old here's Ogg's way, but it's updated in 3d and stuff. It's really cool
11230500	11232860	That's not a game. I'm super familiar with I have to admit
11232860	11239300	So what if assume I don't know anything about this game because I don't so well soccer. Can you hook me up on this one?
11239780	11241500	What's that?
11241500	11244700	I was hoping soccer might be able to fill you in on here's Ogg's way
11244700	11250500	Here's that's more of a classic gaming kind of her dog's why oh shoot. I haven't played that in ages
11250500	11253260	It's a really good game though. Yeah, it's pretty much the first
11253780	11259420	RTS that was created on a console at least on the 16-bit consoles. Anyway, yeah, it was on
11259980	11267900	Genesis correct. Yes. I have I know I have it. It's I haven't touched it in ages. But yeah, it's it's pretty good
11267900	11269940	I should lend you my Genesis so you can play it
11270500	11274880	Well, I have this thing called an emulator and I know it's questionably legal, but let's be real Rob
11274880	11277660	How many Genesis do I have? That's true. You have a lot
11277660	11282340	Yeah, but uh, but did because they have actually have it in the browser
11282340	11286100	I thought it was actually gonna come out on a marketplaces for the different systems
11286100	11291180	I was browsing around to find out for now. It's beta so you can play it for free. We're just kind of awesome. So
11291740	11294580	That's pretty cool. So where what's the website where I can play this app?
11295100	11301280	Well, actually you open up your Chrome browser and type in air mech chrome and it takes you right to the link in the marketplace
11301280	11306940	To get it. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's one of those like chrome store things like they're kind of version iOS
11306940	11312740	Yeah, I know what you're talking about. All right, I'll check that out. Yeah, it plays really simple. It's not too complicated and
11313980	11315700	Its speed is really quick, too
11315700	11321080	I haven't had a chance to play with too many other people since it isn't beta and I'm guessing they're not usually playing when I
11321080	11324900	Am but yeah, it really feels good. It feels like the old-school game
11324900	11328380	All I'm missing is the soundtrack pretty much and it'd be awesome. Right, right
11328900	11332180	What else have you been playing this week? Are you on the Mass Effect 3 hype trainer?
11332180	11339900	Not really because my roommates gonna ruin it for me because he's been posting all over just two more days, man
11339900	11341620	It's like he's partying already
11341620	11347220	but uh, but he plays through it non-stop and we all get sucked in because we know it's a solid story and
11348100	11350100	We're all in half
11350340	11356620	Because me and our roommates are all ex-military guys half this stuff that happens in the accident half the words
11356620	11360240	We just giggle laugh all day long as we heard it elsewhere, too. So
11360240	11364120	So I'm gonna hide in my room until they come out with a game of the year edition
11364120	11367560	And maybe I'll pick it up then kind of what we were saying earlier about Street Fighter cross Tekken
11367560	11369800	You're taking that approach the game of the year edition
11369880	11376520	Well, I don't really see any difference between on disk content and content is downloaded later either way. They're screwing you
11376520	11382360	It really doesn't matter what medium you happen to whether it comes early on the disk or later through a download
11383120	11388200	It's stuff they're holding back and it's nowhere near what they used to do with expansion packs back in the day
11388200	11390960	So as far as I'm concerned I can wait for it all I think again
11390960	11397100	It's really about and it's a really tricky thing to weigh especially with the iOS games really screwing up the whole economy of games
11397100	11400360	I mean you really just have to weigh is the game
11400360	11406400	I'm getting on disk with with no unlocks and all that is that content worth the 50 60 dollars
11406400	11408160	I'm being asked to pay for it and you know
11408160	11413620	for example Mass Effect 3 has been very controversial for this very thing about the whole they have the day one DLC and some people
11413620	11416200	Are like that's a ripoff and it should be free and dah-dah-dah
11416200	11419360	You really just have to weigh well throwing that aside
11419360	11425040	It's not paid to unlock content is the content on the disk worth $60 and for example, Shane our last caller
11425040	11429720	I'm sure would say yes, but other people might look at that and go, you know what? No, not so much
11429720	11431760	I'm gonna wait for the game of the year edition, you know
11431760	11435160	I remember hearing I was listening to the early
11435680	11442080	Coverage of the beta that like total biscuit was doing online and he was ratting and raving about the content on the disk being
11442080	11445880	Unlockable. It's like dude. The game was finished three months ago
11445880	11450800	There's to have time to put more project space if there's more project space to fill they're gonna fill it
11450960	11454840	you know not to mention the fact that it's like one of the characters is is a
11456080	11461220	Character essential. It's not even essential to the storyline. It's just a character they threw in as
11461960	11466080	DLC that happened to be finished before the release date. So they put it on the master disk
11466600	11471400	So half the people that are bitching because of what what I'm trying not to be too spoilery about it
11471400	11478120	But half the people that are, you know whining and moaning. It's like what it's it's this guy. It should be in the main game
11478120	11481840	No, it doesn't have to be in the main game. It was made after the fact when the main game was finished
11481840	11486840	So deal I mean if you if you want it by if you don't, you know
11486840	11490480	Hold on to your money and wait for them to package it all together the game of the year edition
11490480	11492480	Like I did with Batman Arkham Asylum. Oh
11493240	11495860	Yeah, it's another one that's had a lot a lot of DLC
11495860	11497800	But see I love I love Arkham City
11497800	11501960	The base game was was worth it to me, but I can see where some people get turned off by all that DLC
11502280	11505760	Lots and lots of it. Yeah, I might end up by Arkham City, too
11505760	11508880	I'm not really waiting on any DLC or anything, but uh, it's still
11509800	11514320	It's a solid game without all the DLC even the I mean the Catwoman stuff
11514320	11517680	I mean, I like it a lot and I think it's kind of worth the new price
11517680	11520000	But you know, I think even if you took it all out
11520000	11524200	I still think you'd have a solid game. So I thought she was still playable a bit in the main game
11524200	11528720	I think she's cut out completely see the thing is if you have her DLC
11528720	11531680	They integrate her very slickly into the main story
11531680	11535740	But if you don't have her DLC all her little stuff is kind of cut out just skipped over
11536040	11538360	So I think you see her and you interact with her
11538360	11542440	But you never do the stuff where you play as her and see poison ivy and all that
11542640	11546120	Yeah, because yeah when I saw it when I saw her combat mechanics like you know
11546120	11549720	That's an interesting way to rework the way this mechanic works. That was kind of cool
11549720	11554720	So I was kind of curious to see that so remember what I seen earlier about how oh, yeah
11554720	11556720	it's gonna take them, you know a
11557400	11562600	Couple weeks, you know about a week to have it on there. You have it all locked hackers already got all that
11562600	11566680	Are you fed across Tekken? Yep, and there's oh by the way, they're selling call. He's away with code
11566680	11569800	There is always a way with code. All right, Zena core
11569800	11573200	I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls any quick final thoughts you want to get out
11574040	11578660	Yeah, just hold on to your money people go buy food and stuff. That's not getting more expensive every day
11578660	11582860	Yeah, the rising cost of gas. It's gonna cost more to drive to the game store than to buy the game
11582900	11586780	All right, Zena core. Take care, buddy. Thanks for calling. All right. Later. Later
11587460	11593740	And no, it's even squeeze in one more call orange launch radio on Skype or 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67 not toll-free
11594540	11596860	No, it's even funnier too is the fact that
11600540	11601960	Nevermind
11601960	11603960	Alrighty, then I'll go back to Twitter. All right
11603960	11609680	Uh, we got a tweet here from Tony texture saying hey guys just listening live for the first time
11609880	11614520	Hopefully I can get in on Skype. Did I mention I'm an Aussie. Well, I hope you do get through I want to hear the
11614520	11616040	accent
11616040	11619860	Because you know Americans love the Aussie accents. I don't know the DLC
11620440	11623000	They're the codes or whatever the actual like
11623880	11629080	Hashes or whatever for each all the DLC characters was in a CSV file the main directory of the game
11629080	11631200	Oh, you've got to be kidding. It seems so lazy
11631200	11638400	All right. Let's go to the phones and take one more call here tonight. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
11640880	11647840	Soul throw hi, I'm sorry. Who's this soul throw soul throw what's on your mind?
11650400	11656460	It's the one you is it the guy that I just read his tweet yeah, he's calling are you Tony texture on Twitter?
11656460	11661260	Yes. Yes. I am. Oh my hi. Talk about timing. Good lord
11661620	11667820	Well, there must be a hideous delay going across the pond, but that's alright. What's on your mind? What welcome to the show?
11667820	11670020	How you doing? Thank you. Uh, I
11670540	11673940	Just want to say I'm a big fan. I've been listening since
11674860	11677820	Episode 250 so it's been a while. Oh my god
11679820	11681820	Yeah, I know
11681820	11687300	But well my just you know call I've actually this is the second call I've ever used on Skype
11687300	11693260	So yeah, well it works if the first call was to the echo 1 2 3 lady and the second call was to us
11693660	11695660	We can let you know it worked
11695700	11698020	Well, what kind of game what kind of games are you playing lately?
11699180	11703700	I'm playing gives 3 so I'm just going through the horde mode with some buddies. Mm-hmm
11704780	11710180	Saints Row, I'm about quarter way into that Saints Road the third. It's so amazing. Yep, and
11710180	11711700	and
11711700	11713700	just going through
11713740	11715740	Street Fighter Super Street Fighter, so
11716580	11721260	Classic, let me ask you about this since you are from an from Aussie land
11721900	11727700	In Australia has been in the news even up here a lot lately with this whole ratings board stuff that's going on
11727700	11732620	And oh, yeah good times. Good times. Yeah, good times. The fact that some games you guys know, it's true
11732620	11740620	You guys have not been able to buy Mortal Kombat yet, right? No, no, there's many other ways to get so some of the ways
11740620	11742820	Loki was talking about with unlock content. Yes
11743340	11748460	But now apparently it seems like it is the the motion has started to create a new
11749020	11752100	Rating there so that you can get some of the more adult games
11752460	11755980	How do you how do you kind of feel about how your country's been handling a lot of that? Oh
11756620	11761500	It's just just messed up. I don't know. They always change their mind all the time
11761500	11766500	It was actually my state that is holding back to our rating. So
11767340	11769940	It's all you guys, huh? Yeah, pretty much
11771340	11775900	Well, I hope that August would are you interested in playing the ultra-violent games?
11777940	11781580	Some of them yeah, I've already played Mortal Kombat if that's what you're asking
11781580	11784020	I was gonna say if you're playing Saints Row the third
11784020	11788620	I wonder how that one got through because that one's pretty bad. But yeah, Mortal Kombat I guess is even more extreme
11788620	11791700	Yeah, I don't know. I think it's sort of like, you know a
11792380	11794140	bit more stylized
11794140	11796980	When Mortal Kombat's got a lot of blood, you know
11798260	11802260	Right Wow, you know a lot of folks in the chat room are commenting
11802260	11805860	I love in the fact that somebody from Australia is on the line Australia in the house and
11806620	11808340	some folks in chat
11808340	11810840	Frisbee says I'm so glad the internet as fast as it is
11810840	11815100	I mean think about it from Australia to California in only a few seconds of delay, you know
11815100	11816960	That's one of the really humbling things about doing the show
11816960	11820220	I gotta say, you know, we went from doing a show or you know
11820220	11826220	Being friends playing it one arcade in one little city in one state, you know to having this worldwide
11827220	11829220	shit talking fest
11830740	11838420	I was actually worried about the the lag. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so I've got a question for you. All right, go for it
11838420	11845820	Um, what's the game you love but everyone else hates like, you know for me it's a
11846820	11853460	Alone in the dark for 360 everyone else hates it, but I loved it. So, I don't know and why did you love alone in the dark?
11854460	11860100	I don't know. I was a big fan of the original one the one that was actually 3d but was terrible terrible 3d
11860100	11864260	But I liked it was pretty scary at the time. So I just thought I'd buy it
11864260	11867500	I bought it cheap so, you know, but everyone was telling me don't buy it
11867500	11872780	I only bought it for about 12 bucks Aussie. So I'm not sure what that is the u.s. Probably like
11873500	11876140	$15 something probably sounds about right. Mm-hmm
11876660	11882380	Yeah, so what games do you love and everyone else hates good damn question?
11882380	11886220	What game do you love that? Everybody else hates anyone want to take a stab at it? I
11887140	11890780	Have had some people give me crap for liking fantasy zone
11891300	11896240	Because honestly, I love fantasy zone and yeah, you saw that on the master system
11896240	11900900	Yeah people I think games kind of derpy and I actually like the Tengen version for the nest
11901180	11903760	Even though it's probably not one of the greatest versions
11905580	11909340	I'll answer this for you blue dragon. I love blue dragon. Oh
11911260	11915840	See what I tell you what I tell you I got one my he loves it and everyone else is like not
11915840	11921900	I won't touch it. I like to be evolution games that were all in Dreamcast. They were pretty good and
11922860	11924860	I liked
11924860	11926540	I
11926540	11932500	Have a number of games that every time I bring them up. My husband goes. Oh, that's so bad. I'm like you suck
11934020	11939400	I'm trying to think there was one that I mentioned earlier that I absolutely love and he was just going off on it and
11939980	11941980	Offered life of me. I can't remember what it was
11942420	11948900	That's the usual way of conversations go in my house as I love games that he hates. So nice. That's the way to go
11948900	11954540	Um for me, I guess I have a couple answers for I I think one of them would honestly be Final Fantasy 13
11954540	11957940	I think I really loved Final Fantasy 13 and there were so many people that just
11958660	11963860	Despised it. Yeah, you defend that with the sword and shield. I do. I don't think it was I
11964460	11966540	Here's the thing though as much as I defend the game
11966540	11968660	I get why it has haters
11969060	11975380	Because it did go a radically different direction from the earlier games and it did kind it was pretty linear in the beginning
11975380	11979900	But the battle system alone just kind of oh my god, just just just makes it so amazing
11980580	11982780	So that's that's kind of the one I would pick
11983300	11989880	Otherwise, I'm gonna go with another interesting pick and it might sound weird to the listeners of this show, but I think DDR
11989880	11994100	I think there's a lot of people that looked at dance dance revolution back in the day and went
11994580	12000100	What a bunch of crap music that people stomp on arrows to what the hell are they doing up there?
12000100	12002700	And you know, we all defended that game
12002700	12009020	So much and we really loved that game and we were very passionate when it stopped for a while and so forth
12009020	12014180	So I think I think in a way even though a lot of listeners of this show may not realize there's a lot of haters
12014180	12016180	out there DDR
12016300	12022660	Loki you have an answer the game that you loved everybody hates. That's easy. They're gonna be earth defense force. Oh, yeah, I love that
12023220	12024780	site
12024780	12032580	um, I think a lot of people like the excite truck excite truck would be one that was you know, definitely um, I
12032580	12035940	Thought I a lot of people like excite truck. It's hard to say just didn't sell
12035940	12041700	Well, it's it's hard to you know, big game that people don't like maybe gals panic. Not a lot of people like
12045060	12048660	It's not bad, I don't know if I like that game it was fun
12048660	12055780	Um, let's see, I'm reading some of the comments in chat I really love this
12056380	12059460	DDR dollar bill says I love Tony Hawk underground 2
12060100	12064140	Infidel Final Fantasy mystic quest that's a good one
12064700	12070420	Yeah, I remember wasn't there a time that you were playing like the crap out of that game. Yeah, there was
12071220	12073700	Final Fantasy mystic quest is awesome. Let's see
12074220	12076700	Rama says Duke Nukem forever for me
12076700	12082500	DDR dollar bill says Robocop on the NES chiggers says EVO on Super Nintendo
12083460	12089700	Lots of lots and comments on the chat room on that. So, uh, was it Street Fighter EX 3?
12091140	12094700	Good, but a lot of people gave it, you know a lot of trouble
12094700	12101400	I really liked um that it integrated I didn't start sharing the engine that rival schools was using
12101400	12107280	Yeah, yeah when they did was a project something or other for Dreamcast. Yeah
12109720	12114160	Yeah, because I think that EX 3 started using the same fighting engine that rival that
12116120	12118120	The project justice was using
12118880	12125920	Yeah, I was hoping that one of those characters would pop over to Street Fighter Tekken or maybe Marvel vs. Capcom
12125920	12132400	So, but they might be owned by the other developer or whatever
12132400	12134760	I hope to do the X-rays
12134800	12139040	Well, who was your main your main character in that in that series? Cuz I was I used
12139680	12140920	I
12140920	12143080	Used the Kendo girl. Oh
12144640	12146640	Yes, yes
12146720	12150300	The chick with the bow. Yeah had amazing
12151640	12153840	super specials the one that you're like
12153840	12157040	sort of joust them into the air and then you
12157680	12163040	Punch them down from earth or something like that from the moon. It was crazy. That game was just so underappreciated
12163480	12166760	I'm glad to find somebody else who likes that series. All right
12166760	12170560	Well, well, we could nostalgia all night long, but unfortunately we got to wrap up the show here

12240600	12243440	Yeah, oh, it's gonna be free interesting
12243560	12248640	The game was originally gonna be $20, but now it is going to be free. It will still have microtransactions
12248680	12255040	But it's not a pay-to-win game meaning. It's not a Facebook game. So we'll see what that really adds up being in the future
12255300	12258340	Thanks for the tweet. I had no idea about that and I was curious about that game
12259320	12263840	Act deaf sends us a couple tweets here. One of his on Darkstalkers for which we already talked about

12266960	12272800	Trailer for Forza Horizon. Did you watch it already? Yeah, I mean, here's the thing
12272800	12279580	It's like I don't know if that's it doesn't look real to me. I mean really it's it's all like stock footage
12279580	12281580	and then like the title Forza
12282920	12284880	Forza Horizon and

12350120	12353200	Yes, but there was a lot of Sega in-house music done for it
12353200	12355880	That was still really good and somebody brought that up in chat last week
12355880	12358960	And I think that's important to remember so we will get the Sega stuff for sure
