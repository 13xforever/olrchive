7000	8000	Who's your hosts?
8000	12000	Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
14000	16000	Tonight, March 25th, 2012
16000	21000	A classic arcade game will come to Xbox Live Arcade with Kinect controls
21000	24000	Amazon stopped stocking one release from this month
24000	27000	And could games soon carry a warning similar to cigarettes?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	It's Orange Lounge Radio
38000	42000	And we're live with the 451st episode of our show for this
42000	45000	March the 25th of 2012
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming culture and all that good stuff
51000	55000	With my co-hosts, first off, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi
56000	57000	How are you?
57000	59000	Um, hungry
59000	60000	Hungry?
61000	64000	Are you about to participate in the Hunger Games? You're so hungry?
64000	65000	Shut up
65000	67000	Or the Hungry Hungry Hippo Games?
67000	71000	No I'm actually not hungry because I had broth but I will be fasting every Sunday now
71000	72000	Now is this a religious thing?
72000	73000	No
73000	75000	Well you never know, it's worth the shot right?
75000	76000	It's for my health
76000	80000	Okay, like a new, I don't want to say new craze but
80000	81000	No it's not
81000	85000	It's something I've been debating doing for like the last year or so so now I'm actually doing it
85000	88000	So I'm assuming you've done the appropriate research and all that good stuff
88000	89000	Yes
89000	91000	Just letting the listeners know
91000	92000	So
92000	93000	It's not something you're doing on a whim
93000	97000	In a month I will be discussing my results
97000	100000	Are you incorporating any exergaming into this?
100000	103000	Same stuff I'm always doing, I do yoga like every day
103000	104000	Mhm
104000	105000	So
105000	106000	Okay
106000	107000	Yeah
107000	110000	Alright, also say hello to definitely not fasting, Techmaster Loki
110000	112000	Funny you used to say that actually
112000	116000	My wife wants me to do that too starting after
116000	121000	Do you think your wife may or may not have been influenced by a co-host on this show?
121000	129000	No she did that because she had to not eat for a couple days for procedures she just had done so
129000	132000	She's like well if I can keep doing that I can lose some weight
132000	135000	Well this is dangerous territory though
135000	137000	No fasting actually isn't bad for you
137000	142000	It's a gaming show we're getting way off topic but this is much different than you know some people don't eat
142000	147000	I mean it seems like with this fasting thing you're still eating some and it's a scheduled thing
147000	150000	You're still eating some nutritional value things
150000	154000	It's just not a lot of the other stuff
154000	157000	It's basically just cutting out you know
157000	164000	And part of it for me that I really like about it is that I have a full 24 hours where I don't think about food
164000	168000	I have been more productive I've gotten so much stuff done
168000	172000	And honestly I felt super energized after I was done with my first one
172000	178000	That was Wednesday from 3 o'clock p.m. to Thursday 3 o'clock p.m.
178000	180000	Went to yoga that night felt great
180000	185000	And it really is kind of crazy it's just sort of like my energy level shot way up
185000	191000	I'm just trying to draw a clear line between what you're doing and what someone with a mental disorder who doesn't eat does
191000	193000	But I'm just trying to make that distinction clear
193000	196000	A person with a mental disorder would just not eat
196000	198000	You know completely not
198000	202000	Or maybe do like what was her face on the Partridge family Susan Day
202000	205000	Who ate nothing but carrots and turned orange
205000	207000	That happened to me when I was a baby
207000	208000	Well yeah it's beta-carotene
208000	209000	It's different when you're a baby
209000	216000	Yeah but I mean I'm saying that you know there's people that will just you know do all the stuff
216000	220000	And this is really something that I've put research into and read a bunch of different stuff
220000	223000	And I'm doing what I do with anything
223000	225000	I try it for a month
225000	226000	I see how I feel
226000	227000	Check my health
227000	230000	And this is someone who used to get blood tested every six months so
230000	232000	Just want to make that clear for the listeners
232000	234000	Especially if it's your first time listening
234000	235000	Just want to make that clear
235000	236000	There's a clear difference here
236000	237000	I'm not stupid
237000	238000	Alright
238000	240000	Loki sorry to cut you off but
240000	242000	Wanted to make sure the listeners understood that
242000	245000	But you are you are clearly indulging in a feast tonight
245000	247000	With your bacon and garlic pizza
247000	249000	I call that a meal but you know
249000	252000	Alright you can join us live here
252000	255000	We are of course live tonight Sunday night
255000	257000	So we're always here Sundays at All Games Radio
257000	259000	www.allgames.com
259000	261000	6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern
261000	263000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
263000	267000	Although as he mentioned tonight he's going on a brief hiatus for the next two weeks
267000	270000	So you'll just have to tune in right at 6 o'clock for the next couple weeks
270000	272000	Because we'll be on there at All Games Radio

276000	279000	www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com
279000	282000	If you want to join us and chat with us throughout the evening
282000	285000	And some folks are coming up with cute little names

287000	289000	And Diet Diet Revolution there from Hitstun
289000	290000	There you go
290000	291000	Alright
291000	294000	We're going to get into some gaming news
294000	295000	And how our gaming weeks were and all that
295000	297000	But usually we have a little kick off topic here at the start
297000	299000	And I want to talk about this tonight
299000	301000	Because this is what lots of people
301000	302000	Lots of people are talking about
302000	303000	Facebook is any indication
303000	305000	It's like everybody's freaking talking about this
305000	307000	And that's that movie The Hunger Games
307000	309000	Which is announced today
309000	312000	Best non-sequel opening ever
312000	315000	Best, it beat Twilight
315000	318000	Which can't be bad news
318000	321000	I personally have not seen the movie myself
321000	324000	I haven't read the books or anything
324000	326000	I'm interested in seeing the movie
326000	328000	Mostly because all my friends are like
328000	329000	It's so good, it's so good
329000	332000	And I'm not going to hate something just because it's good
332000	334000	Loki you're doing it, did you go see it?
334000	335000	I'm not sure the wife took you to see it
335000	336000	What did you think?
336000	337000	No the wife didn't take me to see it
337000	338000	I had tickets to see it
338000	340000	Oh sorry, how dare I?
340000	341000	It was free
341000	344000	Free popcorn
344000	346000	It was alright
346000	350000	My wife had described it as Battle Royale meets Twilight
350000	354000	As in there's boyfriend, girlfriend, garbage
354000	356000	And people killing each other
356000	359000	The best description I read on the internet was
359000	361000	Battle Royale for soccer moms
361000	364000	It's not really, no
364000	369000	I mean they don't really touch on the whole relationship stuff that much
369000	371000	It's just kind of briefly there
371000	373000	And it actually is part of a plot point
373000	377000	It's not necessarily, without spoiling too much
377000	380000	They try to work up the whole relationship thing
380000	383000	To get more sponsors, to get more perks
383000	386000	In the actual games themselves
386000	388000	And so that's kind of why they're doing it that way
388000	391000	But it's not even like that big a deal
391000	394000	But I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh my god it's Battle Royale
394000	397000	Although I do have to say that the filmmaker
397000	400000	Must have gone to the Michael Bay school of camera work
400000	404000	Because that shit was shaky all over the goddamn place
404000	407000	I would rather you not mention that evil person's name
407000	411000	Oh does this have to do with a certain Ninja Turtle?
411000	412000	Shut up
412000	414000	Yes
414000	417000	I want to make this clear too
417000	418000	It was not bad
418000	419000	And Woody Harrelson's in it
419000	421000	That's always a pleasant surprise
421000	423000	Because Woody Harrelson's character is awesome
423000	426000	Before the Battle Royale, or excuse me before, oh boy
426000	429000	Before the Hunger Games fans shoot me down with a bow and arrow
429000	431000	I want to talk about the Battle Royale thing
431000	436000	Because I do think people are running a little far with this whole comparison thing
436000	439000	Because, hello, Battle Royale's like 12 years old
439000	442000	It's based, it's a completely different kind of book
442000	444000	That's very political in nature
444000	448000	Of course they're going to time the re-release with what's going on here
448000	450000	Because of the distant similarity
450000	453000	But my whole thing is that, you know, well for one
453000	455000	There was what? There was Logan's run
455000	459000	There was the Stephen King novel back in the 70's
459000	463000	You know, there's been other stuff about this type of topic too
463000	467000	And, how can you go Battle Royale and Hunger Games
467000	469000	Or like the same movie and Hollywood doesn't
469000	471000	How can you say that?
471000	474000	And turn your head away from the fact that we have this
474000	477000	Julia Roberts Snow White movie
477000	480000	And Chick from Twilight Snow White movie
480000	483000	Coming out within literally three months of each other
483000	484000	Going on over here
484000	488000	To which I hear the trailer for both were being played before the Hunger Games
488000	492000	And I'm like, how can you fucking sit there and compare the Hunger Games to Battle Royale
492000	494000	When this shit's going on?
494000	496000	No, they did not have the Mirror Mirror trailer
496000	498000	But yeah, I'm well aware of Mirror Mirror
498000	500000	At first I thought they were the same movie
500000	502000	I'm like, man, that first trailer was really dark
502000	504000	But this one makes it look like a comedy
504000	506000	I'm really confused with what's going on here
506000	508000	Right?
508000	513000	But, uh, yeah, it's just, um, it's a little bit dark
513000	516000	I mean, it's not as dark as Battle Royale
516000	518000	I mean, there's killing and stuff
518000	519000	And they have kind of the same stuff
519000	522000	There's alliances and, you know, that kind of thing
522000	524000	But I think Battle Royale is a lot darker
524000	527000	I mean, it's a little bit similar where they, you know, pick people
527000	530000	You know, fight to the death and stuff like that
530000	534000	But at the same time, it's just, it's a little weird
534000	535000	I don't know
535000	538000	Gamer Girl in our chatroom says Logan's run is getting a re-release too
538000	540000	And that's not really surprising
540000	543000	Anything remotely resembling the Hunger Games is gonna come back
543000	547000	Because, again, it's the biggest non-sequel ever
547000	552000	It has come to take Harry Potter's place for a few years in Hollywood as the young adult
552000	554000	Because ain't no one gonna admit they like Twilight
554000	558000	Next year we'll see The Long Walk and then another Lord of the Flies
558000	560000	That's the Stephen King novel I was trying to think of
560000	562000	They'll adapt that
562000	564000	That shit is getting green-lit
564000	566000	Then we'll get an American Battle Royale
566000	568000	I hope not
568000	569000	I hope not
569000	570000	The next one's gonna be Andrew's Game
570000	573000	That's gonna be the next big one that's gonna be coming out in a year from now
573000	576000	By the way, you know, Logan's run came out the year I was born
576000	577000	Oh, really?
577000	578000	Yeah
578000	579000	Wow, that's an old movie
579000	581000	You set yourself up for that
581000	583000	I'm telling you right there
583000	585000	Ready Player One?
585000	587000	You finish that shit
587000	589000	That is gonna be box office gold right there
589000	590000	Here's what I really wanted to talk about
590000	592000	I didn't want to be at Hunger Games podcast tonight
592000	594000	What I really wanted to talk about was
594000	597000	Again, biggest non-sequel ever
597000	599000	And they kinda knew this was gonna happen, right?
599000	601000	Where's the video game?
601000	605000	Now, before you write your emails and chatters
605000	607000	Yes, I'm aware of the iOS video game
607000	609000	That's the whole indie developer collaboration
609000	610000	I've played it
610000	611000	It's pretty sweet
611000	613000	But it is a very simple game
613000	615000	That is a light, tight
615000	617000	I mean, it's fucking free
617000	619000	And it's got a pretty cool soundtrack
619000	621000	It's worth looking at
621000	624000	But it's not a video game based on the movie
624000	626000	It wouldn't work
626000	627000	How so?
627000	630000	How so? Because there's not really anything you could do
630000	633000	You play as a character and you go and kill other kids
633000	637000	I mean, do they really want a killing kids video game?
637000	642000	Ten years ago on this show, we used to love Battle Royale
642000	644000	Remember when we all first saw that movie?
644000	645000	We had the paper play stuff
645000	649000	And we said, there is no fucking way this movie is ever coming out in America
649000	651000	They are not gonna do it
651000	652000	And now they are
652000	654000	You can't put kids killing kids on the screen
654000	656000	Not in this day and age, ten years ago
656000	657000	In the wake of Columbine
657000	659000	And the reason why Battle Royale is coming out
659000	662000	Is because the mainstream studios wouldn't bring it out
662000	664000	And I think it's either Anchor Bay
664000	667000	Or some Hong Kong movie distributor
667000	669000	That's actually putting it out over here
669000	671000	It's not necessarily some mainstream
671000	674000	It's not like Warner Brothers or Lionsgate
674000	675000	Or something like that
675000	676000	It's putting it out here
676000	677000	But it wouldn't work
677000	679000	It's so much smaller scale
679000	682000	It wouldn't really work as an action game
682000	683000	Or a stealth action game
683000	684000	Or something like that
684000	686000	Because there's only twelve
686000	689000	Or twenty-four kids originally in that
689000	691000	And it's just not
691000	694000	Whereas Battle Royale is a little bit more free form
694000	696000	It's just hunting people down
696000	697000	And stuff like that
697000	698000	It just wouldn't really work
698000	699000	Now the later movies
699000	700000	Or later books would work
700000	701000	I was just about to say
701000	703000	Maybe, now without spoiling
703000	705000	But I understand the later books
705000	707000	Are more of a
707000	709000	Her against the government type of piece
709000	711000	Put it very plainly like that
711000	713000	So maybe that would translate better towards a video game
713000	715000	Yeah, that might work
715000	716000	Go to our chatroom
716000	717000	At chat.orangelinesradio.com
717000	718000	Stan says
718000	720000	I would love to see an American Battle Royale movie
720000	722000	With Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and all them assholes
722000	723000	Shoot each other
723000	726000	Except, wait a minute
726000	728000	There wasn't a lot of shooting in Battle Royale
728000	729000	There was some, but not a lot
729000	731000	There was plenty of gunfire
731000	734000	I thought most people died from explosives
734000	737000	And there was some
737000	738000	Like I remember
738000	739000	Meetsco got a hold of the thing
739000	742000	And then dude went all out with the automatic gun
742000	743000	And
743000	746000	Alright, so there were no guns in this movie
746000	748000	Which was my complaint
748000	749000	I'm like, okay
749000	751000	Because spoiling
751000	753000	Well, I don't know if I want to spoil
753000	755000	Don't, let me read another comment from chat
755000	756000	Derek Gage in chat says
756000	757000	Titanic was a sequel?
757000	759000	Hold on, I said biggest opening weekend
759000	761000	Remember, Titanic made all its money
761000	763000	Because it was number one at the box office for like
763000	764000	What, four or five months?
764000	765000	Because
765000	767000	A lot of people were going to see it multiple times
767000	769000	I'll admit, I saw Titanic in the theater three times
769000	771000	I didn't
771000	773000	I saw it once on VHS and I wanted to kill myself
773000	775000	It's not that I loved Titanic
775000	777000	But you have to
777000	779000	I realized my dad was very into Titanic stuff
779000	781000	Way before the movie
781000	783000	I remember watching a National Geographic special
783000	785000	And I was like seven years old, way before the movie
785000	787000	And I went to see it with him
787000	789000	Then I went to see it with some other friends in college
789000	791000	Because a bunch of them hadn't seen it and wanted to go
791000	793000	And then I ended up seeing it one other time
793000	795000	Really cheap for some reason
795000	797000	And you know, it was
797000	799000	It was a good movie
799000	801000	But I won't see this 3D re-release
801000	803000	I will not see the 3D re-release
803000	805000	But it's James Cameron doing 3D
805000	807000	That might not be bad
807000	809000	I don't care
809000	811000	So anyhow
811000	813000	So you're saying the Hunger Games
813000	815000	video game didn't happen because it's not possible
815000	817000	Even though it wouldn't be good
817000	819000	It would seem like there's all these
819000	821000	video game movie games that come out
821000	823000	Although, not a lot lately
823000	825000	Right? They never did a video game
825000	827000	for The Dark Knight
827000	829000	Right?
829000	831000	One had been cancelled or something like that I think
831000	833000	I don't think any had been announced for this
833000	835000	new Batman movie, which you think would be a perfect
835000	837000	tie-in
837000	839000	Surely they've got to be doing an Avengers game, right?
839000	841000	No, at least not that I'm aware
841000	843000	There's a Facebook game
843000	845000	The next movie game that they have coming out
845000	847000	is Madagascar 3
847000	849000	Did the movie video game genre die?
849000	851000	No, see in the month of May
851000	853000	You have Madagascar 3
853000	855000	from D3
855000	857000	You have two from Activision
857000	859000	Men in Black
859000	861000	and Battleship
861000	863000	The movie based off the board game
863000	865000	The video game based off the movie
865000	867000	based off the board game
867000	869000	And we will still not have our Liam Neeson
869000	871000	saying E5
873000	875000	Liam Neeson's awesome
875000	877000	My problem with the movie
877000	879000	Spoiler!
879000	881000	Even though it's not out yet
881000	883000	He dies! And I don't fucking
883000	885000	care about the rest of the movie after he dies
885000	887000	He needs to be there punching
887000	889000	aliens in the face
889000	891000	Just get out of the fucking battleship
891000	893000	He doesn't need the goddamn battleship
893000	895000	You can just punch him in the face with a goddamn broken bottle on his hand
895000	897000	I can't believe you would ruin Battleship the movie
897000	899000	Oh yeah, that
899000	901000	Who cares? So what? He dies, big deal
901000	903000	Honestly, Battleship the movie
903000	905000	is like Independence Day
905000	907000	You look back at Independence Day
907000	909000	I loved the movie, but it was fucking ridiculous
909000	911000	It made no sense, it was just ridiculous
911000	913000	This is true
913000	915000	But you know what? It's a fucking
915000	917000	I saw Independence Day
917000	919000	I think the second, the third, and the fourth
919000	921000	And maybe the fifth
921000	923000	I saw it like four or five days in a row
923000	925000	And it was great
925000	927000	every time
927000	929000	Did they make a video game out of Independence Day? I don't remember
929000	931000	Yes, they did on the Playstation 1
931000	933000	And it was fucking terrible
933000	935000	It really was
937000	939000	AcidicVampire in chat says
939000	941000	I hope the Battleship movie climaxes with a strategic battle
941000	943000	in the style of the board game
943000	945000	Me too, that's the only way you could convince me to see it
945000	947000	Liam Neeson and Rihanna
947000	949000	sit down and they go to town
949000	951000	on a game of Battleship
951000	953000	I don't even care, I think it's gonna be awesome
953000	955000	I mean, it's such a terrible
955000	957000	It's a movie you go into and you know
957000	959000	what it is, it's just explosions
959000	961000	and nonsense, that's Michael Bay for you
961000	963000	Explosions and nonsense, if that's what you want
963000	965000	then you go see that movie
965000	967000	And that's what I want, so I'm gonna go see that movie
967000	969000	And I'll see The Avengers because that looks awesome
969000	971000	But I
971000	973000	do need to catch up on the Avenger
973000	975000	movies, you know, leading up
975000	977000	to it because I've only seen Iron Man 1
977000	979000	I have only seen, you and I are in the same boat
979000	981000	Oh my gosh, you and I need to
981000	983000	get together and do this because
983000	985000	I have only seen Iron Man 1, that's it
985000	987000	I haven't seen any of the others
987000	989000	None of them, didn't see Thor, didn't see
989000	991000	Captain America
991000	993000	It's not that I, I'm not hating
993000	995000	I just, seriously, last year
995000	997000	I did not go to the movie, I didn't go to the movies at all
997000	999000	last year, you had a kid, I'm lazy
999000	1001000	I saw Thor, Thor was good
1001000	1003000	I didn't see the second Iron Man movie
1003000	1005000	because it's just pretty much
1005000	1007000	Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr
1007000	1009000	How's that a bad thing?
1009000	1011000	Drunken asshole
1011000	1013000	That Robert Downey Jr.
1013000	1015000	No, that's fine, that's fine
1015000	1017000	I own it, I just haven't bothered to see it yet
1017000	1019000	It's sort of like I wasn't excited
1019000	1021000	I liked the first one
1021000	1023000	And I saw Hulk
1023000	1025000	Even though it's, you know, not the same
1025000	1027000	Dude, I think it's like, same universe-ish thing
1027000	1031000	Which, honestly, I really wish they had had Edward Norton
1031000	1033000	Really wish they had Edward Norton
1033000	1035000	He was so good
1035000	1037000	You met the other guy, right?
1037000	1039000	Yeah, I have, he signed my Xbox
1039000	1041000	But man, I, Hawkeye
1041000	1043000	Black Wolf in Chat says
1043000	1045000	You guys did notice in the first Battleship trailer
1045000	1047000	that the bombs were in the shape of Battleship pins, right?
1047000	1049000	Yes, I did
1049000	1051000	I didn't notice that
1051000	1053000	So are there any other big movies this summer
1053000	1055000	that I'm not thinking of
1055000	1057000	that might have video games made out of them?
1057000	1059000	Seems like there was a lot of stuff coming out this summer
1059000	1061000	Um
1063000	1065000	I'm trying to think
1065000	1067000	No
1067000	1069000	I honestly don't remember what the summer lineup is this year
1069000	1071000	I mean, other than Batman
1071000	1073000	and the new Snow White movie
1073000	1075000	Which
1075000	1077000	I don't know, looks
1077000	1079000	alright, I'm gonna have to go see it though
1079000	1081000	My wife wants to see it
1081000	1083000	Alright, look, we'll start to talk more about the summer stuff
1083000	1085000	when it gets closer to summer
1085000	1087000	For now, let's talk about right now
1087000	1089000	this week, the types of video games we've been
1089000	1091000	playing this week in a segment we call
1091000	1093000	How Was Your Gaming Week? DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1093000	1095000	My gaming week was
1095000	1097000	retro
1097000	1099000	We bought Bust-A-Move 2
1099000	1101000	as in Puzzle Bobble
1101000	1103000	Arcade Edition for the PlayStation
1103000	1105000	And
1105000	1107000	My husband and I actually
1107000	1109000	had a fairly even match in playing
1109000	1111000	even though I'm usually the
1111000	1113000	much better player
1113000	1115000	Um
1115000	1117000	We also picked up
1117000	1119000	Taito Legends for PS2
1119000	1121000	and so
1121000	1123000	I have that on Xbox One
1123000	1125000	And so a lot of this afternoon was spent with
1125000	1127000	my husband screaming at Rainbow Islands
1127000	1129000	and screaming at Super Kicks
1129000	1131000	and then playing the hell
1131000	1133000	out of Rastan
1133000	1135000	And we also decided
1135000	1137000	that the biplane shooter
1137000	1139000	Tokyo sucks
1139000	1141000	And
1141000	1143000	And while this wasn't
1143000	1145000	we have video games related
1145000	1147000	to the series, but I have to say
1147000	1149000	that watching
1149000	1151000	the Evangelion 2.22
1151000	1153000	really is kind of depressing
1153000	1155000	but awesome
1155000	1157000	Just saying
1157000	1159000	Awesome, so it sounds like it was a bit of a retro day
1159000	1161000	with the Taito stuff
1161000	1163000	There's a series that had its ending changed
1163000	1165000	Yeah
1165000	1167000	If you want to talk about
1167000	1169000	partially from fan complaint
1169000	1171000	and partially from the creator wanting to
1171000	1173000	expand on it more
1173000	1175000	And it made no fucking sense
1175000	1177000	And guess what? They're redoing the whole thing now
1177000	1179000	in a series of movies
1179000	1181000	Alright, before we get to Loki's gaming week
1181000	1183000	from the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
1183000	1185000	Some folks in the chat are naming
1185000	1187000	some other possible
1187000	1189000	titles. Tiger Claws says
1189000	1191000	maybe they should make a video game on Prometheus
1191000	1193000	That's supposed to be a pretty big one, right?
1193000	1195000	Well technically there's the
1195000	1197000	colonial marines which is coming out later
1197000	1199000	this year, so that could tie into
1199000	1201000	Prometheus
1201000	1203000	Infidel names one that I
1203000	1205000	particularly am looking forward to seeing
1205000	1207000	Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter
1207000	1209000	That would be pretty awesome
1209000	1211000	I'm looking forward to that one
1211000	1213000	Platinum Games putting it together, that'd be awesome
1213000	1215000	Meanwhile, your gaming week, Loki
1215000	1217000	So let's see, this week I didn't play a lot of games
1217000	1219000	I played
1219000	1221000	Call of Duty briefly
1221000	1223000	because I was only working for three days this week
1223000	1225000	The rest of the time
1225000	1227000	I've been just working
1227000	1229000	working in Excel
1229000	1231000	Why would I try to program something
1231000	1233000	in Excel? Because I'm weird like that
1233000	1235000	So, I like
1235000	1237000	programming it
1237000	1239000	No, it's not a secret, it never was
1239000	1241000	It was, um, I'm making a map editor
1241000	1243000	for Grand Theft Auto IV
1243000	1245000	It actually works, it's just fucking slow
1245000	1247000	because it's in Excel
1247000	1249000	In Excel
1249000	1251000	How does a map editor in Excel work?
1251000	1253000	Meaning you draw it out in the little cells?
1253000	1255000	No, no, no, it's like
1255000	1257000	basically it opens
1257000	1259000	a format, it's like a
1259000	1261000	WPL, it's a placement list or something like that
1261000	1263000	You can
1263000	1265000	import stuff I make out of
1265000	1267000	the Simple Native Trainer
1267000	1269000	which is a trainer in the game, you can spawn
1269000	1271000	objects, move them around, place them and stuff
1271000	1273000	and you can export those to a file
1273000	1275000	and dump them into this and then I can save them as
1275000	1277000	the actual map files that are used by the games
1277000	1279000	Huh
1279000	1281000	I can actually
1281000	1283000	paste the hex code in there
1283000	1285000	from, you know, you open up the file in the
1285000	1287000	hex editor and dump it in there and it'll actually
1287000	1289000	read everything and, you know, you can also save
1289000	1291000	it as that and it'll
1291000	1293000	do that fun stuff
1293000	1295000	But it works, and it's weird because
1295000	1297000	the editors that they have
1297000	1299000	out there now are broken, they don't really work
1299000	1301000	well, so the fact that I'm making something very
1301000	1303000	inefficiently, it works
1303000	1305000	and that's all I care about, is the fact that it works
1305000	1307000	Because I don't know how to program
1307000	1309000	in C Sharp or C++
1309000	1311000	or whatever, I could
1311000	1313000	I could, you know
1313000	1315000	learn how to
1315000	1317000	do that, but it just, for some reason
1317000	1319000	my mind can't wrap around that, yet complex
1319000	1321000	stuff in Excel I can do that
1321000	1323000	It's weird, like
1323000	1325000	Ridiculous formula, I mean
1325000	1327000	Let me put it this way, my Excel
1327000	1329000	file, I had to go, I had to convert it to
1329000	1331000	the new format because I was gonna try to make it
1331000	1333000	compatible with everything else, it ended up being
1333000	1335000	75 megabytes
1335000	1337000	It's huge. Will it work in open office?
1337000	1339000	Uh, no. Open office doesn't
1339000	1341000	really work that well for this
1341000	1343000	So, that was that
1343000	1345000	And then, kind of a weird
1345000	1347000	It's not weird
1347000	1349000	Something I'm doing, as I mentioned before
1349000	1351000	Mark Ruffalo's signed by Xbox before
1351000	1353000	and a couple other people have as well
1353000	1355000	So, now I have this Xbox that I'm kinda
1355000	1357000	using, it's almost like an autograph book
1357000	1359000	I get celebrities to sign it, you know
1359000	1361000	I don't know if people always consider these
1361000	1363000	people celebrities, but
1363000	1365000	Like, this week I had, we had a visit
1365000	1367000	from Duff Goldman
1367000	1369000	from, you know, Ace of Cakes
1369000	1371000	Duff Beer? No, not Duff Beer
1371000	1373000	From Ace of Cakes, or, you know
1373000	1375000	Charm City Cakes, you know, really cool guy
1375000	1377000	So, I had him sign my Xbox
1377000	1379000	He must have went like, I'm a cake maker
1379000	1381000	Why am I signing an Xbox?
1381000	1383000	He thought it was cool. Of course, he could see the other people
1383000	1385000	Yeah, he thought it was cool, I'm like
1385000	1387000	Oh, cause he wasn't really doing
1387000	1389000	signing of stuff, and I'm like, well hey
1389000	1391000	Can you sign my Xbox? He's like
1391000	1393000	Sure, who else has signed this
1393000	1395000	so far? I'm like, here's Orlando Bloom
1395000	1397000	Here's Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher
1397000	1399000	Thornton. Christopher Thornton is kinda
1399000	1401000	He's a
1401000	1403000	director, and he's not really a
1403000	1405000	Yeah, I mean, Orlando Bloom, that's
1405000	1407000	pretty awesome. That's almost like one of those like
1407000	1409000	you know, when they auction off the giant
1409000	1411000	like, you know, quilt
1411000	1413000	that every celebrity under the sun has signed
1413000	1415000	for a charity, it's like you're building one of those
1415000	1417000	for like D-list celebrities
1417000	1419000	Well, it's not even, I wouldn't consider
1419000	1421000	Orlando Bloom or Mark Ruffalo, who's starring
1421000	1423000	as the Hulk in the Avengers
1423000	1425000	B-list. Whatever, fine
1425000	1427000	But, I mean, it's just, I had
1427000	1429000	I have signatures from a bunch of different celebrities
1429000	1431000	at my work, like a bunch of posters
1431000	1433000	but they're sitting in a pile on my desk
1433000	1435000	and collecting dust, like I have
1435000	1437000	William H. Macy
1437000	1439000	and I had
1439000	1441000	Oh, who the hell is
1441000	1443000	Jeff Goldblum at one time
1443000	1445000	He's just, that guy is
1445000	1447000	fucking weird
1447000	1449000	He is, like, you know how quirky he is
1449000	1451000	and like everything, like movies and stuff
1451000	1453000	He is like that in real life, he's just weird
1453000	1455000	Just like this really
1455000	1457000	strange, off the wall
1457000	1459000	type guy, but you know, it's just like
1459000	1461000	stuff like that, I had
1461000	1463000	Rob Schneider sign a copy of the animal
1463000	1465000	I had on VHS
1465000	1467000	He was wearing a weird cowboy hat at the time
1467000	1469000	too, that was kind of funny
1469000	1471000	But yeah, like, you know, we met before
1471000	1473000	he died, you know, we met
1473000	1475000	Patrick Swayze
1475000	1477000	So that was kind of cool
1477000	1479000	I like to get pictures
1479000	1481000	Well, yeah, I get pictures
1481000	1483000	too, but you know, I just
1483000	1485000	I figured, because I like
1485000	1487000	I keep my Xbox in better shape
1487000	1489000	than those posters, so the way I figured
1489000	1491000	it's more of an honor to sign this
1491000	1493000	Xbox than it is
1493000	1495000	I can't, I mean
1495000	1497000	this guy is a big geek
1497000	1499000	He was talking about totally geeking out
1499000	1501000	at, like, LucasArts and
1501000	1503000	Skywalker Ranch and stuff like that when they went
1503000	1505000	and made the cake there, and, you know
1505000	1507000	Did he also try to fling meatloaf at George Lucas?
1507000	1509000	Hey!
1509000	1511000	But, uh, you know, so
1511000	1513000	I think that, I'm sure that
1513000	1515000	he plays video games, I'm sure that
1515000	1517000	he thought it was cool, so, whatever
1517000	1519000	I like Derek H.'s counter about Mark
1519000	1521000	Ruffalo's celebrity status, Derek H. says
1521000	1523000	Well, Ruffalo is Bruce Banner
1523000	1525000	A few hundred computers are playing the Hulk
1525000	1527000	That is true True facts
1527000	1529000	True facts, alright
1529000	1531000	Fair enough
1531000	1533000	Anything else you want to get out of there for your game?
1533000	1535000	Ummmm
1535000	1537000	I think that's all I've played
1537000	1539000	No, I tried playing a little bit of the Mario
1539000	1541000	Portal game, the Mario
1541000	1543000	game, and it's weird, I mean
1543000	1545000	I can't play that on my laptop, because it's
1545000	1547000	It's an art piece Yeah, it's just
1547000	1549000	It doesn't play very well with, like, a touchpad
1549000	1551000	I'm just, I'm not
1551000	1553000	very keyboard mouse, so it's very
1553000	1555000	awkward for me to play that Oh, yeah, yeah
1555000	1557000	So, it's just, um,
1557000	1559000	yeah, it's a little weird
1559000	1561000	Alright, well, that's it
1561000	1563000	Then my gaming week, um
1563000	1565000	As I mentioned earlier, I tried that new Hunger Games
1565000	1567000	on the iPhone Sorry, sorry, sorry
1567000	1569000	One, uh, I'd like
1569000	1571000	I did play one game
1571000	1573000	a lot this week, actually, I completely forgot
1573000	1575000	Um, Super Stardust Delta
1575000	1577000	Oh I love that game
1577000	1579000	It's actually really awesome That's right
1579000	1581000	Our buddy, uh, Brad from Pod Culture
1581000	1583000	Yes, he hooked me up with the code, and I've
1583000	1585000	been playing the crap out of that, and it's actually
1585000	1587000	a really fun game Yeah? Because I'm thinking about
1587000	1589000	getting it It's definitely worth it
1589000	1591000	It's very fun I still never cashed
1591000	1593000	in my 3G thing I never
1593000	1595000	did either That feature on my Vita
1595000	1597000	has literally gone to waste, I think I have till the
1597000	1599000	31st to do something with it, or you lose it
1599000	1601000	or something like that, so I gotta make sure I get that taken care of
1601000	1603000	You know, who cares
1603000	1605000	I think, well, they have the GPS, though, with
1605000	1607000	the, um, 3G ones, so
1607000	1609000	I mean, that's kinda helpful, but
1609000	1611000	Yeah, I mean, I just can't use
1611000	1613000	3G, I don't know
1613000	1615000	Alright, if you're finally done
1615000	1617000	I'm done, sorry Alright, my gaming week
1617000	1619000	Quickly, before I talk video games, I need to talk
1619000	1621000	board games, because I went to a board game
1621000	1623000	party yesterday, it was actually a lot of fun, and I got to
1623000	1625000	play some new board games, and one of them that I really
1625000	1627000	really really really liked was called
1627000	1629000	Seven Wonders, so I'm sure some of you
1629000	1631000	board card game enthusiasts will know this game
1631000	1633000	and, um, you know, not that I think
1633000	1635000	they should turn every game into an
1635000	1637000	Xbox game, but some of them have worked rather
1637000	1639000	well, right? Like, um, you know, Ticket to Ride
1639000	1641000	and Catan and all that, right? So,
1641000	1643000	um, I would like to see Seven Wonders
1643000	1645000	because that was, I had a lot of fun playing that game
1645000	1647000	that was cool They have a game called Seven Wonders
1647000	1649000	it's just one of those, a match three games
1649000	1651000	Oh, that's not even the same thing
1651000	1653000	this is a more, it was kinda like
1653000	1655000	it actually, to me, felt, and
1655000	1657000	Alan made this comment too, like, the stages
1657000	1659000	of the game are similar to, like, civilization
1659000	1661000	it's resource
1661000	1663000	collecting, and then you can kinda
1663000	1665000	head yourself into technology
1665000	1667000	or military, or
1667000	1669000	like, what I would call cultural
1669000	1671000	types of points, you know, you can kinda
1671000	1673000	it's, it's either really inspired
1673000	1675000	by civilization or kinda right down that same line
1675000	1677000	but you know I love Civ, so I like
1677000	1679000	this game too
1679000	1681000	and, uh, some
1681000	1683000	other friends of ours came
1683000	1685000	over, we played Dominion again
1685000	1687000	which I think I've talked about that on the show, but that's a card game I really
1687000	1689000	enjoy, that would be really hard to pull
1689000	1691000	off on a console though, I think that's something you really have to play
1691000	1693000	in person because there's so many ways you can kinda mix and match
1693000	1695000	the different cards and the expansions and all that
1695000	1697000	so yeah, I've been playing, like
1697000	1699000	tangible games this week
1699000	1701000	crazy, video games though
1701000	1703000	haven't been short on those
1703000	1705000	last week I talked about how I have
1705000	1707000	suddenly, just
1707000	1709000	I wanna say out of the blue, but not really
1709000	1711000	like Shane from Hoard House
1711000	1713000	kinda, like, we'll just say
1713000	1715000	he berated me into playing these games
1715000	1717000	but it worked, the games are really good, Mass Effect, right?
1717000	1719000	I
1719000	1721000	beat Mass Effect 1
1721000	1723000	now, I realize a lot of you might be going
1723000	1725000	yay, golf clap
1725000	1727000	for you, you beat a game that came out
1727000	1729000	five years ago, but really think about
1729000	1731000	that statement if you've been listening to Orange House Radio
1731000	1733000	for any length of time
1733000	1735000	I had the attention span
1735000	1737000	to beat a game, playing it
1737000	1739000	start to finish, that is
1739000	1741000	a huge endorsement I think for the game
1741000	1743000	so yes, I beat Mass Effect, and what did I do
1743000	1745000	when I beat Mass Effect? I put in my
1745000	1747000	Mass Effect 2 disc that I picked up last week for
1747000	1749000	twenty bucks, and I started on Mass Effect 2
1749000	1751000	so I'm about nine hours
1751000	1753000	into Mass Effect 2
1753000	1755000	and now I'm going to go home and start
1755000	1757000	Mass Effect tomorrow
1757000	1759000	yes, and now Jamie is taking my Mass Effect on Xbox
1759000	1761000	and she said she's going to check it out
1761000	1763000	however, she understands
1763000	1765000	she hasn't until the time I beat
1765000	1767000	Mass Effect 3 to finish
1767000	1769000	it, because then I want to play Mass Effect 1
1769000	1771000	again as a renegade
1771000	1773000	and as a woman, so I can have
1773000	1775000	lesbian romance
1775000	1777000	I'm just going to start off as a woman, because I play every game as a woman
1777000	1779000	because, it's fun
1779000	1781000	so
1781000	1783000	have you played Saints Row the Third yet?
1783000	1785000	me? tons
1785000	1787000	no, I haven't, because we don't have
1787000	1789000	a system that I can play it on right now
1789000	1791000	unless someone would like to lend me a copy of it
1791000	1793000	don't you have, I have the
1793000	1795000	361 from you still, right, so
1795000	1797000	you want to borrow the 361? sure
1797000	1799000	alright, I'm going to give it to her
1799000	1801000	alright, I forgot you even had it
1801000	1803000	well there you go, alright
1803000	1805000	so
1805000	1807000	yeah, I've been playing Mass Effect 2
1807000	1809000	again, I don't know
1809000	1811000	how constructive it is for me to review
1811000	1813000	a game that's about 2 or 3 years old
1813000	1815000	but, what? one question from AcidicVampire
1815000	1817000	who did you choose to bang?
1817000	1819000	I did not bang anyone
1819000	1821000	in Mass Effect 1, because
1821000	1823000	I am waiting for Mass Effect 3
1823000	1825000	because I know who I want to bang
1825000	1827000	and I know that they're not bangable until the third game
1827000	1829000	so, let me put it
1829000	1831000	this way, I made a very
1831000	1833000	important choice, I'm keeping this
1833000	1835000	spoiler free, I made a very important choice
1835000	1837000	in the first game
1837000	1839000	that will set it up so that in the third game
1839000	1841000	this person will be around
1841000	1843000	for me to bang, and I will bang them
1843000	1845000	lots
1845000	1847000	so that's, I'll just
1847000	1849000	leave it at that
1849000	1851000	let's see, what else
1851000	1853000	now I'm off track here, oh yeah, Mass Effect 2
1853000	1855000	the game's a few years old, but
1855000	1857000	it's, it's, it's really good
1857000	1859000	it's really, like the story, everything
1859000	1861000	is like, just a step up
1861000	1863000	in the storytelling and in the voice acting
1863000	1865000	and everything, like it's not that the first game was bad
1865000	1867000	but the second game is just even more, I have like
1867000	1869000	laughed out loud at the game
1869000	1871000	there's a particular character I just got
1871000	1873000	into my little squad that, like, literally
1873000	1875000	made me laugh out loud with what they were saying
1875000	1877000	it was, it was, it's awesome
1877000	1879000	the graphics
1879000	1881000	are a step up
1881000	1883000	they got rid of the Mako stuff
1883000	1885000	thank god, planet scanning's
1885000	1887000	a little derpy, that gets a little bit old
1887000	1889000	really fast, but whatever, the hacking's
1889000	1891000	better, the combat
1891000	1893000	I'm still, I still have
1893000	1895000	mixed feelings on, like I know a lot of people
1895000	1897000	generally agree that combat in 2
1897000	1899000	is better than combat in 1, but
1899000	1901000	I will agree it's more fast paced
1901000	1903000	because you can kind of map skills to buttons
1903000	1905000	so you don't have to bring up the menu
1905000	1907000	and you can kind of do things that way, but
1907000	1909000	I don't know, like, I kind of find, I don't like the way
1909000	1911000	that, just, enemies keep coming out
1911000	1913000	in waves and waves and waves
1913000	1915000	and you're kind of just, like, stuck in one spot
1915000	1917000	gunning them all down
1917000	1919000	at least that's the way I kind of find them doing it
1919000	1921000	just kind of gunning them all down until the way's finally over
1921000	1923000	and you can kind of move into the next room
1923000	1925000	like, I feel like the first game kind of made you
1925000	1927000	it was a little more Metal Gear in the way that
1927000	1929000	the enemies didn't just run out until they actually
1929000	1931000	saw you, so I
1931000	1933000	kind of, like, it made the
1933000	1935000	conflicts a little more consistent
1935000	1937000	but don't take that
1937000	1939000	as a harsh gripe on the game, I mean, it's a
1939000	1941000	really minor bitch, it doesn't take away
1941000	1943000	from the experience of the story
1943000	1945000	that I'm really, really, really enjoying
1945000	1947000	so
1947000	1949000	there you go
1949000	1951000	um, let's see
1951000	1953000	uh
1953000	1955000	what else have I been playing, what other game I want to mention
1955000	1957000	uh, on the Vita
1957000	1959000	ModNation Racers Road Trip
1959000	1961000	I played on the Vita for a little bit
1961000	1963000	it's okay
1963000	1965000	you know, it is what it is, it's the
1965000	1967000	PlayStation 3 version condensed down for the Vita
1967000	1969000	the graphics and everything
1969000	1971000	are, you know, pretty good
1971000	1973000	they look like they do on the PlayStation 3
1973000	1975000	the track editor
1975000	1977000	I was very impressed that it's pretty much all there
1977000	1979000	you can import all the stuff
1979000	1981000	from the PlayStation, which is pretty impressive
1981000	1983000	and, you know, you can, therefore
1983000	1985000	build up a pretty, pretty good library
1985000	1987000	of stuff, the only problem with
1987000	1989000	ModNation Racers is
1989000	1991000	they stripped out everything
1991000	1993000	online about the game
1993000	1995000	the only thing you can do online on the Vita
1995000	1997000	version is, like, have ghost racers
1997000	1999000	and you can download other people's tracks
1999000	2001000	but you can't do races online
2001000	2003000	which is kind of an
2003000	2005000	important element of custom
2005000	2007000	it's because a lot of these games
2007000	2009000	are just not able to do
2009000	2011000	that's why you get a lot of this asynchronous
2011000	2013000	multiplayer garbage
2013000	2015000	I mean, you can do ad hoc
2015000	2017000	in the same room, and do it that way
2017000	2019000	but it just, I don't know
2019000	2021000	it really feels lacking
2021000	2023000	and I'm kind of sitting here going
2023000	2025000	this racing game gets kind of basic
2025000	2027000	after you play it for a while
2027000	2029000	like, yeah, there's some interesting
2029000	2031000	power-ups and things they do, but
2031000	2033000	I mean, at the end of the day, I'm just like
2033000	2035000	this game gets kind of old
2035000	2037000	so, I mean, at least
2037000	2039000	it's only 30 bucks, I rented it through
2039000	2041000	I have an account with a game rental
2041000	2043000	company, and so I got it through a rental
2043000	2045000	but I think it's a worthy
2045000	2047000	rental, I don't know if I would pay 30 bucks
2047000	2049000	for it, if you really like racers
2049000	2051000	I'm sure you're getting a lot of objects for it
2051000	2053000	through the, you know, passing
2053000	2055000	I need some, check into Nier while you're here
2055000	2057000	because I need some of those objects
2057000	2059000	so, you know
2059000	2061000	we're going to talk about this later, because there's a story
2061000	2063000	coming up about LittleBigPlanet
2063000	2065000	Kart or whatever
2065000	2067000	I kind of, you know, everyone
2067000	2069000	the trailer looks cool, but it kind of
2069000	2071000	made my heart sink when I heard
2071000	2073000	by the creators of ModNation Racism
2073000	2075000	like, ugh
2075000	2077000	because their load time is fucking terrible
2077000	2079000	Yeah, the load time's really bad
2079000	2081000	but see, I
2081000	2083000	I was really surprised
2083000	2085000	at how much the online
2085000	2087000	piece being missing really hurt
2087000	2089000	the game, because I wouldn't call
2089000	2091000	the one on the Playstation 3 a basic bitch
2091000	2093000	tracer, because the community
2093000	2095000	element kind of saves it
2095000	2097000	because there really is just a
2097000	2099000	stronger sense of community in the Playstation
2099000	2101000	3 one, and you can really get these random
2101000	2103000	organic experiences
2103000	2105000	in the Playstation 3 one that just feel
2105000	2107000	very forced and very
2107000	2109000	vanilla on the Vita one, and that's
2109000	2111000	the problem with it. I mean, it's
2111000	2113000	impressive that they otherwise got
2113000	2115000	most of the Playstation 3 one
2115000	2117000	in there, I hope
2117000	2119000	LittleBigPlanet didn't get neutered this way
2119000	2121000	but then again, LittleBigPlanet, you could
2121000	2123000	play LittleBigPlanet online, but it wasn't as
2123000	2125000	key to that game
2125000	2127000	you know, I think LittleBigPlanet Vita will be alright
2127000	2129000	See, here's my question though, is if they
2129000	2131000	if they did that, though
2131000	2133000	you know, if it's really neutered, I guess
2133000	2135000	on the Vita version, do you
2135000	2137000	have the PSP version? Because I think
2137000	2139000	I got that as a PSP version
2139000	2141000	I'm wondering if it was neutered on there too
2141000	2143000	or if they had
2143000	2145000	online gameplay on the PSP one, but they're just
2145000	2147000	like, ehhh, the Vita
2147000	2149000	we're not gonna worry about writing netcode
2149000	2151000	God, that's work, so let's just
2151000	2153000	forget about it. Nah, I haven't played the
2153000	2155000	PSP one, or if I did, it was a long time ago
2155000	2157000	so I don't remember. Maybe they have some sort of
2157000	2159000	weird like, stipulation where you
2159000	2161000	can only have
2161000	2163000	multiplayer like, um, in your
2163000	2165000	game if you can play it over the 3G
2165000	2167000	or something, because I know only
2167000	2169000	right now there's two games that
2169000	2171000	have actual, well, three games
2171000	2173000	that actually have online multiplayer
2173000	2175000	and those are all the ones that have online passes
2175000	2177000	the Hotshots, Golf, Wipeout
2177000	2179000	and MLB 12
2179000	2181000	are the only games
2181000	2183000	I don't know if Unit 13 does
2183000	2185000	I don't think that did though
2185000	2187000	but those are the three
2187000	2189000	and possibly four games that I know of
2189000	2191000	right now that actually have, you know,
2191000	2193000	multiplayer. Um, now
2193000	2195000	I'll say this, I don't want to
2195000	2197000	totally bash out Monday's Racers because I don't think
2197000	2199000	it's a bad game necessarily, and
2199000	2201000	we have to remember it's a launch title
2201000	2203000	and for a launch title, it's surprisingly
2203000	2205000	decent
2205000	2207000	you know, I say that, you know, it's a
2207000	2209000	strong launch title for
2209000	2211000	the Vita, but it's not as
2211000	2213000	strong as say, Luminous
2213000	2215000	there's some of the other choices that are out there
2215000	2217000	um, or what also kind of
2217000	2219000	shoots this game in the foot a little bit is that
2219000	2221000	I have to say that free MotorStorm
2221000	2223000	game they put out last week
2223000	2225000	it's kind of a
2225000	2227000	better racing experience for me
2227000	2229000	I mean, maybe because it was free, but
2229000	2231000	and it was more like Ironman
2231000	2233000	off-road racing
2233000	2235000	which I really enjoy that style, but
2235000	2237000	well, see, the thing is, like, I'm kind of
2237000	2239000	embracing a little bit more of the
2239000	2241000	online, or not even online, some of the
2241000	2243000	digital stuff now
2243000	2245000	um, thanks to some of these offerings
2245000	2247000	the fact that, well, the fact that the Michael Jackson
2247000	2249000	game was free was kind of fun, but um,
2249000	2251000	you know, the, the
2251000	2253000	MotorStorm game is pretty awesome, and
2253000	2255000	I'm actually thinking of thinning out
2255000	2257000	my collection, because I have four games right now
2257000	2259000	in cart form, and I'm probably
2259000	2261000	gonna, well, Lil Deviance is gone
2261000	2263000	I mean, that game looked like terrible, terrible shit
2263000	2265000	um, and actually
2265000	2267000	Rayman, um, Origins
2267000	2269000	I'm probably gonna get rid of, because
2269000	2271000	I'm just not playing it, not that it's
2271000	2273000	a terrible game, it's not a terrible game at all
2273000	2275000	it's an awesome game, but it's just
2275000	2277000	I'm not finding myself playing, or
2277000	2279000	wanting to play that game, so, I don't know
2279000	2281000	uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com
2281000	2283000	I'm just now catching up
2283000	2285000	on some of the, uh, comments from chat
2285000	2287000	AcidicVampire says, the characters
2287000	2289000	in Mass Effect 2 are some of the best
2289000	2291000	characters in any video game
2291000	2293000	you know what, I gotta say
2293000	2295000	although I haven't played enough of
2295000	2297000	Mass Effect 2 to really say
2297000	2299000	that's true or that's false, I
2299000	2301000	can see so far where that is
2301000	2303000	probably a true statement
2303000	2305000	because there is some strong characters in
2305000	2307000	part 2, like even, and it's
2307000	2309000	it's so funny I'm sitting here saying that, because
2309000	2311000	as I keep saying this about 2, I feel like I'm
2311000	2313000	bashing 1, but I'm
2313000	2315000	not, it's just that 1 set the bar
2315000	2317000	pretty high, and 2 actually
2317000	2319000	exceeds it, in almost
2319000	2321000	every area, so
2321000	2323000	pretty neat
2323000	2325000	and Shane says, picks
2325000	2327000	of Kaiden put him over to actually trying
2327000	2329000	the series out, that may or may not
2329000	2331000	be true, just saying
2331000	2333000	I deny these allegations
2333000	2335000	alright, that's enough about our
2335000	2337000	gaming weeks, let's get into some gaming news

2377000	2379000	let's get into gaming news, Loki
2379000	2381000	well, there's rumors that Sony is
2381000	2383000	shutting down one of their first party
2383000	2385000	developers, Zipper Interactive
2385000	2387000	who just put out the
2387000	2389000	Evita game, Unit 13
2389000	2391000	um, they may be
2391000	2393000	gone, um, apparently
2393000	2395000	there's been some chatter for several days
2395000	2397000	about an impending closure
2397000	2399000	and the possibility of cancellations
2399000	2401000	of a current project
2401000	2403000	of course Sony hasn't made a comment on it
2403000	2405000	and besides, you know, Unit 13
2405000	2407000	they're of course the ones behind
2407000	2409000	SOCOM, US Navy Seals, and
2409000	2411000	MAG, so they
2411000	2413000	kind of know they're shooters
2413000	2415000	but, I don't know
2415000	2417000	maybe is this because they can't really compete
2417000	2419000	with, say, Call of Duty
2419000	2421000	or Battlefield, maybe this is why they're
2421000	2423000	kind of letting them go, and I don't know, restructuring
2423000	2425000	who knows
2425000	2427000	hmm, well
2427000	2429000	it's never good to hear about Studios
2429000	2431000	Closing, but
2431000	2433000	I mean, wasn't SOCOM still a pretty
2433000	2435000	strong series, or did I miss something?
2435000	2437000	Um, I don't know how well SOCOM
2437000	2439000	4 did, um
2439000	2441000	I would have thought that they would have
2441000	2443000	you know, tried to, well maybe
2443000	2445000	they tried with MAG, maybe that was the whole thing
2445000	2447000	is, um, you know, they were trying to
2447000	2449000	you know, do something with that, but
2449000	2451000	maybe it just didn't really
2451000	2453000	work out, also
2453000	2455000	also, but it also is a rumor
2455000	2457000	also, the other thing
2457000	2459000	might have kind of hurt SOCOM 4
2459000	2461000	was the fact that SOCOM 4 launched right
2461000	2463000	before the whole Playstation Network
2463000	2465000	black out there. Oh, that's right
2465000	2467000	I thought I remembered there was something
2467000	2469000	that kind of like about SOCOM 4
2469000	2471000	that was like, iffy in the community
2471000	2473000	that's right, that's what it was
2473000	2475000	the fact that it came out the week they took
2475000	2477000	the network down for like a month
2477000	2479000	yeah, that probably didn't help
2479000	2481000	no, but interesting
2481000	2483000	that all this time later, something
2483000	2485000	happens. I'm also surprised
2485000	2487000	if that, in spite of that, they didn't try to
2487000	2489000	relaunch SOCOM for the holidays
2489000	2491000	or maybe they did, and I just, you know, that's not usually
2491000	2493000	a series I follow, so, but I
2493000	2495000	I'm surprised there wouldn't be like a SOCOM 4
2495000	2497000	game of the year edition
2497000	2499000	since that's what they're all called
2499000	2501000	or SOCOM 4 Platinum Guns edition
2501000	2503000	or something, that comes out at the end of the year
2503000	2505000	to try and relaunch it. I'm surprised
2505000	2507000	too, I mean, um
2507000	2509000	I don't know, I didn't think SOCOM 4
2509000	2511000	is a bad game, it, I think it got
2511000	2513000	pretty good reviews, it's just
2513000	2515000	um, I don't know
2515000	2517000	maybe it's just not enough room right now
2517000	2519000	maybe they're focusing on something else
2519000	2521000	maybe, maybe, maybe they're just getting rid
2521000	2523000	of these guys because they're going to have someone else working on SOCOM
2523000	2525000	who knows, maybe, um
2525000	2527000	you know, I don't know who, um
2527000	2529000	you know, the team behind resistance, what
2529000	2531000	they're working on right now, maybe they're going to be working
2531000	2533000	on a new SOCOM game or something like that
2533000	2535000	or kill, the team behind Killzone
2535000	2537000	you know, maybe they're free now, because Killzone
2537000	2539000	I don't know, well actually
2539000	2541000	Killzone might do alright
2541000	2543000	I think that if they went the route
2543000	2545000	of, with SOCOM that they
2545000	2547000	did with, just recently with Killzone 3
2547000	2549000	where they released a multiplayer
2549000	2551000	kind of, as free and then had people play
2551000	2553000	it and then you can, you know, kind of
2553000	2555000	free to play almost, with uh
2555000	2557000	you know, where you pay 15 bucks if you want to play the full
2557000	2559000	um, or level up fully
2559000	2561000	I think that might be a way to go with SOCOM
2561000	2563000	because, you know, actually free to
2563000	2565000	play would be perfect for a lot of games
2565000	2567000	but, it might help it out
2567000	2569000	especially since people like military first person shooters
2569000	2571000	and free is an awesome
2571000	2573000	amount of money for something
2573000	2575000	alright, well we'll see
2575000	2577000	what develops with that over the next
2577000	2579000	few months, I'm sure by E3 we'll see
2579000	2581000	what they're up to or not
2581000	2583000	um, meanwhile over in
2583000	2585000	Xbox territory there is yet another
2585000	2587000	arcade promotion going on
2587000	2589000	so it seems like Xbox
2589000	2591000	Microsoft and all of them have found success
2591000	2593000	in these, you know, summer of arcade
2593000	2595000	what's the winner one called? Block Party
2595000	2597000	right, so
2597000	2599000	since it's so successful, let's do it quarterly
2599000	2601000	let's do another one, alright, so now we have
2601000	2603000	Arcade Next starts
2603000	2605000	on April 18th
2605000	2607000	gotta say though, there are some pretty big
2607000	2609000	you know, titles here, Trials Evolution
2609000	2611000	is the first one, that is actually really big
2611000	2613000	I mean, you saw what their, Trials is a big
2613000	2615000	deal right, well yeah, but the level editor
2615000	2617000	in this thing is like little big planet-esque
2617000	2619000	I mean, it's like, you can make all
2619000	2621000	sorts of things, people made first person shooters
2621000	2623000	using that level editor
2623000	2625000	Bloodforge on April 25th
2625000	2627000	Fable Heroes on
2627000	2629000	May 2nd, now that is not the
2629000	2631000	it's not on Rails Fable, that's the
2631000	2633000	Mario Party Fable, right? That looks alright
2633000	2635000	it's kind of like a little bit Mario Party
2635000	2637000	crossed with Castle
2637000	2639000	Crashers, I guess, alright
2639000	2641000	interesting, and then
2641000	2643000	obviously this is the huge one
2643000	2645000	the big one, May 9th, Minecraft
2645000	2647000	is gonna be 1600
2647000	2649000	Microsoft points and
2649000	2651000	it should be noted too that because
2651000	2653000	of the recent change in the gamerscore
2653000	2655000	for Arcade, all of these games
2655000	2657000	will now offer the 400 gamerscore
2657000	2659000	it's not gonna be, cause April's the month
2659000	2661000	they're starting that, right? So all these
2661000	2663000	games will now have, you know, 400
2663000	2665000	gamerscore instead of 200 available
2665000	2667000	to you. I mean, I'd like to try
2667000	2669000	Minecraft out, you know, again
2669000	2671000	Yeah, I kinda wanna give
2671000	2673000	Minecraft a second chance, I don't really wanna
2673000	2675000	pay 1600 points for it, only to be
2675000	2677000	as, if I'm disappointed
2677000	2679000	in it, but all the Xbox
2679000	2681000	yeah, they come with demos, so I'll
2681000	2683000	let everybody cross your fingers
2683000	2685000	that the Minecraft one's really good
2685000	2687000	cause I wanna give it another chance
2687000	2689000	I do, so we'll see
2689000	2691000	I am kinda curious about Trials, I kinda skipped the first
2691000	2693000	one, but it sounds interesting
2693000	2695000	they showed another one, there was a picture I saw
2695000	2697000	where, I think it was the devs that did
2697000	2699000	Limbo, did a level that looks
2699000	2701000	like Limbo in Trials
2701000	2703000	That's awesome
2703000	2705000	I do wanna point out the price of the
2705000	2707000	other games, Fable Heroes will be 800
2707000	2709000	points, that's about 10 bucks, all the others
2709000	2711000	Evolution Bloodforge, 15 bucks
2711000	2713000	So that's the pricing for those games
2713000	2715000	Now what we haven't heard about, I have
2715000	2717000	not heard anything about what you get
2717000	2719000	if you buy all four games, because remember
2719000	2721000	that was an important part of the promotion
2721000	2723000	for Block Party and Summer of Arcade
2723000	2725000	is like, buy all four, get
2725000	2727000	400 points in the mail or something
2727000	2729000	like that, right, or get 1200 points
2729000	2731000	or get a game for free, you know
2731000	2733000	depending on what promotion it is, but yet
2733000	2735000	I'm not hearing anything with this
2735000	2737000	So this is just straight up a
2737000	2739000	send out
2739000	2741000	a press release to all the gaming sites and get
2741000	2743000	the games or exposure, right
2743000	2745000	Get an ad in the magazines
2745000	2747000	It's still a while away, I mean they could always
2747000	2749000	announce something, that's true, there may be something coming out
2749000	2751000	later, even if
2751000	2753000	it's something derpy like
2753000	2755000	something for your, I keep wanting to say
2755000	2757000	your me, but for your
2757000	2759000	avatar, like a little next shirt
2759000	2761000	or something, I mean even if they throw something
2761000	2763000	like that in there, there'll be people that
2763000	2765000	give it a shot just to have that
2765000	2767000	you know, so we'll see
2767000	2769000	Not very many people, but
2769000	2771000	there will be people
2771000	2773000	Never know, Derek H in chat
2773000	2775000	says, does that mean Minecraft is the highest
2775000	2777000	price Xbox Live arcade game
2777000	2779000	ever? No, the penny arcade
2779000	2781000	game was also $1600
2781000	2783000	I think there's a couple of those too
2783000	2785000	Well, some of them you may consider
2785000	2787000	Xbox Live Arcade and some you may not
2787000	2789000	Remember, some games are released not as
2789000	2791000	Xbox Live Arcade, but as actually
2791000	2793000	those games on demand because they don't fit
2793000	2795000	within the
2795000	2797000	you know, constraints of the file size
2797000	2799000	True, and one could argue that
2799000	2801000	you know, a game that didn't get
2801000	2803000	released here, like wasn't there that Japanese
2803000	2805000	import shooter that you could
2805000	2807000	only get through on demand
2807000	2809000	Right? Well, there was
2809000	2811000	original Crysis, two Crysis I think
2811000	2813000	it was HD or something like that, they had
2813000	2815000	come out, I don't remember if that was
2815000	2817000	20 bucks, I think it was at least 20 bucks
2817000	2819000	Yeah, but I mean
2819000	2821000	if you wanna count just strictly what's
2821000	2823000	in the category of XBLA
2823000	2825000	then it ties for most
2825000	2827000	expensive game ever, yes
2827000	2829000	Don't get me wrong, they're probably gonna try to
2829000	2831000	inch that up a little bit, but
2831000	2833000	Yeah, there might be DLC that'll bump it
2833000	2835000	up a little, especially in a game like Minecraft
2835000	2837000	it's possible
2837000	2839000	the question is, will they go there?
2839000	2841000	So, alright, let's move on
2841000	2843000	Dark Sakura
2843000	2845000	Well, we've discussed this till we
2845000	2847000	were blue in the face, but
2847000	2849000	Effect 3
2849000	2851000	We don't like the ending
2851000	2853000	Well
2853000	2855000	BioWare's listening
2855000	2857000	I don't know why, but they're listening
2857000	2859000	and
2859000	2861000	the co-founder Ray
2861000	2863000	and I always mispronounce his name, Musica
2863000	2865000	has said that they are
2865000	2867000	actually going to work to
2867000	2869000	answer those open-ended questions and give
2869000	2871000	closure to the fans
2871000	2873000	and describe
2873000	2875000	the fan feedback as
2875000	2877000	incredibly painful
2877000	2879000	So basically everyone
2879000	2881000	bitched and they're putting out some DLC
2881000	2883000	to
2883000	2885000	I guess expand more on
2885000	2887000	the ending, but he's saying
2887000	2889000	and this is a quote, our first instinct is to defend
2889000	2891000	the work and point out the high ratings offered
2891000	2893000	by critics, let you critics know
2893000	2895000	but out of respect to our
2895000	2897000	fans, we need to accept the criticism
2897000	2899000	and feedback with humility
2899000	2901000	So they're basically
2901000	2903000	they're like, uh, well
2903000	2905000	sorry you didn't like it, we're not gonna
2905000	2907000	change that much about it, but maybe you'll like this
2907000	2909000	That's
2909000	2911000	what I can tell
2911000	2913000	I guess the only thing
2913000	2915000	to do is wait and see
2915000	2917000	I think it's a terrible idea
2917000	2919000	I've calmed down
2919000	2921000	a little bit on the idea
2921000	2923000	I still don't think this excuses
2923000	2925000	certain behaviors of certain people
2925000	2927000	on the internet, namely those that are
2927000	2929000	harassing the employees of BioWare
2929000	2931000	that's totally fucking unacceptable
2931000	2933000	I don't give a fuck how much you've spent
2933000	2935000	or invested in the Mass Effect series
2935000	2937000	some of the vile shit I've read on the
2937000	2939000	internet about the creators of the
2939000	2941000	games, like seriously
2941000	2943000	fuck off
2943000	2945000	those people need to
2945000	2947000	and I mean this
2947000	2949000	they need to get a life
2949000	2951000	like, they literally need a life
2953000	2955000	and the guy
2955000	2957000	who took it to the government and all this
2957000	2959000	stuff, that was ridiculous
2959000	2961000	the whole, I don't think this is on the show
2961000	2963000	roll later, so the whole using
2963000	2965000	Child's Play
2965000	2967000	I think went a little bit far
2967000	2969000	I think maybe somebody was good intentioned
2969000	2971000	with that whole thing, but at the end
2971000	2973000	of the day, people were calling Child's Play
2973000	2975000	saying, how much do I have to donate
2975000	2977000	to get the ending changed?
2977000	2979000	And Child's Play's like, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
2979000	2981000	whoa
2981000	2983000	What are we here?
2983000	2985000	Are we an organization that's supposed to
2985000	2987000	help you get
2987000	2989000	your beef with game publishers
2989000	2991000	resolved? Or are we an organization
2991000	2993000	trying to bring joy into sick children's
2993000	2995000	lives? And so they
2995000	2997000	came out with a clarification that if you do a
2997000	2999000	fundraiser for Child's Play, Child's Play
2999000	3001000	is the cause, there is to be no
3001000	3003000	other cause, Child's Play is the cause, and I say
3003000	3005000	bravo to that
3005000	3007000	Now
3007000	3009000	I'm not as harsh on that because I realize there might
3009000	3011000	have been good intentions there
3011000	3013000	but unfortunately some people
3013000	3015000	aren't smart
3015000	3017000	I don't know how else to put it
3017000	3019000	But like what you just said
3019000	3021000	and this is why I'm
3021000	3023000	just scared of what this kind of
3023000	3025000	precedent says. How much money do I
3025000	3027000	have to pay for them to change the ending?
3027000	3029000	And that right there
3029000	3031000	How much money do I have to pay for them to
3031000	3033000	change the ending? Really? Are people
3033000	3035000	actually asking that question? Funny enough
3035000	3037000	Go ahead, Jamie. I was gonna say
3037000	3039000	that right there is America
3039000	3041000	And I was gonna say, funny enough,
3041000	3043000	Loki, that's the part where
3043000	3045000	I become okay with this because although I've been
3045000	3047000	bashing all these things, I realize the vast
3047000	3049000	majority of people out there
3049000	3051000	that, you know, probably went to go
3051000	3053000	click like on the page or have said a nasty
3053000	3055000	tweet about, God that ending sucked or whatever
3055000	3057000	I realize the vast majority of those people
3057000	3059000	aren't, like, insane, like some of the
3059000	3061000	other people I just mentioned
3061000	3063000	But, you know, if they're gonna
3063000	3065000	put it out there, like, if BioWare does
3065000	3067000	a DLC ending, I will buy it and I will
3067000	3069000	support it, I'm kinda like
3069000	3071000	alright, then fine
3071000	3073000	At least you'll have the choice
3073000	3075000	if you want to invest that money or not
3075000	3077000	And it's like, if people want to buy it
3077000	3079000	then fine. It's a weird
3079000	3081000	weird precedent, and we were just
3081000	3083000	talking about this a little bit with Bobby before us
3083000	3085000	here tonight, and I was mentioning
3085000	3087000	about Final Fantasy 7
3087000	3089000	A lot of people hated that ending
3089000	3091000	too, and if that game came out today
3091000	3093000	a lot of people were probably doing the same thing
3093000	3095000	Like, wow, two of the characters were just fucking
3095000	3097000	missing in the ending. But, once again
3097000	3099000	though, it's so what that ending had
3099000	3101000	So what if it was a terrible ending for Final Fantasy 7?
3101000	3103000	People bought Final Fantasy 8
3103000	3105000	People bought Final Fantasy 9
3105000	3107000	People bought Final Fantasy 10, they bought 10 too
3107000	3109000	They probably bought 11
3109000	3111000	They bought 12, they bought 13
3111000	3113000	Did it really hurt
3113000	3115000	the sales of those because they didn't like the game?
3115000	3117000	Now, Loki, nobody bought Final Fantasy 11
3117000	3119000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, don't send the hate mail
3119000	3121000	But there were a lot of Final Fantasy
3121000	3123000	fans that did
3123000	3125000	reject 11, but there were enough that embraced
3125000	3127000	it that gave us 14
3127000	3129000	When that shit goes free to play
3129000	3131000	When that shit goes free to play, watch how many
3131000	3133000	fans reject that
3133000	3135000	Anyway, back to the topic here
3135000	3137000	DLC is something
3137000	3139000	that is in the industry now
3139000	3141000	that we didn't have so many years ago
3141000	3143000	and in a way, EA being
3143000	3145000	one of the biggest DLC whores
3145000	3147000	in this industry, kinda
3147000	3149000	has themselves to blame for this mindset
3149000	3151000	that they can fix the ending
3151000	3153000	through a patch, or they can fix the ending through
3153000	3155000	DLC. EA kind of
3155000	3157000	invented that mess
3157000	3159000	Well, maybe they didn't invent it, but they perfected
3159000	3161000	it, let's say. They did start the
3161000	3163000	online pass, did they not?
3163000	3165000	So they've figured out how to milk all the extra
3165000	3167000	dollars for a video game, so in that capacity
3167000	3169000	EA kinda has
3169000	3171000	themselves to blame for the fan backlash
3171000	3173000	because if this were 10 years ago
3173000	3175000	fans wouldn't be saying
3175000	3177000	this because there wouldn't really be anything they could do
3177000	3179000	about it. They would have to just, you know,
3179000	3181000	write on their live journals
3181000	3183000	I don't like the ending. What they should do is just fucking
3183000	3185000	shut the hell up, and
3185000	3187000	get over it, because you know why?
3187000	3189000	They're like, oh, well I spent
3189000	3191000	how many hours playing this
3191000	3193000	series, and I'm so
3193000	3195000	disappointed at the ending. Fuck you!
3195000	3197000	The developers spent how many fucking years
3197000	3199000	putting these games together for you?
3199000	3201000	You know, what about
3201000	3203000	their time? Well,
3203000	3205000	devil's advocate, I'm not
3205000	3207000	agreeing or disagreeing with you, but just to give you another perspective
3207000	3209000	that's on the internet, there's a lot of talk on the
3209000	3211000	internet that the ending was changed at the last
3211000	3213000	minute, and that the writers of
3213000	3215000	the original ending were basically shafted
3215000	3217000	because I guess there was a leak
3217000	3219000	that had ruined it, or I mean
3219000	3221000	I wasn't following the Mass Effect series then, so I don't know
3221000	3223000	much about this, I'm just hearing it second hand,
3223000	3225000	but I guess there was a leak that spoiled the first ending
3225000	3227000	so the creator kind of
3227000	3229000	made this new ending
3229000	3231000	if the
3231000	3233000	internet is to be believed, literally pulled it
3233000	3235000	out of his ass, and that's the ending
3235000	3237000	we have, because they wanted
3237000	3239000	to get back at the spoiled leak, I
3239000	3241000	guess.
3241000	3243000	That doesn't make any sense.
3243000	3245000	Just saying.
3245000	3247000	And also, like, I take, you know,
3247000	3249000	I have a problem with the fact that
3249000	3251000	all these people hate it, and
3251000	3253000	like, you know, the game reviews and stuff, and granted, everyone
3253000	3255000	is, you know,
3255000	3257000	open to their own opinion, but
3257000	3259000	a lot of the game reviews have been really positive
3259000	3261000	for it. I didn't hear anyone
3261000	3263000	saying- Why's there not letting a 15 minute ending, or
3263000	3265000	even if it's an hour ending, ruin
3265000	3267000	what is otherwise- Exactly!
3267000	3269000	That's how everybody should take it, instead of just
3269000	3271000	being so god damn focused on
3271000	3273000	the last 15 minutes of the game.
3275000	3277000	Sg100Matt has some pretty strong words in our chatroom
3277000	3279000	at chat.orangelandraday.com
3279000	3281000	Let the artist paint the picture and write the
3281000	3283000	image they want. Gamers aren't
3283000	3285000	entitled to nothing. Just sit back and enjoy
3285000	3287000	the ride. If you don't like the ride, get the fuck
3287000	3289000	off it. Exactly! And you don't have to
3289000	3291000	purchase the next game, but see, I think that's why they did it.
3291000	3293000	Two reasons. One, so they could possibly
3293000	3295000	sell more DLC, because, you know,
3295000	3297000	the publisher's like, yeah, yeah, you
3297000	3299000	should make a new ending. We'll give you a little
3299000	3301000	bit of money, and we're gonna make a lot of money in
3301000	3303000	return. And it, you know, appeases
3303000	3305000	the fans so that when Mass Effect 4
3305000	3307000	comes out, because you know there will be a Mass Effect 4,
3307000	3309000	that they will buy it.
3311000	3313000	I just think this whole sense of entitlement
3313000	3315000	thing that's going on in this country
3315000	3317000	is probably the most ridiculous thing
3317000	3319000	to ever happen. It's a truly
3319000	3321000	modern phenomenon, and
3321000	3323000	people really need to get over themselves
3323000	3325000	and realize that, you know,
3325000	3327000	it not being what you want
3327000	3329000	or not getting what you want doesn't mean
3329000	3331000	that it's a complete affront to you
3331000	3333000	in particular. You know, that it's
3333000	3335000	they're doing this on purpose!
3335000	3337000	You know.
3337000	3339000	Stop being a baby.
3339000	3341000	If people are suggesting that they would
3341000	3343000	troll the fans because
3343000	3345000	one of the endings leaked, that doesn't
3345000	3347000	make any sense at all, because
3347000	3349000	if there's a leak coming from your company,
3349000	3351000	it's from within your company. Why would
3351000	3353000	you, well damn those fans, they
3353000	3355000	know my ending, I'm gonna make a terrible ending
3355000	3357000	instead! That'll show them, they'll
3357000	3359000	see that it's completely different and that
3359000	3361000	there's no possible way that it was a leak.
3361000	3363000	I mean, that makes no sense.
3363000	3365000	That sounds like fanboy speculation.
3365000	3367000	It's going to be interesting very
3367000	3369000	much to see the impact that this has
3369000	3371000	on an inevitable Mass Effect 4.
3371000	3373000	And yes, fans, I realize
3373000	3375000	that apparently they have
3375000	3377000	said there's not gonna be any more Mass Effect,
3377000	3379000	but seriously, you
3379000	3381000	can fucking believe that, seriously.
3381000	3383000	Yeah, there wasn't gonna be any
3383000	3385000	more Halo after Halo 3 either.
3385000	3387000	You know, they'll
3387000	3389000	find a way to do Mass Effect 4.
3389000	3391000	It may not be called Mass Effect 4.
3391000	3393000	The series will
3393000	3395000	continue. It's too fucking big
3395000	3397000	to not.
3397000	3399000	It might not be Bioware, so you
3399000	3401000	may really not want it to happen, but it'll happen.
3401000	3403000	Somebody will do it.
3403000	3405000	So, anyhow,
3405000	3407000	why don't we move on?
3407000	3409000	We can probably talk about this all night, and I'm sure we'll
3409000	3411000	get some emails and calls on it later.
3411000	3413000	Mailbag at orangeonshady.com if you want to send your
3413000	3415000	thoughts, or we'll open up the phones later in the show.
3415000	3417000	But for now, how about some more stories? Loki.
3417000	3419000	Yeah, so, Disney
3419000	3421000	Interactive announced Disney's epic Mickey 2.
3421000	3423000	The Power of 2.
3423000	3425000	Um...
3425000	3427000	I was really hoping for The Power of Love, but
3427000	3429000	you know, that's...
3429000	3431000	It sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.
3431000	3433000	The Power of 2.
3433000	3435000	The Power of 2.
3435000	3437000	Um, you know, as all the
3437000	3439000	kind of, um,
3439000	3441000	rumors were, uh, it actually
3441000	3443000	is gonna feature both Mickey Mouse
3443000	3445000	and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.
3445000	3447000	And, um, Oswald's
3447000	3449000	gonna be AI controlled. Um,
3449000	3451000	of course,
3451000	3453000	when other people are not around. Otherwise, it's, you
3453000	3455000	know, I guess it's jump-in
3455000	3457000	co-op, so that's kinda cool.
3457000	3459000	And then it will also be on PlayStation
3459000	3461000	3 and Xbox 360
3461000	3463000	on top of the Wii version, and the
3463000	3465000	PS3 version is supposed to support the move, which makes sense
3465000	3467000	I mean, because they're just gonna port the controls over from the Wii
3467000	3469000	onto the PS3 version.
3469000	3471000	Um, it looks neat.
3471000	3473000	I watched the trailer for it. I mean, I didn't play the
3473000	3475000	original game, which is kind of, you know, a fault
3475000	3477000	on my part, because it looked
3477000	3479000	like a pretty awesome game. Um, maybe
3479000	3481000	I'll check it out, you know, on the 360
3481000	3483000	when it comes out. Um, I'm just glad
3483000	3485000	Disney Interactive is making something, because
3485000	3487000	for a while there, they didn't have anything since
3487000	3489000	like, Disney Universe, and I was like,
3489000	3491000	damn, did they just go away or something?
3491000	3493000	I mean, I was getting worried,
3493000	3495000	but, um, well,
3495000	3497000	yeah, they had, uh, the split second
3497000	3499000	was, uh, is that?
3499000	3501000	Yeah, the split second was the Disney game.
3501000	3503000	And that studio got
3503000	3505000	obliterated, didn't it?
3505000	3507000	Yeah, that's unfortunate. There's another movie
3507000	3509000	tie-in game, Brave, has a movie coming up.
3509000	3511000	Okay, but you know,
3511000	3513000	I expect the kiddie games
3513000	3515000	to all get tie-ins. Those are usually the first
3515000	3517000	ones to have, like, the movie tie-in.
3517000	3519000	Well, there wasn't really anything for Twilight, unless you count
3519000	3521000	the scene at Twilight. Konami, way
3521000	3523000	to go, Konami. What in the fuck
3523000	3525000	would a Twilight video game be? Seriously,
3525000	3527000	I f- I can't believe
3527000	3529000	I'm about to admit this on the radio, but I
3529000	3531000	saw Breaking Dawn Part 1, it's the only
3531000	3533000	Twilight movie I've seen. In my
3533000	3535000	defense, in my
3535000	3537000	defense, put the hate mail down, in my
3537000	3539000	defense, it was with Rift
3539000	3541000	Tracks, which I think is the only- It was a party we hosted.
3541000	3543000	It was the only tolerable way to see. It is the
3543000	3545000	only way to see those movies. But my
3545000	3547000	God.
3547000	3549000	Where was the plot in that movie?
3549000	3551000	It was literally, like, 30
3551000	3553000	minutes of them fucking and
3553000	3555000	being on the beach, and like,
3555000	3557000	I love you, and I love-
3557000	3559000	we're gonna be together, and
3559000	3561000	I'm like, oh my God,
3561000	3563000	people paid a lot of money to see this in the
3563000	3565000	theater. You would pay $50
3565000	3567000	for a video game for Breaking
3567000	3569000	Dawn Part 1? The fuck
3569000	3571000	would you do? I would love
3571000	3573000	to see a game that was controlled
3573000	3575000	very much like Dragon's Lair.
3575000	3577000	It was just, like, left to right.
3577000	3579000	Be emo
3579000	3581000	to the left. Be emo to the right.
3581000	3583000	Sulk
3583000	3585000	to the right. Sulk to
3585000	3587000	the left.
3587000	3589000	Sparkle. Prevent
3589000	3591000	this wedding from becoming her hallucination
3591000	3593000	by pressing A repeatedly
3593000	3595000	to stop them from turning into vampires. I think it would
3595000	3597000	be kind of funny. I mean,
3597000	3599000	someone has to have the sense of humor to do that.
3599000	3601000	Ugh.
3601000	3603000	Anyhow.
3603000	3605000	Oh, and the 3DS
3605000	3607000	is getting the version as well.
3607000	3609000	Power of Illusion, which made me think of
3609000	3611000	Castle of Illusion, so maybe
3611000	3613000	that's a good sign?
3613000	3615000	Um, that is interesting.
3615000	3617000	Epic Mickey. We've known about
3617000	3619000	this for a while from some of the leaks. I know we've
3619000	3621000	talked about it on the show before, but putting
3621000	3623000	all that aside, are we
3623000	3625000	surprised it's actually happening?
3625000	3627000	Or no? Because Epic Mickey-
3627000	3629000	It sold well. Yeah? Yeah.
3629000	3631000	I guess maybe for those of us that
3631000	3633000	focus more on our 360s. It had a lot of neat
3633000	3635000	stuff in it. It did. I'm not saying it was
3635000	3637000	a bad game, but the Wii
3637000	3639000	only thing really kept it away from the hardcore.
3639000	3641000	Yeah, and see, that's kind of
3641000	3643000	that I think was the reason why
3643000	3645000	I didn't play the game, was remember the original
3645000	3647000	concept art for, you know,
3647000	3649000	Epic Mickey, where it's gonna be
3649000	3651000	really fucking twisted and dark. It was like
3651000	3653000	if, you know, not necessarily
3653000	3655000	Tim Burton, but like, you know,
3655000	3657000	Guillermo del Toro, like,
3657000	3659000	put out a version of Mickey Mouse that was
3659000	3661000	like fucking
3661000	3663000	the game, right there. It was just
3663000	3665000	really crazy and steampunk and all
3665000	3667000	this stuff. And then we got the version that
3667000	3669000	came out in the Wii, and they just kind of like
3669000	3671000	you know, kind of washed all that-
3671000	3673000	I mean, there was still a lot of dark stuff in there,
3673000	3675000	but it wasn't anywhere near like this
3675000	3677000	adult Mickey game that was supposed
3677000	3679000	to be coming out. It was kind of like, oh, it's
3679000	3681000	Mickey saving the land. Well, you can't
3681000	3683000	have a truly adult
3683000	3685000	Mickey game. Well, why
3685000	3687000	can't you have a- okay, let's put it
3687000	3689000	this way. Not an adult game, but a very
3689000	3691000	very dark, dark, dark,
3691000	3693000	dark, dark Mickey game. I think Epic
3693000	3695000	Mickey's about as dark as you're gonna get.
3695000	3697000	But, you know, it's the Disney image.
3697000	3699000	You don't want to associate Disney
3699000	3701000	with dark things. And I'm
3701000	3703000	talking the company and Mickey Mouse as a whole.
3703000	3705000	Disney does some
3705000	3707000	dark-ish- I mean, you could call
3707000	3709000	Alice in Wonderland a little bit dark.
3709000	3711000	Tron even is a little bit dark. Well, Kingdom
3711000	3713000	Hearts kind of goes a little bit dark with stuff.
3713000	3715000	But even Kingdom Hearts is a little bit kitty.
3715000	3717000	And I don't- I love Kingdom Hearts.
3717000	3719000	But I'm just saying, like,
3719000	3721000	touching on more of, like, you know, just having
3721000	3723000	the stuff be all really twisted.
3723000	3725000	Anything that's dark that comes out of Disney
3725000	3727000	really comes from Touchstone or
3727000	3729000	whatever their movie arm is. You know, they-
3729000	3731000	Fine. Buena Vista or whatever it's called.
3731000	3733000	We'll just have it produced by Touchstone Interactive
3733000	3735000	or whatever. Make up a company.
3735000	3737000	Who knows? Who knows?
3737000	3739000	Alright, um, I-
3739000	3741000	I'm glad they're doing PlayStation 3
3741000	3743000	and Xbox as well.
3743000	3745000	I think it'll be- you know, because the Wii-
3745000	3747000	The Wii's on its way out, especially with
3747000	3749000	Wii U coming out this year. I'm glad they're
3749000	3751000	stepping it up to the other systems. It really is
3751000	3753000	on its way out. I mean, there's literally
3753000	3755000	hardly any games coming out at all
3755000	3757000	for the Wii. Oh god, worse.
3757000	3759000	A page right out of the
3759000	3761000	23rd Magus Jokes book. You ready for this one?
3761000	3763000	Brad from Pod Culture in chat
3763000	3765000	says, adult Mickey?
3765000	3767000	Are you fucking goofy?
3769000	3771000	At least they got his main laugh.

3779000	3781000	Uh, Ray Genator
3781000	3783000	in our chatroom says, Sky, please tell us
3783000	3785000	you were either drunk and or high
3785000	3787000	when you saw Twilight. No, I was- I was
3787000	3789000	neither drunk nor high. I was
3789000	3791000	fat. I was eating pizza
3791000	3793000	at the time, so I was fat.
3793000	3795000	But I was not drunk or high.
3795000	3797000	Do you think pizza
3797000	3799000	contains things that'll get you wasted?
3799000	3801000	I don't know. Alright.
3801000	3803000	Twilight, even
3803000	3805000	Riff Trax couldn't make that movie
3805000	3807000	good.
3807000	3809000	I have friends
3809000	3811000	that love it. They swear
3811000	3813000	it's only for the guilty pleasure. You should really question your friendship
3813000	3815000	with them. No, no, because they're close
3815000	3817000	friends of mine, but it's like, oh my god.
3817000	3819000	Alright, you know what? I have my things
3819000	3821000	too. Not everybody understands Rocky Horror
3821000	3823000	Picture Shows, so whatever. Rob, I like
3823000	3825000	Xanadu. Yeah, you are
3825000	3827000	a little weird. Shut up!
3827000	3829000	Just being honest.
3829000	3831000	Alright. I'd like
3831000	3833000	to- speaking of Xanadu,
3833000	3835000	you know, some of the animation in Xanadu was done
3835000	3837000	by the guy who made this game. Yep, Don Bluth.
3837000	3839000	Dragon's Lair.
3839000	3841000	Dragon's Lair's coming to Xbox Live Arcade!
3841000	3843000	And I think a lot of us, when we
3843000	3845000	hear that, stop for a minute and say,
3845000	3847000	oh, it isn't on Xbox Live
3847000	3849000	Arcade. It's like the one fucking platform
3849000	3851000	Dragon's Lair isn't on. Because I could
3851000	3853000	get it on- oh god, I could
3853000	3855000	get it on DVD,
3855000	3857000	Blu-ray,
3857000	3859000	I could get it on my iPhone,
3859000	3861000	I could get it on the PlayStation. Sega CD.
3861000	3863000	This game has
3863000	3865000	been on everything CD-based.
3865000	3867000	However, when the early versions were out,
3867000	3869000	the best version was on the CD-i.
3869000	3871000	Why is that? Because it was the full version.
3871000	3873000	I didn't realize the other ones were cut down.
3873000	3875000	Yeah, the Sega CD one
3875000	3877000	especially was missing scenes and everything.
3877000	3879000	Oh wow, I guess they maybe couldn't fit it.
3879000	3881000	Well, I doubt this one will be missing scenes or
3881000	3883000	whatever, but the Xbox Live Arcade
3883000	3885000	is getting a version, and there was kind of a
3885000	3887000	leak that let people know that
3887000	3889000	Dragon's Lair was on its way out.
3889000	3891000	But Digital Leisure, who
3891000	3893000	is publishing the game,
3893000	3895000	kind of gave away a
3895000	3897000	little surprise about this.
3897000	3899000	This isn't just Dragon's Lair
3899000	3901000	as you would normally play Dragon's
3901000	3903000	Lair, but you can also
3903000	3905000	play with Kinect.
3907000	3909000	Think about that for a minute.
3909000	3911000	Dragon's Lair came out
3911000	3913000	in what, 84, 83?
3913000	3915000	It was definitely the early 80s when this game came out, right?
3915000	3917000	They've gone back to this
3917000	3919000	game that's damn near 30 years old
3919000	3921000	and put Kinect in it.
3921000	3923000	There's
3923000	3925000	several ways you can look at this. You can go
3925000	3927000	well, I mean, they've put it out
3927000	3929000	so many other times they had to do
3929000	3931000	something new to it. Or you
3931000	3933000	could look at it and go, they're
3933000	3935000	ruining my childhood in
3935000	3937000	front of my eyes.
3937000	3939000	How do you feel about this?
3939000	3941000	I especially want to know Dark Soccer
3941000	3943000	because you like Dragon's Lair. What do you think about
3943000	3945000	Kinect support? I'm indifferent
3945000	3947000	about it because I'm not going to buy it.
3947000	3949000	Seriously, how many other versions
3949000	3951000	of Dragon's Lair do I own?
3951000	3953000	You know,
3953000	3955000	it kind of would be like
3955000	3957000	for all the people who like...
3957000	3959000	Actually, I can't
3959000	3961000	think of a
3961000	3963000	benefit on this.
3963000	3965000	You know, people who may not
3965000	3967000	be able to use a controller
3967000	3969000	or
3969000	3971000	maybe people with no arms.
3971000	3973000	They can use their feet.
3973000	3975000	Well, to be fair, you would have
3975000	3977000	to, like some of the motions they're talking about are
3977000	3979000	raising your hand up to grab the rope.
3979000	3981000	So unless you can trick the Kinect to think your foot
3981000	3983000	is your hand, which maybe is possible,
3983000	3985000	or use something else.
3985000	3987000	I don't know. You're right. There could be somebody with
3987000	3989000	a disability where they can't use a controller.
3989000	3991000	But
3991000	3993000	I don't know how many
3993000	3995000	people would fit into the category of
3995000	3997000	can't use a controller can use these Kinect commands.
3997000	3999000	Maybe they have no hands.
3999000	4001000	Maybe they're
4001000	4003000	missing fingers. Now you're stretching.
4003000	4005000	Well, I'm just saying that
4005000	4007000	they put it out there for a reason.
4007000	4009000	Someone's gonna probably like it
4009000	4011000	and pay for it. Not me.
4011000	4013000	I just don't care.
4013000	4015000	Let them do whatever they want
4015000	4017000	to with it. It's not costing me any money.
4017000	4019000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com.
4019000	4021000	Stan in our chat room says, oh no, does that mean you can put
4021000	4023000	your face on that guy's face?
4023000	4025000	Dirk the Daring, you mean?
4025000	4027000	Let's hope not.
4027000	4029000	Let's really hope not.
4029000	4031000	Hackdeft says,
4031000	4033000	Dragon's Lair plus
4033000	4035000	Kinect. Why did they think this was a good
4035000	4037000	idea? I don't know.
4037000	4039000	I guess they're...
4039000	4041000	Props to them trying to do something new.
4041000	4043000	That's about the nicest thing I can say.
4043000	4045000	They're trying to make it a party game, a social
4045000	4047000	game. I mean, cause it's
4047000	4049000	Dragon's Lair. You gotta do something
4049000	4051000	to... Oh yeah, when I think party, I think
4051000	4053000	bust out Dragon's Lair.
4053000	4055000	Well, depends on what kind of friend you have.
4055000	4057000	I guess that's true. I mean, it's just, they're
4057000	4059000	just trying to mix it up. You don't have
4059000	4061000	to play it that way. They're not forcing
4061000	4063000	you to use Kinect in this game, so
4063000	4065000	who cares? It's an additional feature.
4065000	4067000	Why are you complaining about additional features?
4067000	4069000	If you think it's stupid, you don't have to use it.
4069000	4071000	Alright, let's move
4071000	4073000	on with some more gaming news. So, release dates
4073000	4075000	and Classic Game of the Week are still coming up, but first,
4075000	4077000	Dark Sakura.
4077000	4079000	I got your news. I got your news
4079000	4081000	right here. Um,
4081000	4083000	apparently exposure to Violet video games
4083000	4085000	has been linked to aggressive behavior.
4085000	4087000	Warning. Shut up!
4087000	4089000	Well, it's not true, but still.
4089000	4091000	Yeah, there is
4091000	4093000	another bill
4093000	4095000	that wants to
4095000	4097000	label any game
4097000	4099000	that's E or
4099000	4101000	higher than exposure
4101000	4103000	to Violet video games has been linked to aggressive
4103000	4105000	behavior. E or higher?
4105000	4107000	That would be all games.
4107000	4109000	That would be almost, like, I can
4109000	4111000	think of maybe, like,
4111000	4113000	two games that
4113000	4115000	had the Y, the youth rating on it.
4115000	4117000	Well, that's old. It's EC nowadays.
4117000	4119000	Whatever. Whatever it is,
4119000	4121000	I can think of maybe two games.
4121000	4123000	Well, this
4123000	4125000	was sponsored by, uh,
4125000	4127000	Frank Wolf, who is
4127000	4129000	the, uh, Republican representative for Virginia.
4129000	4131000	So, people in Virginia remember
4131000	4133000	who not to vote for.
4133000	4135000	And Joe Baca,
4135000	4137000	who is a California
4137000	4139000	Democrat, people in California,
4139000	4141000	don't vote for this guy.
4141000	4143000	Um, who basically
4143000	4145000	wants, they call it the Violence
4145000	4147000	and Video Games Labeling Act.
4147000	4149000	And, I mean, basically,
4149000	4151000	they've done this before. They did it in 2009,
4151000	4153000	which was for T and up.
4153000	4155000	They're just not giving up.
4155000	4157000	And it's already been proven to be unconstitutional.
4157000	4159000	So, I don't know what they're
4159000	4161000	thinking. You know, there's a
4161000	4163000	saying that doing
4163000	4165000	the same thing multiple times
4165000	4167000	in a row and expecting different results
4167000	4169000	is insanity.
4169000	4171000	Well,
4171000	4173000	they're insane.
4173000	4175000	People, don't vote for them.
4177000	4179000	I just, it's
4179000	4181000	kind of insulting in a way.
4181000	4183000	Because it's like, have these guys ever played a
4183000	4185000	video game in their life? Because
4185000	4187000	really, like, you're talking E-rated
4187000	4189000	video games. So, like,
4189000	4191000	I don't know. I'm trying to look at some of
4191000	4193000	the games I have over there that are rated E.
4193000	4195000	Bloom Blocks
4195000	4197000	is gonna lead to aggressive behavior. Fucking
4197000	4199000	blocks! You know, I will say this
4199000	4201000	Mass Effect 2 led to some aggressive behavior last night.
4201000	4203000	You should have seen me playing some Bust-A-Move earlier.
4203000	4205000	Super Mario Brothers Wii
4205000	4207000	will lead to aggressive behavior.
4207000	4209000	Imagine
4209000	4211000	babies. Forza. Sing Star Abba
4211000	4213000	will lean to aggressive behavior.
4213000	4215000	Forza. Well, here, basically,
4215000	4217000	this is what they said about the last
4217000	4219000	time they tried to do this.
4219000	4221000	Is that, basically,
4221000	4223000	that the Supreme Court
4223000	4225000	found all of the data lacking
4225000	4227000	and unpersuasive.
4227000	4229000	And really, even these own studies,
4229000	4231000	if you go and read them, they contradict themselves
4231000	4233000	because they also bring up
4233000	4235000	that violent movies,
4235000	4237000	or any movie,
4237000	4239000	causes the same reaction in a child
4239000	4241000	already predisposed
4241000	4243000	towards it. It has just as much
4243000	4245000	influence as a movie, as a
4245000	4247000	book, as songs, as anything
4247000	4249000	audio-visual.
4249000	4251000	So, this guy's just, these
4251000	4253000	men are, they're clearly insane.
4253000	4255000	That's the only thing that can say it.
4255000	4257000	Again, doing the same thing over and over
4257000	4259000	and expecting different results is insanity.
4259000	4261000	On a tangent here for a minute,
4261000	4263000	speaking of politicians who don't understand
4263000	4265000	video games, did you hear the latest in the
4265000	4267000	Lee Lin Yi saga? Oh, what?
4267000	4269000	He,
4269000	4271000	well, this is, this is actually, this is the interesting
4271000	4273000	thing, is that this is a bill that you look at and go,
4273000	4275000	yes, we do need this.
4275000	4277000	Remember, Lee Lin Yi was the guy in California,
4277000	4279000	I want to say Democrat out of
4279000	4281000	San Francisco, who was trying to pass
4281000	4283000	the bill on violent video
4283000	4285000	games not being able to be
4285000	4287000	sold at the store,
4287000	4289000	but it was
4289000	4291000	very vague as to what made a violent video game
4291000	4293000	because it didn't tie into ESRB or whatever,
4293000	4295000	and, you know, blah, blah, blah. They lost
4295000	4297000	at the Supreme Court level. State spent like a
4297000	4299000	million bucks defending this law that the dude wrote.
4299000	4301000	We're all sitting here saying, vote his ass out,
4301000	4303000	right? Because that's, he didn't win
4303000	4305000	mayor of San Francisco, so they didn't get
4305000	4307000	elected for that, but
4307000	4309000	he wrote a bill this week that
4309000	4311000	actually you look at and go, okay, now that
4311000	4313000	makes sense. That's technology he does
4313000	4315000	understand. He authored a bill in California
4315000	4317000	which will make it illegal
4317000	4319000	for employers to ask you for your
4319000	4321000	Facebook password, because you might
4321000	4323000	have been hearing the stories this week, the
4323000	4325000	nightmare stories about people that went into job interviews,
4325000	4327000	and the interviewees were like, okay,
4327000	4329000	log into Facebook for me
4329000	4331000	so I can check out what you're really like.
4331000	4333000	And everybody's like, wow, that's an
4333000	4335000	invasion of privacy. Employers shouldn't be
4335000	4337000	able to do that. And so, yeah,
4337000	4339000	you know, Facebook has come out and said, don't do it.
4339000	4341000	And now Lee Lin is going to make it illegal
4341000	4343000	in California. And I was kind of like, well, that's
4343000	4345000	a smart man. Oh, wait, no,
4345000	4347000	it's him. He's,
4347000	4349000	he's all right. Gotta read the fine text
4349000	4351000	and I'm sure he's got violent video games
4351000	4353000	stuff. It might be getting in there. You're gonna look for it.
4353000	4355000	You know, I actually posted
4355000	4357000	a comic on my Tumblr
4357000	4359000	yesterday that was
4359000	4361000	a woman that in interviews is like, okay,
4361000	4363000	well, you've passed all of this. Now,
4363000	4365000	let me see your Facebook. She's like, let me see
4365000	4367000	yours.
4367000	4369000	Oh, yeah. That's what I would say, too. I probably wouldn't
4369000	4371000	get the job, but would you want to work for a company
4371000	4373000	that does that? I don't know. It's tough because
4373000	4375000	in this day and age, people really, really
4375000	4377000	need jobs. And it's kind of
4377000	4379000	gross. It's just gross that
4379000	4381000	employers are exploiting that. It's
4381000	4383000	gross. I think employers
4383000	4385000	that do that should be called out. I think
4385000	4387000	we should have a list of employers that are
4387000	4389000	violating the privacy of their employees.
4389000	4391000	And create two Facebook pages.
4391000	4393000	I know.
4393000	4395000	I know, right? Or just say, I don't have one.
4395000	4397000	They won't believe you.
4397000	4399000	They won't believe you. They'll search for you, but
4399000	4401000	if you use a fake name on the internet,
4401000	4403000	it'll be hard to find.
4403000	4405000	And honestly, anyone can read my
4405000	4407000	Facebook page. I don't care. Don't post anything
4407000	4409000	private on there anyways. I don't care. I mean,
4409000	4411000	my mother and my rabbi are on my
4411000	4413000	Facebook. So, really.
4413000	4415000	But you can see where not everybody would want
4415000	4417000	their employers on their Facebook. You know what I mean?
4417000	4419000	It's just, for me, it's a private
4419000	4421000	Yes, I have co-workers on
4421000	4423000	Facebook, but it's, you know, my choice.
4423000	4425000	I don't want him on my Facebook either
4425000	4427000	because I just don't want him
4427000	4429000	I don't want to talk to him on Facebook.
4429000	4431000	I don't really care.
4431000	4433000	Alright, anyhow.
4433000	4435000	Let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel
4435000	4437000	around the world and check out what is coming out
4437000	4439000	in a gaming store near you. We'll start with the
4439000	4441000	US. Ah, slowing down a bit.
4441000	4443000	Go, go crazy bones on the
4443000	4445000	Nintendo DS. I'm sure that was delayed to this
4445000	4447000	week. Melee to aggressive
4447000	4449000	behavior. Those crazy bones.
4449000	4451000	Damn them. Supremacy
4451000	4453000	MMA for the Playstation Vita.
4453000	4455000	That's coming out this week
4455000	4457000	as well. Myst
4457000	4459000	on the 3DS. It's in 3D
4459000	4461000	and it's Myst.
4461000	4463000	Yay. That game's awesome
4463000	4465000	fifteen years ago. You know, I have a
4465000	4467000	parody of that game called Pissed. I remember
4467000	4469000	that, actually. Yeah.
4469000	4471000	I never played it. I just thought it was funny. And I
4471000	4473000	can guarantee that there's a hundred percent more
4473000	4475000	Myst in that game than there is in the
4475000	4477000	Silent Hill HD collection.
4477000	4479000	I
4479000	4481000	see what you did there. Country Dance
4481000	4483000	All Stars for Kinect.
4483000	4485000	Dance
4485000	4487000	to country music.
4487000	4489000	Warriors Orochi 3 on
4489000	4491000	Xbox 360.
4491000	4493000	And then Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13
4493000	4495000	on Playstation 3 and Xbox
4495000	4497000	360 this week, including collector's
4497000	4499000	editions if you really need a collector's
4499000	4501000	edition for a golf game.
4501000	4503000	Sure, why not. The Capcom
4503000	4505000	Digital Collection on Xbox 360, which is a
4505000	4507000	collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that are already
4507000	4509000	out there.
4509000	4511000	And maybe
4511000	4513000	or maybe not this week because
4513000	4515000	no one seems to have the answer for it. Ridge
4515000	4517000	Racer Unbounded possibly coming
4517000	4519000	out this week. Possibly delayed to who knows
4519000	4521000	when. Because even Namco doesn't
4521000	4523000	know. So
4523000	4525000	possibly this week.
4525000	4527000	Alright. Going to
4527000	4529000	Japan. Are we good to go to Japan now?
4529000	4531000	Alright. So going to Japan. Yay! We're going to Japan.
4531000	4533000	On the Nintendo 3DS
4533000	4535000	Japan this week. Probably a
4535000	4537000	big release some of you might care about.
4537000	4539000	This might be worth importing to some of you.
4539000	4541000	Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop
4541000	4543000	Distance gets released on the
4543000	4545000	Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan on the 29th.
4545000	4547000	Remember you can't import
4547000	4549000	from the 3DS unless you
4549000	4551000	have a Japanese region 3DS.
4551000	4553000	Right. It is not region free like the original
4553000	4555000	DS was, right? Yes. So
4555000	4557000	well if you want to get a Japanese 3DS
4557000	4559000	there is specifically a Kingdom Hearts
4559000	4561000	3DS that you
4561000	4563000	can get. It's like a black one
4563000	4565000	that kind of looks nice. Like a little
4565000	4567000	like inscription of Disney. I don't know if that's like
4567000	4569000	a sticker they put on it. But it looks
4569000	4571000	like a picture. It looks like an inscription.
4571000	4573000	Oh okay. So it's
4573000	4575000	a little more permanent so that's good.
4575000	4577000	So that's kind of your big release
4577000	4579000	and that's on the 3DS this week. But there are some
4579000	4581000	other games coming out of Japan this week.
4581000	4583000	On the Playstation Vita
4583000	4585000	there's Pro Yakyuu Spirits
4585000	4587000	2012. O Tumao
4587000	4589000	To Sevanen no Himigimitachi
4589000	4591000	Shin Osamamonogatari.
4591000	4593000	That is coming out from
4593000	4595000	Konami this week. I don't know
4595000	4597000	if this is a series I recognize
4597000	4599000	on the Vita.
4601000	4603000	It's like a chibi
4603000	4605000	character role playing game.
4607000	4609000	When I saw the people at first I was
4609000	4611000	like oh it's like Suikoden but it's definitely
4611000	4613000	not. It's too cartoony to be that.
4613000	4615000	Something a little different
4615000	4617000	there. But that's from Konami which is a pretty big
4617000	4619000	publisher in Japan.
4619000	4621000	Going to the
4621000	4623000	consoles real quick. Let me take a look at the
4623000	4625000	Xbox 360. Japan
4625000	4627000	gets Duke Nukem Forever.
4627000	4629000	Stay away
4629000	4631000	from it. It's horrible.
4631000	4633000	Root Double Before Crime After
4633000	4635000	Days. Mahjong Dream Club
4635000	4637000	on the 360. And lastly
4637000	4639000	on the Playstation 3 this week. Grand Theft
4639000	4641000	Auto. Episodes from Liberty
4641000	4643000	City. Gets like a price reduction.
4643000	4645000	Duke Nukem Forever is out there as well.
4645000	4647000	The Silent Hill HD Collection makes its way
4647000	4649000	to Japan. Idol Master
4649000	4651000	Gravure For You
4651000	4653000	Volume 6
4653000	4655000	comes out this week on the Playstation 3.
4655000	4657000	So there you go. Your Japanese releases.
4657000	4659000	How about
4659000	4661000	UK? We do have a few.
4661000	4663000	For the UK releases
4663000	4665000	we have on the 28th
4665000	4667000	we have Wrecked Revenge
4667000	4669000	on the 29th
4669000	4671000	Silent Hill HD Collection. On the
4671000	4673000	30th Silent Hill Downpour
4673000	4675000	Naruto Shippuden
4675000	4677000	Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
4677000	4679000	Ridge Racer Unbound
4679000	4681000	Warriors Orochi 3
4681000	4683000	Awesome.
4683000	4685000	Alright.
4685000	4687000	Let's do a couple more stories and then the classic
4687000	4689000	game of the week. Loki?
4689000	4691000	Alright.
4691000	4693000	Apparently
4693000	4695000	Ubisoft is hoping that
4695000	4697000	they can get rid of their DRM
4697000	4699000	that they have on PC.
4699000	4701000	According to a recent interview
4701000	4703000	with Eurogamer
4703000	4705000	Chris Early, who is the
4705000	4707000	Vice President of Digital Publishing at
4707000	4709000	Ubisoft, talked about
4709000	4711000	some of their anti-piracy
4711000	4713000	measures and how
4713000	4715000	it's a tricky balancing act.
4715000	4717000	Basically
4717000	4719000	they were talking a little bit about
4719000	4721000	how
4721000	4723000	it's kind of
4723000	4725000	leniencing some of their customers
4725000	4727000	and that at the same time
4727000	4729000	they don't want to put
4729000	4731000	they're having
4731000	4733000	a hard time convincing
4733000	4735000	themselves to not
4735000	4737000	put DRM on their PC tiles because they know
4737000	4739000	they're going to get pirated so they're trying to find
4739000	4741000	kind of a balance where
4741000	4743000	they can offer enough value in a game where
4743000	4745000	people will want to
4745000	4747000	buy it legitimately without having to
4747000	4749000	worry about DRM.
4749000	4751000	Kind of the same thing I think was at
4751000	4753000	CD Projekt Red was going through with
4753000	4755000	The Witcher 2 and stuff like that where that game was
4755000	4757000	really pirated and they're like
4757000	4759000	listen we're not doing DRM anymore.
4759000	4761000	I think that's mainly because it kept
4761000	4763000	failing in their pain to put DRM in there
4763000	4765000	and so you might as well recoup some money.
4765000	4767000	But
4767000	4769000	right now they're saying
4769000	4771000	the question is with enough ongoing
4771000	4773000	content development, content release,
4773000	4775000	engagement at the community level, we can
4775000	4777000	create that kind of MMO value system.
4777000	4779000	I think we can.
4779000	4781000	As the rest of the
4781000	4783000	game industry continues to evolve the more
4783000	4785000	you hear about cloud gaming
4785000	4787000	the more you hear about companion gaming
4787000	4789000	the less pirated game
4789000	4791000	the less
4791000	4793000	pirated games should work in all of that
4793000	4795000	environment. So basically they're
4795000	4797000	trying to
4797000	4799000	make it work here. Well cloud
4799000	4801000	gaming I mean they're basically making it where you don't
4801000	4803000	have any of the content you just kind of access it
4803000	4805000	and then the MMO stuff
4805000	4807000	just kind of more it sounds like
4807000	4809000	a lot of pay to
4809000	4811000	purchase, pay to play stuff.
4811000	4813000	Right. It's kind of like
4813000	4815000	they're trying to enrich it
4815000	4817000	by giving it more
4817000	4819000	to download. It's almost
4819000	4821000	like the Mass Effect 2 thing I'm going through
4821000	4823000	right now. I got a copy of Mass Effect 2 for
4823000	4825000	20 bucks, brand new. I'm like, fuck yeah
4825000	4827000	sweet, a copy of Mass Effect 2.
4827000	4829000	Almost got pissed as hell when I saw it
4829000	4831000	came with a free code for the Cerberus network.
4831000	4833000	Expires January 1,
4833000	4835000	2012. And I just bought it
4835000	4837000	off the shelf at Fry's, brand new.
4837000	4839000	But I tried using it anyway
4839000	4841000	it still worked. So crisis averted
4841000	4843000	right. So by the way
4843000	4845000	pro tip, those codes might not
4845000	4847000	actually expire when they say they do. Just throwing it
4847000	4849000	out there.
4849000	4851000	But the other thing I wanted to say is that
4851000	4853000	I find that now I'm being
4853000	4855000	told, oh I have to buy the $7
4855000	4857000	DLC because it
4857000	4859000	will change some things in 3 and then there's other
4859000	4861000	DLC. I might have to drop another 20
4861000	4863000	bucks in DLC to get the full experience.
4863000	4865000	So they're still going to get
4865000	4867000	40 bucks out of me for the whole game even though
4867000	4869000	I thought I was getting it on sale. What they
4869000	4871000	really should do, and like I was saying before
4871000	4873000	with the whole Killzone 3 online
4873000	4875000	thing, how that was free.
4875000	4877000	That's how you get people interested in
4877000	4879000	your game. You put that shit out there digitally
4879000	4881000	for free. Just, you can
4881000	4883000	even do it like a demo. And then
4883000	4885000	you add content and you're basically free
4885000	4887000	to play. You're free to start playing it but then
4887000	4889000	you pay for additional content. Or you
4889000	4891000	can get everything boxed together. And then
4891000	4893000	is that like the whole idea that Ridge Racer
4893000	4895000	on the Vita would be awesome if it was
4895000	4897000	free?
4897000	4899000	I wouldn't go as far as saying it would be awesome
4899000	4901000	but it would be a lot easier to
4901000	4903000	swallow that, okay yes there's only 3
4903000	4905000	tracks and 5 cars because this is the free version
4905000	4907000	of the game. Versus the $30
4907000	4909000	version of the game. Well there's the Motorstorm.
4909000	4911000	The Motorstorm game is free and they have
4911000	4913000	a lot of DLC for it. Exactly.
4913000	4915000	That's kind of a perfect example there. Although that
4915000	4917000	DLC you don't really need any of it. I mean
4917000	4919000	because it's just cars that change the appearance
4919000	4921000	of your cars. Which since you're not really
4921000	4923000	racing anybody
4923000	4925000	anyways, um
4925000	4927000	I don't really see the point of making your
4927000	4929000	car look different. Considering that I don't think
4929000	4931000	they handle any different. But whatever.
4931000	4933000	You know you can do that. And that
4933000	4935000	DLC though is anywhere from like a quarter
4935000	4937000	a pop to like a buck.
4937000	4939000	I mean which is something like
4939000	4941000	a quarter. I'm not even going to blink at that.
4941000	4943000	I mean that's nothing if I really felt like
4943000	4945000	I should buy it. But I mean
4945000	4947000	you know like do that with like the next
4947000	4949000	Call of Duty game or something like that. Imagine
4949000	4951000	a free to play Call of Duty game where you can
4951000	4953000	level up to say like
4953000	4955000	rank you know 20 or something like that
4955000	4957000	then oh you gotta pay
4957000	4959000	to you know rank up even further.
4959000	4961000	I think people would be all over that
4961000	4963000	shit. It would be
4963000	4965000	it would be immensely successful.
4965000	4967000	Um and I knew this comment
4967000	4969000	was coming in the chat room. AcidicVampire says
4969000	4971000	Sky just drop the money for it.
4971000	4973000	Mass Effect 2's DLC is worth it.
4973000	4975000	All the Mass Effect fans are joining in.
4975000	4977000	Infinel says you don't really need the weapon armor
4977000	4979000	DLC and Shane says yeah forget it
4979000	4981000	just get the story stuff. I'm like alright
4981000	4983000	yeah yeah you guys made your point but
4983000	4985000	you know and Mass Effect 2
4985000	4987000	is kind of one game out of
4987000	4989000	a lot that I would be willing to do that for.
4989000	4991000	I mean again I actually
4991000	4993000	it held my attention long enough to beat it.
4993000	4995000	That says a lot right there. So
4995000	4997000	alright.
4997000	4999000	When you get around to it I may have DLC
4999000	5001000	codes for you for Mass Effect 3.
5001000	5003000	Nice! For some
5003000	5005000	of the pre-order stuff. I think I still
5005000	5007000	have some left over. Send those my way!
5007000	5009000	Save one for when I borrow Rob's.
5009000	5011000	I love that Jamie
5011000	5013000	is already resigned to the fact that she's gonna
5013000	5015000	have to play the whole damn series. Oh and hey if anybody
5015000	5017000	needs any of the ganky codes
5017000	5019000	for Saints Row the Third I think I have like
5019000	5021000	200 of them still so
5021000	5023000	send me a direct message
5023000	5025000	on Twitter. By the way
5025000	5027000	Mass Effect fans in chat especially
5027000	5029000	Shane. Do I get like a big
5029000	5031000	old high five or a big old cookie for
5031000	5033000	paying it forward to Jamie where
5033000	5035000	now she's taking my copy and she's gonna
5035000	5037000	get sucked into this? Of course
5037000	5039000	she might come on the show next week
5039000	5041000	and go I hated it.
5041000	5043000	You guys are stupid. You know what? I think
5043000	5045000	right there that's a perfect example of how they
5045000	5047000	should be treating games instead of saying oh
5047000	5049000	well we want each person to play an online pass.
5049000	5051000	They should be fucking encouraging people to get
5051000	5053000	people to loan that game out so that people try.
5053000	5055000	Not necessarily the full version of the game but
5055000	5057000	like say hey this person played a demo
5057000	5059000	that's owned by this person like you can
5059000	5061000	send it to them and if they play it and they
5061000	5063000	like it or something like that you get a kickback
5063000	5065000	or something like that. That is the fucking way
5065000	5067000	That's a good point because if I loan her
5067000	5069000	Mass Effect 2 she might have to go buy the
5069000	5071000	DLC for herself.
5071000	5073000	Maybe. I mean we're making a lot of assumptions
5073000	5075000	here but. Well I think they just need to
5075000	5077000	rethink how they're you know
5077000	5079000	doing this. How they're approaching everything
5079000	5081000	and if they could just grasp
5081000	5083000	these wonderful ideas you know they could make a lot of money.
5083000	5085000	Alright.
5085000	5087000	Hitstone wants to know if any of those codes are for PC.
5087000	5089000	No. Oh.
5089000	5091000	Sorry. PS3 and 360 only.
5091000	5093000	Wah wah wah wah. Sorry.
5093000	5095000	Alright. One more
5095000	5097000	story for you guys. Look it's a slow news week
5097000	5099000	so I'm gonna let this story through.
5099000	5101000	In a more busy news week it would have been cut but
5101000	5103000	we needed something so I'm gonna
5103000	5105000	go ahead and address these rumors about Grand Theft
5105000	5107000	Auto 5. Supposedly
5107000	5109000	from an ex-Rockstar employee
5109000	5111000	on the GameSpot
5111000	5113000	forums so
5113000	5115000	big fat grain of salt
5115000	5117000	and I'm doing this instead of Loki
5117000	5119000	so that Loki can sit here and go
5119000	5121000	it's bullshit or oh it sounds like it's
5121000	5123000	legit.
5123000	5125000	Number one. There will be
5125000	5127000	one protagonist character. One
5127000	5129000	character alone. Albert Da Silva
5129000	5131000	is the name. Half Hispanic
5131000	5133000	man who was once a part of a crime city.
5133000	5135000	Crime family in Vice City.
5135000	5137000	True or false? I don't know.
5137000	5139000	You're not very fun to play with.
5139000	5141000	Sorry. Multiplayer will hold
5141000	5143000	32 people on the Xbox and
5143000	5145000	PlayStation 3. Unknown
5145000	5147000	about PC. Just like
5147000	5149000	Red Dead Redemption you'll be able to form
5149000	5151000	gangs. They're not ranked through XP
5151000	5153000	but through reputation.
5153000	5155000	Well we know that to be true
5155000	5157000	already but I think a lot of that is
5157000	5159000	just speculation. I think all this is
5159000	5161000	speculation. They don't know.
5161000	5163000	Alright.
5163000	5165000	Yeah I think a lot of this seems like educated
5165000	5167000	speculation to me when I read it too and I don't
5167000	5169000	know a dick about Grand Theft Auto. I don't know if it's educated
5169000	5171000	speculation but. Number
5171000	5173000	three. The map is about five times as large
5173000	5175000	as the Grand Theft Auto 4 map and the
5175000	5177000	city of Los Santos takes up just
5177000	5179000	under half of this area. So it's bigger than
5179000	5181000	two Grand Theft Auto 4 Liberty Cities.
5181000	5183000	Again, safe bet.
5183000	5185000	Um.
5185000	5187000	I don't know if they can do it like that.
5187000	5189000	I mean it could be bigger because
5189000	5191000	I think the Red Dead Redemption map was pretty big
5191000	5193000	but I mean it's a lot of it's just
5193000	5195000	fitting in textures and fitting in
5195000	5197000	the maps themselves. I mean
5197000	5199000	the object placement formats and stuff like
5199000	5201000	that it's pretty small
5201000	5203000	but it's when you get all the different textures in the
5203000	5205000	game. So I don't know if it's going to be five
5205000	5207000	times as large. I mean it's going to be pretty big.
5207000	5209000	But I
5209000	5211000	don't know. I just assume it's going to be larger.
5211000	5213000	Cars and guns are customizable
5213000	5215000	to an extent. For an example you
5215000	5217000	can customize a gun to have a suppressor on it
5217000	5219000	and you can install nitrous into cars.
5219000	5221000	I thought you could already do that in Grand Theft Auto.
5221000	5223000	Uh.
5223000	5225000	They used to have that in San Andreas.
5225000	5227000	Not necessarily the
5227000	5229000	suppressors but I mean that would be a nice feature.
5229000	5231000	I don't know if that's going to be
5231000	5233000	legit or not.
5233000	5235000	Alright let me get to some of the other
5235000	5237000	good stuff because this is getting
5237000	5239000	boring already. Radio stations
5239000	5241000	now do traffic reports that are actually
5241000	5243000	correct. So if you don't know what route to take
5243000	5245000	you can check the traffic reports on your phone or on the
5245000	5247000	Radio 7. The in-game TV
5247000	5249000	has more channels. Again that seems like a safe bet.
5249000	5251000	But once again though
5251000	5253000	those in-game TV channels are
5253000	5255000	fucking huge as far as the files go.
5255000	5257000	They're Bic encoded
5257000	5259000	or Bink encoded videos
5259000	5261000	that take up hundreds of
5261000	5263000	megs. I mean if they're going to fit
5263000	5265000	that shit on a disc they're going to have to do some sort of
5265000	5267000	compression or something because as of
5267000	5269000	right now on 4 in episodes
5269000	5271000	from Liberty City they're not
5271000	5273000	compressed at all besides
5273000	5275000	you know what the actual
5275000	5277000	encoder does but
5277000	5279000	that's why there's not that many stations
5279000	5281000	on like episodes from Liberty City
5281000	5283000	because they can't fit it on the disc.
5283000	5285000	The protagonist
5285000	5287000	can take drugs which will have
5287000	5289000	some effects but smoking weed
5289000	5291000	on the streetwalk will lead to getting a one
5291000	5293000	star wanted level.
5293000	5295000	That's like Saintsboro
5295000	5297000	one shit. I mean I don't even
5297000	5299000	know if I can go with that. I'm bored
5299000	5301000	of this story already so here's the biggest one.
5301000	5303000	The game is due in May 2013.
5303000	5305000	A more specific date has not been
5305000	5307000	decided because the game is still needing six
5307000	5309000	months to be fully developed. They
5309000	5311000	will have a playable demo at E3.
5311000	5313000	That's again speculation
5313000	5315000	because we already know with their
5315000	5317000	we already know the next quarter game is going to be
5317000	5319000	Max Payne 3. We already know what the
5319000	5321000	fourth quarter game is going to be which is going to be
5321000	5323000	well it's not necessarily the Rockstar but Take 2
5323000	5325000	which is going to be NBA 2K
5325000	5327000	NHL 2K if they actually put one out
5327000	5329000	this year and of course you know the big
5329000	5331000	big big one is
5331000	5333000	you know Bioshock Infinite
5333000	5335000	so of course that stuff is going to be
5335000	5337000	coming out and so you got to figure
5337000	5339000	you know it's going to be
5339000	5341000	first or second quarter and you know
5341000	5343000	estimating they've got
5343000	5345000	maybe they've got some other 2K stuff
5345000	5347000	oh shit I completely forgot
5347000	5349000	of like you know
5349000	5351000	XCOM is still in there somewhere
5351000	5353000	and
5353000	5355000	then I want to say like the
5355000	5357000	Summer Games probably
5357000	5359000	Spec Ops they've
5359000	5361000	still got in there somewhere in June I
5361000	5363000	believe
5363000	5365000	I don't know a lot of it just sounds like
5365000	5367000	speculation and you know
5367000	5369000	unfortunately because I do follow
5369000	5371000	a lot of Grand Theft Auto
5371000	5373000	communities and stuff there is like one person
5373000	5375000	each week saying oh I've heard something
5375000	5377000	from a random you know
5377000	5379000	Rockstar employee yeah and they're going to make
5379000	5381000	these educated guesses so that if they're close
5381000	5383000	then yeah people say hey I said it first
5383000	5385000	and then if they're wrong then no one will
5385000	5387000	remember. People have a need to be first
5387000	5389000	sometimes. Exactly.
5389000	5391000	I love some of the comments in our chat room
5391000	5393000	chat.orangessantria.com Porkchop
5393000	5395000	what a delicious handle in the
5395000	5397000	chat room says why would anyone
5397000	5399000	waste time watching TV in Grand Theft Auto
5399000	5401000	when you can go out and stomp hookers? We actually
5401000	5403000	did watch a lot of the TV when
5403000	5405000	Dan was playing it. It was funny.
5405000	5407000	You're boring. You should be killing more hookers.
5407000	5411000	SHJ100Matt
5411000	5413000	says what Grand Theft Auto 5 really
5413000	5415000	needs is the SimCity Action News
5415000	5417000	reporter just saying
5417000	5419000	God I love your topical sense of humor
5419000	5421000	I really do because it gives me an excuse
5421000	5423000	to play a clip from SimCity Action
5423000	5425000	News
5453000	5455000	is
5455000	5457000	picking up cars and buses
5457000	5459000	and throwing them hundreds of yards
5459000	5461000	as he moves closer to the SimCity Action
5461000	5463000	Studios which means
5463000	5465000	that this is Carol Davenport signing off
5465000	5467000	and getting the hell out of here.
5469000	5471000	Give her an Emmy. Give her a goddamn Emmy.
5471000	5473000	Lifetime Achievement
5473000	5475000	Award.
5475000	5477000	You see...
5477000	5479000	Let's give her a series on Bravo.
5479000	5481000	Jurassic Park had just come
5481000	5483000	out that same year. So that's funny.
5487000	5489000	Let's go back to a time
5489000	5491000	when
5491000	5493000	video games were less complicated
5493000	5495000	and didn't require full screen
5495000	5497000	videos and all that stuff
5497000	5499000	in a segment we call the classic
5499000	5501000	game of the week. Yay!
5505000	5507000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into
5507000	5509000	the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks
5509000	5511000	is great. You kids
5511000	5513000	need to stop playing
5513000	5515000	your Grand Theft Auto 5s and your SimCity
5515000	5517000	Action Newses
5517000	5519000	and you need to check out this
5519000	5521000	awesomely classic game. What is the classic
5521000	5523000	game of the week? Today's classic game is
5523000	5525000	Star Fox.
5525000	5527000	Yay. Fucking great choice.
5527000	5529000	Which came out of Starwing
5529000	5531000	in Europe and Australia because there was
5531000	5533000	a trademarked game that came out
5533000	5535000	like in
5535000	5537000	when the hell... 1983.
5537000	5539000	Can I just say I'm really hating the ads
5539000	5541000	on YouTube these days. Sorry. It's alright.
5541000	5543000	Not your fault. I didn't want
5543000	5545000	to hear emo bands singing first while I'm trying
5545000	5547000	to get some Star Fox action going on here
5547000	5549000	in the studio. We're the emo band
5549000	5551000	singing about Star Fox.
5553000	5555000	Our lives suck
5555000	5557000	cause we don't have Star Fox.
5557000	5559000	Anyway.
5559000	5561000	Star Fox
5561000	5563000	is a
5563000	5565000	rail shooter that used
5565000	5567000	3D polygon graphics. It's the first Nintendo
5567000	5569000	game to use full on polygons.
5569000	5571000	And it was powered by the
5571000	5573000	Super FX chip which was basically
5573000	5575000	a co-processor so that it could handle it.
5575000	5577000	So uh
5577000	5579000	the characters were all designed
5579000	5581000	by Takaya Imamura
5581000	5583000	based off of Kemono
5583000	5585000	characters basically
5585000	5587000	from old I believe 16th
5587000	5589000	century Japanese art.
5589000	5591000	This is pretty cool. You know basically
5591000	5593000	anthropomorphic characters.
5593000	5595000	What? Somebody in chat asked
5595000	5597000	if they could do a barrel roll so I slapped him with a fish.
5597000	5599000	Okay cool.
5599000	5601000	At any rate
5601000	5603000	God this music is so epic. I love the first
5603000	5605000	level music. The soundtrack was so
5605000	5607000	fucking good. Turn this up a little bit. Sure.
5607000	5609000	This is like seriously my favorite music in the game.
5609000	5611000	What the
5611000	5613000	planet music? The very first
5613000	5615000	level. Oh yeah the music
5615000	5617000	here. The canaria level. The whole
5617000	5619000	take off sequence and all that is awesome. Let's
5619000	5623000	listen here for a minute here.
5623000	5625000	Thanks. Emergency.
5625000	5627000	This brings me so much
5627000	5629000	worries.
5641000	5643000	Seriously the most epic
5643000	5653000	music ever right here.
5653000	5655000	Shut up Falco.
5655000	5657000	Shut up Slippy.
5659000	5661000	I swear I spent the whole game going
5661000	5663000	freaking hate Slippy die
5663000	5665000	and shut up Falco. That was me
5665000	5667000	the entire time I was playing this game. Seriously
5667000	5669000	this music just invokes the
5669000	5673000	world.
5673000	5675000	Fuck yeah.
5675000	5677000	For a Japanese game sure.
5677000	5679000	Anyway it
5679000	5681000	involves Fox McCloud
5681000	5683000	who is the leader of the Star Fox team
5683000	5685000	and they
5685000	5687000	have these ships called
5687000	5689000	Arwings which
5689000	5691000	are really floating polygon
5691000	5693000	things and they're pretty cool.
5693000	5695000	And you've got thrusters and
5695000	5697000	retrorockets that let you speed up
5697000	5699000	slow down and you've got
5699000	5701000	bombs and
5701000	5703000	pew pew laser things.
5703000	5705000	You hear the pew pew noises?
5705000	5707000	Pew pew pew pew.
5707000	5709000	So anyway
5709000	5711000	you've got
5711000	5713000	a little bit different thing
5713000	5715000	with your
5715000	5717000	in the damage on here. You've actually got
5717000	5719000	an energy shield that controls how much
5719000	5721000	damage you can absorb before the craft
5721000	5723000	destroys. So you can bump
5723000	5725000	into stuff and you take some damage
5725000	5727000	and don't just immediately explode.
5727000	5729000	Sometimes if your
5729000	5731000	wings clip against certain obstacles
5731000	5733000	they'll break off and it will affect
5733000	5735000	the handling of your Arwing.
5735000	5737000	Which was pretty innovative I thought
5737000	5739000	for a game of it's time.
5739000	5741000	The other thing that was interesting
5741000	5743000	about this is that it didn't have a difficulty
5743000	5745000	selection after you
5745000	5747000	finished the first stage you actually
5747000	5749000	would pick a path
5749000	5751000	that you could go on.
5751000	5753000	And so you could pick the easy
5753000	5755000	option, the normal option, or the hard option
5755000	5757000	depending on which path you took.
5757000	5759000	So you could mix and match your game
5759000	5761000	anyway and it had multiple
5761000	5763000	patterns. You know kind of like
5763000	5765000	an outrun.
5765000	5767000	You know how you can pick your different
5767000	5769000	paths and outrun. Oh yeah an outrun
5769000	5771000	you can pick your path but kind of once you
5771000	5773000	start going one way it's like you can't
5773000	5775000	really change it too much.
5775000	5777000	You can kind of slip back into something.
5777000	5779000	If you go left the first time you'll
5779000	5781000	never do the stage all the way at the bottom of the map.
5781000	5783000	Right you know that kind of thing.
5783000	5785000	The same thing was done in After Burner.
5785000	5787000	Yay Sega. Anyway.
5787000	5789000	So you also have
5789000	5791000	your wingmen. You have Peppy Hare, Slippy
5791000	5793000	Toad. Sucker.
5793000	5795000	And Falco Lombardi who I hated
5795000	5797000	Falco so much.
5797000	5799000	And it was kind of
5799000	5801000	cool because if you accidentally shot one of
5801000	5803000	your guys you wouldn't hurt them
5803000	5805000	but they would say hey
5805000	5807000	what are you doing shooting at me?
5807000	5809000	I'm Falco and I suck.
5809000	5811000	Hey I suck at these things off my toes.
5811000	5813000	Yeah you actually have to um
5813000	5815000	save your wingmen from being attacked by
5815000	5817000	other enemies too which was
5817000	5819000	almost always slippy.
5819000	5821000	So yeah
5821000	5823000	so you have to help them so that they'll always
5823000	5825000	be there with you and you even have the
5825000	5827000	little flying formation thing which is pretty cool.
5827000	5829000	So anyway
5829000	5831000	um
5831000	5833000	there were a few
5833000	5835000	really neat things with this too. Like I said
5835000	5837000	it was using the um
5837000	5839000	Super FX chip. It actually was
5839000	5841000	based off on
5841000	5843000	there was a prototype on the NES that was called
5843000	5845000	NES Glider that was
5845000	5847000	inspired by a game called Star Glider
5847000	5849000	and then they brought the prototype to the SNES
5849000	5851000	and once they uh
5851000	5853000	they actually uh hired
5853000	5855000	um a company to create
5855000	5857000	the Super FX chip so that they could have
5857000	5859000	the 3D graphics in there.
5859000	5861000	It was actually a lot
5861000	5863000	harder um a lot more
5863000	5865000	powerful than the SNES
5865000	5867000	uh processor. There was a joke going
5867000	5869000	around that the um
5869000	5871000	SNES was basically just a box to hold the chip.
5871000	5873000	Pretty cool.
5873000	5875000	So um the main game
5875000	5877000	uh was designed by Miyamoto
5877000	5879000	and um Eguchi
5879000	5881000	and uh like I said the characters were designed
5881000	5883000	by um Imamura
5883000	5885000	and that awesome music was by
5885000	5887000	um Hajime Hirasawa so
5887000	5889000	awesome music. We've got so many different
5889000	5891000	good versions of that song too.
5891000	5893000	Um
5893000	5895000	It was also stated
5895000	5897000	by Miyamoto that he wanted to use animal
5897000	5899000	characters since he didn't want to
5899000	5901000	do conventional sci-fi with
5901000	5903000	robots, monsters, and superheroes.
5903000	5905000	And uh so that's how
5905000	5907000	it came about.
5909000	5911000	So um moving
5911000	5913000	a little bit uh forward
5913000	5915000	there's secret levels in the game.
5915000	5917000	Did you ever do any of the secret levels Rob?
5917000	5919000	I did. Wasn't it the thing where you had to shoot the little
5919000	5921000	planet and the little planet that would pop out
5921000	5923000	for like a half second? You had to do something?
5923000	5925000	And then you had to shoot it in the eye?
5925000	5927000	There were, okay. If I remember this
5927000	5929000	correctly cause keep in mind it's been a while since
5929000	5931000	I've done it. To get to the um the black hole
5931000	5933000	level you have to shoot
5933000	5935000	these um like
5935000	5937000	rings that there's a little central
5937000	5939000	part. Is this the slot machine level?
5939000	5941000	That's the slot machine. I think that's the slot machine.
5941000	5943000	Yeah
5943000	5945000	is that going from the easy one to the
5945000	5947000	This video is somebody actually doing it. So
5947000	5949000	we'll uh. No that's the first one.
5949000	5951000	The slot machines
5951000	5953000	later on. Let me fast forward
5953000	5955000	the video a little bit then. Where's the slot machine?
5955000	5957000	Oh no that's the one.
5957000	5959000	That's the slot machine one.
5959000	5961000	Yeah I think somebody
5961000	5963000	accesses it here cause here's the
5963000	5965000	Yeah that's the slot machine.
5965000	5967000	Okay anyway let me
5967000	5969000	There was one where um
5969000	5971000	where you uh
5973000	5975000	have to shoot these certain rings a certain
5975000	5977000	way and then fly through the center of the explosion
5977000	5979000	and then this ugly ass planet
5979000	5981000	pops up that looks like um
5981000	5983000	you know it kind of looks like the moon from
5983000	5985000	Majora's Mask. It looks like a troll
5985000	5987000	face to me. To me it looks like
5987000	5989000	the moon from Majora's Mask.
5989000	5991000	And um you have to
5991000	5993000	shoot it or fly into it or something.
5993000	5995000	And so you get to go to the first
5995000	5997000	um black hole and the
5997000	5999000	black hole basically if you
5999000	6001000	whatever different ring pops up in the black
6001000	6003000	hole if you fly through it it warps you
6003000	6005000	to that level. Shut up Slippy.
6005000	6007000	Anyway.
6007000	6009000	The other one which is one that we were talking about
6009000	6011000	a moment ago is you get there from
6011000	6013000	asteroid field course three.
6013000	6015000	Is um
6015000	6017000	called out of this dimension.
6017000	6019000	And it plays um
6019000	6021000	different music as you go
6021000	6023000	through it um you actually have to shoot down
6023000	6025000	paper planes.
6025000	6027000	At first. And then the boss plays um
6027000	6029000	different parts. One is from a
6029000	6031000	Japanese folk song called Yuki.
6031000	6033000	Um the chorus from when the saints go marching
6033000	6035000	in and lightly row.
6035000	6037000	And uh you shoot parts of the machine
6037000	6039000	like the arm to cause
6039000	6041000	the spinners on the slot machine
6041000	6043000	to go. And basically um
6043000	6045000	when you land
6045000	6047000	on three sevens
6047000	6049000	um then you defeat the machine
6049000	6051000	and it explodes. And then you
6051000	6053000	actually fly through the ending credits
6053000	6055000	of the game and then the end shows up
6055000	6057000	but all the letters are flipped around. So you have to keep shooting
6057000	6059000	the letters and when it finally lines up the different way
6059000	6061000	it um basically just
6061000	6063000	I think starts you over.
6063000	6065000	It ends the game. Imagine that.
6065000	6067000	It's not just a clever title.
6067000	6069000	No this
6069000	6071000	crazy mode seven.
6071000	6073000	Ooh mode seven. And FX FX.
6073000	6075000	And FX exactly.
6075000	6077000	Wasn't there only like one other game that had the FX chip in it?
6077000	6079000	That would be Stunt Race FX.
6079000	6081000	I think there was one more.
6081000	6083000	There was a robot game.
6083000	6085000	Oh yeah there was. You're right. And keep in mind there's the
6085000	6087000	Star Fox 2 prototype.
6087000	6089000	That of course
6089000	6091000	we never saw.
6091000	6093000	Now the one I'm going to talk about next is actually
6093000	6095000	one that our friend Melody
6095000	6097000	used to have a copy of.
6097000	6099000	And that was the competition version.
6099000	6101000	Which is the Super Star Fox weekend competition one.
6101000	6103000	Where uh they had
6103000	6105000	a limited time play
6105000	6107000	and there were two thousand copies made
6107000	6109000	and she said she sold hers.
6109000	6111000	There was um you know we had
6111000	6113000	a number of Star Fox games come out since then.
6113000	6115000	Star Fox 2 was in the works for Super Nintendo.
6115000	6117000	Um
6117000	6119000	though um the head programmer said
6119000	6121000	that they actually finished the game.
6121000	6123000	Um there was
6123000	6125000	uh Star Fox 64.
6125000	6127000	There were
6127000	6129000	um there's actually ROM dumps of
6129000	6131000	Star Fox 2 that were from different stages
6131000	6133000	of development. And someone
6133000	6135000	actually translated it and made um
6135000	6137000	a patch for it.
6137000	6139000	There is Star Fox
6139000	6141000	on the GameCube that was Star Fox Adventures by
6141000	6143000	Rare. We had
6143000	6145000	Star Fox Assault for the GameCube
6145000	6147000	that was done by Namco.
6147000	6149000	And it was a third person shooter.
6149000	6151000	There was Star Fox Command that was on the DS.
6151000	6153000	And now there's um Star Fox makes
6153000	6155000	appearances in a micro game in Warrior
6155000	6157000	where Smooth moves.
6157000	6159000	And um you fight
6159000	6161000	basically the Nintendo robot
6161000	6163000	who has a huge munga zapper.
6163000	6165000	And
6165000	6167000	that's it.
6167000	6169000	Alright. A true classic.
6169000	6171000	Star Fox. Again
6171000	6173000	one of those games I had to go
6173000	6175000	she's never done Star Fox before? I know.
6175000	6177000	I had to go really? I've never done Star Fox before?
6177000	6179000	So yeah. So yeah
6179000	6181000	200 episodes into this or what?
6181000	6183000	Also funny.
6183000	6185000	The Starwing logo uses a completely different font
6185000	6187000	than Star Fox. Just saying.
6187000	6189000	Now some folks in chat were like
6189000	6191000	boy Nintendo really ruined this franchise.
6191000	6193000	You know some of the Star Fox Adventures of course
6193000	6195000	was not very well received and
6195000	6197000	you know I think people liked Star Fox 64
6197000	6199000	enough. Um and a lot of
6199000	6201000	Star Fox 2 kind of went into that but uh
6201000	6203000	yeah Star Fox Adventures wasn't really
6203000	6205000	pretty. So that's too bad.
6205000	6207000	Anyhow we are going
6207000	6209000	to take a quick break but don't go anywhere. We got
6209000	6211000	more Orange Lounge Radio to come. Things that might
6211000	6213000	actually be better than Star Fox.
6213000	6215000	Alright maybe not but they're still
6215000	6217000	pretty good so stick around. We'll be right back after this
6217000	6219000	with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6225000	6227000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6227000	6229000	We are live with episode number
6229000	6231000	451 for this.
6231000	6233000	March the 25th of
6233000	6235000	2012. Um I know we
6235000	6237000	can't play these live break songs that we do
6237000	6239000	um on the podcast but we were playing some
6239000	6241000	music from the DDR days and
6241000	6243000	by coincidence I happened to pick
6243000	6245000	songs that were both from Dance Dance Revolution
6245000	6247000	third mix Korean.
6247000	6249000	Um and man I miss
6249000	6251000	those games. I miss DDR back when it was
6251000	6253000	so good and like that
6253000	6255000	that community and everything we had and the songs
6255000	6257000	were like legit. Like not everybody
6257000	6259000	ever understood the songs. I'm sure some of you
6259000	6261000	listening to the show now probably go
6261000	6263000	really you guys kind of like that music but
6263000	6265000	like there is just something about DDR music. I can't
6265000	6267000	explain it. I can't put my finger on it but man
6267000	6269000	I miss those days. But
6269000	6271000	oh well. It was
6271000	6273000	actually asked um by
6273000	6275000	Technus who was played at a third mix
6275000	6277000	machine that was not a Korean version.
6277000	6279000	Me. Um they had one here
6279000	6281000	locally somewhere didn't they? Well they did.
6281000	6283000	The one that I played at I think it was
6283000	6285000	AX2000. Mhm. Was
6285000	6287000	um a Japanese third mix from
6287000	6289000	uh Arcade Infinity. Ah.
6289000	6291000	Nice.
6291000	6293000	I did hear I think
6293000	6295000	that they're trying to restart Arcade Infinity
6295000	6297000	in another location. Or like something
6297000	6299000	like it. So that's cool. I hope it
6299000	6301000	happens. We'll see.
6301000	6303000	Alright anyhow let's get back into some gaming news
6303000	6305000	with some rapid fire news.
6305000	6307000	Uh some quick stories for you guys. Loki.
6307000	6309000	So uh we've
6309000	6311000	heard about LittleBigPlanet Karting
6311000	6313000	um which was you know
6313000	6315000	leaked out of the
6315000	6317000	uh what was it
6317000	6319000	uh PlayStation
6319000	6321000	event. PlayStation event. PlayStation event.
6321000	6323000	What the hell was it called? Uh
6323000	6325000	uh
6325000	6327000	uh I can't remember. Anyways.
6327000	6329000	Uh you know
6329000	6331000	Loki uh PlayStation event
6331000	6333000	basically uh is gonna be coming out on
6333000	6335000	the Vita and PlayStation 3.
6335000	6337000	Uh not surprisingly enough though it's
6337000	6339000	actually being done by
6339000	6341000	um United Front Games
6341000	6343000	who are the developers behind
6343000	6345000	ModNation Racers.
6345000	6347000	So they kinda have a little bit of experience
6347000	6349000	in you know
6349000	6351000	play, share, create racing games.
6351000	6353000	Although
6353000	6355000	at the same time that makes me
6355000	6357000	a little worried because
6357000	6359000	Well maybe they'll take some of the feedback from the last
6359000	6361000	one and make it better.
6361000	6363000	You know. Maybe.
6363000	6365000	Hopefully. Um
6365000	6367000	I mean the trailer looks neat. They have
6367000	6369000	a trailer out for it now. Um
6369000	6371000	So it has potential. I'm just really
6371000	6373000	sad that Media Molecule is not
6373000	6375000	having a
6375000	6377000	like you know really
6377000	6379000	a lot of
6379000	6381000	feedback on it. At least I hope that
6381000	6383000	they do. I don't know. It didn't really say.
6383000	6385000	So.
6385000	6387000	Um
6387000	6389000	Destination PlayStation. That's
6389000	6391000	what it was. Destination PlayStation.
6391000	6393000	Um
6393000	6395000	So yeah. They're gonna be doing an Adventure Time
6395000	6397000	game for Nintendo DS.
6397000	6399000	And it's being done by
6399000	6401000	WayForward. Um. Who have
6401000	6403000	I guess they were behind
6403000	6405000	Uh
6405000	6407000	Some new. Oh what was it?
6407000	6409000	I'm trying to remember games they put out.
6409000	6411000	The Henry Hatsworth game.
6411000	6413000	Um. They had that come out.
6413000	6415000	Um. So that was not a bad
6415000	6417000	game. And I haven't really said
6417000	6419000	too much about what the game is.
6419000	6421000	Although the creator of the show
6421000	6423000	um
6423000	6425000	actually posted some really funny
6425000	6427000	like animated gifs. So
6427000	6429000	Neat.
6429000	6431000	I'm sure the game will be pretty
6431000	6433000	awesome. The show is pretty cool.
6433000	6435000	It's a great cartoon.
6435000	6437000	And last but not least
6437000	6439000	they announced that Max Payne 3
6439000	6441000	is gonna have kind of a
6441000	6443000	new feature for the multiplayer. They're
6443000	6445000	gonna have what they're calling crews
6445000	6447000	and now what the Max
6447000	6449000	Payne 3 crews are are kind of like these
6449000	6451000	multiplayer clans that you have
6451000	6453000	that you can um play
6453000	6455000	through the game and
6455000	6457000	uh kind of um create these
6457000	6459000	uh crews or clans
6459000	6461000	through the social club. The Rockstar Social
6461000	6463000	Club page. And what's
6463000	6465000	kind of neat though is when you create
6465000	6467000	your clan in Max Payne
6467000	6469000	3 you'll actually be able to transfer it to
6469000	6471000	Grand Theft Auto 5
6471000	6473000	when that comes in to play the actual multiplayer
6473000	6475000	and that. So it's kind of like a cross game
6475000	6477000	clan
6477000	6479000	crew or whatever you want to call it.
6479000	6481000	Um. Which I think is kind of cool.
6481000	6483000	Cause they're definitely doing a lot of social club
6483000	6485000	um interaction with the game
6485000	6487000	and I know like in the past when I used
6487000	6489000	to play a lot of Grand Theft Auto 4
6489000	6491000	and I really am sad I don't play a lot of
6491000	6493000	Grand Theft Auto 4 now but
6493000	6495000	you know last week or so
6495000	6497000	actually this is kind of one thing that we
6497000	6499000	didn't talk about but on the
6499000	6501000	hacking scene for Grand Theft Auto 4
6501000	6503000	they released online scripts for
6503000	6505000	Grand Theft Auto 4
6505000	6507000	um for multiplayer.
6507000	6509000	So you're gonna see a lot more hacking
6509000	6511000	shenanigans on Grand Theft Auto 4
6511000	6513000	um if you're playing that online
6513000	6515000	which is kind of sad cause I
6515000	6517000	legitimately had a really high rank on
6517000	6519000	that game um but unfortunately
6519000	6521000	you know now anyone can game it to
6521000	6523000	you get the top of the
6523000	6525000	leaderboard so it's kind of
6525000	6527000	over and done for now.
6527000	6529000	Um but 5 man I am looking
6529000	6531000	forward to playing 5 multiplayer
6531000	6533000	for sure from day 1 but uh
6533000	6535000	Max Payne 3
6535000	6537000	not much interest in that game.
6537000	6539000	Cause it's not Grand Theft Auto.
6539000	6541000	Alright
6541000	6543000	well moving on to some other games
6543000	6545000	uh kind of in the same
6545000	6547000	category as Grand Theft Auto another Rockstar game
6547000	6549000	uh L.A. Noire
6549000	6551000	is getting a touch controlled
6551000	6553000	version um
6553000	6555000	OnLive of course put out some
6555000	6557000	various tablet apps
6557000	6559000	um and Rockstar is doing
6559000	6561000	a touch version of L.A. Noire
6561000	6563000	making this kind of more of a
6563000	6565000	touch screen friendly game or an iOS
6565000	6567000	or whatever phone it is game.
6567000	6569000	Um OnLive says those controls are now
6569000	6571000	available so you can play L.A. Noire
6571000	6573000	with OnLive Mobile
6573000	6575000	and uh yeah you can uh
6575000	6577000	swipe across the screen to do
6577000	6579000	some motions I guess you don't need to use
6579000	6581000	virtual buttons or a wireless controller
6581000	6583000	or any of that. Uh you do need to
6583000	6585000	buy L.A. Noire if you want to play it
6585000	6587000	uh or you know and have an OnLive
6587000	6589000	account and all that but it is interesting that they actually
6589000	6591000	kind of adapted it. However, however
6591000	6593000	there are free trials for all the games and the Online
6593000	6595000	client is free. So you can check it out
6595000	6597000	for free. Okay that's good to know.
6597000	6599000	So if you want to see if this is up your alley.
6599000	6601000	I don't know if L.A. Noire would work in touch
6601000	6603000	motion for me but okay.
6603000	6605000	The problem is it's L.A. Noire.
6605000	6607000	The interrogation parts will be fine but it's
6607000	6609000	the rest of the movie. I got bored
6609000	6611000	with that game really fast.
6611000	6613000	Alright moving on Final Fantasy 13
6613000	6615000	2 um you know what's funny
6615000	6617000	is that I didn't finish 13
6617000	6619000	2 and part of the reason I wasn't able to do it is because
6619000	6621000	I got sucked into Mass Effect. Well
6621000	6623000	worlds can now collide on March
6623000	6625000	27th. They've announced that there will be
6625000	6627000	Mass Effect 3 DLC
6627000	6629000	for Final Fantasy 13 2.
6629000	6631000	What? Yes it's
6631000	6633000	true. It's not as big as you think
6633000	6635000	though. It's just that now Sarah and Noel
6635000	6637000	who are of course the big two uh characters
6637000	6639000	in the game are going to get
6639000	6641000	N7 armor
6641000	6643000	that they can dress up in to make them look like Mass Effect
6643000	6645000	characters and although there's a part of me that
6645000	6647000	goes that's stupid. There's another part of me that goes
6647000	6649000	but that's really awesome.
6649000	6651000	By the way Mass Effect is not the only
6651000	6653000	kind of you know game hopping
6653000	6655000	that's going on. Assassin's Creed
6655000	6657000	Revelations outfits are supposed to be on their way.
6657000	6659000	And that's I believe only in Japan right now.
6659000	6661000	Right I don't think a date has been announced
6661000	6663000	for the US. It'll eventually
6663000	6665000	happen though. Yeah. Uh
6665000	6667000	what else is interesting I think this is
6667000	6669000	really interesting
6669000	6671000	um Final Fantasy 13 2 got some other
6671000	6673000	DLCers getting some that
6673000	6675000	throws the game back to Final Fantasy
6675000	6677000	6. Don't get too
6677000	6679000	excited it's just a couple of the characters
6679000	6681000	but if you played 6 you'll remember
6681000	6683000	Ultros right
6683000	6685000	Ultros was the octopus and the annoying
6685000	6687000	little bastard. He has the
6687000	6689000	little jokes and everything. Uh
6689000	6691000	Typhon is the other one. Is it Typhoon or
6691000	6693000	Typhon is the other one. I'll say Typhoon.
6693000	6695000	But uh is the other
6695000	6697000	I only see 1-0 so whatever.
6697000	6699000	Uh but is the other character that will be available
6699000	6701000	as well. Uh this is
6701000	6703000	more of one of those arena fights and if you beat
6703000	6705000	them in the arena then you can use them as your monsters
6705000	6707000	cause you know your third person can always be a monster.
6707000	6709000	So I thought it was kind of funny that
6709000	6711000	they kind of went back to the
6711000	6713000	past with that so that's pretty cool.
6713000	6715000	So there you go. Uh
6715000	6717000	no announcement when that is out in the US
6717000	6719000	March 27th in Japan however.
6719000	6721000	So probably soon thereafter.
6721000	6723000	Um
6723000	6725000	this is just you know kind of unfortunate
6725000	6727000	but um some of the promotion
6727000	6729000	for Street Fighter X Tekken caused
6729000	6731000	Yoshinori Ono to need medical
6731000	6733000	treatment which is um unfortunate.
6733000	6735000	Uh the producer of course
6735000	6737000	he's the producer of the Street Fighter series
6737000	6739000	and you know this new direction they're
6739000	6741000	going in here. He was at a
6741000	6743000	Street Fighter X Tekken event in South Korea and he
6743000	6745000	just collapsed. He had to go to the hospital.
6745000	6747000	Uh they did post Capcom on
6747000	6749000	their Street Fighter blog. Immediately after
6749000	6751000	a Street Fighter X Tekken event in Asia
6751000	6753000	the physical condition of Street Fighter X Tekken producer
6753000	6755000	Ono-Chin, that's the nickname
6755000	6757000	he goes by, rapidly deteriorated
6757000	6759000	and he collapsed. He was taken to the hospital and he
6759000	6761000	is currently not coming into work.
6761000	6763000	Luckily it sounds like something that's
6763000	6765000	easily treatable.
6765000	6767000	Luckily it also sounds like he didn't suffer
6767000	6769000	from exhaustion the same way that that one
6769000	6771000	guy did that's all over THC. I was just
6771000	6773000	gonna make that joke.
6773000	6775000	But uh
6775000	6777000	yeah it's not something to really joke
6777000	6779000	about in this guy's case so too bad.
6779000	6781000	Hope he feels better.
6781000	6783000	Yeah that's sad. However you might feel
6783000	6785000	about the game aside um
6785000	6787000	Well both did suffer exhaustion
6787000	6789000	while handling their fight sticks.
6789000	6791000	So for a game
6791000	6793000	coming out in Japan called
6793000	6795000	well actually I think it's coming out here too. It's by
6795000	6797000	Platinum Games
6797000	6799000	Anarchy Reigns.
6799000	6801000	Famitsu put out images that Bayonetta
6801000	6803000	is gonna be in the game.
6803000	6805000	No other news about it
6805000	6807000	just hi Bayonetta.
6807000	6809000	What else do you need besides
6809000	6811000	I don't know a sequel to Bayonetta? I know right.
6811000	6813000	And also amongst the
6813000	6815000	30 some odd games that were removed
6815000	6817000	from the Japanese Wii Virtual
6817000	6819000	Console uh
6819000	6821000	basically 4 Sonic games are gone.
6821000	6823000	Sonic 1 to Sonic and Knuckles is gone
6823000	6825000	as well as the uh Master System
6825000	6827000	version of Sonic 1.
6827000	6829000	Which is too bad cause you know it's impossible
6829000	6831000	to get Sonic 1 on any other platform.
6831000	6833000	Well there's
6833000	6835000	no I mean the Master System.
6835000	6837000	I know what you mean but you know what I mean.
6837000	6839000	But there's
6839000	6841000	no word about it in the US or Europe yet
6841000	6843000	but I'm sure it's gonna follow.
6843000	6845000	And then fans of ThinkGeek
6845000	6847000	who have I'm sure seen more and more
6847000	6849000	and more Portal stuff pop up there
6849000	6851000	I sure have including an inflatable
6851000	6853000	Sentry and a little uh talking
6853000	6855000	Sentry uh plushie that I totally want.
6855000	6857000	Um the Portal gun
6857000	6859000	is for sale for 140 bucks.
6859000	6861000	5,000 replicas have been made.
6861000	6863000	And somebody better buy me one for my birthday.
6863000	6865000	That's all I'm saying.
6865000	6867000	No secret what you want huh?
6867000	6869000	Just saying.
6869000	6871000	Birthdays next month.
6871000	6873000	Let's go to the FUGL Question
6873000	6875000	of the Week. We missed it last week but it's back tonight.
6875000	6877000	The FUGL Question of the Week.
6879000	6881000	Uh Facebook and
6881000	6883000	Google Plus get a question every week
6883000	6885000	and we read some of our favorite answers
6885000	6887000	here on the program for you
6887000	6889000	guys and if uh those in studio want to
6889000	6891000	answer. I don't know if they repeat the question
6891000	6893000	in advance. It's kind of a toughie. This is one that
6893000	6895000	takes a little bit of thought tonight.
6895000	6897000	Uh so we'll start at Google Plus
6897000	6899000	with Orange Lounge Radio.
6899000	6901000	FUGL Question of the Week. If you could go back and change
6901000	6903000	a classic games ending since
6903000	6905000	you know it's all the rage right now talking about changing
6905000	6907000	the ending of games. What ending would you change
6907000	6909000	and what would the new ending be?
6909000	6911000	And I said let's stick to classics because
6911000	6913000	we don't want to spoil any new games. So I
6913000	6915000	did force people to think classics. It's interesting
6915000	6917000	though. We got a lot of varied responses that
6917000	6919000	weren't, that kind of took the question in a different
6919000	6921000	direction. And uh Derek H.
6921000	6923000	starts us off on Google in that direction.
6923000	6925000	I want to go back to the days when
6925000	6927000	games didn't have endings.
6927000	6929000	The only time it ended was because the
6929000	6931000	machine broke or you ran out of quarters.
6931000	6933000	I bet there's some guy in Ohio that's
6933000	6935000	still playing River Raid after 25
6935000	6937000	years and he's only on his
6937000	6939000	second man.
6939000	6941000	Imagine some kid complaining after the planet
6941000	6943000	exploded in Stargate or when Pauline
6943000	6945000	kept getting kidnapped by Donkey Kong
6945000	6947000	or that the ambulance always passed you in
6947000	6949000	Turbo. That would never happen because
6949000	6951000	in those days, gamers
6951000	6953000	weren't spoiled little punks who need
6953000	6955000	closure after having pretend sex with an
6955000	6957000	alien.
6957000	6959000	So some pretty strong words
6959000	6961000	there about uh
6961000	6963000	back in my day, back in the old day.
6963000	6965000	That's true though. A lot of Atari
6965000	6967000	2600 games never ended.
6967000	6969000	Very few had an ending. You know the ending
6969000	6971000	the only game I can think of
6971000	6973000	a couple of them that actually
6973000	6975000	had endings. Oops
6975000	6977000	no. No Holik during the uh
6977000	6979000	question. Thank you. Um
6979000	6981000	Pitfall and Pitfall 2.
6981000	6983000	And at the end of Pitfall
6983000	6985000	it just stops. It freezes.
6985000	6987000	I don't think there's anything to do it. And the ending of
6987000	6989000	Pitfall 2, he jumps up
6989000	6991000	and down a lot. And you won.
6993000	6995000	It's because games back then
6995000	6997000	were trying to recreate the arcade experience
6997000	6999000	games today are
6999000	7001000	about touching you emotionally.
7003000	7005000	Alright uh going to Facebook
7005000	7007000	some of the answers there.
7007000	7009000	Blue 2 says that's a tough one. I can't
7009000	7011000	think of any ending I would change. However like
7011000	7013000	thousands of gamers out there
7013000	7015000	finished Half Life already Gabe.
7015000	7017000	So uh he kind of ignored the question
7017000	7019000	of the week and just said finish Half Life. But actually
7019000	7021000	Alan was telling me about how
7021000	7023000	Half Life 2
7023000	7025000	Episode 1 did kind of
7025000	7027000	go back and
7027000	7029000	patch a few things up from what was originally
7029000	7031000	out there for Half Life so
7031000	7033000	they've kind of tinkered with those
7033000	7035000	endings before. Um
7035000	7037000	Let's see
7037000	7039000	Jim H answers on Facebook
7039000	7041000	saying since I just beat it again yesterday
7041000	7043000	I would change the ending of Super Mario Brothers 2
7043000	7045000	so it isn't a dream
7045000	7047000	at the end. I know it
7047000	7049000	I know it was a different
7049000	7051000	game they just plugged in Mario
7051000	7053000	characters into but since they did end up
7053000	7055000	using enemies from the game in later sequels
7055000	7057000	it would be nice if it fit into the
7057000	7059000	continuity better. Oh yeah the
7059000	7061000	original it was all a dream ending
7061000	7063000	Mario 2 right?
7063000	7065000	Yeah. But it
7065000	7067000	doesn't fit well into the continuity when it's all a
7067000	7069000	dream. I like that idea. That's good.
7069000	7071000	Uh let's see Stan H
7071000	7073000	on Facebook says I'd
7073000	7075000	change the ending of the
7075000	7077000	I Said No Holic
7077000	7079000	Thank you
7079000	7081000	I'd change the ending of the original
7081000	7083000	Super Mario Brothers. I'd make it so that when
7083000	7085000	Mario saves Peach from Bowser
7085000	7087000	she tells her that he
7087000	7089000	I think he tells her that he is enrolling her in some
7089000	7091000	Taekwondo lessons with Chun-Li
7091000	7093000	so that when Bowser tries to kidnap her
7093000	7095000	at least she'd be able to put up a fight and she
7095000	7097000	wouldn't get kidnapped so damn frequently.
7097000	7099000	Nintendo wouldn't have to whore the Mario
7099000	7101000	series out so much. Remember
7101000	7103000	she doesn't fight with Kung Fu she fights
7103000	7105000	with emotions. That's right
7105000	7107000	Super Princess Peach. That's what we learned.
7107000	7109000	Lastly Robert C
7109000	7111000	on Facebook says I'd change the ending to
7111000	7113000	Mortal Kombat. The mandatory
7113000	7115000	final fight would be between Katana and
7115000	7117000	Sonia. They'd suddenly both swap
7117000	7119000	fighting styles to Brazilian Jutsu
7119000	7121000	in a big pool of mud
7121000	7123000	or jelly. The final scene would
7123000	7125000	obviously be a slow motion montage
7125000	7127000	of them moving from fighting to kissing.
7127000	7129000	Cue the 70's porn music.
7129000	7131000	Oh
7131000	7133000	you.
7133000	7135000	I see what you did
7135000	7137000	there. It'd be kinda hot.
7137000	7139000	Any classic
7139000	7141000	games you guys here in studio would want to change?
7141000	7143000	I know you haven't had a lot of time
7143000	7145000	to think about the answer. I
7145000	7147000	would say let's go back to Ghosts and
7147000	7149000	Goblins and give them proper grammar.
7149000	7151000	How's that sound?
7151000	7153000	That was part of the fun.
7153000	7155000	I guess that's true.
7155000	7157000	Um
7157000	7159000	I can't
7159000	7161000	really think of anything because you know what
7161000	7163000	I'm not a little bitch with
7163000	7165000	a sense of entitlement.
7167000	7169000	We're just having fun.
7169000	7171000	I will tell you which
7171000	7173000	game needs another
7173000	7175000	different ending. The Legend of Zelda
7175000	7177000	it needs a third quest.
7177000	7179000	Actually
7179000	7181000	I would give a better ending to Zelda
7181000	7183000	to the past after how fucking hard that game
7183000	7185000	is. Kinda get a shitty ending.
7185000	7187000	That game was epic.
7187000	7189000	I mean yeah don't get me wrong it's a fucking tremendous
7189000	7191000	game but kind of a crab ending.
7191000	7193000	Dude.
7193000	7195000	They really, you know what would be awesome
7195000	7197000	totally on tangent here.
7197000	7199000	Is they should totally go with the
7199000	7201000	Little Big Planet style to
7201000	7203000	the Legend of Zelda games. You know how they have
7203000	7205000	a ton of ROM hacks and stuff like that with custom levels
7205000	7207000	for the Legend of Zelda. Why not have
7207000	7209000	a Legend of Zelda game that was like Link to the Past
7209000	7211000	but with a ton of fucking custom games
7211000	7213000	in there. Oh I know because no one would ever
7213000	7215000	play your new Zelda games because they'd be
7215000	7217000	too busy enthralled with
7217000	7219000	the custom made stuff.
7219000	7221000	You want the Legend of Little Big Planet?
7221000	7223000	I want the Legend
7223000	7225000	of Zelda with a really kick ass
7225000	7227000	editor
7227000	7229000	that's officially sanctioned. I'm trying to
7229000	7231000	think of just the endings of different games
7231000	7233000	and really I keep thinking back
7233000	7235000	to how epic many of them were.
7235000	7237000	You know like Hitler's head blowing up
7237000	7239000	at the end of Bionic Commando
7239000	7241000	or
7241000	7243000	you know
7243000	7245000	how you felt bad
7245000	7247000	for the baby Metroid when you know
7247000	7249000	it got killed
7249000	7251000	and
7251000	7253000	it's all kinds of sad-facedness.
7253000	7255000	I would go back and make sure
7255000	7257000	that every Silent Hill game had a dog
7257000	7259000	ending. Yes. I would
7259000	7261000	you know what actually I would change the ending
7261000	7263000	to Shattered Memories because I
7263000	7265000	wanted to like that game a whole lot.
7265000	7267000	In fact
7267000	7269000	I think that the next Silent
7269000	7271000	Hill game should be directed by Peter Molyneaux
7271000	7273000	and you should play as the dog.
7273000	7275000	Should be
7275000	7277000	called Silent Dog. Alright now you guys are getting
7277000	7279000	crazy. Let's move on with some more game news.
7279000	7281000	Yeah but wait wait wait Silent Dog
7281000	7283000	has a cat
7283000	7285000	let me finish let me finish has a cat ending.
7287000	7289000	I love the idea of a game called
7289000	7291000	Silent Dog.
7291000	7293000	Where the
7293000	7295000	This might be a dream game.
7295000	7297000	Hold on. Hold on. Alright dream game.
7297000	7299000	Silent Dog. The dog must confront
7299000	7301000	you know the
7301000	7303000	demons of its past you know like
7303000	7305000	all the legs they've peed on
7305000	7307000	chasing its tail and
7307000	7309000	yeah being chased by a
7309000	7311000	faceless postman with claw
7311000	7313000	hands. Tires that they can
7313000	7315000	just never catch.
7315000	7317000	Frisbees of doom with razor blades
7317000	7319000	on them. And mandatory
7319000	7321000	Kiryamoka is forced
7321000	7323000	to do all the music.
7323000	7325000	Cause it's
7325000	7327000	just not a Silent Hill game. Really it should just be
7327000	7329000	the dog song throughout the whole game.
7329000	7331000	Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof
7331000	7333000	That you know we need we need
7333000	7335000	to we need to play that Rob. I don't think I have
7335000	7337000	the dog getting music readily accessible.
7337000	7339000	Yes you do. You have
7339000	7341000	YouTube. Yes you do.
7341000	7343000	You know
7343000	7345000	I would love to see like the
7345000	7347000	saga of the UFO ending Silent Hill
7347000	7349000	as a UFO.
7349000	7351000	That would just be great.
7351000	7353000	Uh hold on I'm
7353000	7355000	finding it for you guys.
7355000	7357000	It was you the whole time?
7357000	7359000	Praying there's no uh
7359000	7361000	There it is.
7361000	7383000	It would be awesome.
7383000	7385000	But we can't forget about the most important
7385000	7387000	part of Silent Dog.
7387000	7399000	Which I think is at the very end of the song.
7399000	7401000	I like that he growls
7401000	7403000	at that one horrible guy.
7403000	7409000	Ugh this is so great.
7409000	7425000	Listen to Vampire wants to know this is the canon ending to Silent Hill 2 right?
7425000	7427000	Yes. Yes absolutely.
7427000	7431000	Was it Silent Hill 3 that had like the um
7431000	7433000	Here's the most important scene in the entire game.
7433000	7435000	Hold on.
7435000	7439000	Oh.
7439000	7441000	Does it do the chorus one more time?
7441000	7443000	Yes. Oh god.
7443000	7451000	I was wondering if the voice actor has been changed for the dog in the HD collection.
7451000	7459000	Here it is.
7459000	7461000	That's right the all important sex scene.
7461000	7467000	Where the adults are having sex and the dog is just forced to watch with that blank expression on their face.
7467000	7469000	Like what are my owners doing?
7469000	7475000	You know actually one of my live journal icons is the dog and it says game over.
7475000	7481000	You know as much as I love the dog ending I still like the um the Silent Hill theme.
7481000	7483000	Silent Hill. Silent Hill.
7483000	7485000	From one of the UFO endings.
7485000	7489000	Anyhow I don't know how we got on this topic but Silent Dog make it happen.
7489000	7491000	Woof woof woof.
7491000	7493000	So we were going to get into news at some point right?
7493000	7495000	News?
7495000	7497000	Yeah we were talking about Silent Dog though so that is very important.
7497000	7499000	Um.
7499000	7501000	Oh our dream game.
7501000	7503000	Silent Dog.
7503000	7513000	So someone needs to explain to me once again why we have these online passes because I swear it's just like I never hear anything going smoothly with them.
7513000	7515000	I mean I don't understand but whatever.
7515000	7524000	So Ninja Gaiden 3 came out this week and um yeah apparently no one could redeem the online passes for that game.
7524000	7532000	Not even the reviewers could redeem the online passes because they had forgot to flip the switch to allow those passes to be redeemed.
7532000	7534000	Ha ha.
7534000	7540000	Um so yes none of the codes worked at all at launch.
7540000	7548000	I think they work now. They may be working soon but as of you know earlier this week they were not working at all.
7548000	7550000	So fun.
7550000	7551000	Um.
7551000	7562000	And then on top of that MLB 12 the show another game with an online pass also had its issues.
7562000	7574000	Apparently the Playstation 3 and Vita versions had a problem if the Vita players tried to redeem the online pass they couldn't do it via the Vita.
7574000	7577000	They could only do it if they had a Playstation 3.
7577000	7584000	But here's the funny thing if they did it via the PS3 it unlocked online play for the PS3 version that they don't own.
7584000	7594000	So uh yeah apparently they were working out problems with that.
7594000	7596000	But I don't know.
7596000	7597000	It's interesting I guess.
7597000	7601000	And then last but not least there is one more game that had an online pass.
7601000	7605000	EA Sports MMA.
7605000	7608000	It had an online pass and it had online play.
7608000	7610000	It wasn't a very popular game.
7610000	7614000	And on April 13th they will be shutting down the server for it.
7614000	7617000	So it just.
7617000	7619000	It was on the failure board. Sorry.
7619000	7621000	It seemed appropriate.
7621000	7625000	Other games that are going to be shut are getting their servers shut down as well.
7625000	7630000	EA Create game which was supposed to take on LittleBigPlanet and that sucked.
7630000	7635000	And EA Sports Active 2 which I didn't even know that had online.
7635000	7643000	And the Xbox Live Arcade game Spare Parts is also going to be getting its servers shut down.
7643000	7645000	On top of that Boom Blocks for the Wii.
7645000	7647000	Burnout Revenge for Xbox 360.
7647000	7649000	Damn it I own Boom Blocks.
7649000	7653000	EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp for the Wii.
7653000	7655000	FIFA 10 for the PSP and the Wii.
7655000	7659000	Godfather 2 for the PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
7659000	7662000	Need for Speed Pro Street on PS3 and 360.
7662000	7668000	And the Saboteur for PS3 and 360 is going to lose the access to the Midnight Club.
7668000	7672000	Which is some exclusive club but that was in the game if you preordered.
7672000	7681000	And then on the 31st they're shutting down Battlefield 3 Aftershock for the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch.
7681000	7683000	You know that game they just released.
7683000	7685000	And a few other iPad games.
7685000	7689000	But you know that $10 that funds that online pass.
7689000	7693000	It costs a lot to shut a server down.
7693000	7695000	Yeah must be nice I hope they're refunding money.
7695000	7699000	Oh of course they're not refunding money because you got your online play.
7699000	7703000	But just remember when you're paying for $10 for online for some of these games.
7703000	7708000	If it's not popular they're just going to shut the server down.
7708000	7713000	At least it wasn't as quickly as like say you know.
7713000	7717000	Oh what was that one MMO that was like Grand Theft Auto?
7717000	7719000	That they just re-released for free.
7719000	7721000	APB?
7721000	7723000	Yeah at least it wasn't that quick.
7726000	7731000	Dart Tetsuya in our chatroom says I called that section the online pass blooper reel.
7731000	7735000	I have to admit when I was reading all this news all I could hear in my head was.
7735000	7743000	Music
7743000	7747000	I mean those poor bastards that are buying some of those games used.
7747000	7749000	And now they're just going to be offline.
7749000	7751000	I mean shutting down the servers is nothing new.
7751000	7757000	But now we have a game that people paid $10 to play online and it's not forever.
7757000	7761000	And I understand that these games may not have been popular or whatever.
7761000	7767000	And I'm sorry that's nice that it might not have been popular.
7767000	7773000	But I don't know I mean I guess eventually it has to happen.
7773000	7775000	Figure out a way to consolidate then.
7775000	7778000	I mean I realize I'm talking out my ass here.
7778000	7782000	But shouldn't there be a way where maybe you could consolidate some of the servers.
7782000	7787000	And just have a computer that runs for whatever occasional game.
7787000	7789000	You know like combine servers.
7789000	7792000	Yeah I mean I can't imagine that like you know EA Sports MMA.
7792000	7795000	And the reason they shut them down is because not many people are playing them right now.
7795000	7797000	But there's still a few people playing them.
7797000	7800000	Just drop them out of servers that you have.
7800000	7802000	Drop of the one.
7802000	7804000	You can only have one person play online at a time.
7804000	7806000	Well I mean still that's better than none at all.
7806000	7808000	And especially for people that paid.
7808000	7811000	Just unfortunate.
7811000	7814000	Alright well anyhow here's something else that's unfortunate.
7814000	7817000	And kind of along the same topic of something we were just talking about.
7817000	7820000	You know the Silent Hill HD collection just recently came out.
7820000	7824000	And apparently it's getting very very mixed polarized reviews.
7824000	7826000	I haven't played it myself yet.
7826000	7828000	So I can't say one way or the other.
7828000	7832000	But you've got some people that are like yay it's Silent Hill it's in HD it looks great.
7832000	7835000	And some people are like the game is fucking missing fog.
7835000	7837000	The frame rate is hideous.
7837000	7839000	The voice acting is terrible.
7839000	7841000	And it's gotten to the point.
7841000	7843000	I don't know if you want to call this entitlement or what.
7843000	7847000	Amazon.com is no longer stocking the game.
7847000	7849000	That just came out two weeks ago.
7849000	7854000	Because there are too many user reports that there is a problem with the item.
7854000	7857000	So Amazon.com is doing an investigation to see if it's problematic.
7857000	7859000	It didn't even come out two weeks ago. It came out last week.
7859000	7861000	Oh my gosh.
7861000	7863000	And you know what though?
7863000	7865000	I have to agree with them as far as the fog thing goes.
7865000	7872000	Because even the art director or whatever said hey we use a lot of transparent textures for fog.
7872000	7877000	And you can even see there's a lot of objects that don't quite go all the way.
7877000	7881000	They're not complete objects because the fog would normally be obscuring them.
7881000	7885000	And so without the fog it looks like oh hey look I've got these telephone wires that just disappear.
7885000	7888000	What the hell? That doesn't make any sense.
7888000	7892000	But what's interesting I tried to go to like I wanted to see what the user feedback was.
7892000	7896000	So I went to Amazon.com to read some of the reviews and it's still kind of divided.
7896000	7903000	And like I don't know if that's like fanboys versus you know or what it is but it's very divided.
7903000	7907000	Because for like let me go to Metacritic real fast and do Silent Hill.
7907000	7913000	Now it should be noted the PS3 one is getting more flack than the Xbox 360 one seems to be.
7913000	7915000	So just to kind of put that out there.
7915000	7917000	Yeah the user score 5.1.
7917000	7921000	Six positive reviews. Five negative reviews.
7921000	7925000	So you have some people that are giving it tens going I don't understand why people are hating on this.
7925000	7930000	Konami says relive the two best horror games of all time, strong graphics.
7930000	7937000	And then you get some people that are bombing it putting the game has far too many bugs to recommend to first timers or veterans alike.
7937000	7940000	And it's interesting you look at the scores.
7940000	7942000	Okay eleven people have reviewed the game.
7942000	7944000	Here are the scores.
7944000	7949000	Zero. Zero. Ten. Ten. Zero. Ten. Nine. Zero.
7949000	7951000	And it's funny is that you have.
7951000	7954000	Nobody's in the middle. They're either all the way here or all the way there.
7954000	7959000	You have to. That's a perfect example right there of what's wrong with review scores.
7959000	7963000	And what's wrong with review scores by just average people sometimes.
7963000	7966000	Because those people are obviously fanboys.
7966000	7970000	Because a game. Trust me that game doesn't warrant a ten and it doesn't warrant a zero either.
7970000	7973000	It's just. It's ridiculous.
7973000	7976000	Now to be fair the critics.
7976000	7979000	The you know legitimate whatever you want to call it.
7979000	7981000	Critics. Although I think that's a shitty name.
7981000	7985000	Have given it. There's only three reviews up so far which is strange.
7985000	7987000	I thought more outlets have reviewed it.
7987000	7990000	But you have a ninety, an eighty, and a seventy.
7990000	7992000	So two good and one average.
7992000	7995000	I think it's been more average for sure.
7995000	7997000	I think that's what I've been reading out on the internet too.
7997000	8000000	It's kind of like if you've never played Silent Hill.
8000000	8004000	And the old games are too hard to get now then go ahead and play this.
8004000	8008000	But otherwise get your PS2 and go hook up the old games because they were better.
8008000	8010000	I don't know.
8010000	8013000	Rama in chat says how the hell they fucked this game up I'll never know.
8013000	8016000	Well not putting fog in there.
8016000	8020000	And I think was that only on the PS3 version or something like that?
8020000	8023000	Like they were saying oh well we had trouble rendering the fog.
8023000	8027000	Why would you have trouble rendering the fog on the Playstation 3?
8027000	8031000	Here's my other concern. Why did they feel the need then to put this game out now?
8031000	8035000	It's not like we have a shortage of Silent Hill in the world right now.
8035000	8039000	We just had Downpour. We're gonna have the Vita game coming out.
8039000	8042000	Why does this need to be out right now?
8042000	8044000	And okay let's just say that...
8044000	8045000	Go back and make it right.
8045000	8048000	Let's just say for whatever reason okay we can't do the fog.
8048000	8056000	Did anybody that was QA'ing that game realize hey it looks a little fucking weird that something that's supposed to not be there.
8056000	8060000	Or something that's supposed to be obscured by fog is just stopping in the middle of the air.
8060000	8062000	That doesn't make any sense.
8062000	8067000	Maybe we should I don't know recreate the object or something like that instead of porting all the assets over and going.
8067000	8069000	Eh whatever close enough.
8069000	8071000	I mean seriously come on.
8071000	8077000	Just like spend the two seconds it would take to recreate the object or I don't know go back and fix it.
8077000	8079000	Was the Metal Gear collection this bad?
8079000	8082000	It was fuzzy looking. I didn't like the look of it.
8082000	8084000	But I don't think it was this bad.
8084000	8088000	I honestly haven't seen because Dan keeps playing the MSX versions.
8088000	8090000	Does it really have the MSX games in there?
8090000	8091000	Yes.
8091000	8092000	In English?
8092000	8093000	Yes.
8093000	8094000	Nice.
8094000	8096000	I think it got the Metal Gear Solid collection got good reviews.
8096000	8101000	Sg100Matt in our chatroom says it's a fucking Playstation 3 how can it not render fog?
8101000	8103000	That's a great question.
8103000	8106000	Why is fog on the PS3 difficult?
8106000	8111000	Fog in the same way they did it on the PS2 is probably difficult but ok.
8111000	8115000	Well take the time to redo it if you're gonna do this.
8115000	8116000	That's exactly my problem.
8116000	8119000	Just like those fucking people at Capcom.
8119000	8123000	They're complaining well we didn't know how to do local team play.
8123000	8127000	In Street Fighter X2 we didn't want to bother to learn that.
8127000	8132000	Boo fucking hoo that you couldn't spend the time to figure out how to program your game.
8132000	8135000	If you can't do any god damn programming then quit.
8135000	8139000	Because seriously you're of no use to us if you can't make a game.
8139000	8143000	Oh we had to make new assets for this game.
8143000	8148000	You mean I couldn't just straight port the shit over and up the res the textures?
8148000	8150000	Yeah you may have to do a little bit of work.
8150000	8154000	Porkchop in our chatroom says maybe we'll have a DLC bundle.
8154000	8156000	We'll call it the Fog and Dog Pack.
8156000	8157000	Maybe.
8157000	8163000	AcidicVampire says maybe someone should file an issue with the Better Business Bureau and get the fog eventually implemented.
8163000	8167000	Don't give people ideas.
8167000	8170000	But it's important to say this though.
8170000	8172000	Again the reviews were half and half.
8172000	8175000	So not everybody's hating on it.
8175000	8180000	And Konami they've had issues with the Silent Hill series.
8180000	8181000	They really have.
8181000	8182000	I mean.
8182000	8186000	Well Akira Yomoka going somewhere else didn't help.
8186000	8188000	Yes that's true.
8188000	8192000	I mean and it's not our show role but you know and as I mentioned weeks ago.
8192000	8194000	The Vita version has been delayed.
8194000	8197000	That's right again right to May or something?
8197000	8201000	Well the rumor is May right now but I don't think there's actually a date yet for it.
8201000	8202000	Wow.
8202000	8205000	But yeah the Vita version's been delayed.
8205000	8206000	They have one more chance.
8206000	8208000	Konami has one more chance at this HD collection thing.
8208000	8212000	They've got the Zone of Enders collection coming out in the fall.
8212000	8214000	So cross fingers.
8214000	8221000	Well if the Metal Gear 1 was pretty good and the Silent Hill 1 was not so good then maybe ZOE will be in the middle.
8221000	8224000	And we're talking like porting different engines over.
8224000	8226000	So maybe that has some issues.
8226000	8228000	But come on.
8228000	8229000	Try a little harder.
8229000	8236000	When did you think I mean come on you don't see any problem with hey you know that telephone pole just disappears.
8236000	8243000	You know like or hey that part of the fence is missing it just goes nowhere because you had fog obscuring it before.
8243000	8248000	It does also make me worry like if they can't render fucking fog like granted it's another company we're talking about here.
8248000	8252000	But is that Final Fantasy 10 HD remake gonna blow?
8252000	8255000	And it's not that they couldn't render fog they couldn't render enough fog.
8255000	8257000	Like certain textures they couldn't render.
8257000	8258000	Needs more fog.
8258000	8262000	Seriously it's like how did you fuck this up?
8262000	8267000	Transparent textures the PS3 just can't do that.
8267000	8271000	Or Konami doesn't know how to do that.
8271000	8277000	Alright let's move into the mailbag.
8277000	8280000	Speaking of strong opinions and so forth.
8280000	8282000	Every week you guys send us emails.
8282000	8288000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and picks.
8288000	8290000	Oh she got a little sticky tonight.
8290000	8293000	Picks a few of her favorite mails to read to us here in studio.
8293000	8294000	All two of them.
8294000	8297000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com email us.
8297000	8300000	Greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8300000	8304000	Last year when I bought my beast video card for my PC it came with Civ 5.
8304000	8308000	Rob I'm sorry but as much as I tried I was always so bored by it.
8308000	8309000	Get out.
8309000	8312000	But last week I found the answer.
8312000	8313000	Quick pace.
8313000	8316000	Ever since I found that little option I can't stop playing the game.
8316000	8317000	Alright you can stay.
8317000	8321000	I used to be a huge German board game player and this is a very involved board game to
8321000	8322000	me.
8322000	8325000	And it was because you always talk about how great the game is.
8325000	8326000	Thank you very much for that.
8326000	8328000	Also I have a request for OLR.
8328000	8332000	My wife of seven years just had her birthday and I was hoping that at the end of reading
8332000	8336000	this email you could wish a very happy birthday to french fry.
8336000	8340000	As always you are an integral part of my week your loyal turtle and filly series turtle.
8340000	8343000	Happy birthday french fry.
8343000	8345000	What if I'm more of a fan of onion rings?
8345000	8347000	Can we give a shout out to onion rings?
8347000	8348000	Don't be a hoe.
8348000	8351000	Alright happy birthday french fry.
8351000	8352000	Happy birthday french fry.
8352000	8357000	I like the sea salted french fries a lot at Wendy's just saying.
8357000	8358000	Last email.
8358000	8363000	Is there any relation to french toast?
8363000	8367000	This is me staring at Rob with a, you didn't just say that face.
8367000	8370000	This is me recycling the happy music.
8370000	8371000	Hearts.
8371000	8374000	I'm making hearts at Rob now.
8374000	8376000	Boy not eating makes you a bitch.
8376000	8377000	Does it?
8377000	8379000	I have lots of energy.
8379000	8382000	I've been drinking so much.
8382000	8383000	I'm just fucking with you.
8383000	8388000	All the times by the way that I have been quiet I've been in the bathroom.
8388000	8390000	I'm doing nothing but drinking broth.
8390000	8391000	Okay.
8391000	8392000	Robert HM here.
8392000	8394000	I'm peeing nothing but broth.
8394000	8397000	I said drinking nothing but broth.
8397000	8398000	Never mind.
8398000	8399000	Next email yes.
8399000	8403000	I never heard your thoughts on the Muppets DLC pack for LittleBigPlanet 2.
8403000	8407000	Myself I enjoyed it but haven't gotten to sit down to get everything yet.
8407000	8409000	Relatedly, is that a word relatedly?
8409000	8410000	Sure.
8410000	8416000	How do you feel about the level pack DLC for the game and possibly others staying hosted on the server?
8416000	8421000	Such as that the levels out at the time were inaccessible during the PSN outage.
8421000	8428000	I guess the only positive is that one doesn't have to wait for hundreds of megabytes at PSN speeds to download.
8428000	8431000	It does update the game itself though.
8431000	8436000	Or is the content now being loaded in and I have no idea what I'm writing about.
8436000	8443000	The LittleBigPlanet stuff is generally fun but frustrating content especially trying to get all the prize items.
8443000	8445000	I actually had no idea.
8445000	8447000	Okay confession time.
8447000	8449000	I loved LittleBigPlanet 1.
8449000	8451000	I still haven't bought LittleBigPlanet 2.
8451000	8457000	I'm waiting for it to go on sale and every time I check it's like still like 50, 60 bucks.
8457000	8463000	Granted it's the game of the year edition that comes with all the extra stuff but I'm kind of waiting for it to get a little cheaper before I buy it.
8463000	8464000	I just totally missed it.
8464000	8469000	It came out at a time when a ton of other games came out so I never got around to getting it.
8469000	8477000	And I want to get it so I can check out this Muppets DLC and all that so I'm not going to sit here and make up an opinion on something I haven't played.
8477000	8481000	But I'm still interested in checking it out. I'll put it that way.
8481000	8486000	As far as the server end stuff, I had no idea that was going on.
8486000	8492000	That's weird though. Why would you not...
8492000	8499000	I don't get it because you either have to download it to your drive or you have to download it to play it server side even.
8499000	8502000	It's not like it's doing an on live thing where it's streaming.
8502000	8503000	It's like...
8503000	8504000	I don't think it could handle it.
8504000	8505000	That's weird.
8505000	8518000	That sounds very like Final Fight Magic Sword locks you out when PSN is down type of thing to maybe prevent hacking and cracking like what we're seeing happen with Street Fighter X Tekken.
8518000	8519000	And that's...
8519000	8521000	You got something about that too coming up.
8521000	8526000	Sony needs to stop assuming that PSN is always going to be up because it's not.
8528000	8529000	Anyhow.
8530000	8531000	Very strange.
8531000	8535000	So anyway. That's the last email.
8535000	8536000	Alrighty.
8537000	8541000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to send us emails in the future.
8541000	8543000	Meanwhile, Loki.
8543000	8548000	Alright. Let's talk a little bit about hacking.
8548000	8559000	Not necessarily hacking of things that some people might find controversial but fan translated stuff for example.
8559000	8569000	For example, there's two games that recently have been kind of hacked to translate them into English because no English versions were made available.
8569000	8575000	One of those being Tales of Vesperia on the PS3.
8575000	8581000	Tales of Vesperia of course came out on Xbox 360 in the US but never on the PS3.
8581000	8590000	The PS3 version, which I believe was superior to the Xbox 360 version and had a lot more content to that, was available in Japan.
8590000	8605000	So what people are doing of course is hacking the game to actually use the Xbox 360 translation to translate the text in the PS3 version and of course doing their own translation for the new content.
8605000	8614000	And it's funny enough they said that actually the Xbox 360 translated version text was actually hidden in the PS3 code because you know you don't clean up your code.
8614000	8618000	So they're working on translating that.
8618000	8625000	They were originally doing the Tales of Graces but since that actually did get localized over here they stopped working on that when that announcement was made.
8625000	8639000	And I guess of course they're saying that this will have a patch to the game and of course it will require you to have a jailbroken PS3 with a firmware of 3.55 or lower.
8639000	8645000	And they're going to release documentation on how to patch your game if you wish to do so.
8645000	8660000	And then on top of that there of course is another fan translated thing that actually finished and that is Fatal Frame 4 Mask of the Lunar Eclipse has been translated into English for the Nintendo Wii.
8660000	8681000	And there's a big ol' effort with that. Of course you have to patch a version of the game that you have dumped to an ISO or you can always download a pre-patch version and run it from your hard drive because they made it so freaking easy to do that.
8681000	8684000	But very interesting.
8684000	8692000	I don't usually endorse the piracy of games but if they're not going to release it here, they're not going to give you the opportunity, what other choice do you have?
8692000	8715000	Exactly. And if you had it before then you might as well translate it into English so you can actually understand it. Also it should be noted that they have fully translated it into Spanish and German and French translations are about halfway done as well.
8715000	8720000	So it's pretty interesting.
8720000	8730000	Alright. Well Microsoft has put out an interesting patent. You know we sometimes get what's coming in the gaming industry from what's going on with patents.
8730000	8740000	And Microsoft has patented this weird helmet device. It's a laser scanning virtual image display and it will display an image very close to your eyes.
8740000	8751000	Apparently by doing this the two displays could be in a helmet and you'd be able to see stereoscopic 3D. It's kind of a similar trick to what the 3DS uses except it's putting those images right in front of your freaking face.
8751000	8759000	It doesn't necessarily mean that this is limited to video games. Remember Microsoft is a PC company as well so it could be something that's used with general PC games.
8759000	8768000	But it could be used in aviation as stated in the patent. Maybe this is going to be like a bitchin' flight simulator add-on or what do they call it now? They changed the name.
8768000	8769000	Microsoft Flight.
8769000	8772000	You know what? It's the Lawnmower Man.
8772000	8784000	Actually I remember like 20 years ago renting from the local store. Don't ask why we did this but we rented a headset VR display.
8784000	8790000	And all it was you put this headset on it fucking looked like something on Lawnmower Man. It was just a TV right in front of your eyes.
8790000	8794000	And it was the amazing VR display you could play Super Nintendo games on.
8794000	8803000	They had a VR type thing over at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz and you could play versions of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake.
8803000	8814000	And I actually played Quake on that and it was terrible. It was like I had my eyes straight up to my PC screen and that was it.
8814000	8815000	Oh go ahead.
8815000	8819000	I was going to say yeah it's so immersive with the 640x480 graphics.
8819000	8825000	And there's a 100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrady.com brings up the Virtual Boy. It was kind of a similar gag too.
8825000	8831000	This image may be partially transparent so you can see the world around you.
8831000	8835000	So that way you can play your game and this sounds like something out of a giant picture.
8835000	8836000	It's the game from Star Trek.
8836000	8837000	So you can see the people laughing at you.
8837000	8840000	No seriously from Next Generation where they had the little thing that shot lasers in their eyes. Oh.
8840000	8844000	So you can see the people laughing at you for wearing a giant helmet.
8844000	8851000	Oh my god Chiggers at the exact same time you said that Chiggers in chat said it's like that Star Trek Next Generation episode and everybody will be zombies.
8851000	8854000	You guys are both really big nerds.
8854000	8858000	So.
8858000	8860000	Alright so there you go.
8860000	8864000	Before you even say oh this is the next Xbox.
8864000	8865000	No.
8865000	8866000	Sit down. It's not.
8866000	8869000	No we've been down that territory.
8869000	8870000	OMG Microsoft Portable.
8870000	8871000	No.
8871000	8872000	Sit down.
8872000	8876000	You know that Wii prototype or the one that was fake would have been pretty fucking awesome.
8876000	8877000	Mm hmm.
8877000	8878000	VR.
8878000	8879000	DarkSakura what do you have for us.
8879000	8884000	Well as mentioned earlier Capcom is cracking down.
8884000	8891000	Basically a statement and I actually did read this on the Capcom Unity forums.
8891000	8898000	But they're talking about people using the download character.
8898000	8902000	The downloadable characters on disk using hacked Xboxes.
8902000	8912000	And one of the big guys at Capcom Unity said quite ballsy for folks to be taking hacked Xbox 360s on live where they are detectable.
8912000	8918000	And they're also saying in any event we have open channels of communication with Microsoft on these issues Friday night.
8918000	8923000	And then they started asking people to take screenshots and record videos of the offenders.
8923000	8926000	But they closed the video and said oh we'll catch them ourselves.
8926000	8931000	They do realize that you can't take screenshots of a fucking Xbox 360 right?
8931000	8932000	Yes you can.
8932000	8934000	Well you can if you're a developer.
8934000	8938000	But what if you have one of those capture cards?
8938000	8941000	Okay well that's a capture card but I'm talking about like you can't just.
8941000	8946000	It's not like the Vita where I can push two buttons and take a screenshot.
8946000	8947000	And it wouldn't.
8947000	8951000	And there's iPhones and cameras.
8951000	8954000	And we wouldn't have this problem if they didn't put the DLC on the fucking disk.
8954000	8955000	I agree.
8955000	8961000	And this smells a lot like CD Projekt Red a few months ago.
8961000	8963000	We're gonna catch those hackers.
8963000	8965000	And we're gonna let the hackers go.
8965000	8968000	They're gonna be Batman. I'm Batman.
8968000	8975000	Well I mean I do agree with the point that you gotta be pretty bold to play this shit online.
8975000	8978000	Again it's kinda that gamer mentality you see sometimes.
8978000	8984000	And some gamers where it's like I gotta be the first and I gotta I'm gonna show these guys online that my penis is the biggest.
8984000	8987000	And I'm using characters you're not supposed to have.
8987000	8990000	You know it's a little bit silly.
8990000	8993000	Look at my E-Pain.
8993000	8994000	Exactly.
8994000	8999000	But it's kind of a dumb thing to take it online where you know they're watching.
8999000	9002000	I like what Chigurh says. I will hit you with a coelacanth.
9002000	9003000	I'm moving on.
9003000	9004000	Logie.
9004000	9009000	So this is I'm sure a disappointment to some of the people who are actually playing.
9009000	9015000	But Zynga has purchased the company OMG Pop. The makers of the game Draw Something.
9015000	9019000	And of course they purchased them for quite a bit of money.
9019000	9031000	Including approximately $200 million between I guess a cash deal and $30 million or so for employee retention payments.
9031000	9038000	And of course you know they're gonna be working with them to create some new games I guess.
9038000	9041000	In related news I deleted Draw Something this week.
9041000	9046000	I was playing it pretty hardcore for a little bit. I had like 15 games going at once. It was crazy.
9046000	9049000	And I said nope I'm done.
9049000	9053000	By the way there's another iPhone app you might want to check out if you are in the same boat I am.
9053000	9055000	It's called Sharadium.
9055000	9058000	C-H-A-R-A-D-I-U-M.
9058000	9061000	It was free at least for a little bit. I don't know if it still is but you can check it out.
9061000	9065000	Now before you go saying well Rob if you don't like Zynga because they rip games off.
9065000	9067000	Why are you recommending another game that's a rip off of Draw Something?
9067000	9070000	Because it is a little bit different. It's not like a direct rip off.
9070000	9077000	Unfortunately one of the best parts of the game which is the whole Wheel of Fortune round isn't really in there.
9077000	9080000	It's more of a chat type guessing thing.
9080000	9086000	But there's more paint styles and it's more of a robust paint program than Draw Something was.
9086000	9088000	You don't have to pay for extra colors and shit.
9088000	9090000	You have to pay for extra colors?
9090000	9096000	Oh yeah and Draw Something if you wanted more than just red. What was it? Red, blue, yellow and black were the only colors you could use.
9096000	9104000	If you wanted green and purple you either saved up enough tokens from winning games or you had to pay 99 cents to get them.
9104000	9105000	That's hilarious.
9105000	9109000	Oh yeah and I knew people that had tons of colors.
9109000	9112000	Well it's sad.
9112000	9114000	You know what? Your money spent by which you won.
9114000	9115000	And you know what though?
9115000	9120000	Until Zynga knew I spent 99 cents buying the legit add free Draw Something.
9120000	9123000	Because I'm like this is a great new game I want to support this.
9123000	9125000	And then this happened.
9125000	9134000	Honestly I can't fault some of the employees at Zynga because they're just working but it's obviously the higher ups.
9134000	9136000	It's the ones that are making the decisions.
9136000	9137000	The executives.
9137000	9145000	I actually have some friends that work at Zynga and there's some really talented people which I'm like what are you doing working at Zynga but hey whatever.
9145000	9147000	Well it's just like how we talk about GameStop.
9147000	9152000	I know lots of people that work at GameStop that are great people and they're just people trying to get by and make a living.
9152000	9156000	I don't have a problem in the world with people that work at GameStop.
9156000	9161000	You know and I even will go so far as to say they have some of the toughest jobs in the world and I respect that.
9161000	9166000	It's some of the decisions that are made at a corporate level at GameStop that I have a huge problem with.
9166000	9167000	Yeah.
9167000	9168000	That's the issue.
9168000	9171000	So you know I imagine it's a similar situation.
9171000	9177000	Why else do you think that Dan keeps getting class action lawsuit checks after he hasn't been working there for six years?
9177000	9179000	Wow.
9179000	9181000	Just saying.
9181000	9182000	Very interesting.
9182000	9183000	I want some class action lawsuit checks.
9183000	9184000	How do I get in on that?
9184000	9186000	Work for GameStop.
9186000	9189000	Well they might try to go the other way around and sue me.
9189000	9191000	Alright.
9191000	9200000	Anyhow one more story for you guys tonight and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but not just yet.
9200000	9206000	We have one more story for you guys tonight and it's another fucking Kickstarter.
9206000	9207000	This is a trend.
9207000	9209000	I'm not liking this trend.
9209000	9213000	I'm just going to say it's just too much.
9213000	9217000	Everybody in the world wants a piece of this Kickstarter thing and it's like I'm sorry.
9217000	9220000	It's kind of like those that got in on it early like the double fine and stuff.
9220000	9222000	Good for them but now it's just getting old.
9222000	9227000	However there may be some folks that are really into this so good for you guys.
9227000	9229000	Tex Murphy may make a comeback.
9229000	9234000	Big Finish Games is going to start up a Kickstarter page on May 15th.
9234000	9237000	That seems weird to me that you'd announce like six weeks in advance.
9237000	9245000	We're going to start a Kickstarter but alright they're going to round up funding for a sixth game in this Full Motion Video Adventure series.
9245000	9247000	Oh God I remember these games.
9247000	9249000	Wow.
9249000	9255000	On May 15th they're going to go live and you can donate to all this and the guy who plays Tex Murphy is on board.
9255000	9262000	And you can actually see him in a YouTube video where they're actually trying to kind of hawk the whole Kickstarter event.
9262000	9272000	So I don't know it's like I don't want to hate Kickstarter but I just hate the trend thing is what it is.
9272000	9278000	And I don't hate every campaign on Kickstarter but there's some that are pretty gross.
9278000	9280000	But I've already talked about that on a previous episode.
9280000	9287000	There's one in particular I saw that was downright offensive and I think people who contributed to it.
9287000	9292000	I think in some ways got suckered and swindled but that's your choice, your money.
9292000	9297000	Anyhow let's move on to happier topics or maybe worse topics.
9297000	9304000	It's all up to you guys in the hands of the listeners because the Skype line is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9304000	9307000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9307000	9312000	Alright and going to our chatroom ddrdollarbill says I like the Tex Murphy games.
9312000	9313000	I'm not saying they were bad games.
9313000	9319000	It's just this trend is a little strange and I'm not a big fan of this.
9319000	9322000	Alright so going to our Twitter while we wait for some calls.
9322000	9324000	Again it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9324000	9327000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9327000	9332000	Going to the Twitter we have gamergirl who tweeted us and says I need to get a new TV.
9332000	9336000	Anyone got any recommendations as far as price and model goes?
9336000	9338000	I miss my games, cries.
9338000	9340000	I'm pretty happy with our Panasonic.
9340000	9343000	Toshiba makes good ones too.
9343000	9346000	If you've got fries in town go to fries.
9346000	9348000	I have specials all the damn time.
9348000	9351000	Yeah don't buy anything on impulse.
9351000	9354000	It's so hard for me to recommend you a specific TV gamergirl.
9354000	9356000	Do not get a plasma.
9356000	9358000	Get an LCD.
9358000	9361000	It's so hard for me to recommend a TV gamergirl because I don't know what type of setup you have.
9361000	9365000	Do you have a gigantic living room that you want a gigantic TV to fill?
9365000	9370000	Or do you want something for your bedroom that maybe you're not going to be able to use the living room an awful lot.
9370000	9376000	Like if you want a bedroom TV and it's specifically for gaming because you said I miss my games.
9376000	9379000	Maybe you should look into that Playstation monitor that's out.
9379000	9384000	I hear it's not terrible and you could do the whole 3D games if you have the consoles to support it.
9384000	9389000	But if you don't really have a Playstation 3 then that TV is kind of a waste.
9389000	9396000	So something to think about. Again if you're going for a bedroom TV why not go for a computer monitor?
9396000	9401000	You can get a cable that will hook an Xbox 360 up to the computer monitor.
9401000	9404000	As well as a Playstation 3 can hook up to a computer monitor right?
9404000	9407000	With a particular cable. Am I correct in that?
9407000	9408000	In Japan.
9408000	9409000	HDMI?
9409000	9411000	HDMI yes it can hook up to a monitor.
9411000	9415000	Well HDMI you can hook it up through an HDMI to DVI adapter.
9415000	9424000	Otherwise they sell a device or they sell an actual cable in Japan that will do it.
9424000	9426000	That I'm sure will work with the USPS3s.
9426000	9431000	Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room suggests Vizio. Best bang for the buck.
9431000	9434000	That's actually what we have. I'm happy with the Vizio. That's the way to do it.
9434000	9440000	Rama says Samsung. Best TVs ever. Chigurh says Sony Bravia all the way.
9440000	9449000	So gamer girl it's really hard when we don't know your circumstance and your budget to pinpoint one correct TV.
9449000	9453000	But do your research. Do your research online. Read reader reviews.
9453000	9456000	Don't go to the store on a whim and let the sales guy know.
9456000	9460000	Yeah I need to get a new TV because I can't play games anymore.
9460000	9462000	Because they are going to try to take it to the cleaners.
9462000	9465000	Because they're going to know you need a new TV.
9465000	9468000	And they're going to be like oh this chick's not going to leave for that one.
9468000	9469000	It's like shopping for a car.
9469000	9471000	Yeah exactly. So...
9471000	9474000	Don't be afraid to say no and don't let them know you want it.
9474000	9475000	Exactly.
9475000	9477000	And don't buy a plasma.
9477000	9481000	Well now some folks in the chat room disagree with you.
9481000	9484000	Legend of Zaku says get a plasma. Very little lag.
9484000	9487000	Chigurh agrees though saying plasma hurts my eyes.
9487000	9490000	Niche or niche I don't know how to say that.
9490000	9494000	It says plasma is better than LCD. WTF.
9494000	9498000	Disagree because with plasma you can also deal with more burn in in some cases.
9498000	9505000	I would say also Gamer Girl go to the store and kind of look at the TVs.
9505000	9510000	Especially a place where you're less likely to get hounded like Best Buy or even like Target.
9510000	9512000	Good with a furniture store.
9512000	9513000	Or Walmart even.
9513000	9515000	Oh furniture? I never thought to get TVs at a furniture store.
9515000	9516000	RC Willy.
9516000	9519000	So yeah go to a place where you're less likely to get hounded and just kind of look.
9519000	9521000	And go oh I like the look of this.
9521000	9524000	Because then you can make your own decision on plasma versus LCD.
9524000	9526000	Maybe you'll look at a plasma and go I want this.
9526000	9528000	And then you know you can.
9528000	9530000	So I would do that.
9530000	9532000	I think a Target or a Walmart is a great place to look.
9532000	9534000	Because you're not going to get hounded by salesmen.
9534000	9536000	You don't have to buy. Just look.
9536000	9538000	In fact the TVs at Walmart are probably not.
9538000	9542000	I mean they're cheap for a reason. Remember that.
9542000	9545000	I actually super agree with Technus.
9545000	9549000	If you have a membership to Costco, Sam's Club or BJ's.
9549000	9552000	I recommend them because of the return policies.
9552000	9554000	Agree agree agree.
9554000	9556000	I think the best place in the world actually.
9556000	9558000	And here we go with advertisements.
9558000	9560000	But I'm saying it because I believe it.
9560000	9562000	I think the best place in the world to get a TV is Costco.
9562000	9564000	Because their return policy.
9564000	9567000	It used to be a lot more generous than it is now.
9567000	9570000	Oh my God I had a TV break like two years after I bought it.
9570000	9573000	And Costco took it back. I was astounded.
9573000	9576000	They did that with us. They didn't have our model anymore.
9576000	9580000	So we traded it in from a 58 inch to a 52 inch.
9580000	9582000	And paid just another hundred bucks.
9582000	9584000	Me too. I was astounded.
9584000	9587000	So I don't think their policy is as generous anymore.
9587000	9589000	You have to have a receipt now.
9589000	9591000	Yeah. But yeah.
9591000	9594000	Just the price and the fact you don't get hounded.
9594000	9597000	And the selection I think is a great place to try it.
9597000	9599000	Alright anyhow.
9599000	9601000	Wow the phone's not ringing.
9601000	9603000	I hope it's working. 1877 game OLR.
9603000	9605000	Our username on Skype is orangeontradio.
9605000	9607000	Or the listeners are just being shy tonight.
9607000	9609000	That's okay. That happens sometimes.
9609000	9612000	Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.
9612000	9615000	It might have also just been a little bit of a slow news week.
9615000	9617000	You know what I mean? Sometimes that happens.
9617000	9620000	Yeah. Why don't you just call and ask me a question people.
9620000	9622000	Dar Sakura wants attention.
9622000	9623000	I'm just checking.
9623000	9626000	No. I'm just trying to get some life into the phone line.
9626000	9629000	I'm checking to make sure the 800 number is actually working.
9629000	9631000	Because it's been having some problems lately.
9631000	9632000	Yeah it's working.
9632000	9633000	There it is.
9633000	9634000	People who've got problems.
9634000	9636000	Alright. Anyhow.
9636000	9638000	Let's move on to a couple more tweets.
9638000	9644000	We have Tiger Claw links us to a story about NASA helped with Angry Birds Space.
9644000	9646000	Oh yeah. That came out.
9646000	9648000	I forgot.
9648000	9650000	But Angry Birds Space did come out.
9650000	9656000	And apparently NASA collaborated in this with what's called a Space Act Agreement.
9656000	9658000	Why does NASA team up with this?
9658000	9663000	It saw an opportunity to teach kids about space, science, and the laws of physics.
9663000	9668000	And considering that NASA's kind of taken some hits lately with funding and all that,
9668000	9671000	I can see why they'd want to get on board with this.
9671000	9676000	And you know, if I was a kid, I'd be really into this I think.
9676000	9678000	So I think this is actually a good thing.
9678000	9680000	I can't hate on this.
9680000	9683000	A comment from, what is this?
9683000	9686000	Space Station Trajectory Operations Officer.
9686000	9692000	It's a great way to demonstrate how we can use trajectories to get from one place to another.
9692000	9697000	It's a really good example of how interplanetary probes can take gravity assets from other,
9697000	9700000	or gravity assists, excuse me, from other planets.
9700000	9703000	Alright, hey, our phone line's lighting up now.
9703000	9705000	I think your hemming and hawing worked, Dark Soccer.
9705000	9706000	We got a call.
9706000	9708000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9708000	9710000	Hi, this is Zach Deff.
9710000	9712000	Hey, Zach Deff. What's up, buddy?
9712000	9715000	Just checking if Skype works.
9715000	9717000	Yes, thank you. It does work. We're good.
9717000	9720000	Well, what's on your mind? What have you been playing lately?
9720000	9728000	Not much, really. I have been playing mostly Team Fortress 2 on Steam and Forza 4.
9728000	9729000	Forza 4?
9729000	9730000	Yeah.
9730000	9735000	Forza, that's a series I never really got into because it's a little too pro for me,
9735000	9739000	but what do you like about Forza 4?
9739000	9745000	Forza, pretty much, it's pretty much like Gran Turismo in the simulation sense.
9745000	9752000	It's very precise, and when you have to accelerate turns and all that, it's like driving a real car.
9752000	9762000	But the thing that Forza has as a series is that it has an arcade feel rather than a simulation feel.
9762000	9769000	Are you a car guy in real life? Do you like to mod cars and kind of pimp your ride and all that?
9769000	9780000	Somewhat. I do like cars, though I don't know that much to mod or modify cars like that,
9780000	9786000	but I am a car aficionado in real life, so I do know some stuff.
9786000	9791000	Okay, so yeah, I just kind of notice usually the people that get into these games are car aficionados,
9791000	9795000	and there's nothing wrong with that. Cars can be very sexy machines, even I recognize that.
9795000	9800000	I don't necessarily drive a state-of-the-art car, but I even parked next to a guy today.
9800000	9806000	I'm like, that's a sexy car. If I had more money, I'd want that car.
9806000	9815000	But yeah, something that Forza has, it doesn't feel like a simulation at all.
9815000	9821000	You have all the customization, you can paint your car, you can tune it out,
9821000	9827000	and you can pretty much do everything with your car, and it also drives like a real car.
9827000	9833000	But like I said, the moment you're playing the game, it doesn't feel like a simulation.
9833000	9842000	It doesn't feel like Gran Turismo, where the races are hard because you have to make very precise turns and all that.
9842000	9851000	And even though you have, but like I said, you have a lot of options that make it feel like an arcade racer rather than a simulation.
9851000	9858000	I was going to say, are you a fan of arcade racers, like the split seconds, the blurs, the burnouts of the world?
9858000	9869000	Yeah, I'm a fan of both types of games, really, though I do mostly play arcade racers like Ridge Racer, the Dirt series, and all that.
9869000	9874000	Then tell me, am I right or am I right? F-Zero needs to be a Wii U launch title.
9874000	9875000	Oh yeah, it does.
9875000	9881000	Thank you very much. That's another series I need Nintendo to bring back from the dead.
9881000	9885000	Although, speaking of series coming back from the dead, don't forget Kid Icarus came out this week,
9885000	9890000	and I've got it sitting in a box in my room, I haven't been able to play it yet, I've been kind of busy this weekend.
9890000	9893000	Yeah, I've been hearing that, that's pretty good.
9893000	9901000	I'm hearing, I was talking to Shane earlier about it, and he says the game's got a great sense of humor, he says he's reminded of Earthbound in the sense of humor,
9901000	9905000	and I'm like, ooh, that's a big name to invoke around Nintendo.
9905000	9909000	But that's pretty cool if it's got that sense of humor to it.
9909000	9913000	Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9913000	9915000	No, that will be all.
9915000	9917000	Alright, well take care buddy, have a good one.
9917000	9919000	You too, thanks.
9919000	9920000	Bye.
9920000	9930000	I should have asked if he was into Mario Kart too, because Mario Kart's kind of a racer that's a little bit toned down so everybody can get into it.
9930000	9937000	You know what I played randomly not that long ago was Mario Kart on the Wii again, I hadn't played that in forever, but it's still alright.
9937000	9943000	One other tweet here from Tigerclaw at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, where you guys can send us tweets every week.
9943000	9947000	Scammers attempt to trick fans with promise of new Mass Effect 3 endings.
9947000	9954000	Oh, this is terrible. God, there's always scammers that read the gaming sites and seem to figure out what's going on.
9954000	9956000	Like, you see this with Blizzard all the time.
9956000	9961000	Like, how Mists of Pandaria Beta just came out this week, which, funny enough, I can't believe I didn't bring it up on the show.
9961000	9964000	Maybe because there's, you know, Horde House, the whole other show I have for that stuff.
9964000	9969000	But yeah, the Mists of Pandaria Beta just started out of the fucking blue this week, which is a pretty big deal.
9969000	9973000	But of course, scammers want to get in on that and try to rip off, you know,
9973000	9981000	Congratulations, you're in the Mists of Pandaria Beta. Click here to give us all your information so you can download the client, like your credit card number.
9981000	9983000	And some people, unfortunately, fall for it.
9983000	9986000	Well, it's happening with the Mass Effect 3 ending stuff.
9986000	9989000	I'll come back to the story in a minute, but we have another call coming in.
9989000	9991000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
9991000	9992000	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9992000	9993000	Hey, Ranma, what's up?
9993000	9996000	Not too much, not too much. How about you, good friend?
9996000	10002000	Same old, same old. Just working, sleeping, playing Mass Effect.
10002000	10004000	Uh-huh, Mass Effect, I see that.
10004000	10006000	Yeah, what's on your mind?
10006000	10011000	Not too much, I was pondering to call and see if you have played Kid Icarus yet,
10011000	10015000	Because I'm more or less waiting on your review of the game before I go out and buy it,
10015000	10020000	But from the last call, you haven't popped it open yet, so I'm kind of anxious about it.
10020000	10023000	Oh, god, I will have a review next week, I promise.
10023000	10027000	I did buy it, I took a leap of faith and bought it.
10027000	10033000	I got it on Amazon, which is kind of funny, because I ended up getting, like, it was $39.99, right?
10033000	10039000	They refunded me ten bucks, because I guess Best Buy or somebody else put it out cheaper,
10039000	10043000	So they have that whole, if it comes out cheaper somewhere else, we'll refund your money.
10043000	10045000	So I thought that was kind of interesting.
10045000	10050000	That would kind of explain why I could not find it in Best Buy the last couple of days,
10050000	10055000	Because I just decided to walk in and check, just out of idle curiosity, nope, didn't have it.
10055000	10060000	Well, that means it's selling, which I guess is a good sign.
10060000	10062000	I would like for the series to come back.
10062000	10069000	I'm hoping the game doesn't suck, but the general consensus I'm reading on the internet is that the game is pretty damn good,
10069000	10074000	But the controls are so bad, it ruins it for some people.
10074000	10079000	Like, there's a reason the game came with the little stand.
10079000	10083000	That's kind of the general consensus I'm hearing, which is a little bit alarming.
10083000	10087000	If the controls are that bad, it's going to ruin the game.
10087000	10092000	But it's good enough to further explore the concept, is kind of what I'm getting.
10092000	10095000	Ah, okay, I get it. I get it now.
10095000	10099000	There's also the 3D re-release of the original Kid Icarus.
10099000	10102000	Apparently, it's not just the ROM.
10102000	10106000	I mean, this isn't a huge deal, but they went and added backgrounds, I guess, into it.
10106000	10110000	So they did kind of give it a little something, something they didn't have before.
10110000	10116000	That sounds interesting, because I'm kind of reminded of the times I used to sit there and play the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy.
10116000	10120000	Oh yeah, the kind of overlooked sequel that really did come out, yeah.
10120000	10128000	You know, I was reading some people hating on Kid Icarus this week, because they were saying it wasn't that good of a game.
10128000	10132000	And, oh god, that makes my heart hurt every time I read it, because I loved it.
10132000	10135000	But it was a hard-as-nails game.
10135000	10140000	It was a really hard game, and it did have some weird, quirky stuff in it.
10140000	10143000	But, and it tried to do a lot.
10143000	10148000	Like, I think they kind of stretched themselves thin with, suddenly, it's a vertical scroller.
10148000	10152000	Now, it's a side scroller. Now, it's a dungeon crawler. Now, it's a shooter.
10152000	10154000	You know what I mean?
10154000	10156000	That's a bit of a mindfuck if you think about it.
10156000	10163000	It is, but, I mean, for a child who was, you know, 8 years old with mild ADD, it was great.
10163000	10165000	Pretty much.
10165000	10167000	Maybe that's why it holds my attention so well.
10167000	10171000	Since we're on the topic of 3DS games, I'll make this quick before I bounce off.
10171000	10174000	I finally got around to playing Super Mario 3D Land.
10174000	10176000	Ooh, what'd you think?
10176000	10180000	Okay, I kept saying that I want a 3D version of Super Mario 3.
10180000	10183000	That's what I've been screaming for.
10183000	10189000	And this game pretty much comes close to my inner Super Mario 3 fandom.
10189000	10191000	It comes close.
10191000	10193000	It's really good.
10193000	10198000	I really think people don't give it enough credit for what it's doing to the franchise as a whole.
10198000	10200000	I think it's really good.
10200000	10205000	I mean, one of my main issues with the game is that all the levels are straightforward.
10205000	10209000	I thought maybe you'd be able to go to 1-1 and 1-2.
10209000	10212000	You could just go down another direction, go to 1-4, this and that.
10212000	10214000	Oh, like in Mario 64, kind of?
10214000	10217000	No, more like for the way it was in the original Mario 3.
10217000	10220000	Oh, I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10220000	10222000	Have you finished the game yet or no?
10222000	10226000	I've fake finished it.
10226000	10228000	I don't want to say too much for spoiler reasons.
10228000	10230000	Okay.
10230000	10233000	Let me put it this way. It's got a Symphony of the Night-esque thing going on.
10233000	10235000	Yeah, I know.
10235000	10237000	I'm playing through the game.
10237000	10241000	In the back of my mind, I'm like, I can't believe I'm going through the levels the way I am.
10241000	10245000	It's like the difficulty kind of jumps around.
10245000	10252000	And then at that last section, I thought it was done and then this whole more of it pops up.
10252000	10255000	I'm like, Nintendo, what the fuck?
10255000	10256000	Exactly.
10256000	10257000	What the fuck?
10257000	10258000	Yeah, right.
10258000	10260000	But that's great.
10260000	10262000	That's great.
10262000	10266000	It's not often that games kind of invoke that feeling that you got when you realized,
10266000	10270000	oh my God, Symphony of the Night, I'm not even halfway done.
10270000	10273000	That's awesome.
10273000	10276000	That's all I got to say is just...
10276000	10278000	Well, good luck.
10278000	10283000	And you know, if you do well enough, you might get to be Black Luigi playing Luigi.
10283000	10286000	I've already gotten to that part.
10286000	10288000	Okay.
10288000	10293000	I like how they redid Luigi. I like that.
10293000	10295000	It's more playable.
10295000	10298000	All right. Anything else before we let you go tonight?
10298000	10300000	No, that's it.
10300000	10302000	All right. Take care, buddy.
10302000	10303000	You too.
10303000	10304000	Bye.
10304000	10306000	Agdeft in our chat room says, Rob, it's a Mario game.
10306000	10308000	Do we really need spoiler alerts for it?
10308000	10309000	Well, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
10309000	10310000	All right.
10310000	10311000	We have another call coming in.
10311000	10312000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10312000	10313000	Who's this?
10313000	10314000	This is Shane.
10314000	10315000	Hey, you've been calling a lot lately.
10315000	10316000	What's up?
10316000	10321000	I know, because I stay up later for some reason, which is probably why I fail at work more
10321000	10322000	often than not.
10322000	10323000	It's all good.
10323000	10325000	This show's important, damn it.
10325000	10326000	Totally.
10326000	10327000	What's on your mind?
10327000	10332080	Well, I will say, first of all, this week I won't talk about Mass Effect, because I'm
10332080	10338920	pretty sick of both fanatics on each side, and it's just disgusting me at this point.
10338920	10342400	But I will call and talk about Kid Icarus.
10342400	10345160	Ah, that's what our last caller wanted to know about.
10345160	10347520	What do you think about Kid Icarus?
10347520	10348520	It's fantastic.
10348520	10353320	The way they pace the game with the terrible control scheme, because let's just be honest,
10353320	10360380	if a game makes you hurt your hands while playing on purpose, it's got a terrible control
10360380	10362680	scheme.
10362680	10368820	But the writing is so good, and I think the Earthbound comparison that I gave to you earlier
10368820	10376100	is spot on, because it's witty, it's stupidly cheesy, it makes terrible puns, and it breaks
10376100	10379120	the fourth wall constantly.
10379120	10380120	That's pretty cool.
10380120	10386240	Maybe that's because Nintendo is, for whatever reason, and this makes me hurt to say, please
10386240	10391400	don't be mad at me, fanboys, but maybe since Nintendo's kind of abandoned the Mother franchise,
10391400	10397280	maybe they're bringing Kid Icarus in as kind of their, you know, silly.
10397280	10399200	Or do you think it's just because it's for four year olds?
10399200	10402000	I think it's because it's made by Sakurai, is why.
10402000	10403000	Anything?
10403000	10404000	Yeah.
10404000	10405000	Alright.
10405000	10407680	Well, he's got a great sense of humor, then, because...
10407680	10412680	To be fair, in the interest of full disclosure, you're a big fan of Power Rangers and Pokemon.
10412680	10413680	Yes.
10413680	10417440	So, maybe the game's aimed at children.
10417440	10421720	I don't know, when one of the lines is, it's like a birthday party where everybody's trying
10421720	10424720	to kill me, I don't feel like that's really Pokemon.
10424720	10426360	Hey, Shane.
10426360	10427360	Yes.
10427360	10431720	Quick spoiler, because I forgot to talk about this last week during the segment that doesn't
10431720	10432720	exist.
10432720	10433720	Which game are you spoiling?
10433720	10436840	Oh, real quick, I was just gonna say, hey, I bet you don't know that there's a Kinect
10436840	10441400	version of Power Rangers Samurai coming out later this year.
10441400	10444720	You mean the game I feel the urge to pre-order now?
10444720	10445720	Yes.
10445720	10450960	Because I will totally morph and punch things in the air.
10450960	10451960	That's awesome.
10451960	10456960	You know, I played the crap out of the Super Nintendo one.
10456960	10458360	Oh yeah, that was great.
10458360	10459360	That one was awesome.
10459360	10460760	That was a really good beat-em-up.
10460760	10465600	And there was a Die Ranger game that came out in Japan that I had the ROM for that I
10465600	10467360	played the hell out of.
10467360	10468360	I bet that was pretty good too.
10468360	10469360	It was really good.
10469360	10473200	The only one I was kind of disappointed in when I played it besides, you know, the newer
10473200	10476600	stuff they put out was the fighting game on Genesis.
10476600	10478840	Oh, that was painful.
10478840	10482240	Have you already pre-ordered Black and White 2?
10482240	10485680	I almost did from Playasia for the Japanese copies.
10485680	10487880	Our chat room flailed at the mention of Pokemon.
10487880	10488880	Pokemon!
10488880	10492400	Well yeah, because everybody should be excited about that.
10492400	10498220	And not to cross-promote shows or whatever, but I'm sure on Horthouse we'll talk about
10498220	10505440	this week, they datamined some of the pet battle stuff and it shows what's weak to what,
10505440	10508280	what's strong against what in some of the new attacks.
10508280	10513080	So Pokemon in World of Warcraft is just going to make my day.
10513080	10515440	That is pretty awesome, I gotta say.
10515440	10518960	It's both the dumbest thing I've ever heard and the most awesome thing I've ever heard.
10518960	10522720	It's like a movie that's so bad it's good.
10522720	10526280	Yeah pretty much, and I will be doing that all the time.
10526280	10530600	It's going to take away from leveling, which is kind of sad.
10530600	10532040	So gosh, what else do I ask you about?
10532040	10535560	So thank you for the plug for Horthouse, that's good, we always try to cross-promote the shows.
10535560	10540440	And Kid Icarus, so you think Kid Icarus, because Rama said he's waiting for my review to check
10540440	10544920	it out, but you're saying don't bother, just go get it, and you can play the game in ten
10544920	10548720	minute bursts, so that way when your hand starts wanting to die, you can take a break
10548720	10549720	and it's okay.
10549720	10555840	Yeah, and I really like the way they scale the difficulty for you.
10555840	10562640	There's no hard easy mode, there's this bar and you wager hearts, and by wagering hearts
10562640	10567720	you get better rewards, and the more hearts you wager, the harder the game gets.
10567720	10571640	So if you lose, you lose a whole bunch of hearts, but if you beat it, you get better
10571640	10573880	rewards, and the difficulty just skyrockets.
10573880	10581240	I almost died wagering to a 4.2 level difficulty, it was pretty hard.
10581240	10583120	Is the eggplant wizard in the game?
10583120	10588320	Yes, and that was one of my favorite puns in the entire game so far, and I'm gonna ruin
10588320	10590520	it because I don't care, because it was so good.
10590520	10596160	So there's lots of back and forth dialogue in the game, and it constantly happens, there's
10596160	10601220	no cutscene for it, it's just you're fighting and oh, Palutena and Pit have to talk the
10601220	10602400	entire time.
10602400	10608320	So she's like, oh, remember the eggplant wizard and the nurses, and it previously would heal
10608320	10609320	you?
10609320	10613160	And he was like, or Pit was like, yeah, I went there so often they named it after me,
10613160	10614160	and she's like, what?
10614160	10616840	And he's like, hospital, get it?
10616840	10617840	Hospital.
10617840	10621600	Oh my god, that is terrible.
10621600	10622720	Isn't it?
10622720	10627460	But it's just so funny when you're playing it, it's like, are you kidding me?
10627460	10628460	This is great.
10628460	10630160	And it's all voice acted, right?
10630160	10632440	Yeah, there's not any text.
10632440	10635520	Oh, there's text, but I mean, it's all dialogue voice stuff.
10635520	10638240	Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
10638240	10642840	Or when you are scaling a wall in one of the flying stages, and there's enemies pouring
10642840	10646800	down on you, and you beat them all and you get to the top, Pit's like, yeah, take that
10646800	10647800	wall.
10647800	10649880	I'm like, that sounds like something I would say.
10649880	10652320	That is something you would say, actually, very much.
10652320	10655480	That also sounds like something Dan would say.
10655480	10657400	It does, it does.
10657400	10661720	Any online-ish components, StreetPass, SpotPass, any of that?
10661720	10666640	Yeah, it does have, I believe, an online multiplayer, a local multiplayer.
10666640	10675560	I haven't done them yet, because I'm only to world four or five, because I fell asleep.
10675560	10676960	And then went back to playing Mass Effect.
10676960	10680960	Yes, and then I went back to playing Mass Effect.
10680960	10685320	It sounds like, from everything I've read, the multiplayer is really fun, and a lot of
10685320	10691320	the sort of high-risk, high-reward stuff happens in that too, because if you take, I guess,
10691320	10696800	one of your better weapons into multiplayer, if you, when you take a good weapon in there,
10696800	10702480	you take, you have a lower health bar, so it expects, if you have a good weapon, you're
10702480	10707640	going to be a better player, and I think that's really cool, because if I'm going to have
10707640	10711440	a god weapon, I should only have a little bit of health, because I earned that weapon.
10711440	10712440	All right.
10712440	10715960	Well, we've got to let you go to wrap up the show, but quickly, I know you said you weren't
10715960	10719680	going to bring up Mass Effect, but I just have to ask one Mass Effect-related question.
10719680	10720680	Yes, game's hot.
10720680	10721680	Jack is the greatest character ever.
10721680	10722680	There you go, answer.
10722680	10723680	Yes or yes?
10723680	10724680	What?
10724680	10726280	Sorry, say it again.
10726280	10727720	Jack is the greatest character ever.
10727720	10728720	Yes or yes?
10728720	10729720	No.
10729720	10730720	Don't lie to listeners.
10730720	10731720	But I do like Jack better in two.
10731720	10732720	I mean, three.
10732720	10733720	Don't lie to listeners.
10733720	10734720	All right.
10734720	10735720	All right, have a good one.
10735720	10736720	Shane.
10736720	10737720	You too.
10737720	10738720	All right, bye.
10738720	10739720	Bye.
10739720	10740720	That'll do it for the Skype line tonight.
10740720	10741720	Thanks to those guys that got through.
10741720	10745680	It was a little slow to begin, but then it started to fill up there at the end, so don't
10745680	10746680	be shy next week.
10746680	10747680	You guys can get through.
10747680	10749520	I've heard from some of my favorite people today.
10749520	10750760	Oh?
10750760	10751760	On the Skype.
10751760	10752760	Oh, on the Skype line, yeah.
10752760	10753760	Oh, I thought you were-
10753760	10754760	I'm especially...
10754760	10760120	I'm pleased slash angry with Shane, because of all of the music that I got in trouble
10760120	10764680	for buying on Amazon after being in a turntable with him.
10764680	10766840	Oh, you guys turntabling this week?
10766840	10769320	We did two nights ago.
10769320	10770320	Nice.
10770320	10771320	Yeah.
10771320	10776200	I don't remember because I can't remember anything, but I got in trouble for all those
10776200	10777600	music I downloaded.
10777600	10780840	I have good music, yay, but I'm poor boo.
10780840	10785920	There is an unofficial official turntable FM after party for Orange Launch Radio that
10785920	10788720	Hitstun puts together, so it's kind of one of those.
10788720	10790160	We endorse it.
10790160	10792400	It's not us doing it, but we endorse it.
10792400	10793560	I love turntable FM.
10793560	10794560	It's a great site.
10794560	10800240	It's one of the greatest things to happen to music in a long time since iTunes.
10800240	10805720	All right, anyhow, I want to quickly say I never finished up the tweet from earlier that
10805720	10808040	TigerClaw sent us, the whole scamming thing.
10808040	10813240	The new scam is Mass Effect 3, and there is a spam email going out, and I can't believe
10813240	10816000	people are falling for this, but unfortunately it's working.
10816000	10821440	You download a zip file containing a password-protected downloader for the supposed new ending, and
10821440	10826720	a text file in the zip tells you to go to a website where you do offers to get the ending.
10826720	10828960	I mean, this is shady as hell, right?
10828960	10830440	So don't fall for this stuff.
10830440	10833280	And then I'm sure the executable is a virus.
10833280	10836560	If something legit happens, it will be all over the internet.
10836560	10842440	We'll not only report on it here on the show, but if you can't wait until Sunday, just seriously.
10842440	10844080	The Mass Effect 3 stuff has been so big.
10844080	10845080	I don't know.
10845080	10846560	That sounds kind of legit to me.
10846560	10849720	I see stories on my news.google.com.
10849720	10855440	I used to kind of get the aggregate news a lot, and Mass Effect 3 is always in the technology
10855440	10857440	stories.
10857440	10861960	Anyhow, that's it.
10861960	10862960	That's it for calls.
10862960	10866080	That's it for tweets, and I think that's it for another episode of OLR.
10866080	10869920	Quickly, though, before we wrap it up and say good night, I need to ask if there's any
10869920	10870920	last-minute stories.
10870920	10873480	Dark Soccer, Loki, any last-minute stories you want to get out tonight?
10873480	10874480	No.
10874480	10877760	Nothing I want to get out.
10877760	10882440	Do you have a day on chat that says it's happening for the Guild Wars 2 beta, too?
10882440	10883440	That's unfortunate.
10883440	10885080	I really wish I was getting in that beta.
10885080	10890320	Well, maybe you'll get your zip file executable, and then you can download the password from
10890320	10891320	a website.
10891320	10892320	Stop.
10892320	10893320	Stop.
10893320	10894320	All right.
10894320	10897240	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10897240	10900560	Dark Soccer, what's your final thought for the listeners tonight?
10900560	10902280	I want pizza.
10902280	10904320	Wait, we can't do final thoughts.
10904320	10905320	You know what?
10905320	10906320	We skipped something.
10906320	10907320	What?
10907320	10908320	We never did the FUs of the Week.
10908320	10909320	Fuck.
10909320	10916880	I'm just not angsty, Rob.
10916880	10924800	Well you can do a thank you, or bless you, or whatever you call it.
10924800	10927800	Actually, I do have a fuck you.
10927800	10934120	To the guy who is setting up the booth outside of Walmart that said get rid of Obama, vote
10934120	10939280	Republican, with a very poorly handwritten sign, first of all.
10939280	10944160	If you want to draw the right attention, you need a better designed sign, just saying.
10944160	10950000	Two, don't vote in Satan to get rid of a guy who's doing good, just saying, even if you
10950000	10951000	don't like him.
10951000	10958560	Don't vote in the devil, because, seriously, they're all evil, evil, evil, evil.
10958560	10962280	And a fuck you to my stomach for rumbling, I'm going to have to put some more tea in
10962280	10964520	you when I get home.
10964520	10965520	I like fasting.
10965520	10968040	I really do feel great, except I'm hungry.
10968040	10969040	That's it.
10969040	10970040	Logie?
10970040	10979400	Um, I guess, uh, I have to be tired, because I've had to work hard the last few days because
10979400	10987520	I've had to watch Josh instead of going to work and give me at least a lunch break.
10987520	10994240	My a few of the week goes to internet drama, because it's very, very serious.
10994240	10995240	The internet's serious business.
10995240	11003960	It is serious business, and our lives depend on internet drama.
11003960	11007840	Porkchop in our chat says orange launch radio is linked to aggressive and violent hosts.
11007840	11008840	Possibly.
11008840	11013680	All right, uh, last minute, or excuse me, now our final thoughts, because we did last
11013680	11014680	minute stories.
11014680	11015680	Final thoughts.
11015680	11016680	So Darkstalker, you get another go at it.
11016680	11017680	What's your final thought?
11017680	11018680	Tea.
11018680	11022080	Uh, my final thought of the night is broccoli beef.
11022080	11023960	Logie, your final thought tonight?
11023960	11028440	Uh, there are a lot of good projects on Kickstarter, so be sure to check out Kickstarter, but there
11028440	11033800	are a lot that seem, you just have to look at it and how professionally it's being approached
11033800	11038680	and stuff, and some of them are quite sickening to the amount of money that they raised for
11038680	11044700	what they've raised it for and for how long those certain things were going for prior
11044700	11049360	to putting a Kickstarter up, if you know what I mean.
11049360	11052760	I think that's as vague as I can get.
11052760	11057720	All right, and, uh, let's see, my final thought tonight, oh no, I did my final thought.
11057720	11058720	Hello.
11058720	11060360	Sorry, I got distracted by chat.
11060360	11063360	But I will say this, this is the segment I always say at the end of every show, it's
11063360	11065400	the final final thought from all of us.
11065400	11070220	If you like Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show, leave
11070220	11073280	us a nice review somewhere, spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.
11073280	11076880	You know, we do this show commercial free because we love the community, that's what
11076880	11080600	it's all about, so all we ask in exchange, help our community grow.
11080600	11085800	I've seen a lot of you guys give us links on your blogs, that's awesome, I've seen little
11085800	11090840	signatures on sites, somebody inevitably on every forum ever starts a what podcast do
