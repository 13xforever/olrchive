10035	12297	Sky, and Loki.
13838	20465	Tonight, March 25th, 2012, a classic arcade game will come to Xbox Live Arcade with Kinect controls.
20946	23628	Amazon stopped stocking one release from this month.
23969	27092	And could games soon carry a warning similar to cigarettes?
32079	32920	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
58436	58816	Hungry?
59217	59597	Hungry?
61159	63522	Are you about to participate in the Hunger Games?
63722	64423	You're so hungry?
64743	65184	Shut up.
65424	66666	Or the Hungry Hungry Hippo Games?
66726	71131	No, I'm actually not hungry because I had broth, but I will be fasting every Sunday now.
71451	72472	Now is this a religious thing?
72612	72852	No.
73252	73832	Well, you never know.
73952	75033	It's worth the shot, right?
75153	76314	It's for my health.
76794	77114	Okay.
77654	81036	Like a new, I don't want to say a new craze, but... No, it's not.
81396	85158	It's something I've been debating doing for like the last year or so, so now I'm actually doing it.
85178	88460	So I'm assuming you've done the appropriate research and all that good stuff.
88880	89040	Yes.
89060	90221	Just letting the listeners know.
90241	92142	It's not something you're doing on a whim.
92302	96964	In a month, I will be discussing my results.
97084	99866	Are you incorporating any extra gaming into this?
100715	101676	Same stuff I'm always doing.
101696	103136	I do yoga like every day.
103897	104877	So, I'm good.
105237	105337	Yeah.
105718	105898	All right.
105958	109460	Also say hello to definitely not fasting Techmaster Loki.
109800	111260	Funny you used to say that actually.
112601	115202	My wife wants me to do that too starting after.
116123	119785	Do you think your wife may or may not have been influenced by a co-host on this show?
120948	126772	No, she did that because she had to not eat for a couple days for a procedure she just had done.
126852	132096	So she's like, well, if I can keep doing that, I can lose some weight.
132156	134658	Well, this is dangerous territory, though.
135098	136339	Fasting actually isn't bad for you.
136579	152203	Okay, I just want to make, you know, it's a gaming show, we're getting way off topic, but this is much different than, you know, some people don't eat, I mean, it seems like with this fasting thing, you're still eating some, and it's a scheduled thing, you're still eating some nutritional value things, it's just not a lot of the...
153795	163320	It's basically just cutting out, you know, and part of it for me that I really like about it is that I have a full 24 hours where I don't think about food.
164361	172265	I have been more productive, I've gotten so much stuff done, and honestly I felt super energized after I was done with my first one.
172285	176048	That was Wednesday from 3 o'clock p.m.
176128	178309	to Thursday, 3 o'clock p.m.
178689	179890	Went to yoga that night, felt great.
180730	182331	and it really is kind of crazy.
182371	185352	It's just sort of like my energy level shot way up.
185492	190795	I'm just trying to draw a clear line between what you're doing and what someone with a mental disorder who doesn't eat does.
191255	192936	But I'm just trying to make that distinction clear.
192976	195317	A person with a mental disorder would just not eat.
196518	197658	You know, completely not.
197878	198059	Right.
198239	200840	Or maybe do like, what was her face on the Partridge family?
200880	201420	Susan Day?
202041	203981	Who'd ate nothing but carrots and turned orange.
204282	204562	Mm-hmm.
204962	205262	You know.
205282	206483	Hey, that happened to me when I was a baby.
207143	207463	Well, yeah.
207503	208204	It's beta carotene.
208224	209084	It's different when you're a baby.
209404	216470	Yeah, but I mean, I'm saying that, you know, there's people that will just, you know, do all this stuff.
216530	220133	And this is really something that I've put research into and read a bunch of different stuff.
221073	223535	And I'm doing what I do with anything.
223675	224556	I try it for a month.
225177	225997	I see how I feel.
226338	226998	Check my health.
227699	229880	And this is someone who used to get blood tested every six months.
230501	233523	Just want to make that clear for the listeners, especially if it's your first time listening.
233723	234764	Just want to make that clear.
234804	235765	There's a clear difference here.
236005	236786	I'm not stupid.
237006	238827	All Games Radio, www.allgames.com
259552	262796	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
262916	267080	Although, as he mentioned tonight, he's going on a brief hiatus for the next two weeks.
267280	272004	So you'll just have to tune in right at 6 o'clock for the next couple weeks because we'll be on there at All Games Radio.
272585	274167	Again, www.allgames.com.
274187	282615	We also always have our chat room with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us and chat with us throughout the evening.
283135	285397	and some folks are coming up with cute little names.
285797	289439	Fitness Lounge Radio from Actdeft and Diet Diet Revolution there from HitStun.
289479	289860	There you go.
290620	290860	All right.
292702	295363	We're going to get into some gaming news and how our gaming weeks were and all that.
295383	297505	But usually we have a little kickoff topic here at the start.
297525	302468	And I want to talk about this tonight because this is what lots of people are talking about.
302508	305130	If Facebook is any indication, it's like everybody's freaking talking about this.
305570	331163	and that's that movie The Hunger Games right which you know is announced today what best non-sequel opening ever uh best uh it beat Twilight which that that's can't be bad news uh you know I personally have not seen the movie myself I haven't um read the books or anything um I'm interested in seeing the movie mostly because all my friends are like it's so good it's so good and you know I'm not gonna hate something just because it's you know
331443	331643	Good.
332183	332804	Loki, you're doing that.
332824	333424	Did you go see it?
333444	333864	I went and saw it.
333884	334865	I'm sure the wife took you to see it.
334885	335345	What did you think?
335405	336685	No, the wife didn't take me to see it.
336725	337566	I had tickets to see it.
337966	338766	Oh, sorry.
339066	339507	How dare I?
339707	340467	It was free.
341307	341808	Free popcorn.
344149	344709	It was alright.
344949	349411	It was, you know, my wife had described it as Battle Royale meets Twilight.
349991	355974	Well, like as in there's, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend, garbage, and, you know, people killing each other.
357374	360596	The best description I read on the internet was Battle Royale for soccer moms.
361650	363691	It's not really, no.
364232	369555	I mean, there's not even, they don't really touch on the whole relationship stuff that much.
369695	373678	It's just kind of briefly there, and it actually is part of a plot point.
373738	385906	It's not necessarily, without spoiling too much, they try to work up the whole relationship thing to get more sponsors, to get more perks in the actual games themselves.
386387	388868	And so that's kind of why they're doing it that way.
388888	391250	But it's not even that big a deal.
392150	394972	But I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh my god, it's Bal Royale.
395152	404979	Although, I do have to say that the filmmaker must have gone to the Michael Bay School of Camera Work because that shit was shaky all over the goddamn place.
405480	407641	I would rather you not mention that evil person's name.
409002	411264	Oh, does this have to do with a certain Ninja Turtle?
411484	411844	Shut up.
413565	413785	Yes.
416167	417067	I want to make this clear, too.
417087	418088	It was not bad.
418408	419489	And Woody Harrelson's in it.
419549	422991	That's always a pleasant surprise because Woody Harrelson's character is awesome.
423111	439120	Before the Hunger Games fans shoot me down with a bow and arrow, I want to talk about the Battle Royale thing because I do think people are running a little far with this whole comparison thing because, hello, Battle Royale's like 12 years old.
439480	443302	It's a completely different kind of book that's very political in nature.
443322	444023	Just got re-released.
445004	449727	Of course they're going to time the re-release with what's going on here because of the distant similarity.
450148	459475	But my whole thing is that, for one, there was Logan's Run, there was the Stephen King novel back in the 70s.
459495	462758	There's been other stuff about this type of topic too.
463438	464940	And how can you go...
465680	483996	Battle Royale and Hunger Games are like the same movie and Hollywood does... How can you say that and turn your head away from the fact that we have this Julia Roberts Snow White movie and Chick from Twilight Snow White movie coming out within literally three months of each other going on over here?
484417	488801	To which I hear the trailer for both were being played before the Hunger Games and I'm like...
489321	493722	How can you fucking sit there and compare the 100 years to Battle Royale when this shit's going on?
493742	495442	No, they did not have the Mirror Mirror trailer.
495622	497923	But, yeah, I'm well aware of Mirror Mirror.
498203	499963	At first I thought they were the same movie.
500183	503864	I'm like, man, that first trailer was really dark, but this one makes it look like a comedy.
503904	505645	I'm really confused at what's going on here.
506225	506525	Right?
508225	512026	But, yeah, it's just... It's...
512846	513586	A little bit dark.
513646	515767	I mean, it's not as dark as Battle Royale.
515907	519128	I mean, there's killing and stuff, and they have kind of the same stuff.
519168	523990	There's alliances and that kind of thing, but I think Battle Royale is a lot darker.
524070	531393	I mean, it's a little bit similar where they pick people and have them fight to the death and stuff like that, but at the same time, it's just...
533226	534127	It's a little weird.
534467	534907	I don't know.
535627	539750	Gamer Girl in our chatroom says Logan's Run is getting a re-release too, and that's not really surprising.
539850	547214	Anything remotely resembling The Hunger Games is going to come back because, again, it's the biggest non-sequel ever.
547394	554618	It has come to take Harry Potter's place for a few years in Hollywood as the young adult because ain't no one going to admit they like Twilight.
554858	558401	Next year we'll see The Long Walk and then another Lord of the Flies.
558861	560883	That's the Stephen King novel I was trying to think of.
560903	561263	The Long Walk.
561323	562685	They'll adapt that.
562825	564886	That shit is getting greenlit in the next couple months.
564906	566368	Then we'll get an American Battle Royale.
567489	568029	I hope not.
568089	569110	I hope not.
569210	570531	The next one's going to be Ender's Game.
570651	573714	That's going to be the next big one that's going to be coming out in a year from now.
573894	575956	By the way, you know Logan's Run came out the year I was born?
576316	576636	Oh, really?
576876	577056	Yeah.
578217	579278	Wow, that's an old movie.
579518	579919	Just kidding.
580339	581339	You set yourself up for that.
600265	601646	Where's the video game?
601666	603247	Where's the video game?
626223	626603	How so?
627084	627544	How so?
627624	629646	Because there's not really anything you could do.
629706	632748	You play as a character, and you go and kill other kids.
632868	637211	I mean, do they really want a killing kids video game?
637331	642575	Ten years on this show, or ten years ago on this show, we used to love Battle Royale.
642595	643876	Remember when we all first saw that movie?
644036	649020	We had the paper play stuff, and we said, there is no fucking way this movie is ever coming out in America.
649321	650161	They are not going to do it.
650181	650702	They're not going to do it.
650782	651642	And now they are.
652163	655225	You can't put kids killing kids on the screen, not in this day and age, ten years ago.
657526	662049	The reason why Battle Royale is coming out is because the mainstream studios wouldn't bring it out.
662189	668612	I think it's either Anchor Bay or some Hong Kong movie distributor that's actually putting it out over here.
668652	671434	It's not necessarily some mainstream.
671454	676917	It's not like Warner Brothers or Lionsgate or something like that is putting it out here.
677317	683881	It's so much smaller scale, it wouldn't really work as an action game or stealth action game or something like that because
684381	689185	There's only 24 kids originally in that.
689926	694290	And it's just not... Whereas Battle Royale is a little bit more freeform.
694390	696371	It's just hunting people down and stuff like that.
696451	697572	It just wouldn't really work.
697973	700034	Now, the later movies or later books would work.
700054	708842	I was just about to say, maybe... Now, without spoiling, but I understand the later books are more of a her against the government type of piece.
708922	710563	So put it very plainly like that.
710643	712625	So maybe that would translate better towards a video game?
713635	714336	Yeah, that might work.
714596	715477	All right.
715497	717500	Go to our chat room at chat.orangesonsradio.com.
717520	723127	Stan says, I would love to see an American Battle Royale movie with Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and all them assholes shoot each other.
725509	726170	He said, wait a minute.
726190	727892	There wasn't a lot of shooting in Battle Royale.
727912	728873	There was some, but not a lot.
729995	731196	There was plenty of gunfire.
732304	733485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
751005	753126	Well, I don't know if I want to spoil... Don't.
753166	754587	Let me read another comment from chat.
754887	757228	Derek Gage in chat says, Titanic was a sequel?
757648	759529	Hold on, I said biggest opening weekend.
759589	763951	Remember, Titanic made all its money because it was number one at the box office for like, what, four or five months?
764312	767353	Because a lot of people were going to see it multiple times.
767473	769434	I'll admit, I saw Titanic in the theater three times.
770214	772896	I didn't... I saw it once on VHS and I wanted to kill myself.
773616	780640	It's not that I loved Titanic, but you have to realize my dad was very into Titanic stuff way before the movie.
780900	785763	I remember watching a National Geographic special when I was seven years old, way before the movie.
786443	787524	I went to see it with him.
788004	792486	Then I went to see it with some other friends in college because a bunch of them hadn't seen it one to go.
792506	796168	Then I ended up seeing it one other time really cheap for some reason.
796288	801451	It was a good movie, but I won't see this 3D re-release.
801491	802852	I will not see the 3D re-release.
804110	805491	But it's James Cameron doing the reading.
805651	806672	I mean, that might not be bad.
807032	807893	I don't care.
809334	809754	So anyhow.
810775	811315	Yeah, all right.
811415	815258	So you're saying the Hunger Games video game didn't happen because it's not possible.
816797	817817	It wouldn't be good.
839482	840943	No, at least not that I'm worried.
840964	841844	There's a Facebook game.
842825	846067	The next movie game that they have coming out is Madagascar 3.
847388	849450	Did the movie video game genre die?
849690	849930	No.
850070	855094	See, in the month of May, you have Madagascar 3 from D3.
855535	862340	You have two from Activision, Men in Black, and Battleship, the movie based off the board game.
863680	865764	The video game based off the movie, based off the board game.
865984	866285	Got it.
867347	869831	And we will still not have our Liam Neeson saying E5!
873892	877074	I can't believe you would ruin Battleship the movie.
897544	899486	Oh yeah, who cares?
899566	899926	So what?
899966	900887	He dies, big deal.
900927	904690	I mean, it's like, honestly, Battleship, the movie, is like Independence Day.
904710	908632	I mean, you look back at Independence Day, I loved the movie, but it was fucking ridiculous.
908753	909653	It made no sense.
909793	910934	It was just ridiculous.
911014	911615	This is true.
912255	912876	But you know what?
912956	914877	It's a fucking entertaining movie.
915077	918760	I saw Independence Day, I think the second, the third, and the fourth.
919260	920001	And maybe the fifth.
920161	922603	I saw it like four or five days in a row.
923023	923383	Just like...
924484	926065	and it was great every time.
926085	927666	Did they make a video game out of Independence Day?
927766	929067	Yes, they did on the PlayStation 1.
929307	930027	Oh, I forget.
930047	931068	It was so long ago.
931088	932229	And it was fucking terrible.
933990	934690	It really was.
936892	942275	Acidic Vampire in chat says, I hope the Battleship movie climaxes with a strategic battle in the style of the board game.
942635	943175	Me too.
943515	950219	That's the only way you could convince me to see it is that Liam Neeson and Rihanna sit down and they go to town on a game of Battleship.
950520	951240	I don't even care.
951280	952341	I think it's going to be awesome.
953123	957547	I mean, it's such a terrible... It's a movie you go into and you know what it is.
957967	959868	It's just explosions and nonsense.
959948	961129	That's Michael Bay for you.
961169	962370	Explosions and nonsense.
962430	964232	If that's what you want, then you go see that movie.
964792	967334	And that's what I want, so I'm going to go see that movie.
967935	969556	And I'll see The Avengers because that looks awesome.
970937	976961	I do need to catch up on the Avenger movies leading up to it because I've only seen Iron Man 1.
977821	979342	You and I are in the same boat.
979402	979843	Oh my gosh.
980243	984285	You and I need to get together and do this because I have only seen Iron Man 1.
984586	984906	That's it.
984986	985966	I haven't seen any of the others.
986927	987267	None of them.
987788	988428	Didn't see Thor.
988568	990849	Didn't see Captain America.
991310	993531	It's not that I'm not hating.
994031	996113	Seriously, last year I did not go to the movie.
996193	997494	I didn't go to the movies at all last year.
998234	998894	You had a kid?
999055	999535	I'm lazy.
1002392	1002953	I saw Thor.
1002993	1003633	Thor was good.
1003713	1008999	I didn't see the second Iron Man movie because it's just pretty much Robert Downey Jr.
1009039	1009960	being Robert Downey Jr.
1010641	1011401	How's that a bad thing?
1011682	1012462	Drunk and asshole.
1012903	1013724	Oh, okay.
1013744	1014465	That Robert Downey Jr.
1014525	1015085	No, that's fine.
1015125	1015646	That's fine.
1017047	1017488	I own it.
1017688	1019129	I just haven't bothered to see it yet.
1019229	1020491	It's sort of like I wasn't excited.
1020531	1021332	I liked the first one.
1021972	1025553	And I saw Hulk, even though it's, you know, not the same dude.
1025573	1027873	I think it's like same universe-ish thing.
1029173	1031534	Which, honestly, I really wish they had had Edward Norton.
1032434	1033814	Really wish they had Edward Norton.
1033834	1034735	He was so good.
1036335	1037335	You met the other guy, right?
1037355	1037855	Yeah, I have.
1038035	1038955	He signed my Xbox.
1039296	1041016	But, man, I... Hawkeye.
1042616	1048517	BlackWolfInChat says, you guys did notice in the first Battleship trailer that the bombs were in the shape of Battleship pins, right?
1048537	1049057	Yes, I did.
1049898	1050558	I didn't notice that.
1051098	1051398	It's your...
1051938	1057383	So are there any other big movies this summer that I'm not thinking of that might have video games made out of them?
1057683	1059425	Seems like there was a lot of stuff coming out this summer.
1061314	1063816	I'm trying to think.
1065037	1065338	No.
1067519	1069841	I honestly don't remember what the summer lineup is this year.
1069861	1077547	I mean, other than Batman and the new Snow White movie, which, I don't know, looks all right.
1077647	1078628	I'm going to have to go see it, though.
1078648	1079649	My wife wants to see it.
1079869	1080249	Of course.
1080329	1080630	All right.
1080690	1084553	Look, we'll start to talk more about the summer stuff when it gets closer to summer.
1084573	1084753	All right.
1084953	1091901	For now, let's talk about, right now, this week, the types of video games we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1092021	1093102	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1093618	1095500	My gaming week was retro.
1096461	1103347	We bought Bust a Move 2, as in Puzzle Bobble, arcade edition for the PlayStation.
1104728	1112015	And my husband and I actually had a fairly even match in playing, even though I'm usually the much better player.
1114537	1118380	We also picked up Taito Legends for PS2.
1119942	1121503	I have that on Xbox One.
1141282	1154126	We have video games related to the series, but I have to say that watching the Evangelion 2.22 really is kind of depressing, but awesome!
1155426	1155806	Just saying.
1157026	1157286	Awesome.
1157386	1160287	So certainly there's a bit of a retro day with the Taito stuff.
1160327	1162288	There's a series that had its ending changed.
1163148	1163708	Yeah, it...
1165140	1165781	DarkSakura.com
1178311	1187376	Alright, before we get to Loki's Gaming Week, from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, some folks in the chat are naming some other possible titles.
1188196	1190598	TigerClaw says maybe they should make a video game on Prometheus.
1191298	1192919	That's supposed to be a pretty big one, right?
1192939	1199823	Well, technically there's the Aliens Colonial Marines, which is coming out later this year, so that could tie into Prometheus.
1200492	1205899	Infinell names one that I particularly am looking forward to seeing, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.
1206340	1207081	That'd be fucking awesome.
1207101	1208343	That would be pretty awesome.
1208503	1209404	I'm looking forward to that one.
1209565	1211548	Platinum Games putting it together, that'd be awesome.
1211628	1212229	Very awesome.
1212409	1213751	Alright, meanwhile, your gaming week, Loki.
1214866	1215546	So let's see.
1215606	1217147	This week I didn't play a lot of games.
1218487	1223248	I played Call of Duty briefly because I was only working for three days this week.
1224229	1228530	The rest of the time I've been just working in Excel.
1229630	1231550	Why would I try to program something in Excel?
1231610	1233251	Because I'm weird like that.
1233411	1235491	So I like programming.
1235511	1236472	What are you making in Excel?
1236532	1237312	Is it still a secret?
1237872	1238472	No, it's not a secret.
1238492	1238872	It never was.
1239052	1241693	I'm making a map editor for Grand Theft Auto IV.
1242395	1243399	It actually works.
1243540	1246009	It's just fucking slow because it's in Excel.
1246089	1246892	In Excel.
1246972	1247534	In Excel.
1247575	1247976	You've made a...
1249377	1250998	How does a map editor in Excel work?
1251018	1252839	Meaning you draw it out in the little cells?
1252879	1253560	No, no, no.
1253760	1257682	It's like basically it opens a format.
1257882	1259383	It's like a WPL.
1259423	1260924	It's a placement list or something like that.
1262345	1268409	You can import stuff I make out of the Simple Native Trainer, which is a trainer in the game.
1268429	1270630	You can spawn objects, move them around, place them and stuff.
1270690	1273772	And you can export those to a file and dump them into this.
1273832	1277435	And then I can save them as the actual map files that are used by the games.
1277795	1277935	Okay.
1278675	1292001	or I can actually paste the hex code in there from, you know, you open up the file in the hex editor and dump it in there and it'll actually read everything and, you know, you can also save it as that and it'll, you know, do that fun stuff.
1292961	1298283	But it works and it's weird because the editors that they have out there now are broken.
1298404	1299284	They don't really work well.
1299404	1301525	So the fact that I'm making something very inefficiently
1302606	1305209	It works, and that's all I care about is the fact that it works.
1305609	1309854	Because I don't know how to program in C Sharp or C++ or whatever.
1310655	1318403	I could learn how to do that, but for some reason my mind can't wrap around that.
1318483	1321026	Yet, complex stuff in Excel, I can do that.
1321547	1321967	It's weird.
1322748	1323809	I hear ya, I hear ya.
1323869	1324909	Ridiculous formula.
1324929	1326530	Let me put it this way.
1326771	1332054	My Excel file, I had to convert it to the new format because I was going to try to make it compatible with everything else.
1332154	1334155	It ended up being 75 megabytes.
1334175	1334635	Oh my lord.
1334655	1335916	75 megabytes is huge.
1335956	1336917	Will it work in OpenOffice?
1337397	1337717	No.
1337737	1338558	Because I'm an OpenOffice user.
1338578	1340179	OpenOffice doesn't really work that well for this.
1340199	1340919	Nope.
1342100	1343061	So that was that.
1343221	1348063	And then kind of a weird, it's not weird, something I'm doing.
1348283	1352405	As I mentioned before, Mark Ruffalo has signed my Xbox before and a couple other people have as well.
1352885	1356727	So now I have this Xbox that I'm kind of using as almost like an autograph book.
1356827	1358888	I get celebrities to sign it.
1358928	1362030	I don't know if people always consider these people celebrities.
1363210	1368554	This week we had a visit from Duff Goldman from Ace of Cakes.
1368594	1368854	Duff Beer?
1369274	1370255	No, not Duff Beer.
1370835	1373818	From Ace of Cakes or Charm City Cakes.
1374298	1374918	Really cool guy.
1375339	1376459	So I had him sign my Xbox.
1377320	1379441	He must have went like, I'm a cake maker.
1379501	1380762	Why am I signing an Xbox?
1380902	1381683	He thought it was cool.
1381943	1382603	Thanks for watching!
1399674	1403216	I wouldn't consider Orlando Bloom or Mark Ruffalo, who's starring as the Hulk in the Avengers.
1403496	1403777	B-minus list.
1423949	1424430	Whatever, fine.
1424830	1434097	But, I mean, it's just, I have signatures from a bunch of different celebrities at my work, like a bunch of posters, but they're sitting in a pile on my desk and collecting dust.
1434177	1442344	Like, I have William H. Macy, and I had, oh, who the hell's, Jeff Goldblum at one time.
1443685	1446047	He's just, that guy is fucking weird.
1446567	1447688	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1468784	1492306	um but yeah like you know we we met before he died you know we met um Patrick Swayze oh nice uh so that was kind of cool um I like to get pictures yeah well yeah I get pictures too uh but you know I just I figured because I like you know I keep my Xbox in better shape than those posters so the way I figured I'm all it's it's more of an honor to sign this Xbox than it is good point
1492486	1496348	And I can't... I mean, this guy's a big geek.
1496549	1503733	I mean, he was talking about, you know, totally geeking out at, like, LucasArts and, you know, Skywalker Ranch and stuff like that when they went and made the cake there.
1503753	1506735	Did he also try to fling meatloaf at George Lucas?
1506755	1507135	Hey!
1509031	1533699	but uh you know so I I think that I'm sure that he plays video games I'm sure that he thought it was cool so whatever I like Derek H's counter about Mark Ruffalo's celebrity status Derek H says well Ruffalo is Bruce Banner a few hundred computers are playing the Hulk that is true facts true facts all right um fair enough anything else you want to get out there for your game um
1534959	1536080	I think that's all I've played.
1537041	1541786	No, I tried playing a little bit of the Mario Portal game, the Mario game.
1542026	1542446	It's weird.
1542587	1544568	I mean, I can't play that on my laptop.
1544588	1545469	It's an art piece.
1546190	1549573	It doesn't play very well with a touchpad.
1549653	1554298	I'm not very keyboard mouse, so it's very awkward for me to play that.
1554338	1556800	Yeah, if you're a laptop person.
1556960	1557921	Yeah, it's a little weird.
1559042	1559302	All right.
1559743	1560263	Well, that's it.
1560523	1560843	That's it.
1560883	1561964	Then My Gaming Week.
1563125	1565946	As I mentioned earlier, I tried that new Hunger Games on the iPhone.
1565986	1569248	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1569889	1572470	I did play one game a lot this week, actually.
1572490	1573431	I completely forgot.
1574051	1575112	Super Stardust Delta.
1575952	1576772	I love that game.
1576972	1578553	It's actually really awesome.
1578633	1578993	That's right.
1579073	1580934	Our buddy Brad from PodCulture.
1581014	1584295	Yes, he hooked me up with the code and I've been playing the crap out of that.
1584355	1585835	It's actually a really fun game.
1585955	1586235	Yeah?
1586315	1587336	Because I'm thinking about getting it.
1587596	1588636	It's definitely worth it.
1588696	1589536	It's very fun.
1589816	1592637	I still never cashed in my 3G thing.
1592777	1593558	I never did either.
1594018	1596158	That feature on my Vita has literally gone to waste.
1596198	1599519	I think I have until the 31st to do something with it or you lose it or something like that.
1599559	1601040	So I've got to make sure I get that taken care of.
1601809	1602789	You know, who cares?
1602989	1606590	I think, well, they have the GPS, though, with the 3G one.
1606690	1608471	So, I mean, that's kind of helpful.
1608511	1612291	But, yeah, I mean, I just can't use 3G.
1612471	1612812	I don't know.
1613012	1613292	All right.
1614032	1615152	If you're finally done with Game Week.
1615192	1615372	I'm done.
1615392	1615572	I'm done.
1615592	1615792	Sorry.
1615812	1616392	All right, my Game Week.
1616712	1619993	Quickly, before I talk video games, I need to talk board games.
1620133	1621814	Because I went to a board game party yesterday.
1621834	1622634	It was actually a lot of fun.
1622714	1623874	I got to play some new board games.
1623974	1627715	And one of them that I really, really, really, really liked was called Seven Wonders.
1628255	1630836	So I'm sure some of you board card game enthusiasts will know this game.
1631396	1637697	And, you know, not that I think they should turn every game into an Xbox game, but some of them have worked rather well, right?
1637757	1640438	Like, you know, Ticket to Ride and Catan and all that, right?
1640778	1644899	So I would like to see Seven Wonders because that was... I had a lot of fun playing that game.
1644919	1645379	That was cool.
1645479	1646559	They have a game called Seven Wonders.
1646579	1648640	It's just one of those match-three games.
1649020	1651021	Oh, that's not even the same thing.
1651061	1652461	This is a more... It was kind of like...
1653281	1677612	it actually to me felt and Alan made this comment too like the stages of the game are similar to like civilization it's resource collecting and then you can kind of hedge yourself into technology or military or like what I would call cultural types of points you know you can kind of it's either really inspired by civilization or kind of right down that same line but you know I love Civ so I like this game too
1679654	1694876	and some other friends of ours came over we played Dominion again which I think I've talked about that on the show but that's a card game I really enjoy that would be really hard to pull off on a console though I think that's something you really have to play in person because there's so many ways you can kind of mix and match the different cards and the expansions and all that
1695536	1698918	So yeah, I've been playing tangible games this week.
1699298	1699658	Crazy.
1700178	1702540	Video games, though, haven't been short on those.
1703240	1709703	Last week, I talked about how I have suddenly just... I want to say out of the blue, but not really.
1709803	1715546	Shane from Horde House kind of... We'll just say he berated me into playing these games, but it worked.
1715646	1716427	The games are really good.
1716467	1717307	Mass Effect, right?
1718308	1720148	I beat Mass Effect 1.
1721309	1727717	Now, I realize a lot of you might be going, yay, golf clap for you, you beat a game that came out five years ago.
1728077	1731882	But really think about that statement if you've been listening to Orange House Radio for any length of time.
1732803	1737809	I had the attention span to beat a game playing it start to finish.
1738429	1740732	That is a huge endorsement, I think, for the game.
1740792	1742053	So yes, I beat Mass Effect.
1742113	1743655	And what did I do when I beat Mass Effect?
1744095	1748800	I put in my Mass Effect 2 disc that I picked up last week for $20, and I started on Mass Effect 2.
1749160	1751623	So I'm about nine hours into Mass Effect 2.
1752836	1756117	and now I'm going to go home and start Mass Effect tomorrow.
1756337	1761259	Yes, and now Jamie is taking my Mass Effect on Xbox and she said she's going to check it out.
1761580	1773945	However, she understands she has until the time I beat Mass Effect 3 to finish it because then I want to play Mass Effect 1 again as a renegade and as a woman so I can have lesbian romance.
1774205	1779127	I'm just going to start off as a woman because I play every game as a woman because it's fun.
1780827	1782308	Have you played Saints Row the 3rd yet?
1783467	1783747	Me?
1783947	1784327	Tons.
1784387	1784627	Her.
1784867	1784987	Oh.
1785387	1788848	No, I haven't because we don't have a system that I can play it on right now.
1789208	1791029	Unless someone would like to lend me a copy of it.
1791429	1794070	Don't you have... I have the 361 from you still, right?
1794110	1795750	So, do you want to borrow the 361?
1796510	1796750	Sure.
1796990	1797310	Alright.
1798211	1799151	I'm going to give it to her, okay?
1799331	1799691	Alright.
1800111	1800991	I forgot you even had it.
1801311	1801752	Well, there you go.
1802232	1802492	Alright.
1804554	1806918	So, yeah, I've been playing Mass Effect 2.
1808059	1812667	Again, I don't know how constructive it is for me to review a game that's about two or three years old.
1813168	1813909	But, what?
1814109	1815251	One question from Acidic Vampire.
1815271	1815612	Okay.
1815792	1816674	Who did you choose to bang?
1818028	1820070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1837122	1841744	That will set it up so that in the third game, this person will be around for me to bang.
1842164	1843045	And I will bang them.
1844545	1844905	Lots.
1845926	1847647	So that's, I'll just leave it at that.
1849908	1850868	Let's see, what else?
1851428	1852229	Now I'm off track here.
1852309	1853149	Oh yeah, Mass Effect 2.
1853509	1857331	The game's a few years old, but it's really good.
1858952	1863594	Everything is just a step up in the storytelling and in the voice acting and everything.
1863654	1866115	It's not that the first game was bad, but the second game is just even more.
1866595	1869057	I have laughed out loud at the game.
1869377	1874879	There's a particular character I just got into my little squad that literally made me laugh out loud with what they were saying.
1876780	1877281	It's awesome.
1879042	1880562	The graphics are a step up.
1881803	1883684	They got rid of the Mako stuff, thank God.
1884204	1885844	Planet Scanning's a little derpy.
1886244	1888425	That gets a little bit old really fast, but whatever.
1888525	1889405	The hacking's better.
1890005	1893946	The combat, I still have mixed feelings on.
1894066	1904248	I know a lot of people generally agree that combat in 2 is better than combat in 1, but I will agree it's more fast-paced because you can kind of map skills to buttons so you don't have to bring up the menu.
1904568	1907068	You can kind of do things that way, but I don't know.
1907248	1909649	I kind of find I don't like the way that just...
1910169	1929646	Enemies keep coming out in waves and waves and waves And you're kind of just like stuck in one spot Gunning them all down At least that's the way I kind of find them doing it Just kind of gunning them all down until the wave's finally over And you can kind of move into the next room Like I feel like the first game kind of made you It was a little more Metal Gear in the way that The enemies didn't just run out until they actually saw you
1930527	1945665	so I kind of like it made the conflicts a little more consistent but don't take that as a harsh gripe on the game I mean it's a really minor bitch it doesn't take away from the experience of the story that I'm really really really enjoying so
1947116	1947516	There you go.
1950358	1952359	Let's see.
1953020	1953900	What else have I been playing?
1953940	1955001	What other game I want to mention?
1955601	1959003	On the Vita, Mod Nation Racers Road Trip.
1959244	1960704	I played on the Vita for a little bit.
1961205	1962666	It's okay.
1962786	1963846	It is what it is.
1963946	1967469	It's the PlayStation 3 version condensed down for the Vita.
1967889	1970931	The graphics and everything are pretty good.
1970951	1972452	They look like they do on the PlayStation 3.
1973212	1977275	The track editor, I was very impressed that it's pretty much all there.
1977775	1985740	You can import all the stuff from the PlayStation, which is pretty impressive, and you can therefore build up a pretty good library of stuff.
1986100	1988622	The only problem with Mod Nation Racers is...
1989471	1992893	They stripped out everything online about the game.
1992953	2004841	The only thing you can do online on the Vita version is have ghost racers, and you can download other people's tracks, but you can't do races online, which is kind of an important element of custom track making.
2004881	2011986	It's because a lot of these games, they're just not able to do... That's why you get a lot of this asynchronous multiplayer garbage.
2013906	2020988	You can do ad hoc in the same room and do it that way, but it really feels lacking.
2021248	2027029	I'm kind of sitting here going, this racing game gets kind of basic after you play it for a while.
2027169	2034251	Yeah, there's some interesting power-ups and things they do, but at the end of the day, I'm just like, this game gets kind of old.
2035191	2037192	So, I mean, at least what?
2037232	2039072	It's only $30, but I rented it through.
2039212	2043113	I have an account with a game rental company, and so I got it through a rental.
2043734	2045714	But I think it's a worthy rental.
2045934	2047735	I don't know if I would pay $30 for it.
2047795	2049275	If you really like racers.
2049315	2053717	I'm sure you're getting a lot of objects for it through the little passing.
2053737	2054097	I need some.
2054117	2056738	Check into Nier while you're here, because I need some of those objects.
2057258	2064360	So, you know, we're going to talk about this later, because there's a story coming up about LittleBigPlanet cart or whatever.
2067216	2073721	The trailer looks cool, but it kind of made my heart sink when I heard, by the creators of Mod Nation Races, I'm like, ugh.
2075042	2077784	Because their load time is fucking terrible.
2077804	2079265	Yeah, the load time's really bad.
2080045	2087490	But see, I was really surprised at how much the online piece being missing really hurt the game.
2087810	2091333	Because I wouldn't call the one on the PlayStation 3 a basic bitch racer.
2091733	2109907	because the community element kind of saves it because there really is just a stronger sense of community in the PlayStation 3 one and you can really get these random organic experiences in the PlayStation 3 one that just feel very forced and very vanilla on the Vita one and that's the problem with it.
2110427	2115471	I mean, it's impressive that they otherwise got most of the PlayStation 3 one in there
2116571	2119152	I hope LittleBigPlanet didn't get neutered this way.
2119192	2125213	But then again, LittleBigPlanet... You could play LittleBigPlanet online, but it wasn't as key to that game.
2125253	2126954	I think LittleBigPlanet Vita will be alright.
2127454	2129074	See, here's my question, though.
2129314	2136296	If they did that, though, if it's really neutered, I guess, on the Vita version, do you have the PSP version?
2136616	2138736	Because I think I got that as the PSP version.
2139356	2141677	I'm wondering if it was neutered on there, too, or if they...
2142711	2143392	Thanks for watching!
2156075	2156555	Thanks for watching!
2175790	2180493	Hot Shots, Golf, Wipeout, and MLB 12 are the only games.
2181073	2182614	I don't know if Unit 13 does.
2183594	2184595	I don't think that did though.
2185595	2191439	But those are the three and possibly four games that I know of right now that actually have multiplayer.
2192820	2193901	Now, I'll say this.
2194662	2198485	I don't want to totally bash out Monday's Racers because I don't think it's a bad game necessarily.
2198926	2200968	And we have to remember it's a launch title.
2201228	2204992	And for a launch title, it's surprisingly decent.
2205793	2206594	I say that.
2206814	2209957	It's a strong launch title for the Vita community.
2210257	2232007	But it's not as strong as, say, Luminous or some of the other choices that are out there Or what also kind of shoots this game in the foot a little bit is that I have to say that free Motorstorm game they put out last week It's kind of a better racing experience for me I mean, maybe because it was free, and it was more like Iron Man off-road racing
2232927	2258173	which I really enjoy that style but I'm well see the thing is like I'm kind of embracing a little bit more of the uh online or not even online stuff but the digital stuff now um thanks to some of these offerings the fact that well the fact that the Michael Jackson game was free was kind of fun but um you know the the on that Motorstorm game is pretty awesome and I'm actually thinking of thinning out my collection because I have four games right now and cart form and
2258553	2260676	I'm probably going to, well, Lil Deviance is gone.
2260896	2263959	I mean, that game looked like terrible shit.
2264179	2270446	And actually, Rayman Origins I'm probably going to get rid of because I'm just not playing it.
2270607	2271808	Not that it's a terrible game.
2271868	2273009	It's not a terrible game at all.
2273089	2278095	It's an awesome game, but it's just I'm not finding myself playing or wanting to play that game.
2278295	2278956	So, I don't know.
2279771	2282092	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloundtrader.com.
2282112	2284933	I'm just now catching up on some of the comments from chat.
2285273	2290435	Acidic Vampire says, the characters in Mass Effect 2 are some of the best characters in any video game.
2291135	2291675	You know what?
2291895	2302759	I gotta say, although I haven't played enough of Mass Effect 2 to really say that's true or that's false, I can see so far where that is probably a true statement.
2303019	2305480	Because there is some strong characters in Part 2.
2305620	2305960	Like, even...
2306480	2313244	and it's so funny I'm sitting here saying that because as I keep saying this about two, I feel like I'm bashing one, but I'm not.
2313324	2319808	It's just that one set the bar pretty high and two actually exceeds it in almost every area.
2320568	2322249	So, pretty neat.
2323950	2328053	And Shane says, pics of Kaiden put him over to actually trying the series out.
2328453	2329454	That may or may not be true.
2329834	2330254	Just saying.
2332055	2333036	I deny these allegations.
2333898	2335518	Alright, that's enough about our gaming weeks.

2376962	2378364	Let's get into gaming news, Loki.
2379522	2388664	Well, there's rumors that Sony is shutting down one of their first party developers, Zipper Interactive, who just put out the Vita game, Unit 13.
2389584	2391565	They may be gone.
2392685	2400627	Apparently there's been some chatter for several days about an impending closure and the possibility of cancellations of a current project.
2400987	2402527	Of course, Sony hasn't made a comment on it.
2402747	2406308	And besides, you know, Unit 13, they're of course the ones behind Zipper.
2406608	2409610	Socom, US Navy SEALs, and MAG.
2410351	2414895	So they kind of know their shooters, but I don't know.
2414915	2419878	Maybe it's just because they can't really compete with, say, Call of Duty or Battlefield.
2419918	2423021	Maybe this is why they're kind of letting them go and restructuring.
2423781	2424062	Who knows?
2426141	2434826	Hmm well it's never good to hear about studios closing but I mean wasn't SOCOM still a pretty strong series or did I miss something?
2435226	2451595	Um I don't know how well SOCOM 4 did um I would have thought that they would have you know tried to well maybe they tried with MAG maybe that was the whole thing is um you know they were trying to you know do something with that but um maybe it just didn't really work out.
2452495	2453675	Also, also.
2453756	2454776	But it also is a rumor.
2455416	2463499	Also, the other thing might have kind of hurt SOCOM 4 was the fact that SOCOM 4 launched right before the whole PlayStation Network blackout there.
2463979	2464960	Oh, that's right.
2465380	2471342	I thought I remembered there was something that kind of like about SOCOM 4 that was like iffy in the community.
2471682	2472122	That's right.
2472402	2473062	That's what it was.
2473122	2476304	The fact that it came out the week they took the network down for like a month.
2476744	2476984	Yeah.
2477064	2477644	Yeah.
2477784	2479165	That probably didn't help.
2479805	2479885	No.
2480285	2504285	but interesting that all this time later something happens I'm also surprised if that in spite of that they didn't try to relaunch SOCOM for the holidays or maybe they did and I just you know that's not usually a series I follow so but I'm surprised there wouldn't be like a SOCOM 4 game of the year edition since that's what they're all called or SOCOM 4 platinum guns edition or something that comes out at the end of the year to try and relaunch it
2504705	2505465	I'm surprised too.
2505545	2507806	I mean, I don't know.
2507826	2509706	I didn't think SOCOM 4 is a bad game.
2510406	2511727	I think it got pretty good reviews.
2511887	2514768	It's just... I don't know.
2514788	2516748	Maybe it's just not enough room right now.
2517548	2518949	Maybe they're focusing on something else.
2519609	2523110	Maybe they're just getting rid of these guys because they're going to have someone else working on SOCOM.
2523130	2523430	Who knows?
2523550	2523730	Maybe...
2524250	2525151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2541387	2541968	Thanks for watching!
2566281	2566761	Thanks for watching!
2582012	2587174	Meanwhile, over in Xbox territory, there is yet another arcade promotion going on.
2587654	2593316	So it seems like Xbox, Microsoft, and all them have found success in these, you know, summer of arcade.
2593716	2594796	What's the winner one called?
2594837	2596037	Block Party, right?
2596457	2598738	So since it's so successful... Let's do it quarterly.
2599138	2600579	Arcade Next Trials Evolution
2623054	2627659	Bloodforge on April 25th, Fable Heroes on May 2nd.
2627739	2630301	Now, that is not the It's Not on Rails fable.
2630341	2632102	That's the Mario Party fable, right?
2632303	2632903	That looks all right.
2633183	2637988	It's kind of like a little bit Mario Party crossed with Castle Crashers, I guess.
2638328	2638668	All right.
2639369	2639769	Interesting.
2640190	2645354	And then, obviously, this is the huge one, the big one, May 9th, Minecraft.
2645794	2646755	It's going to be 1,600 Microsoft points.
2649017	2669286	and it should be noted too that because of the recent change in the gamer score for arcade all of these games will now offer the 400 gamer score it's not going to be because April's the month they're starting that right so all these games will now have you know 400 gamer score instead of 200 available to you I mean I'd like to try Minecraft out you know again
2670166	2672189	Yeah, I kind of want to give Minecraft a second chance.
2672229	2677636	I don't really want to pay 1,600 points for it, only to be... if I'm disappointed in it.
2677977	2680661	But all the Xbox... Yeah, they come with demos, so I'll...
2681337	2686702	Let's everybody cross your fingers that the Minecraft one's really good because I want to give it another chance.
2686923	2687163	I do.
2688244	2688745	So we'll see.
2688925	2690106	I am kind of curious about Trials.
2690146	2692528	I kind of skipped the first one, but it sounds interesting.
2692869	2693669	They showed another one.
2693689	2701037	There was a picture I saw where I think it was the devs that did Limbo did a level that looks like Limbo in Trials.
2702165	2702726	That's awesome.
2703586	2705368	I do want to point out the price of the other games.
2705448	2707250	Fable Heroes will be 800 points.
2707270	2708111	That's about 10 bucks.
2708251	2710533	All the others, Evolution, Bloodforge, 15 bucks.
2711774	2713155	So that's the pricing for those games.
2713456	2718360	Now what we haven't heard about, I have not heard anything about what you get if you buy all four games.
2718400	2724786	Because remember, that was an important part of the promotion for Block Party and Summer of Arcade, is like buy all four, get...
2725928	2747369	400 points in the mail or something like that right or get 1200 points or get a game for free you know depending on what what promotion it is but yet I'm not hearing anything with this so this is just straight up a send out a press release to all the gaming sites and get the games more exposure right get an ad in magazines it's still a while away I mean they could always announce something
2747523	2747924	That's true.
2748024	2749305	There may be something coming out later.
2750907	2759358	Even if it's something derpy, like something for your, I keep wanting to say your me, but for your avatar, like a little next shirt or something.
2759779	2765346	I mean, even if they throw something like that in there, there'll be people that give it a shot just to have that, you know?
2766882	2770283	Not very many people, but there will be people.
2771064	2771464	Never know.
2772304	2777466	Derek H in chat says, does that mean Minecraft is the highest priced Xbox Live Arcade game ever?
2778066	2779667	No, the Penny Arcade game was also $1,600.
2779767	2787030	I want to say, well, some of them you may consider Xbox Live Arcade and some you may not.
2787330	2797138	Remember, some games are released not as Xbox Live Arcade, but as actually those games on demand because they don't fit within the constraints of the file size.
2797238	2806986	True, and one could argue that a game that didn't get released here, like wasn't there that Japanese import shooter that you could only get through on demand?
2807426	2807606	Right?
2807626	2808447	Wasn't there something like that?
2808467	2810088	Well, there was this original Crisis, too.
2810128	2812530	Crisis, I think, was HD or something like that.
2812710	2814011	They had come out.
2814351	2815091	I don't remember if that was $20.
2815652	2816412	I think it was at least $20.
2816512	2816692	Yeah.
2816732	2826479	But, I mean, if you want to count just strictly what's in the category of XBLA, then it ties for most expensive game ever, yes.
2826559	2827099	Don't get me wrong.
2827119	2830522	They're probably going to try to inch that up a little bit, but...
2831162	2835483	Yeah, there might be DLC that'll bump it up a little, especially in a game like Minecraft.
2836104	2837144	It's possible.
2837264	2838504	The question is, will they go there?
2839625	2841065	All right, let's move on.
2841225	2841685	DarkSakura.
2842505	2847207	Well, we've discussed this till we were blue in the face, but Mass Effect 3.
2848843	2869937	We don't like the ending Well, Bioware is listening I don't know why, but they're listening And the co-founder, Ray, and I always mispronounce his name, Musica Has said that they are actually going to work to answer those open-ended questions And give closure to the fans
2871881	2876683	and described the fan feedback as incredibly painful.
2878123	2891587	So basically everyone bitched and they're putting out some DLC to I guess expand more on the ending but he's saying, and this is a quote, our first instinct is to defend the work and point out the high ratings offered by critics.
2891888	2892888	What do critics know?
2894056	2900142	Out of respect to our fans, we need to accept the criticism and feedback with humility.
2902945	2903906	Sorry you didn't like it.
2904167	2907050	We're not going to change that much about it, but maybe you'll like this.
2908692	2910053	That's what I can tell.
2911255	2914158	I guess the only thing to do is wait and see.
2915342	2941600	I think it's a terrible idea I've calmed down a little bit on the idea I still don't think this excuses certain behaviors of certain people on the internet namely those that are harassing the employees of Bioware that's totally fucking unacceptable I don't give a fuck how much you've spent or invested in the Mass Effect series some of the vile shit I've read on the internet about the creators of the games like seriously, fuck off
2942020	2942420	It's a game.
2959053	2966499	The whole, I don't think this is on the show roll later, so the whole using Child's Play, I think, went a little bit far.
2966679	2976626	I think maybe somebody was good intentioned with that whole thing, but at the end of the day, people were calling Child's Play, saying, how much do I have to donate to get the ending changed?
2976706	2979168	And Child's Play's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2980785	2981846	What are we here?
2982927	2989353	Are we an organization that's supposed to help you get your beef with game publishers resolved?
2989733	2993817	Or are we an organization trying to bring joy into sick children's lives?
2994578	3000003	And so they came out with a clarification that if you do a fundraiser for Child's Play, Child's Play is the cause.
3000323	3001845	There is to be no other cause.
3001885	3002526	Child's Play is the cause.
3002566	3004668	And I say bravo to that.
3006449	3014837	Now, I'm not as harsh on that because I realize there might have been good intentions there, but unfortunately some people aren't smart.
3016078	3017179	I don't know how else to put it.
3017259	3023505	But like what you just said, and this is why I'm just scared of what this kind of precedent says.
3024026	3027189	How much money do I have to pay for them to change the ending?
3028991	3031834	How much money do I have to pay for them to change the ending?
3032155	3032455	Really?
3032575	3034617	Are people actually asking that question?
3034778	3035298	Funny enough.
3035558	3036179	Go ahead, Jamie.
3036199	3038522	I was going to say, that right there is America.
3039204	3043826	And I was going to say, funny enough, Loki, that's the part where I become okay with this.
3043846	3054989	Because although I've been bashing all these things, I realize the vast majority of people out there that probably went to go click like on the page or have said a nasty tweet about, God, that ending sucked or whatever.
3055389	3060131	I realize the vast majority of those people aren't insane like some of the other people I just mentioned.
3061011	3067573	But, you know, if they're going to put it out there, like, if BioWare does a DLC ending, I will buy it and I will support it.
3067653	3071173	I'm kind of like, alright, then fine.
3072154	3074954	At least you'll have the choice if you want to invest that money or not.
3075074	3077695	And it's like, if people want to buy it, then fine.
3078155	3080515	It's a weird, weird precedent.
3080555	3083636	And we were just talking about this a little bit with Bobby before us here tonight.
3084316	3086797	And I was mentioning about Final Fantasy VII.
3087637	3089397	A lot of people hated that ending too.
3089537	3092858	And if that game came out today, a lot of people would probably be doing the same thing.
3092918	3095959	Like, wow, two of the characters were just fucking missing in the ending.
3096139	3101500	But, once again though, it's so what if it was a terrible ending for Final Fantasy 7?
3102360	3103500	People bought Final Fantasy 8.
3103660	3104780	People bought Final Fantasy 9.
3104900	3106021	People bought Final Fantasy 10.
3106221	3107061	They bought 10 too.
3107521	3108381	They probably bought 11.
3109001	3109361	They bought 12.
3109421	3110782	They bought 13.
3111022	3115383	Did it really hurt the sales of those because they didn't like the game?
3115703	3116883	Nobody bought Final Fantasy 11.
3117563	3119365	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, don't send the hate mail.
3120186	3129477	But there were a lot of Final Fantasy fans that did reject XI, but there were enough that embraced it that gave us XIV, which truly nobody bought XIV.
3129497	3132441	When that shit goes free to play, watch how many fans reject that.
3133462	3135505	Anyway, back to the topic here.
3136158	3136538	E.A.
3136618	3137779	kind of invented that mess.
3157267	3159829	Maybe they didn't invent it, but they perfected it, let's say.
3160189	3162410	They did start the online pass, did they not?
3162890	3166112	So they've figured out how to milk all the extra dollars for a video game.
3166152	3171174	So in that capacity, EA kind of has themselves to blame for the fan backlash.
3171574	3177417	Because if this were 10 years ago, fans wouldn't be saying this because there wouldn't really be anything they could do about it.
3177758	3181700	They would have to just write on their live journals, I don't like the ending.
3181820	3184101	What they should do is just fucking shut the hell up.
3184821	3185482	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3200727	3201728	What about their time?
3202348	3208071	Well, devil's advocate, I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with you, but just giving you another perspective that's on the internet.
3208091	3217896	There's a lot of talk on the internet that the ending was changed at the last minute and that the writers of the original ending were basically shafted because I guess there was a leak that had ruined it.
3218597	3221679	I mean, I wasn't following the Mass Effect series then, so I don't know much about this.
3221719	3222679	I'm just hearing it secondhand.
3222999	3228562	But I guess there was a leak that spoiled the first ending, so the creator kind of made this new ending...
3230773	3239289	If the internet is to be believed, literally pulled it out of his ass and that's the ending we have because they wanted to get back at the spoiled leak, I guess.
3240832	3241774	That doesn't make any sense.
3242235	3242676	Just saying.
3244355	3272369	and also like I take you know I have a problem with the fact that all these people hate it and then like you know the game reviews and stuff and granted everyone is you know open to their own opinion but a lot of the game reviews have been really positive for it I didn't hear anyone saying they're not letting a 15 minute ending or even if it's an hour ending ruin what is otherwise exactly and that's how everybody should take it instead of just being so goddamn focused on the last 15 minutes of the game
3275169	3282013	SGO100 Matt has some pretty strong words in our chatroom at chat.orangesoundradio.com Let the artists paint the picture and write the image they want.
3282373	3283874	Gamers aren't entitled to nothing.
3284154	3285615	Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
3285635	3287416	If you don't like the ride, get the fuck off it.
3287616	3289837	Exactly, and you don't have to purchase their next game.
3289877	3291038	But see, I think that's why they did it.
3291318	3291778	Two reasons.
3292019	3294100	One, so they could possibly sell more DLC.
3294480	3297902	Because, you know, the publisher's like, yeah, yeah, you should make a new ending.
3298522	3301284	We'll give you a little bit of money, and we're going to make a lot of money in return.
3301825	3308381	and it appeases the fans so that when Mass Effect 4 comes out, because you know there will be a Mass Effect 4, that they will buy it.
3311525	3336845	I just think this whole sense of entitlement thing that's going on in this country is probably the most ridiculous thing to ever happen it's a truly modern phenomenon and people really need to get over themselves and realize that you know it not being what you want or not getting what you want doesn't mean that it's a complete affront to you in particular you know that it's they're doing this on purpose you know
3337964	3338464	Stop being a baby.
3338504	3339205	I mean that makes no sense.
3339225	3339305	Yeah.
3362879	3365161	That sounds like fanboy speculation.
3365262	3370507	It's going to be interesting very much to see the impact that this has on an inevitable Mass Effect 4.
3371428	3377093	And yes, fans, I realize that apparently they have said there's not going to be any more Mass Effect.
3377133	3378114	But seriously?
3378775	3379876	You fucking believe that?
3379976	3380677	Seriously?
3381498	3381778	Yeah.
3382138	3384921	There wasn't going to be any more Halo after Halo 3 either.
3385322	3385862	You know, there was...
3386883	3402110	they'll find a way to do Mass Effect 4 it may not be called Mass Effect 4 the series will continue it's too fucking big to not it might not be Bioware so you may really not want it to happen but it'll happen somebody will do it
3403598	3407440	Disney Interactive announced Disney's Epic Mickey 2, The Power of Two.
3425256	3431518	I was really hoping for The Power of Love, but you know, that's... It sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie to me.
3431538	3432519	The Power of Two.
3432539	3433359	The Power of Two.
3433879	3444523	So yes, this new, you know, as all the kind of rumors were, it actually is going to feature both Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.
3445463	3449385	And Oswald's going to be AI controlled, of course.
3451007	3451508	Thanks for watching!
3470391	3470972	It looks neat.
3471132	3472132	I watched the trailer for it.
3472172	3477994	I mean, I didn't play the original game, which is kind of a fault on my part because it looked like a pretty awesome game.
3478735	3481696	Maybe I'll check it out on the 360 when it comes out.
3482616	3488199	I'm just glad Disney Interactive is making something because for a while there, they didn't have anything since Disney Universe.
3488239	3490780	I was like, damn, did they just go away or something?
3490800	3493421	I was getting worried, but...
3494321	3500807	Well, yeah, the split second was the Disney game.
3501268	3504230	That studio got obliterated, didn't it?
3504250	3504851	Yeah, BlackRock.
3505111	3506092	Yeah, that's unfortunate.
3506352	3507533	There's another movie tie-in game.
3507614	3509075	Brave has a movie coming up.
3510020	3514203	Okay, but you know, I expect the kiddie games to all get tie-ins.
3514224	3516866	Those are usually the first ones to have, like, the movie tie-in.
3516886	3519648	Well, there wasn't really anything for Twilight, unless you count seeing it at Twilight.
3520008	3520509	Konami!
3520909	3521810	Way to go, Konami!
3522210	3524552	What in the fuck would a Twilight video game be?
3524652	3530317	Seriously, I can't believe I'm about to admit this on the radio, but I saw Breaking Dawn Part 1.
3530637	3532318	It's the only Twilight movie I've seen.
3532839	3536742	In my defense... In my defense... Put the hate mail down.
3536802	3537543	In my defense...
3538263	3542607	It was with Riff Trax, which I think is the only tolerable way to see.
3542727	3544168	It is the only way to see those movies.
3544328	3546030	But my God.
3547496	3549157	Where was the plot in that movie?
3549217	3558124	It was literally like 30 minutes of them fucking and being on the beach and like, I love you and we're going to be together.
3558624	3563528	I'm like, oh my God, people paid a lot of money to see this in the theater.
3564309	3568011	You would pay $50 for a video game for Breaking Dawn Part 1?
3568732	3569753	The fuck would you do?
3570613	3575016	I would love to see a game that was controlled very much like Dragon's Lair.
3575297	3576838	It was just like left, right.
3578619	3579520	Be emo to the left.
3580280	3581141	Be emo to the right.
3582862	3583923	Sulk to the right.
3584483	3585564	Sulk to the left.
3587385	3588086	Sparkle.
3588446	3594730	Prevent this wedding from becoming her hallucination by pressing A repeatedly to stop them from turning into vampires.
3594750	3595751	I think it would be kind of funny.
3596431	3598693	I mean, someone has to have the sense of humor to do that.
3602051	3602432	Anyhow.
3604334	3606676	Oh, and 3DS is getting a version as well.
3607377	3611882	Power of Illusion, which made me think of Castle of Illusion, so maybe that's a good sign?
3614385	3615106	That is interesting.
3615666	3618630	Epic Mickey, we've known about this for a while from some of the leaks.
3618690	3620292	I know we've talked about it on the show before, but...
3620672	3625614	Putting all that aside, are we surprised it's actually happening, or no?
3625674	3627794	Because Epic Mickey... It sold well.
3628074	3628374	Yeah?
3628554	3628734	Yeah.
3629635	3633836	I guess maybe for those of us that focus more on our 360s... It had a lot of neat stuff in it.
3634036	3634356	It did.
3634396	3639298	I'm not saying it was a bad game, but the Wii-only thing really kept it away from the hardcore.
3639378	3646260	Yeah, and see, that's kind of... I think that's the reason why I didn't play the game, was remember the original concept art for...
3647461	3650763	Epic Mickey, where it's going to be really fucking twisted and dark.
3650803	3658830	It was like, not necessarily Tim Burton, but Guillermo del Toro put out a version of Mickey Mouse.
3658850	3662353	That was like fucking the game right there.
3662553	3665416	It was just really crazy and steampunk and all this stuff.
3665776	3668978	And then we got the version that came out in the Wii, and they just kind of like...
3669739	3671000	You know, kind of washed all that.
3671060	3677664	I mean, there was still a lot of dark stuff in there, but it wasn't anywhere near like this adult Mickey game that was supposed to be coming out.
3677704	3680566	It was kind of like, oh, it's Mickey saving the land.
3680586	3683788	You can't have a truly adult Mickey game.
3684403	3687225	Well, why can't you have a... Okay, let's put it this way.
3687305	3690088	Not an adult game, but a very, very dark.
3690508	3692249	Dark, dark, dark, dark Mickey game.
3692309	3694451	I think Epic Mickey is about as dark as you're going to get.
3695112	3696913	But, you know, it's the Disney image.
3697073	3700036	You don't want to associate Disney with dark things.
3700756	3702978	And I'm talking the company and Mickey Mouse as a whole.
3703058	3708182	Disney does some dark-ish... I mean, you could call Alice in Wonderland a little bit dark.
3708202	3708943	What about Kingdom Hearts, though?
3708963	3710344	Or Tron, even, is a little bit dark.
3710544	3712946	Well, Kingdom Hearts kind of goes a little bit dark with stuff.
3713026	3715007	But even Kingdom Hearts is a little bit kiddy.
3715227	3716908	And I love Kingdom Hearts.
3718089	3722491	But I'm just saying, like, touching on more of like, you know, just having the stuff be all really twisted.
3723092	3728235	Anything that's dark that comes out of Disney really comes from Touchstone or whatever their movie arm is.
3728255	3729115	It's fine.
3729396	3730796	Buena Vista or whatever it's called.
3730816	3733838	We'll just have it produced by Touchstone Interactive or whatever.
3733938	3734779	Make up a company.
3736397	3736757	Who knows?
3736797	3737057	Who knows?
3737398	3737638	All right.
3739499	3742881	I'm glad they're doing PlayStation 3 and Xbox as well.
3742941	3747965	I think it'll be, you know, because the Wii is on its way out, especially with the Wii U coming out this year.
3748305	3750066	I'm glad they're stepping it up to the other systems.
3750426	3751607	It really is on its way out.
3751647	3755830	I mean, there's literally hardly any games coming out at all for the Wii.
3756130	3760494	Oh god, a page right out of the 23rd Magus Jokes book.
3760514	3761315	You ready for this one?
3761715	3764798	Brad from PodCulture in chat says, Adult Mickey?
3765239	3766400	Are you fucking goofy?
3766420	3771164	At least it got his main laugh.
3771224	3776409	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to...
3780745	3786149	Ragenator in our chatroom says, Sky, please tell us you were either drunk and or high when you saw Twilight.
3786269	3788210	No, I was neither drunk nor high.
3788631	3789431	I was fat.
3790172	3791733	I was eating pizza at the time.
3792173	3794355	So I was fat, but I was not drunk or high.
3796176	3799319	Do you think pizza contains things that will get you wasted?
3799419	3799739	I don't know.
3799959	3800200	All right.
3800920	3801561	Let me put it this way.
3801601	3805744	Twilight, even Rift Tracks couldn't make that movie good.
3808610	3809830	I have friends that love it.
3810791	3812191	They swear it's only for the guilty pleasure.
3812211	3813932	You should really question your friendship with them.
3814052	3817053	No, no, because they're close friends of mine, but it's like, oh my God.
3817693	3818393	All right, you know what?
3818493	3819494	I have my things too.
3819574	3822195	Not everybody understands Rocky Horror Picture Show, so whatever.
3822455	3823455	I like Xanadu.
3824315	3825536	Yeah, you are a little weird.
3825856	3826276	Shut up.
3828140	3829542	Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair
3845240	3847482	Oh, it isn't on Xbox Live Arcade.
3847502	3850144	It's like the one fucking platform Dragon's Lair isn't on.
3850445	3854088	Because I could get it on, oh God, I could get it on DVD.
3854188	3855749	I have it on my DVD player.
3855849	3856750	Blu-ray.
3857491	3858932	I get it on my iPhone.
3859032	3860834	I could get it on the PlayStation.
3860874	3862515	Sega CD.
3862535	3865158	This game has been on everything CD-based.
3865238	3868541	However, when the early versions were out, the best version was on the CD-i.
3869161	3869702	Why is that?
3870182	3871143	Because it was the full version.
3871912	3872512	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3899378	3901359	Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair
3922799	3924060	There's several ways you can look at this.
3924680	3929944	You can go, well, I mean, they've put it out so many other times, they had to do something new to it.
3930765	3936128	Or you could look at it and go, they're ruining my childhood in front of my eyes.
3938029	3939190	How do you feel about this?
3939450	3941972	I especially want to know, DarkSakura, because you like Dragon's Lair.
3942272	3943513	What do you think about Kinect support?
3944414	3946255	I'm indifferent about it because I'm not going to buy it.
3947856	3950258	Seriously, how many other versions of Dragon's Lair do I own?
3951877	3962226	You know, it kind of would be like, you know, for all the people who like... Actually, I can think of a benefit on this.
3963567	3966210	You know, people who may not be able to use a controller...
3969071	3997124	or maybe people with no arms they can use their feet well to be fair you would have to like some of the motions they're talking about are raising your hand up to grab the rope so unless you can trick the Kinect to think your foot is your hand which maybe is possible or use something else I don't know you're right there could be somebody with a disability where they can't use a controller but I don't know how many people would fit into the category of can't use a controller can use these Kinect commands
3997679	3999180	Maybe they have no hands.
4001162	4002082	Maybe they're missing fingers.
4002182	4003043	Now you're stretching.
4003523	4007186	Well, I'm just saying that they put it out there for a reason.
4007286	4009788	Someone's gonna probably like it and pay for it.
4010328	4010709	Not me.
4010969	4011749	I just don't care.
4013931	4015452	Let them do whatever they want to with it.
4015472	4016573	It's not costing me any money.
4017033	4022277	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com Stan in our chatroom says, Oh no, does that mean you can put your face on that guy's face?
4023198	4023998	Dirk the Daring, you mean?
4024899	4025439	Let's hope not.
4027082	4027763	Let's really hope not.
4027983	4029424	More like Derp the Daring.
4030424	4033486	Actdeft says, Dragon's Lair plus Kinect.
4033647	4035808	Why did they think this was a good idea?
4036569	4036989	I don't know.
4037869	4041052	I guess they're props to them trying to do something new.
4041992	4043413	That's about the nicest thing I can say.
4043433	4045555	They're trying to make it a party game, a social game.
4045575	4048177	I mean, because it's Dragon's Lair.
4048217	4049918	You got to do something to... Oh, yeah.
4049938	4052400	When I think party, I think bust out Dragon's Lair.
4053120	4053320	DarkSakura
4077327	4078127	I got your news.
4078548	4079548	I got your news right here.
4080969	4084330	Apparently, exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior.
4084990	4085330	Warning.
4085530	4086031	Shut up!
4087891	4089092	Well, it's not true, but still.
4090172	4103398	Yeah, there is another bill that wants to label any game that's E or higher that exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior.
4104038	4105039	E or higher?
4106294	4108136	That would be all games.
4108836	4115323	I can think of maybe two games that had the Y, the youth rating on it.
4115483	4116023	That's old.
4116164	4117225	It's EC nowadays.
4117545	4120628	Whatever it is, I can think of maybe two games.
4122597	4125861	Frank Wolf, Virginia, Joe Baca, California,
4142458	4168548	who basically want they call it the Violence of Video Games Labeling Act and I mean basically they've done this before they did it in 2009 which was for TNUP they're just not giving up and it's already been proven to be unconstitutional so I don't know what they're thinking you know there's a saying that doing the same thing multiple times in a row and expecting different results is insanity
4169912	4172160	Well, they're insane.
4173726	4174910	People don't vote for them.
4177503	4178724	Super Mario Bros.
4178744	4180145	Wii will lead to aggressive behavior
4208524	4209586	Imagine Babies.
4209726	4212830	SingStar Abba will lean to aggressive behavior.
4213010	4213691	Forza.
4214232	4226048	Well, here, basically, this is what they said about the last time they tried to do this, is that basically that the Supreme Court found all of the data lacking and unpersuasive.
4226888	4241303	And really, even these own studies, if you go and read them, they contradict themselves because they also bring up that violent movies or any movie causes the same reaction in a child already predisposed towards it.
4241923	4247609	It has just as much influence as a movie, as a book, as songs, as anything audiovisual.
4249031	4252817	So, these men are clearly insane.
4253137	4254420	That's the only thing that I can say.
4254920	4258827	Again, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity.
4259958	4265882	On a tangent here for a minute, speaking of politicians who don't understand video games, did you hear the latest in the Leland Yee saga?
4266683	4270545	Oh, what?
4270625	4274368	The interesting thing is that this is a bill that you look at and go, yes, we do need this.
4275169	4285656	Remember, Leland Yee was the guy in California, I want to say Democrat out of San Francisco, who was trying to pass the bill on violent video games not being able to be sold online.
4286176	4288117	Thank you for watching!
4307589	4311450	He wrote a bill this week that actually you look at and go, okay, now that makes sense.
4311690	4313311	That's technology he does understand.
4313751	4330536	He authored a bill in California which will make it illegal for employers to ask you for your Facebook password because you might have been hearing the stories this week, the nightmare stories about people that went into job interviews and the interviewees were like, okay, log into Facebook for me so I can check out what you're really like.
4331256	4333978	And everybody's like, wow, that's an invasion of privacy.
4334258	4335639	Employers shouldn't be able to do that.
4336100	4338922	And so, yeah, Facebook has come out and said, don't do it.
4339422	4341723	And now Leland Yee is going to make it illegal in California.
4341743	4344906	And I was kind of like, well, that's a smart – oh, wait.
4344966	4345526	No, it's him.
4346086	4348148	He's all right.
4348168	4349369	Better read the fine text.
4349449	4351550	I'm sure he's got violent video game stuff hidden in there.
4351570	4352291	It might be hidden in there.
4352311	4352991	You got to look for it.
4353011	4353431	This is great.
4353472	4354092	Just pass it through.
4354252	4360078	I actually posted a comic on my Tumblr yesterday that was a woman in an interview.
4360098	4362020	She's like, okay, well, you've passed all of this.
4362120	4364102	Now let me see your Facebook.
4364122	4365183	She's like, let me see yours.
4366954	4368394	Oh yeah, that's what I would say too.
4368434	4371115	I probably wouldn't get the job, but would you want to work for a company that does that?
4371175	4371415	I don't know.
4371435	4377456	It's tough because in this day and age, people really, really need jobs and it's kind of gross.
4377556	4380357	It's just gross that employers are exploiting that.
4380437	4381517	It's gross.
4382177	4384518	I think employers that do that should be called out.
4384698	4388618	I think we should have a list of employers that are violating the privacy of their employees.
4388638	4391119	And create two Facebook pages.
4392665	4393505	I know, I know, right?
4393605	4395026	Or just say, I don't have one.
4395966	4396666	They won't believe you.
4396846	4397366	They won't believe you.
4397386	4398086	They'll search for you.
4398166	4402047	But if you use a fake name on the internet, it'll be hard to find.
4403488	4405548	And honestly, anyone can read my Facebook page.
4405688	4406208	I don't care.
4406288	4407969	Don't post anything private on there anyways.
4407989	4408789	I don't care.
4408829	4411470	I mean, my mother and my rabbi are on my Facebook.
4411830	4412570	So, really.
4413442	4416344	But you can see where not everybody would want their employers on their Facebook.
4416384	4416905	You know what I mean?
4417685	4423049	For me, it's a private... Yes, I have co-workers on Facebook, but it's my choice.
4423330	4428293	I don't want him on my Facebook either because I just don't want to talk to him on Facebook.
4429234	4429855	I don't really care.
4431176	4431776	Alright, anyhow.
4433077	4434418	Let's move on with some release dates.
4434438	4438521	We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a gaming store near you.
4438561	4439302	We'll start with the U.S.
4439862	4440923	That's slowing down a bit.
4441424	4443806	GoGo Crazy Bones on the Nintendo DS.
4443846	4445227	I'm sure that was delayed to this week.
4446168	4447529	Melee to aggressive behavior.
4447589	4448670	Those crazy bones.
4449350	4449911	Damn them.
4450451	4453114	Supremacy MMA for the PlayStation Vita.
4453974	4455596	That's coming out this week as well.
4456056	4458098	Myst on the 3DS.
4458298	4459659	It's in 3D and it's Myst.
4461093	4461573	Yay.
4461593	4463714	That game's awesome, 15 years ago.
4464235	4466156	You know, I have a parody of that game called Pissed.
4466676	4468117	I remember that, actually.
4468717	4469678	Yeah, I never played it.
4469738	4470378	I just thought it was funny.
4470738	4476321	And I can guarantee that there's 100% more mist in that game than there is in the Silent Hill HD Collection.
4479062	4479983	I see what you did there.
4480283	4482764	Country Dance All-Stars for Kinect.
4487041	4507701	Warriors Orochi 3 on Xbox 360 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week including collector's editions if you really need a collector's edition for a golf game sure why not the Capcom Digital Collection on Xbox 360 which is a collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that are already out there
4510441	4515867	And maybe or maybe not this week, because no one seems to have the answer for it, Ridge Racer Unbounded.
4516007	4519171	Possibly coming out this week, possibly delayed to who knows when.
4519852	4521373	Because even Namco doesn't know.
4522094	4524437	So, possibly this week.
4525578	4527139	Alright, going to Japan.
4528019	4528980	Are we good to go to Japan now?
4529000	4531361	Yay, we're going to Japan.
4532041	4537004	On the Nintendo 3DS in Japan this week, probably a big release some of you might care about.
4537104	4538865	This might be worth importing to some of you.
4539365	4545128	Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance gets released on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan on the 29th.
4545969	4550351	Remember, you can't import from the 3DS unless you have a Japanese region 3DS.
4550951	4553432	Right, it is not region-free like the original DS was, right?
4553693	4554433	Yes.
4555053	4561437	Well, if you want to get a Japanese 3DS, there is specifically a Kingdom Hearts 3D DS that you can get.
4561497	4566300	It's like a black one that kind of looks nice, like a little inscription of Disney.
4566360	4569221	I don't know if that's a sticker they put on it, but it looks like an inscription.
4569241	4569381	Oh, okay.
4572603	4574985	So it's a little more permanent, so that's good.
4575325	4578448	So that's, you know, kind of your big release, and that's on the 3DS this week.
4578468	4580550	But there are some other games coming out in Japan this week.
4581291	4591680	On the PlayStation Vita, there's Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012, Otumao to Seven-Nin no Himi Gimitachi, Shin Osamu Monogatari.
4592220	4594162	That is coming out from Konami this week.
4594362	4598486	I don't know if this is a series I recognize on the Vita.
4601798	4604920	It's like a chibi character role-playing game.
4607322	4611325	When I saw the people at first, I was like, oh, it's like Suikoden, but it's definitely not.
4611365	4615088	It's too cartoony to be that, so something a little different there.
4615108	4618290	But that's from Konami, which is a pretty big publisher in Japan.
4620111	4623894	Going to the consoles real quick, let me take a look at the Xbox 360.
4624735	4626316	Japan gets Duke Nukem Forever.
4628411	4629451	Stay away from it.
4629531	4630232	It's horrible.
4631072	4635293	Root Double, Before Crime, After Days, Mahjong, Dream Club, all on the 360.
4636454	4641236	And lastly, on the PlayStation 3 this week, Grand Theft Auto, episodes from Liberty Cities.
4641416	4642496	It's like a price reduction.
4642896	4644737	Duke Nukem Forever is out there as well.
4644777	4647458	The Silent Hill HD collection makes its way to Japan.
4648358	4654460	Idol Master, Gravure for You, Volume 6, comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.
4655080	4656521	So there you go, your Japanese releases.
4658697	4659697	How about UK?
4659997	4660778	We do have a few.
4661618	4667220	For the UK releases, we have on the 28th, we have Wrecked, Revenge Revisited.
4667961	4670521	On the 29th, Silent Hill HD Collection.
4670622	4679665	On the 30th, Silent Hill Downpour, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Ridge Racer Unbound, Warriors Orochi 3.
4682166	4682406	Awesome.
4684409	4684709	All right.
4684909	4687651	Let's do a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.
4687751	4688011	Loki?
4688912	4690013	All right.
4690633	4698198	So apparently Ubisoft is hoping that they can get rid of their DRM that they have on PC.
4698918	4707664	According to a recent interview with Eurogamer, Chris Early, who is the vice president of digital publishing at Ubisoft, said,
4708544	4714926	Talked about some of their anti-piracy measures and how it's a tricky balancing act.
4716327	4728491	Basically, they were talking a little bit about how it's kind of inconveniencing some of their customers and that at the same time, they don't want to put...
4730652	4737722	They're having a hard time convincing themselves to not put DRM on their PC tiles because they know they're going to get pirated.
4737762	4746736	So they're trying to find a balance where they can offer enough value in a game where people will want to buy it legitimately without having to
4747437	4748578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4766501	4793431	but right now they're saying the question is with enough ongoing content development content release engagement at the community level we can create that kind of MMO value system I think we can as the rest of the game industry continues to evolve the more you hear about cloud gaming the more you hear about companion gaming the less pirated games should work in all of that environment
4794031	4801813	So basically, they're trying to make it where you're... Well, cloud gaming, I mean, they're basically making it where you don't have any of the content.
4801833	4802993	You just kind of access it.
4803194	4810976	And then the MMO stuff, just kind of more... It sounds like a lot of pay-to-purchase, pay-to-play stuff.
4811376	4811516	Right.
4812256	4818257	It's kind of like, yeah, they're trying to enrich it by giving it more to download.
4818818	4821418	It's almost like the Mass Effect 2 thing I'm going through right now.
4821558	4823859	I got a copy of Mass Effect 2 for $20, brand new.
4823879	4826459	I'm like, fuck yeah, sweet, a copy of Mass Effect 2.
4826999	4831140	Almost got pissed as hell when I saw it came with a free code for the Cerebrus Network.
4831640	4833021	Expires January 1st, 2012.
4834481	4863191	and I just bought it off the shelf at Fry's brand new like but it's still I tried using it anyway it still worked so crisis averted right so by the way those pro tip those codes might not actually expire when they say they do just throwing it out there but the other thing I wanted to say is that I find that now I'm being told oh I have to buy the $7 DLC because it will change some things in three and then there's other DLC I might have to drop another 20 bucks in DLC to get the full experience and
4863411	4868233	So, they're still going to get $40 out of me for the whole game, even though I thought I was getting it on sale.
4868753	4877337	What they really should do, and like I was saying before with the whole Killzone 3 online thing, how that was free, that's how you get people interested in your game.
4877617	4879438	You put that shit out there digitally for free.
4880818	4881959	You can even do it like a demo.
4882599	4885281	and then you add content and you're basically free to play.
4885301	4890605	You're free to start playing it but then you pay for additional content or you can get everything boxed together.
4891346	4895249	Is that like the whole idea that Ridge Racer on the Vita would be awesome if it was free?
4897222	4908095	I wouldn't go as far as saying it'd be awesome, but it'd be a lot easier to swallow that, okay, yes, there's only three tracks and five cars because this is the free version of the game versus the $30 version of the game.
4908115	4909096	Well, there's the Motorstorm.
4909336	4912400	The Motorstorm game's free, and they have a lot of DLC for it.
4912620	4931129	Exactly, that's kind of a perfect example there, although that DLC, you don't really need any of it, I mean, because it's just cars that change the appearance of your cars, which, since you're not really racing anybody anyways, I don't really see the point of making your car look different, considering that I don't think they handle any different, but whatever.
4931829	4937752	You know, you can do that, and that DLC, though, is anywhere from like a quarter a pop to like a buck, I mean, which...
4938232	4939373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4966132	4967914	and I knew this comment was coming in the chat room.
4967954	4971036	Acidic Vampire says, Sky, just drop the money for it.
4971296	4974738	Mass Effect 2's DLC is worth it and all the Mass Effect fans are joining in.
4975078	4979902	Infinel says, you don't really need the Weapon Armor DLC and Shane says, yeah, forget it, just get the story stuff.
4980382	4989028	I'm like, alright, yeah, yeah, you guys made your point but, you know, and Mass Effect 2 is kind of one game out of a lot that I would be willing to do that for.
4989388	4992830	I mean, again, I actually, it held my attention long enough to beat it.
4992870	4993931	That says a lot right there.
4994551	4994712	So,
4996232	4996552	Alright.
4996872	5000333	When you get around to it, I may have DLC codes for you for Mass Effect 3.
5001054	5001634	Nice!
5002554	5003874	For some of the pre-order stuff.
5003974	5006095	I think I still have some left over.
5006115	5007175	Send those my way!
5007415	5009036	Save one for when I borrow Rob's.
5010056	5014057	I love that Jamie is already resigned to the fact that she's going to have to play the whole damn series.
5014097	5020299	Oh, and hey, if anybody needs any of the Genki codes for Saints Row the Third, I think I have like 200 of them still, so...
5021479	5022599	Yeah, I'd like one of those too.
5022619	5024480	Send me a direct message on Twitter.
5024580	5032502	By the way, Mass Effect fans in chat, especially Shane, do I get like a big old high five or a big old cookie for paying it forward to Jamie?
5032962	5035983	Where now she's taking my copy and she's going to get sucked into this?
5036764	5040144	Of course, she might come on the show next week and go, I hated it.
5040985	5041845	You guys are stupid.
5042025	5042465	You know what?
5042705	5048967	I think right there, that's a perfect example of how they should be treating games instead of saying, oh, well, we want each person to play an online pass.
5049147	5049807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5071044	5072485	Hitstone wants to know if any of those codes are for PC.
5087600	5087740	No.
5088881	5089161	Sorry.
5089282	5090823	PS3 and 360 only.
5090843	5092464	Sorry.
5093585	5093846	All right.
5094746	5095607	One more story for you guys.
5095647	5098350	Look, it's a slow news week, so I'm going to let this story through.
5098890	5102493	In a more busy news week, it would have been cut, but we needed something.
5102573	5111962	So I'm going to go ahead and address these rumors about Grand Theft Auto V, supposedly from an ex-Rockstar employee on the GameSpot forums.
5112162	5112402	So...
5113666	5115107	Big Fat Grain Assault.
5115187	5121471	And I'm doing this instead of Loki so that Loki can sit here and go, it's bullshit or, oh, it sounds like it's legit.
5122952	5127915	Number one, there will be one protagonist character, one character alone.
5128215	5129836	Albert Da Silva is the name.
5130396	5134519	Half Hispanic man who was once a part of a crime city, crime family in Vice City.
5135239	5135819	True or false?
5135839	5136820	I don't know.
5138285	5139646	You're not very fun to play with.
5139966	5143687	Multiplayer will hold 32 people on the Xbox and PlayStation 3.
5145008	5146128	Unknown about PC.
5146508	5149389	Just like Red Dead Redemption, you'll be able to form gangs.
5149449	5152211	They're not ranked through XP, but through reputation.
5153671	5158053	Well, we know that to be true already, but I think a lot of it is just speculation.
5158213	5159734	I think all this is speculation.
5159774	5160614	They don't know.
5162556	5166778	I think a lot of this seems like educated speculation to me when I read it too.
5166798	5169719	I don't know if it's educated speculation.
5170860	5178223	Number three, the map is about five times as large as the Grand Theft Auto 4 map and the city of Los Santos takes up just under half of this area.
5178303	5180764	So it's bigger than two Grand Theft Auto 4 Liberty Cities.
5181125	5181925	Again, safe bet.
5185334	5210988	I don't know if they can do it like that I mean it could be bigger because I think the Red Dead Redemption map was pretty big but I mean it's a lot of it's just fitting in textures and fitting in the maps themselves I mean the object placement formats and stuff like that it's pretty small but it's when you get all the different textures in the game so I don't know if it's gonna be five times as large I mean it's gonna be pretty big but I don't know I just assume it's gonna be larger
5211823	5214105	Cars and guns are customizable to an extent.
5214166	5218530	For an example, you can customize a gun to have a suppressor on it, and you can install nitrous into cars.
5219051	5223475	I thought you could already do that in Grand Theft Auto.
5223756	5225457	They used to have that in San Andreas.
5225898	5229201	Not necessarily the suppressors, but that would be a nice feature.
5229382	5232625	I don't know if that's going to be legit or not.
5232867	5237634	Alright, let me get to some of the other good stuff, because this is getting boring already.
5238135	5241540	Radio stations now do traffic reports that are actually correct.
5241700	5245365	So if you don't know what route to take, you can check the traffic reports on your phone or on the Radio 7.
5246086	5247869	The in-game TV has more channels.
5248049	5249231	Again, that seems like a safe bet.
5249651	5255116	But once again, though, those in-game TV channels are fucking huge as far as the files go.
5255156	5261642	They're BIC-encoded videos that take up hundreds of megs.
5261702	5275754	I mean, if they're going to fit that shit on a disc, they're going to have to do some sort of compression or something, because as of right now, on four episodes from Liberty City, they're not compressed at all, besides what the actual encoder does.
5275814	5275974	But
5277195	5291882	The protagonist can take drugs, which will have some effects, but smoking weed on the streetwalk will lead to getting a one-star wanted level.
5293709	5295611	That's like Saints Row 1 shit.
5295732	5298535	I don't even know if I'd go with that.
5298595	5300778	I'm bored of this story already, so here's the biggest one.
5301198	5302500	The game is due in May 2013.
5303661	5308447	A more specific date has not been decided because the game is still needing six months to be fully developed.
5308827	5310449	They will have a playable demo at E3.
5311943	5318048	That's, again, speculation because we already know what their... We already know what the next quarter game is going to be, Max Payne 3.
5318088	5327577	We already know what the fourth quarter game is going to be, which is going to be... Well, it's not necessarily the Rockstar, but Take-Two, which is going to be NBA 2K, NHL 2K if they actually put one out this year.
5327737	5333022	And, of course, the big, big, big one is Bioshock Infinite.
5333642	5335383	So, of course, that stuff's going to be coming out.
5335443	5340185	And so you've got to figure, you know, it's going to be first or second quarter.
5340245	5345208	And, you know, estimating they've got some other 2K stuff.
5345288	5350931	Oh, shit, I completely forgot if, like, you know, XCOM's still in there somewhere.
5353092	5356454	And then I want to say, like, the summer games probably.
5358134	5361336	Spec Ops, they've still got in there somewhere in June, I believe.
5363177	5363497	I don't know.
5363577	5366118	A lot of it just sounds like speculation.
5367138	5377962	Unfortunately, because I do follow a lot of Grand Theft Auto communities and stuff, there is one person each week saying, I heard something from a random rock star employee.
5378262	5383164	And they're going to make these educated guesses so that if they're close, then yeah, people will say, hey, I said it first.
5383244	5385464	And if they're wrong, then no one will remember.
5385524	5387305	People have a need to be first sometimes.
5387505	5387705	Exactly.
5388986	5400493	I love some of the comments in our chatroom at chat.orangesentree.com Porkchop, what a delicious handle in the chatroom, says why would anyone waste time watching TV and Grand Theft Auto when you can go out and stomp hookers?
5400713	5403915	We actually did watch a lot of the TV when Dan was playing it.
5404435	5404916	It was funny.
5405390	5406030	You're boring.
5406050	5407211	You should be killing more hookers.
5410433	5415637	SSJ100Matt says, What Grand Theft Auto V really needs is the SimCity Action News Reporter.
5415797	5416397	Just saying.
5417238	5419119	God, I love your topical sense of humor.
5419179	5423542	I really do, because it gives me an excuse to play a clip from SimCity Action News.
5425243	5428546	And in other news today, SimCity had its Founders Day Parade.
5429566	5429766	Wait.
5430767	5431407	This just in.
5433349	5433649	Hold on.
5440472	5448818	folks, but I am told that Funzilla is cutting a path of destruction through SimCity, devastating the transportation system.
5450399	5466131	Apparently this 20-story lizard is picking up cars and buses and throwing them hundreds of yards as he moves closer to the SimCity Action Studios, which means that this is Carol Davenport signing off and getting the hell out of here.
5469079	5469700	Give her an Emmy.
5469880	5471062	Give her a goddamn Emmy.
5472264	5473466	Lifetime Achievement Award.
5476290	5477912	At least give her a series on Bravo.
5478553	5482960	Jurassic Park had just come out that same year, so that's funny.
5487762	5492187	DarkSakura is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey!
5510362	5520471	You kids need to stop playing your Grand Theft Auto V's and your SimCity Action News's and you need to check out this awesomely classic game.
5520511	5521492	What is the classic game of the week?
5521612	5524314	Today's classic game is Star Fox.
5525135	5525855	Yay.
5525975	5527036	Fucking great choice.
5527657	5533962	Which came out as Starwing in Europe and Australia because there was a trademarked game that came out like in 1983. 1983.
5537717	5537937	StarFox
5560044	5565849	Star Fox is a rail shooter that used 3D polygon graphics.
5565889	5569232	It's the first Nintendo game to use full-on polygons.
5570013	5574497	And it was powered by the Super FX chip, which was basically a coprocessor so that it could handle it.
5575758	5588785	So, the characters were all designed by Takaya Imamura, based off of Kemono characters, basically, from old, I believe, 16th century Japanese art.
5588805	5589526	This is pretty cool.
5590106	5592347	You know, basically, anthropomorphic characters.
5593048	5593288	What?
5594321	5597242	Somebody in chat asked if they could do a barrel roll so I slapped them with a fish.
5597743	5598283	Okay, cool.
5599984	5602084	At any rate, this music is so epic.
5602365	5603565	I love the first level music.
5603665	5605666	The soundtrack was so fucking good.
5605686	5606326	Turn this up a little bit.
5606726	5606927	Sure.
5607207	5609228	This is like seriously my favorite music in the game.
5610788	5611829	What, the planet music?
5611849	5613369	The very first level.
5614010	5615350	Oh yeah, the music here.
5615370	5616171	The canary level.
5616311	5618592	The whole takeoff sequence and all that is awesome.
5618632	5620152	Let's listen here for a minute here.
5620713	5621293	Here's Mark.
5623206	5624487	Thanks.
5624688	5625368	Emergency.
5625509	5627030	This bridge has so much memories.
5627050	5631475	Seriously, the most epic music ever right here.
5652910	5653711	Shut up, Falco.
5655192	5655913	Shut up, Slippy.
5659295	5663098	I swear, I spent the whole game going, I freaking hate Slippy, die!
5663739	5664660	And shut up, Falco.
5664680	5666061	That was me the entire time I was playing this game.
5666581	5672666	Seriously, this music just evokes the... America!
5673046	5673787	Fuck yeah!
5674568	5675609	For a Japanese game, sure.
5678075	5682899	Anyway, it involves Fox McCloud, who is the leader of the Star Fox team.
5683679	5692346	And they have these ships called Arwings, which are really floating polygon-y things, and they're pretty cool.
5692986	5697450	And you've got thrusters and retro rockets that let you speed up or slow down.
5698331	5702954	And you've got bombs and pew-pew laser things.
5703234	5704175	You hear the pew-pew noises?
5704515	5705556	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!
5709924	5715607	You've got a little bit different thing in the damage on here.
5715647	5721409	You've actually got an energy shield that controls how much damage you can absorb before the craft destroys.
5721929	5726732	So you can bump into stuff and you take some damage, you don't just immediately explode.
5727572	5738137	Sometimes if your wings clip against certain obstacles, they'll break off and it will affect the handling of your Arwing, which was pretty innovative, I thought, for a game of its time.
5739432	5743934	The other thing that was interesting about this is that it didn't have a difficulty selection.
5744554	5749776	After you finished the first stage, you actually would pick a path that you could go on.
5750856	5756558	And so you could pick the easy option, the normal option, or the hard option, depending on which path you took.
5757098	5761560	So you could mix and match your game any way, and it had multiple patterns.
5762080	5764622	Outrun Outrun Outrun Outrun
5786961	5789564	So you also have your wingmen.
5789584	5796890	You have Peppy Hair, Slippy Toad, sucker, and Falco Lombardi, who I hated Falco so much.
5798071	5807460	And it was kind of cool because if you accidentally shot one of your guys, you wouldn't hurt him, but they would say, Hey, what are you doing shooting at me?
5808061	5809222	I'm Falco and I suck.
5810083	5811565	Hey, I suck at these things off my toes.
5811585	5817952	Yeah, you actually have to save your wingmen from being attacked by other enemies too, which was almost always slippy.
5820474	5823598	So yeah, so you have to help them so that they'll always be there with you.
5823758	5826401	And you even have, you know, your little flying formation thing, which is pretty cool.
5828035	5829396	So, anyway.
5832399	5834481	There were a few really neat things with this, too.
5834541	5838304	Like I said, it was using the Super FX chip.
5838404	5846732	It actually was based off on... There was a prototype on the NES that was called NES Glider that was inspired by a game called Star Glider.
5847152	5849094	And then they brought the prototype to this NES.
5849594	5850555	And once they...
5851636	5858484	They actually hired a company to create the Super FX chip so that they could have the 3D graphics in there.
5859586	5866334	It was actually a lot harder, a lot more powerful than the SNES processor.
5866354	5870699	There was a joke going around that the SNES was basically just a box to hold the chip.
5872304	5874386	Ima Mura Hajime Hirasawa
5894440	5902636	It was also stated by Miyamoto that he wanted to use animal characters since he didn't want to do conventional sci-fi with robots, monsters, and superheroes.
5903818	5905622	And so that's how it came about.
5910151	5914894	So, moving a little bit forward, there's secret levels in the game.
5915675	5917196	Did you ever do any of the secret levels, Rob?
5917336	5917576	I did.
5917616	5924000	Wasn't there the thing where you had to shoot the little planet, and the little planet that would pop out for like a half second, you had to do something, and you had to shoot it in the eye?
5924460	5925261	There were, okay.
5926181	5929383	If I remember this correctly, because keep in mind, it's been a while since I've done it.
5929544	5935648	To get to the black hole level, you have to shoot these rings.
5935948	5937329	There's a little central part.
5937549	5938730	Is this the slot machine level?
5938850	5939591	That's the slot machine.
5939631	5940911	I think that's the slot machine.
5942533	5942773	Yeah.
5943153	5946275	Is that going from the easy one to the... This video is somebody actually doing it.
5946656	5948617	So we'll... No, that's the first one.
5950418	5951539	The slot machine's later on.
5952520	5954101	Let me fast forward the video a little bit then.
5954141	5954961	Where's the slot machine?
5955021	5955462	Whoa.
5956417	5957077	Oh no, that's the one.
5957418	5958678	That's the slot machine one.
5960279	5964821	Yeah, I think somebody axes it here because here's the... Yeah, that's the slot machine.
5964941	5983891	Okay, anyway, let me... There was one where you have to shoot these certain rings a certain way and then fly through the center of the explosion and then this ugly-ass planet pops up that looks like... You know, it kind of looks like the moon from Majora's Mask.
5984411	5985632	It looks like a troll face to me.
5986575	6006068	to me it looks like the moon from Majora's Mask and you have to shoot it or fly into it or something and so you get to go to the first black hole and the black hole basically whatever different ring pops up in the black hole if you fly through it it warps you to that level shut up Slippy anyway
6007109	6007830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6024781	6025302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6043502	6045163	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6068584	6070086	and all this crazy Mood 7.
6070426	6073449	And FX.
6073930	6074270	Exactly.
6074450	6076613	Wasn't there only one other game that had the FX chip in it?
6077073	6078234	That would be Stunt Race FX.
6078555	6080657	I think there was one more.
6080897	6082058	There was a robot game.
6082779	6083420	Oh yeah, there was.
6083440	6083720	You're right.
6083780	6086183	And keep in mind, there's the Star Fox 2 prototype.
6088166	6089267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6110042	6112303	We had a number of Star Fox games come out since then.
6112383	6114844	Star Fox 2 was in the works for Super Nintendo.
6116724	6120545	Although the head programmer said that they actually finished the game.
6122346	6124967	There was Star Fox 64.
6126107	6131889	There's actually ROM dumps of Star Fox 2 that were from different stages of development.
6132449	6136170	And someone actually translated it and made a patch for it.
6137570	6165659	there is Star Fox on the GameCube that was Star Fox Adventures by Rare we had Star Fox Assault for the GameCube that was done by Namco and it was a third person shooter there was Star Fox Command that was on the DS and now there's Star Fox makes appearances in a micro game in Wario where Smooth moves and you fight basically the Nintendo robot who has a huge mungus zapper and that's it
6167034	6167334	All right.
6167894	6168695	A true classic.
6169395	6170155	Star Fox.
6170476	6172857	Again, one of those games I had to go, really?
6173097	6174457	She's never done Star Fox before?
6174697	6174998	I know.
6175118	6175958	I had to go, really?
6175978	6177158	I've never done Star Fox before?
6178339	6179059	So, yeah.
6179099	6181040	So, yeah, 200 episodes into this or whatever.
6181160	6181761	Also funny.
6182881	6185682	The Star Wing logo uses a completely different font than Star Fox.
6185962	6186323	Just saying.
6186663	6186803	Hmm.
6187623	6191086	Now, some folks in chat were like, boy, Nintendo really ruined this franchise.
6191126	6194269	You know, some of the Star Fox Adventures, of course, was not very well received.
6194349	6197811	And, you know, I think people liked Star Fox 64 enough.
6198472	6200313	And a lot of Star Fox 2 kind of went into that.
6200353	6203436	But, yeah, Star Fox Adventures wasn't really pretty.
6204096	6204737	So that's too bad.
6205658	6208180	Anyhow, we are going to take a quick break.
6208220	6208760	But don't go anywhere.
6208780	6210342	We got more Orange Lodge Radio to come.
6210602	6212984	Things that might actually be better than Star Fox.
6213649	6215897	Alright, maybe not, but they're still pretty good, so stick around.
6215917	6218627	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6224847	6227369	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6227449	6232693	We are live with episode number 451 for this March the 25th of 2012.
6234595	6240520	I know we can't play these live break songs that we do on the podcast, but we were playing some music from DDR days.
6240980	6246505	And by coincidence, I happened to pick songs that were both from Dance Dance Revolution third mix, Korean songs.
6247245	6249626	Um, and man, I miss those games.
6249746	6251646	I miss DDR back when it was so good.
6252086	6258408	And like that, that community and everything we had in the songs were like legit, like, like not everybody ever understood the songs.
6258448	6262109	I'm sure some of you listening to the show now probably go, really, you guys kind of like that music.
6262169	6264650	But like, there is just something about DDR music.
6264690	6265450	I can't explain it.
6265590	6266550	I can't put my finger on it.
6266590	6267731	But man, I miss those days.
6268631	6268811	But
6270616	6276618	It was actually asked by Technus, who has played a third mix machine that was not a Korean version?
6277239	6277419	Me.
6278379	6280059	They had one here locally somewhere, didn't they?
6280420	6288322	Well, the one that I played, I think it was AX2000, was a Japanese third mix from Arcade Infinity.
6288662	6289863	Ah, nice.
6291264	6297357	I did hear, I think, that they're trying to restart Arcade Infinity in another location or like something like it.
6297578	6298700	So that's cool.
6298720	6299382	I hope it happens.
6300204	6300564	We'll see.
6301429	6304972	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news.
6305433	6306694	Some quick stories for you guys.
6306734	6306994	Loki.
6307534	6319464	So, we heard about LittleBigPlanet carding, which was leaked out of the PlayStation event.
6319685	6320405	PlayStation event.
6320425	6321006	PlayStation event.
6321026	6321927	What the hell was it called?
6321947	6321987	Uh...
6325530	6325910	I can't remember.
6328712	6330834	Low-key PlayStation event.
6330914	6334137	Basically, it's going to be coming out on the Vita and PlayStation 3.
6335238	6344347	Not surprisingly enough, though, it's actually being done by United Front Games, who are the developers behind Mod Nation Racers.
6345027	6350993	So they kind of have a little bit of experience in play, share, create racing games.
6351833	6360421	Although, at the same time, that makes me a little worried because... Well, maybe they'll take some of the feedback from the last one and make it better.
6361162	6361462	You know?
6361903	6362243	Maybe?
6363414	6363975	Hopefully.
6364755	6366617	I mean, the trailer looks neat.
6366757	6368218	They have a trailer out for it now.
6368879	6370140	So it has potential.
6370560	6380128	I'm just really sad that Media Molecule is not having a lot of feedback on it.
6380268	6381429	At least I hope that they do.
6381729	6382069	I don't know.
6382329	6383210	It didn't really say.
6383490	6384631	Okay.
6387913	6389553	Destination PlayStation, that's what it was.
6390013	6391094	Destination PlayStation.
6392994	6397135	So yeah, they're going to be doing an Adventure Time game for Nintendo DS.
6397816	6408559	And it's being done by WayForward, who have... I guess they were behind some new... I'm trying to remember games they put out.
6409159	6412400	The Henry Hatsworth game, they had that come out.
6414181	6433998	so that was not a bad game and I haven't really said too much about what the game is although the creator of the show actually posted some really funny like animated gifs so neat I'm sure the game will be pretty awesome which is pretty cool it's a great cartoon
6435086	6442331	And last but not least, they announced that Max Payne 3 is going to have a new feature for the multiplayer.
6442731	6444652	They're going to have what they're calling crews.
6445293	6455580	And now what the Max Payne 3 crews are, are kind of like these multiplayer clans that you have that you can play through the game and kind of...
6456480	6458322	Thanks for watching!
6476676	6477997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6494206	6506389	Last week or so, actually, this is kind of one thing that we didn't talk about, but on the hacking scene for Grand Theft Auto 4, they released online scripts for Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer.
6506829	6513990	So you're going to see a lot more hacking shenanigans on Grand Theft Auto 4 if you're playing that online, which is kind of sad.
6514270	6517351	Because I legitimately had a really high rank on that game.
6518311	6523693	But unfortunately, you know, now anyone can game it to get the top of the leaderboard.
6523753	6526454	So it's kind of over and done for now.
6527434	6532356	But five, man, I am looking forward to playing five multiplayer for sure from day one.
6532656	6536317	But Max Beam 3, not much interest in that game.
6536337	6538438	Because it's not Grand Theft Auto.
6540353	6540693	All right.
6541014	6547158	Well, moving on to some other games, kind of in the same category as Grand Theft Auto, another Rockstar game.
6548079	6548299	L.A.
6548399	6551542	Noire is getting a touch-controlled version.
6552923	6560248	OnLive, of course, put out some various tablet apps, and Rockstar is doing a touch version of L.A.
6560308	6566013	Noire, making this kind of more of a touchscreen-friendly game or an iOS or whatever phone it is game.
6567453	6570735	OnLive says those controls are now available so you can play L.A.
6570795	6583581	Noire with OnLive Mobile and yeah you can swipe across the screen to do some motions I guess you don't need to use virtual buttons or a wireless controller or any of that you do need to buy L.A.
6583641	6595366	Noire if you want to play it and have an OnLive account and all that but it is interesting that they actually kind of adapted it however there are free trials for all the games and the OnLive client is free so you can check it out for free
6595754	6596515	Okay, that's good to know.
6597016	6598820	So if you want to see if this is up your alley.
6598860	6599501	I don't know if L.A.
6599541	6602226	Noire would work in touch motion for me, but okay.
6603478	6604419	The problem is it's L.A.
6604439	6604899	Noire.
6605019	6608180	The interrogation parts will be fine, but it's the rest of it.
6608340	6610341	I got bored with that game really fast.
6611281	6611982	All right, moving on.
6612222	6613262	Final Fantasy XIII 2.
6614463	6620105	What's funny is that I didn't finish XIII 2, and part of the reason I wasn't able to do it is because I got sucked into Mass Effect.
6620565	6623826	Well, worlds can now collide on March 27th.
6623986	6628208	They've announced that there will be Mass Effect 3 DLC for Final Fantasy XIII 2.
6628268	6628348	What? !
6630569	6631469	Yes, it's true.
6632070	6633410	It's not as big as you think, though.
6633490	6643615	It's just that now Sarah and Noel, who are of course the big two characters in the game, are going to get N7 armor that they can dress up in to make them look like Mass Effect characters.
6643975	6648477	And although there's a part of me that goes, that's stupid, there's another part of me that goes, but that's really awesome.
6649659	6653701	By the way, Mass Effect is not the only kind of game hopping that's going on.
6654061	6656642	Assassin's Creed Revelations outfits are supposed to be on their way.
6657202	6658943	And that's, I believe, only in Japan right now.
6659563	6659764	Right.
6659844	6662285	I don't think a date has been announced for the US.
6662365	6663605	It'll eventually happen, though.
6663765	6664766	Yeah.
6665186	6666306	What else is interesting?
6666367	6668708	I think this is really interesting.
6669488	6675811	Final Fantasy XIII's who got some other DLCers getting some that throws the game back to Final Fantasy VI, right?
6676431	6676771	Typhon Typhoon
6693710	6721491	but is the other I always see 1-0 so whatever but is the other character that will be available as well this is more of one of those arena fights and if you beat them in the arena then you can use them as your monsters because you know your third person can always be a monster so I thought it was kind of funny that they kind of went back to the past with that so that's pretty cool so there you go no announcement when that is out in the US March 27th in Japan however so probably soon thereafter
6723593	6724554	Thank you for watching!
6745629	6748090	They did post Capcom on their Street Fighter blog.
6748530	6750470	Luckily it sounds like something that's easily treatable.
6765214	6770236	Luckily, it also sounds like he didn't suffer from exhaustion the same way that that one guy did that's all over TV.
6770456	6772076	I was just going to make that joke.
6774417	6779139	But yeah, it's not something to really joke about in this guy's case, so too bad.
6779859	6780539	Hope he feels better.
6780939	6782080	Yeah, that's sad.
6782100	6784621	However you might feel about the game aside, he's better.
6784961	6788622	Well, both did suffer exhaustion while handling their fight sticks.
6789383	6789703	Stop it.
6789723	6798131	So, for a game coming out in Japan called, well actually I think it's coming out here too, it's by Platinum Games, Anarchy Reigns.
6798812	6802536	Famitsu put out images that Bayonetta is going to be in the game.
6804137	6806620	No other news about it, just, hi Bayonetta.
6806900	6810641	Sonic 1, 2, Sonic & Knuckles is gone, as well as the Master System version of Sonic 1.
6826963	6842184	which is too bad because you know it's impossible to get Sonic 1 on any other platform well there's no I mean the master system I know what you mean but you know what I mean but yeah but there's no word about it in the US or Europe yet but I'm sure it's gonna follow
6842865	6848487	and then fans of ThinkGeek who have, I'm sure, seen more and more and more Portal stuff pop up there.
6849028	6855090	I sure have, including an inflatable sentry and a little talking sentry plushie that I totally want.
6856130	6858931	The Portal gun is for sale for $140.
6859652	6862893	5,000 replicas have been made and somebody better buy me one for my birthday.
6863033	6863573	That's all I'm saying.
6865934	6867475	No secret what you want, huh?
6868295	6869475	Just saying.
6869555	6870255	Birthday's next month.
6871236	6873616	Let's go to the Fugle question of the week.
6873656	6875096	We missed it last week, but it's back tonight.
6875116	6880157	The Fugle question of the week.
6880237	6887339	Facebook and Google Plus get a question every week, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program for you guys.
6887519	6891559	And if those in studio want to answer, I don't know if they did the question in advance.
6891599	6892360	It's kind of a toughie.
6892400	6894160	This is one that takes a little bit of thought tonight.
6895860	6898522	So we'll start at Google+, but Orange Launch Radio.
6898982	6899862	Google Question of the Week.
6899903	6908487	If you could go back and change a classic game's ending, since, you know, it's all the rage right now talking about changing the ending of games, what ending would you change and what would the new ending be?
6909227	6912669	And I said, let's stick to classics because we don't want to spoil any new games.
6912709	6914370	So I did force people to think classics.
6914750	6919533	It's interesting though, we got a lot of varied responses that kind of took the question in a different direction.
6920054	6923296	And Derek H. starts us off on Google in that direction.
6938926	6947515	Imagine some kid complaining after the planet exploded in Stargate or when Pauline kept getting kidnapped by Donkey Kong or that the ambulance always passed you in Turbo.
6947815	6955522	That would never happen because in those days gamers weren't spoiled little punks who need closure after having pretend sex with an alien.
6958045	6963030	So some pretty strong words there about back in my day, back in the old day.
6963820	6991060	that's true though, a lot of Atari 2600 games never ended, very few had an ending you know the ending, the only game I can think of, a couple of them that actually had endings oops, no, no holic during the foogle question, thank you um Pitfall and Pitfall 2 and at the end of Pitfall it just stops it freezes, I don't think there's anything to it and the ending of Pitfall 2 he jumps up and down, a lot and you won
6993717	6997078	It's because games back then were trying to recreate the arcade experience.
6997118	7000919	Games today are about touching you emotionally.
7003760	7006221	Alright, going to Facebook, reading some of the answers there.
7007261	7008742	Blue2 says, That's a tough one.
7008802	7010222	I can't think of any ending I would change.
7010262	7014724	However, like thousands of gamers out there, finish Half-Life already, Gabe.
7015544	7018385	So he kind of ignored the question of the week and just said finish Half-Life.
7018605	7021606	But actually, Alan was telling me about how Half-Life...
7022626	7033692	Half-Life 2 Episode 1 did kind of go back and patch a few things up from what was originally out there for Half-Life, so they've kind of tinkered with those endings before.
7036644	7043169	Let's see, Jim H answers on Facebook saying, Since I just beat it again yesterday, I would change the ending of Super Mario Bros.
7043669	7046812	2 so it isn't a dream at the end.
7047772	7057980	I know it was a different game they just plugged in Mario characters into, but since they did end up using enemies from the game in later sequels, it would be nice if it fit into the continuity better.
7058460	7060762	Oh yeah, the original, it was all a dream ending.
7060982	7061983	Mario 2, right?
7062964	7063184	Yeah.
7063204	7063284	Yeah.
7064372	7064853	I said noholic.
7065053	7065273	Thank you.
7079432	7081873	I'd change the ending of the original Super Mario Bros.
7082013	7100099	I'd make it so that when Mario saves Peach from Bowser, she tells her that he, I think he tells her that he is enrolling her in some Taekwondo lessons with Chun-Li, so that when Bowser tries to kidnap her, at least she'd be able to put up a fight, and she wouldn't get kidnapped so damn frequently, and Nintendo wouldn't have to whore the Mario series out so much.
7100639	7103960	Remember, she doesn't fight with Kung Fu, she fights with emotions.
7104720	7106721	That's right, Super Princess Peach, that's what we learned.
7108292	7111873	Lastly, Robert C. on Facebook says, I'd change the ending to Mortal Kombat.
7112193	7115413	The mandatory final fight would be between Katana and Sonya.
7115853	7121534	They'd suddenly both swap fighting styles to Brazilian Jutsu in a big pool of mud or jelly.
7121954	7127115	The final scene would obviously be a slow motion montage of them moving from fighting to kissing.
7127515	7128996	Cue the 70s porn music.
7130916	7131636	Oh, you.
7134256	7135437	I see what you did there.
7136497	7137137	It'd be kind of hot.
7138792	7141014	Any classic games you guys here in studio would want to change?
7142114	7144516	I know you haven't had a lot of time to think about the answer.
7144996	7148899	I would say let's go back to Ghosts and Goblins and give them proper grammar.
7149319	7150020	How's that sound?
7151300	7152261	That was part of the fun.
7153362	7154082	I guess that's true.
7158845	7160687	I can't really think of anything because you know what?
7160867	7164169	I'm not a little bitch with a sense of entitlement.
7168038	7169219	We're just having fun.
7170320	7173562	I will tell you which game needs another different ending.
7174083	7175143	The Legend of Zelda.
7175784	7176965	It needs a third quest.
7178826	7183210	Actually, I would give a better ending to Zelda A Link to the Past after how fucking hard that game is.
7183270	7183590	God.
7183810	7184991	Kind of get a shitty ending.
7185271	7186552	That game was epic.
7187012	7187993	I mean, yeah, don't get me wrong.
7188033	7191095	It's a fucking tremendous game, but kind of a crap ending.
7191176	7191396	So...
7193177	7195078	They really... You know what would be awesome?
7195098	7196698	Totally on a tangent here.
7196858	7197058	What?
7197298	7202240	Is they should totally go with the LittleBigPlanet style to like the Legend of Zelda games.
7202500	7206141	You know how they have a ton of ROM hacks and stuff like that with custom levels for the Legend of Zelda?
7206561	7211582	Why not have like a Legend of Zelda game that was like Link to the Past but with a ton of fucking custom games in there?
7211822	7212282	Oh, I know.
7212322	7218384	Because no one would ever play your new Zelda games because they'd be too busy enthralled with the custom made stuff.
7219024	7221205	You want the Legend of LittleBigPlanet?
7222647	7228331	I want The Legend of Zelda with a really kick-ass editor that's officially sanctioned.
7228651	7234935	I'm trying to think of just the endings of different games, and really I keep thinking back to how epic many of them were.
7234955	7239078	You know, like Hitler's head blowing up at the end of Bionic Commando?
7240579	7249205	Or how you felt bad for the baby Metroid when it got killed and...
7251095	7252776	It's all kinds of sad-facedness.
7253916	7257377	I would go back and make sure that every Silent Hill game had a dog ending.
7257837	7258117	Yes.
7259598	7264539	Actually, I would change the ending to Shattered Memories because I wanted to like that game a whole lot.
7266980	7272442	In fact, I think that the next Silent Hill game should be directed by Peter Molyneux and you should play as the dog.
7274864	7276285	I love the idea of a game called Silent Dog
7293457	7294878	This might be a dream game.
7294918	7295779	Hold on, hold up.
7295839	7296640	Alright, dream game.
7296660	7297380	Silent Dog.
7297660	7302264	The dog must confront the demons of its past.
7302364	7304986	All the legs they've peed on.
7305226	7306467	Chasing its tail.
7307388	7311551	Being chased by a faceless postman with claw hands.
7312272	7314093	Tires that they can just never catch.
7315494	7318057	Frisbees of doom with razor blades on them.
7318137	7322360	And mandatory, Akira Yamaoka is forced to do all the music.
7324616	7326297	because it's just not a Silent Hill game.
7326337	7328597	Really, it should just be the dog song throughout the whole game.
7332259	7334040	You know, we need to play that, Rob.
7334160	7337041	I don't think I have the dog ending music readily accessible.
7337781	7338281	Yes, you do.
7338581	7339402	You have YouTube.
7339542	7340062	Yes, you do.
7341762	7347565	You know, I would love to see like the saga of the UFO ending, Silent Hill the UFO.
7349105	7349925	That would just be great.
7352366	7352626	Hold on.
7352666	7353647	I'm finding it for you guys.
7353767	7354007	I'm just...
7354733	7355955	It was you the whole time?
7356195	7359118	Praying there's no, uh... There it is.
7359198	7361361	It would be awesome.
7383655	7392620	but we can't forget about the most important part of Silent Dog which I think is at the very end of the song I like that he growls at that one horrible guy
7407091	7407791	This is so great.
7407831	7411013	This is the canon ending to Silent Hill 2, right?
7411053	7411253	Yes.
7411273	7412453	Yes, absolutely.
7412633	7419175	Was it Silent Hill 3 that had like the... Here's the most important scene of the entire game.
7419195	7419515	Hold on.
7439231	7441713	Oh, does it do the chorus one more time?
7442093	7442374	Yes.
7442394	7442874	Oh, God.
7443514	7448698	I was wondering, I wonder if the voice actor has been changed for the dog in the HD collection.
7448718	7449399	Okay, here it is.
7449499	7449699	Ah.
7449819	7449959	Ah.
7459375	7467758	That's right, the all-important sex scene where the adults are having sex and the dog is just forced to watch with that blank expression on their face.
7467798	7469059	Like, what are my owners doing?
7469399	7474360	You know, actually, one of my LiveJournal icons is the dog and it says, Game Over.
7476779	7480741	As much as I love the dog ending, I still like the Silent Hill theme.
7482001	7484182	Silent Hill, Silent Hill.
7484222	7485263	From one of the UFO endings.
7486323	7489524	Anyhow, I don't know how we got on this topic, but Silent Dog, make it happen.
7490925	7493386	So we were going to get into news at some point, right?
7493886	7494146	News?
7494206	7497548	Yeah, we were talking about Silent Dog, so that is very important.
7498908	7499508	Oh, our dream game.
7502570	7502850	So...
7504588	7512053	Someone needs to explain to me once again why we have these online passes, because I swear, it's just like, I never hear anything going smoothly with them.
7512153	7514555	I mean, I don't understand, but whatever.
7515036	7524142	So, Ninja Gaiden 3 came out this week, and yeah, apparently no one could redeem the online passes for that game.
7524562	7532308	Not even the reviewers could redeem the online passes, because they had forgot to flip the switch to allow those passes to be redeemed.
7532868	7550352	haha um so yes none of the codes worked at all at launch I think they work now they may be working soon but as of you know earlier this week they were not working at all so fun um
7556116	7561878	MLB 12 The Show, another game with an online pass, also had its issues.
7561938	7566560	Apparently, the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions had a problem.
7566620	7573703	If the Vita players tried to redeem the online pass, they couldn't do it via the Vita.
7574083	7576544	They could only do it if they had a PlayStation 3.
7577325	7578145	But here's the funny thing.
7578165	7583327	If they did it via the PS3, it unlocked online play for the PS3 version that they don't own.
7587696	7591537	So yeah, apparently they were working out problems with that.
7594097	7595438	But I don't know.
7596338	7597158	It's interesting, I guess.
7597638	7600799	And then last but not least, there is one more game that had an online pass.
7601799	7604380	EA Sports MMA.
7606140	7608641	It had an online pass and it had online play.
7608661	7610101	It wasn't a very popular game.
7610861	7613922	And on April 13th, they will be shutting down the server for it.
7617556	7619197	It was on the failure board, sorry.
7620738	7621658	It seemed appropriate.
7621818	7624800	Other games that are going to be getting their servers shut down as well.
7625700	7630523	EA Create Game, which was supposed to take on LittleBigPlanet, and that sucked.
7631263	7634966	And EA Sports Active 2, which I didn't even know they had online.
7635566	7642630	And the Xbox Live Arcade game Spare Parts is also going to be getting its servers shut down.
7643350	7647132	On top of that, Boom Blox for the Wii, Burnout Revenge for Xbox 360.
7648352	7649513	Damn it, I own Boom Blox.
7649853	7658437	EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp for the Wii, FIFA 10 for the PSP and the Wii, Godfather 2 for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
7659837	7671683	Need for Speed Pro Street on PS3 and 360, and the Saboteur for PS3 and 360 is going to lose access to the Midnight Club, which is some exclusive club, but that was in the game if you pre-ordered.
7673023	7680247	And then on the 31st, they're shutting down Battlefield 3 Aftershock for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.
7683412	7685215	and a few other iPad games.
7685335	7691768	But you know, that $10 that funds that online pass, it costs a lot to shut a server down.
7693584	7694004	Grand Theft Auto
7717145	7719847	They just re-released for free.
7719867	7720488	APB?
7720508	7721328	APB, yeah.
7721368	7722349	At least it wasn't that quick.
7726372	7731156	Dartetsuya in our chatroom says, I called that section the online pass blooper reel.
7731656	7734979	I have to admit, when I was reading all this news, all I could hear in my head was...
7743445	7748786	I mean, those poor bastards that are buying some of those games used, and now they're just going to be offline.
7748826	7757268	I mean, shutting down the servers is nothing new, but now we have a game that people paid $10 to play online, and it's not forever.
7757468	7761669	And I understand that these games may not have been popular or whatever, but...
7762689	7772877	And I'm sorry, that's nice that it might not have been popular, but you... I don't know, I mean, I guess eventually it has to happen.
7773277	7775159	Figure out a way to consolidate then.
7775219	7786748	I mean, I realize I'm talking out my ass here, but shouldn't there be a way where maybe you could consolidate some of the servers and just have a computer that runs for whatever occasional game?
7787248	7788209	You know, like combined...
7788749	7796532	Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine that, like, you know, EA, Sports MMA, and the reason they shut them down is because not many people are playing them right now, but there's still a few people playing them.
7797033	7799434	Just drop the amount of servers that you have.
7800614	7801275	Drop it to one.
7801935	7803796	You can only have one person play online at a time.
7803916	7807917	Well, I mean, still, that's better than none at all, and especially for people that paid.
7808458	7809158	Just unfortunate.
7811078	7817041	Alright, well anyhow, here's something else that's unfortunate and kind of along the same topic of something we were just talking about.
7817461	7824385	You know the Silent Hill HD collection just recently came out and apparently it's getting very, very mixed polarized reviews.
7824905	7831909	I haven't played it myself yet, so I can't say one way or the other, but you've got some people that are like, yay, it's Silent Hill, it's in HD, it looks great.
7832269	7838673	And some people are like, the game is fucking missing fog, the frame rate is hideous, the voice acting is terrible.
7839413	7854421	and it's gotten to the point, I don't know if you want to call this entitlement or what, Amazon.com is no longer stocking the game that just came out two weeks ago because there are too many user reports that there is a problem with the item.
7855122	7857703	So Amazon.com is doing an investigation to see if it's problematic.
7857723	7859404	It didn't even come out two weeks ago, it came out last week.
7859744	7860305	Oh my gosh.
7862119	7888390	and you know what though I have to agree with them as far as the fog thing goes because even the art director or whatever said hey we use a lot of transparent textures for fog and you can even see it there's a lot of objects that don't quite go all the way they're not complete objects because the fog would normally be obscuring them and so without the fog it looks like oh hey look I've got these telephone wires that just disappear what the hell that doesn't make any sense
7888530	7907246	but what's interesting I tried to go to like I wanted to see what the user feedback was so I went to Amazon.com to read some of the reviews and it's still kind of divided and like I don't know if that's like fanboys versus you know or what it is but it's very divided because for like let me go to Metacritic real fast and do Silent Hill
7907606	7912928	Now it should be noted, the PS3 one is getting more flack than the Xbox 360 one seems to be.
7913408	7915049	So just to kind of put that out there.
7915409	7917090	Yeah, the user score, 5.1.
7917870	7920771	Six positive reviews, five negative reviews.
7921131	7924993	So you have some people that are giving it 10s going, I don't understand why people are hating on this.
7925673	7930435	Konami says relive the two best horror games of all time, strong graphics.
7930795	7936777	And then you get some people that are bombing it, putting the game has far too many bugs to recommend to first timers or veterans alike.
7938541	7938681	0-0-10-10-0-10-9-0
7950040	7950701	And it's funny.
7951461	7952662	Nobody's in the middle.
7952742	7955084	They're either all the way here or all the way there.
7957226	7970658	That's a perfect example right there of what's wrong with review scores and what's wrong with review scores by just average people sometimes because those people are obviously fanboys because a game, trust me, that game doesn't warrant a 10 and it doesn't warrant a 0 either.
7970718	7973100	It's just ridiculous.
7973120	7973941	Yeah.
7974281	7974641	Critics 90, 80, 70
7991850	7994951	I think it's been more average for sure.
7995211	7996991	I think that's what I've been reading out on the internet too.
7997472	8008134	It's kind of like if you've never played Silent Hill and the old games are too hard to get now, then go ahead and play this, but otherwise get your PS2 and go hook up the old games because they were better.
8009335	8009675	I don't know.
8010652	8012893	Ramma in chat says, how the hell did they fuck this game up?
8012933	8013613	I'll never know.
8014094	8015895	Well, not putting Fog in there.
8016635	8020697	And I think, was that only on the PS3 version or something like that?
8020997	8023658	Like they were saying, oh, well, we had trouble rendering the Fog.
8023738	8026680	Like, why would you have trouble rendering the Fog on the PlayStation 3?
8026800	8028240	Here's my other concern.
8028320	8031142	Why did they feel the need then to put this game out now?
8031462	8034844	It's not like we have a shortage of Silent Hill in the world right now.
8035244	8036444	We just had Downpour.
8036825	8039366	We're gonna have the Vita game coming out.
8040166	8043408	Why does this need to be out right now?
8043428	8044749	Go back and make it right.
8044789	8047670	Let's just say for whatever reason, okay, we can't do the fog.
8048251	8060518	Did anybody that was QAing that game realize, hey, it looks a little fucking weird that something that's supposed to not be there or something that's supposed to be obscured by fog is just stopping in the middle of the air.
8060778	8061979	That doesn't make any sense.
8062079	8069163	Maybe we should, I don't know, recreate the object or something like that instead of porting all the assets over and going, eh, whatever, close enough.
8069423	8070443	You know what I mean?
8070503	8071624	Seriously, come on.
8072104	8077325	Just like spend the two seconds it would take to recreate the object or I don't know, go back and fix it.
8077465	8079206	Was the Metal Gear collection this bad?
8079746	8081107	It was fuzzy looking.
8081247	8083747	I didn't like the look of it, but I don't think it was this bad.
8085068	8087729	I honestly haven't seen because Dan keeps playing the MSX versions.
8088969	8090409	Does it really have the MSX games in there?
8090510	8090690	Yes.
8090810	8091190	In English?
8091730	8091910	Yes.
8093548	8099233	I think the Metal Gear Solid Collection got good reviews.
8099273	8102516	That's a great question.
8103777	8105879	Why is fog on the PS3 difficult?
8106219	8110824	Fog in the same way they did it on the PS2 is probably difficult, but okay.
8111464	8114667	Well, take the time to redo it if you're going to do this.
8115087	8116249	That's exactly my problem.
8116429	8118791	Just like those fucking people at Capcom...
8119071	8126994	They're complaining, well, we didn't know how to do local team play in Street Fighter Crosstek and we didn't want to bother to learn that.
8127334	8131815	Boo fucking hoo that you couldn't spend the time to figure out a program in your game.
8132716	8135156	If you can't do any goddamn programming, then quit.
8135316	8139258	Because seriously, you're of no use to us if you can't make a game.
8140499	8143261	Oh, we had to make new assets for this game.
8143461	8147604	You mean I couldn't just straight port the shit over and up-res the textures?
8148165	8149906	Yeah, you may have to do a little bit of work.
8150787	8153950	Porkchop in our chatroom says, Maybe we'll have a DLC bundle.
8153990	8155651	We'll call it the Fog and Dog Pack.
8156632	8156892	Maybe.
8157433	8163077	Acidic Vampire says, Maybe someone should file an issue with the Better Business Bureau and get the fog eventually implemented.
8163698	8165079	Don't give people ideas.
8168839	8169880	It's important to say this though.
8170461	8172343	Again, the reviews were half and half.
8172883	8174465	So not everybody's hating on it.
8175826	8178869	And Konami, they've had issues with the Silent Hill series.
8180050	8180671	They really have.
8181112	8186097	I mean... Well, Akira Yamaoka going somewhere else didn't help.
8186727	8187707	Yes, that's true.
8187988	8194310	I mean, and it's not our show role, but, you know, and as I mentioned weeks ago, the Vita version has been delayed.
8194530	8194931	That's right.
8195011	8195871	Again, right?
8195951	8197132	To May or something?
8197232	8200893	Well, the rumor is May right now, but I don't think there's actually a date yet for it.
8200993	8201954	Wow.
8202514	8204415	But yeah, the Vita version's been delayed.
8205055	8206255	They have one more chance.
8206375	8208536	Konami has one more chance at this HD collection thing.
8208556	8212038	They've got the Zone of Enders collection coming out in the fall.
8212338	8213839	So, cross fingers?
8214359	8214479	Yeah.
8214759	8215700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8241357	8251946	You had fog obscuring it before It does also make me worry, like, if they can't render fucking fog, like, granted it's another company we're talking about here, but is that Final Fantasy X HD remake gonna blow?
8252727	8258832	And it's not that they couldn't render fog, they couldn't render enough fog, like, certain textures they couldn't render Needs more fog!
8259693	8262436	Seriously, it's like, how did you fuck this up?
8264417	8267300	Transparent textures, the PS3 just can't do that
8269662	8296901	or Konami doesn't know how to do that alright let's move into the mailbag speaking of strong opinions and so forth every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange launch radio dot com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and picks oh she got a little sticky tonight picks a few of her favorite mails to read to us here in studio all two of them mailbag at orange launch radio dot com email us
8297982	8298763	Greetings, OLR.
8298843	8300064	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8300465	8308274	Last year when I bought my beast video card for my PC, it came with Civ V. Rob, I'm sorry, but as much as I tried, I was always so bored by it.
8308714	8309355	Get out.
8309935	8311697	But last week, I found the answer.
8311838	8312338	QuickPace.
8312919	8315402	Ever since I found that little option, I can't stop playing the game.
8315842	8316482	Alright, you can stay.
8316642	8321185	I used to be a huge German board game player and this is a very involved board game to me.
8322205	8324767	And it was because you always talk about how great the game is.
8325207	8326247	Thank you very much for that.
8326327	8327568	Also, I have a request for OLR.
8327968	8335512	My wife of seven years just had her birthday and I was hoping that at the end of reading this email you could wish a very happy birthday to French Fry.
8336032	8337913	As always, you are an integral part of my week.
8337953	8339754	Your loyal turtle in Philly, Siri Turtle.
8340215	8342936	Happy birthday, French Fry.
8343056	8344757	What if I'm more of a fan of onion rings?
8346292	8347433	Can we give a shout out to Onion Ring?
8347453	8348233	Don't be a hoe.
8348333	8348773	All right.
8349073	8350554	Happy birthday, French fry.
8351575	8352795	Happy birthday, French fries.
8352975	8355717	I like the sea salted French fries a lot at Wendy's, just saying.
8356797	8357398	Last email.
8358138	8359379	Is there any relation to French toast?
8363201	8367163	This is me staring at Rob with a, you didn't just say that face.
8367223	8368883	This is me recycling the happy music.
8371345	8371605	Hearts.
8372005	8373006	I'm making hearts at Rob now.
8373326	8373666	Okay.
8374346	8375687	Boy, not eating makes you a bitch.
8376502	8377083	Doesn't?
8378144	8379185	I have lots of energy.
8379425	8381327	I've been drinking so much.
8382548	8383729	I'm just fucking with you.
8383849	8386471	All the times, by the way, that I've been quiet, I've been in the bathroom.
8388694	8390335	I'm doing nothing but drinking broth.
8390535	8390756	Okay.
8391276	8391977	Robert H.M.
8392037	8392197	here.
8392217	8393458	I'm peeing nothing but broth.
8394939	8396401	I said drinking nothing but broth.
8397510	8397970	Never mind.
8398211	8398991	Next email, yes.
8399791	8402973	I never heard your thoughts on the Muppets DLC pack for LittleBigPlanet 2.
8403614	8406915	Myself, I enjoyed it but haven't gotten to sit down to get everything yet.
8407376	8408857	Relatedly, is that a word, relatedly?
8409677	8409957	Sure.
8410357	8415921	How do you feel about the level pack DLC for the game and possibly others staying hosted on the server?
8416901	8421164	Such is that the levels out at the time were inaccessible during the PSN outage.
8421764	8427788	I guess the only positive is that one doesn't have to wait for hundreds of megabytes at PSN speeds to download.
8428348	8430390	It does update the game itself, though.
8431110	8435753	Or is the content now being loaded in and I have no idea what I'm writing about?
8436093	8441657	The LittleBigPlanet stuff is generally fun but frustrating content, especially trying to get all the prize items.
8443308	8444629	I actually had no idea.
8444749	8445949	Okay, confession time.
8446689	8448390	I loved LittleBigPlanet 1.
8448970	8451171	I still haven't bought LittleBigPlanet 2.
8451691	8456874	I'm waiting for it to go on sale, and every time I check, it's still like 50, 60 bucks.
8457354	8463016	Granted, it's the Game of the Year edition that comes with all the extra stuff, but I'm kind of waiting for it to get a little cheaper before I buy it.
8463156	8464377	I just totally missed it.
8464837	8467638	It came out at a time when a ton of other games came out.
8468038	8469218	So I never got around to getting it.
8470099	8473640	And I want to get it so I can check out this Muppets DLC and all that.
8473700	8476581	So I'm not going to sit here and make up an opinion on something I haven't played.
8478241	8479842	But I'm still interested in checking it out.
8480162	8481042	I'll put it that way.
8483163	8486183	As far as the server and stuff, I had no idea that was going on.
8486704	8487724	That's weird, though.
8488984	8491205	Why would you not...
8493311	8498995	I don't get it because you either have to download it to your drive or you have to download it to play it server-side even.
8499456	8502158	It's not like it's doing an on-live thing where it's streaming.
8502378	8504279	It's like... I don't think it could handle it.
8504299	8504980	That's weird.
8507021	8518190	That sounds very like Final Fight, Magic Sword, locks you out when PSN is down type of thing to maybe prevent hacking and cracking like what we're seeing happen with Street Fighter X Tekken.
8518230	8518590	And that's...
8519961	8521562	We've got something about that too coming up.
8521662	8525683	Sony needs to stop assuming that PSN is always going to be up because it's not.
8528324	8528684	Anyhow.
8530684	8531324	Very strange.
8531725	8534045	So anyway, that's the last email.
8535766	8537606	Alrighty.
8537666	8540727	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com to send us emails in the future.
8541648	8542828	Meanwhile, Loki.
8543988	8544328	Alright.
8544949	8548210	Let's talk a little bit about hacking.
8548650	8549470	Not necessarily...
8550097	8559661	Hacking of... Things that some people might find controversial, but fan-translated stuff, for example.
8560401	8569785	For example, there's two games that recently have been hacked to translate them into English because no English versions were made available.
8571085	8572366	One of those being...
8573586	8599391	Tales of Vesperia on the PS3 Tales of Vesperia of course came out on Xbox 360 in the US but never on the PS3 the PS3 version which I believe was superior to the Xbox 360 version had a lot more content to that was available in Japan so what people are doing of course is hacking the game to actually use the Xbox 360 translation
8601111	8605634	to translate the text in the PS3 version, and of course doing their own translation for the new content.
8605854	8614038	And it's funny, nothing said that actually the Xbox 360 translated version text was actually hidden in the PS3 code, because you know, you don't clean up your code.
8615659	8617921	So they're working on translating that.
8618161	8625605	They were originally doing the Tales of Graces, but since that actually did get localized over here, they stopped working on that when that announcement was made.
8627786	8645560	and I guess of course they're saying that this will have a patch to the game and of course it will require you to have a jailbroken PS3 with a firmware of 3.55 or lower and they're going to release documentation on how to patch your game if you wish to do so.
8646721	8661379	and then on top of that there of course is another fan translated thing that actually finished and that is Fatal Frame 4 Mask of the Lunar Eclipse has been translated into English for the Nintendo Wii and
8663000	8664601	There's a big ol' effort with that.
8664721	8681188	Of course, you have to patch a version of the game that you have dumped to an ISO, or you can always download a pre-patched version and run it from your hard drive because they made it so freaking easy to do that.
8681909	8682329	But, um...
8684279	8690547	I don't usually endorse the piracy of games, but if they're not going to release it here, they're not going to give you the opportunity.
8691569	8692590	What other choice do you have?
8692850	8693331	Exactly.
8693531	8702863	And I mean, if you had it before, then, you know, you might as well translate in English so you can actually understand it.
8703844	8715391	Also, it should be noted that they're also they have fully translated into Spanish and German and French translations are about halfway done as well.
8717632	8719734	So it's pretty interesting.
8721423	8725605	Alright, well Microsoft has put out an interesting patent.
8725885	8729826	You know, we sometimes get what's coming in the gaming industry from what's going on with patents.
8730406	8733788	And Microsoft has patented this weird helmet device.
8734308	8739530	It's a laser scanning virtual image display and it will display an image very close to your eyes.
8740190	8746052	Apparently, by doing this, the two displays could be in a helmet and you'd be able to see stereoscopic 3D.
8746092	8748253	It's kind of a similar trick to what the 3DS uses.
8748533	8749114	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8773112	8789886	Actually, I remember, okay, I remember, like, 20 years ago, renting from the local store, don't ask why we did this, but we rented a headset VR display, and all it was, you put this headset on, it fucking looked like something on Lawnmower Man, it was just a TV right in front of your eyes.
8791107	8794028	And it was the amazing VR display you could play Super Nintendo games on.
8794048	8798390	They had a VR type thing over at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz.
8798811	8802952	And you could play versions of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake.
8804433	8806114	And I actually played Quake on that.
8806814	8807855	And it was terrible.
8809495	8813077	It was like I had my eyes straight up to my PC screen.
8813257	8813817	And that was it.
8815078	8818019	I was going to say, yeah, it's so immersive with the 640x480 graphics.
8819949	8823655	And SGA100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com brings up the virtual boy.
8823675	8825458	It was kind of a similar gag too.
8826500	8830687	This image may be partially transparent so you can see the world around you.
8832145	8833426	So that way you can play your game, man.
8833706	8835047	This sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.
8835067	8835748	It's a game from Star Trek.
8835768	8837049	So you can see the people laughing at you.
8837069	8840232	No, seriously, from Next Generation where they had the little thing that shot lasers in their eyes.
8840492	8843955	So you can see the people laughing at you for wearing a giant helmet.
8844095	8850661	Oh my god, Chiggers, at the exact same time you said that, Chiggers in chat said, it's like that Star Trek Next Generation episode and everybody will be zombies.
8850961	8853203	You guys are both really big nerds.
8854023	8854304	So...
8858348	8859349	Alright, so there you go.
8860570	8864333	Before you even say, oh, this is the next Xbox, no.
8865113	8865494	Sit down.
8865614	8865974	It's not.
8866274	8868576	No, we've been down that territory.
8868636	8870057	OMG, Microsoft Portable.
8870357	8870537	No.
8871058	8871418	Sit down.
8871598	8877243	God, you know, that Wii prototype, the one that was fake, would have been pretty fucking awesome.
8877803	8878844	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8879597	8883539	Well, as mentioned earlier, Capcom is cracking down.
8884379	8900828	Basically, a statement, and I actually did read this on the Capcom Unity forums, but they're talking about people using the downloadable characters on discs using hacked Xboxes.
8902729	8911412	and one of the big guys at Cat Community said quite ballsy for folks to be taking hacked Xbox 360s on live where they are detectable.
8912793	8918155	And they're also saying in any event we have open channels of communication with Microsoft on these issues Friday night.
8918555	8925858	And then they started asking people to take screenshots and record videos of the offenders but they closed the video and said oh we'll catch them ourselves.
8926772	8931495	They do realize that you can't take screenshots of a fucking Xbox 360, right?
8931736	8932156	Yes, you can.
8932616	8933957	Well, you can if you're a developer.
8934818	8937820	But, and what if you have one of those capture cards?
8938180	8944505	Okay, well, that's a capture card, but I'm talking about like, you can't just, it's not like that Vita where I can push two buttons and take a screenshot.
8946827	8950890	And it wouldn't... And there's iPhones and cameras.
8951090	8953772	And we wouldn't have this problem if they didn't put the DLC on the fucking disc.
8953792	8954893	I agree.
8954913	8955133	I agree.
8957823	8961570	And this smells a lot like CD Projekt Red a few months ago.
8961830	8963232	We're gonna catch those hackers!
8963593	8964735	And we're gonna let the hackers go.
8966738	8967479	They're gonna be Batman.
8967640	8968020	I'm Batman.
8970760	8975164	Well, I mean, I do agree with the point that you gotta be pretty bold to play this shit online.
8975204	8987314	Again, it's kind of that gamer mentality you see sometimes in some gamers where it's like, I gotta be the first, and I gotta, I'm gonna show these guys online that my penis is the biggest, and I'm using characters you're not supposed to have.
8987694	8988495	Rah!
8988655	8990196	You know, it's a little bit silly.
8991809	8992911	Look at my pain.
8993012	8993593	I'm back in.
8994034	8994414	Exactly.
8994495	8998723	But it's kind of a dumb thing to take it online where, you know, they're watching.
8999865	9000767	I like what Sugar says.
9000787	9001909	I will hit you with a coelacanth.
9010066	9031481	Zynga has purchased the company OMG Pop, the makers of the game Draw Something, and of course they purchased them for quite a bit of money, including approximately $200 million between a cash deal and $30 million or so for employee retention and payments.
9033314	9037816	And of course, you know, they're going to be working with them to create some new games, I guess.
9038756	9041157	In related news, I deleted Draw Something this week.
9041417	9043938	I was playing it pretty hardcore for a little bit.
9043978	9045799	I had like 15 games going at once.
9045819	9046379	It was crazy.
9047019	9048580	And I said, nope, I'm done.
9049180	9053241	By the way, there's another iPhone app you might want to check out if you are in the same boat I am.
9053301	9054362	It's called Sheradium.
9055482	9058063	CharaDium
9080451	9085973	But there's more paint styles and it's more of a robust paint program than Draw Something was.
9086093	9087853	You don't have to pay for extra colors and shit.
9087893	9090394	You have to pay for extra colors?
9090554	9093715	Oh yeah, and Draw Something, if you wanted more than just red, what was it?
9093795	9096236	Red, blue, yellow, and black were the only colors you could use.
9096276	9104479	If you wanted green and purple, you either saved up enough tokens from winning games or you had to pay 99 cents to get them.
9104519	9105379	That's hilarious.
9105519	9105839	Oh yeah.
9106939	9108640	And I knew people that had tons of colors.
9111243	9111984	Well, it's sad.
9112004	9112404	You know what?
9112444	9113565	Your money, spend, buy what you want.
9113585	9114285	And you know what, though?
9114305	9122371	I will say, but until the Zynga news, I bought, I spent 99 cents buying the legit, you know, ad-free draws because I'm like, this is a great new game.
9122411	9123312	I want to support this.
9123512	9124613	And then this happened.
9124673	9125233	I'm like, ugh.
9125493	9134900	I, honestly, I can't fault some of the employees at Zynga because, you know, they're just working, but it's, you know, obviously the higher ups that... Well, it's the...
9135300	9136401	GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
9154528	9154928	Just saying.
9181892	9182392	Very interesting.
9182412	9183333	I want some class action.
9183593	9184333	How do I get in on that?
9184353	9185113	Work for GameStop.
9186554	9188935	Well, they might try to go the other way around and sue me.
9189695	9189995	All right.
9191536	9198879	Anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9198899	9199939	But not just yet.
9200479	9205841	We have one more story for you guys tonight, and it's another fucking Kickstarter.
9206962	9207662	This is a trend.
9207802	9208902	I'm not liking this trend.
9208982	9209623	I'm just going to say I...
9211083	9212625	It's just too much.
9213225	9215747	Everybody in the world wants a piece of this Kickstarter thing.
9215787	9217549	And it's like, I'm sorry.
9217569	9220912	Those that got in on it early, like the Double Fine and stuff, good for them.
9220932	9222073	But now it's just getting old.
9222553	9225436	However, there may be some folks that are really into this.
9225536	9226817	So good for you guys.
9227317	9229499	Tex Murphy may make a comeback.
9229599	9234243	Big Finish Games is going to start up a Kickstarter page on May 15th.
9234343	9237046	That seems weird to me that you'd announce like six weeks in advance.
9237086	9238427	We're going to start a Kickstarter page.
9238747	9244831	But alright, they're going to round up funding for a sixth game in this full motion video adventure series.
9244971	9246392	Oh god, I remember these games.
9247793	9248134	Wow.
9248994	9252016	On May 15th, they're going to go live and you can donate to all this.
9252317	9255179	And the guy who plays Tex Murphy is on board.
9255559	9261903	And you can actually see him in a YouTube video where they're actually trying to kind of hawk the whole Kickstarter event.
9263044	9263204	So...
9264745	9293217	I don't know, it's like I don't want to hate Kickstarter but I just hate the trend I think is what it is and I don't hate every campaign on Kickstarter but there's some that are pretty gross but I've already talked about that on a previous episode there's one in particular I saw that was downright offensive and I think people who contributed to it I think in some ways got suckered and swindled but that's your choice, your money anyhow
9294443	9295843	Let's move on to happier topics.
9296424	9297664	Or maybe worse topics.
9297724	9298604	It's all up to you guys.
9298644	9299605	It's in the hands of the listeners.
9299925	9304146	Because the Skype line is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9304506	9307087	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9308267	9308568	All right.
9308648	9312029	And going to our chat room, DDR Dollar Bill says, I like the Tex Murphy games.
9312069	9313489	I'm not saying they were bad games.
9313549	9316410	It's just this trend is a little strange.
9316730	9318991	I'm not a big fan of this.
9319651	9320272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9336309	9337210	I miss my games!
9337531	9337851	Cries.
9338051	9340053	I'm pretty happy with our Panasonic.
9340954	9342957	Toshiba makes good ones, too.
9343017	9346260	I mean, go look... If you've got a Fry's in town, go to Fry's.
9346280	9348142	They have specials all the damn time.
9349124	9351666	Yeah, don't buy anything on impulse.
9352127	9354610	It's so hard for me to recommend you a specific TV game or girl.
9354630	9355631	Do not get a Plasma.
9357414	9358155	Get an LCD.
9358275	9361577	It's so hard for me to recommend a TV gamer girl because I don't know what type of setup you have.
9361657	9365000	Do you have like a gigantic living room that you want a gigantic TV to fill?
9365400	9370304	Or do you want something for your bedroom that maybe you're not going to be able to use the living room an awful lot?
9370804	9379751	Like if you want a bedroom TV, maybe, and it's specifically for gaming because you said I miss my games, maybe you should look into that PlayStation monitor that's out.
9379891	9384274	I hear it's not terrible and you could do the whole 3D games if you have the consoles to support it.
9385534	9390036	But if you don't really have a PlayStation 3, then that TV is kind of a waste.
9390156	9391956	So something to think about.
9392056	9396337	Again, if you're going for a bedroom TV, why not go for a computer monitor?
9396717	9405340	You can get a cable that will hook an Xbox 360 up to the computer monitor as well as PlayStation 3 can hook up to a computer monitor, right, with a particular cable?
9405580	9405980	HDMI to DVI adapter
9423453	9423973	That will do it.
9424193	9426054	I'm sure we'll work with the USPS3s.
9427214	9429654	Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom suggests Vizio.
9429855	9430835	Best bang for the buck.
9430875	9431895	That's actually what we have.
9432535	9433595	I'm happy with the Vizio.
9433655	9434336	That's the way to do it.
9436156	9437236	Rama says Samsung.
9437276	9438156	Best TVs ever.
9438256	9440257	Chiggers says Sony Bravia all the way.
9440757	9448659	So, Gamer Girl, it's really hard when we don't know your circumstance and your budget to pinpoint one correct TV.
9449039	9450079	But do your research.
9450419	9451660	Do your research online.
9451820	9452920	Read reader reviews.
9453360	9468166	Don't go to the store on a whim and let the sales guy know, yeah, I need to get a new TV because I can't play games anymore because they are going to try to take it to the cleaners because they're going to know you need a new TV and they're going to be like, oh, this chick's not going to leave without one.
9468186	9468987	It's like shopping for a car.
9469007	9469807	Yeah, exactly.
9471168	9473909	Don't be afraid to say no and don't let them know you want it.
9474509	9474969	Exactly.
9475309	9476130	And don't buy a plasma.
9477170	9480595	Well now, some folks in the chat room disagree with you.
9482097	9484360	Legend of Zaku says, get a plasma, very little lag.
9484720	9487023	Chiggers agrees though, saying plasma hurts my eyes.
9488105	9492410	Niche, or Niche, I don't know if you've seen that, says plasma is better than LCD.
9493171	9493472	WTF.
9494073	9498396	Disagree, because with plasma you can also deal with more burn-in in some cases.
9499697	9509825	I would say also, Gamer Girl, go to the store and kind of look at the TVs, especially a place where you're less likely to get hounded, like Best Buy or even like Target.
9510605	9511726	Go to a furniture store.
9511826	9512706	Or a Walmart even.
9512726	9515008	I would never have thought to get TVs at a furniture store.
9516068	9521371	So yeah, go to a place where you're less likely to get hounded and just kind of look and go, oh, I like the look of this.
9521391	9523793	Because then you can make your own decision on plasma versus LCD.
9523813	9525394	Maybe you'll look at a plasma and go, I want this.
9525894	9527475	Then, you know, you can.
9527895	9529496	So I would do that.
9529716	9533704	I think a Target or a Walmart is a great place to look because you're not going to get hounded by salesmen.
9533964	9534686	You don't have to buy.
9535107	9535507	Just look.
9535928	9540156	In fact, the TVs at Walmart are probably not... I mean, they're cheap for a reason.
9540316	9540858	Remember that.
9542778	9545180	I actually super agree with Technus.
9545280	9551625	If you have a membership to Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's, I recommend them because of the return policies.
9551806	9553327	Agree, agree, agree.
9553807	9561593	I think the best place in the world actually, and here we go with advertisements, but I'm saying it because I believe it, I think the best place in the world to get a TV is Costco.
9562634	9566497	because their return policy used to be a lot more generous than it is now.
9567197	9571180	Oh my God, I had a TV break like two years after I bought it and Costco took it back.
9571440	9572601	I was astounded.
9573095	9573796	They did that with us.
9574076	9575457	They didn't have our model anymore.
9576197	9581942	So we traded it in from a 58-inch to a 52-inch and paid just another $100.
9582562	9582903	Me too.
9583003	9584064	I was astounded.
9584564	9588047	So I don't think their policy is as generous anymore.
9588067	9588947	You have to have a receipt now.
9589027	9589228	Yeah.
9589688	9597354	But yeah, just the price and the fact you don't get hounded and the selection I think is a great place to try it.
9598632	9599273	Alright, anyhow.
9599933	9601055	Wow, the phone's not ringing.
9601475	9602316	I hope it's working.
9602336	9605600	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangetown Radio.
9605980	9607442	Or the listeners are just being shy tonight.
9607482	9608002	That's okay.
9608123	9608964	That happens sometimes.
9612608	9614610	It might have also just been a little bit of a slow news week.
9614850	9615291	You know what I mean?
9615531	9616572	Sometimes that happens.
9617173	9619475	Why don't you just call and ask me a question, people?
9620700	9621940	DarkSakura wants attention.
9622801	9626442	No, I'm just trying to get some life into the phone line.
9627022	9630663	I'm checking to make sure the 800 number is actually working because it's been having some problems lately.
9631124	9631784	Yeah, it's working.
9631804	9633784	We've got people who've got problems.
9634945	9637726	Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more tweets.
9638366	9644148	We have Tigerclaw links us to a story about NASA helped with Angry Birds space.
9644736	9646437	Oh yeah, that came out.
9646937	9647477	I forgot.
9648678	9656441	But Angry Birds Space did come out and apparently NASA collaborated in this with what's called a Space Act Agreement.
9656521	9657961	Why does NASA team up with this?
9658421	9663023	It saw an opportunity to teach kids about space, science, and the laws of physics.
9663543	9670886	And considering that NASA's kind of taken some hits lately with funding and all that, I can see why they'd want to get on board with this.
9671206	9671907	And you know, I...
9672967	9675529	If I was a kid, I'd be really into this, I think.
9675970	9677731	So I think this is actually a good thing.
9677811	9678772	I can't hate on this.
9679813	9682355	A comment from, what is this?
9683256	9686259	Space Station Trajectory Operations Officer.
9686759	9691664	It's a great way to demonstrate how we can use trajectories to get from one place to another.
9692224	9699831	It's a really good example of how interplanetary probes can take gravity assets from other, or gravity assists, excuse me, from other planets.
9700650	9702391	Hey, our phone line's lighting up now.
9703012	9705393	I think you're hemming and hawing work, DarkSakura.
9705413	9705954	We got a call.
9706294	9707215	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9707235	9707595	Who's this?
9708756	9709776	Hi, this is Actdeft.
9709876	9710457	Hey, Actdeft.
9710477	9710997	What's up, buddy?
9712378	9714299	Just checking if Skype works.
9715300	9716061	Yes, thank you.
9716101	9716761	It does work.
9716861	9717401	We're good.
9717441	9718122	Well, what's on your mind?
9718142	9719123	What have you been playing lately?
9720844	9721824	Not much, really.
9722145	9725807	I have been playing mostly Team Fortress 2 on Steam.
9726267	9726988	And Forza 4.
9727028	9727168	Forza 4?
9727208	9727328	Yeah.
9730851	9734894	Forza, that's a series I never really got into because it's a little too pro for me.
9734954	9736996	But what do you like about Forza?
9737076	9737917	Forza 4.
9739458	9744763	Forza, pretty much, it's pretty much like Gran Turismo in the simulation sense.
9745783	9752549	It's very precise, and when you have to accelerate turns and all that, it's like driving a real car.
9752609	9759135	But the thing that Forza has as a series is that it has an arcade feel.
9759975	9764497	Are you a car guy in real life?
9764898	9768679	Do you like to mod cars and pimp your ride and all that?
9770460	9771201	Somewhat.
9772481	9780065	I do like cars, though I don't know that much to mod or modify cars like that.
9780125	9785328	But I am a car aficionado in real life, so I do know some stuff.
9785948	9792635	Okay, so yeah, I, you know, I just kind of noticed usually the people that get into these games are car aficionados and there's nothing wrong with that.
9792715	9794216	Cars can be very sexy machines.
9794276	9795257	Even I recognize that.
9796098	9800643	And, you know, I don't necessarily drive a state of the art car, but I was, I even parked next to a guy today.
9800683	9801864	I'm like, that's a sexy car.
9802604	9804026	If I had more money, I'd want that car.
9806144	9814909	But yeah, something that, like I said, for so fast, it doesn't feel like a simulation at all.
9815489	9824314	You have all the customization, you can paint your car, you can tune it out, and you can pretty much do everything with your car.
9824434	9826235	And it also drives like a real car.
9826895	9830217	But like I said, the moment you're playing the game,
9830997	9831278	and so on.
9851135	9853096	I was going to say, are you a fan of arcade racers?
9853196	9857538	Like, you know, the split seconds, the blurs, the burnouts of the world?
9858318	9860859	Yeah, I'm a fan of both type of games, really.
9861259	9867902	Though I do mostly play arcade racers like Ridge Racer, the Dirt Series, and all that.
9869023	9870823	Then tell me, am I right or am I right?
9871564	9873865	F-Zero needs to be a Wii U launch title.
9874565	9875365	Oh, yeah, it does.
9875746	9876526	Thank you very much.
9878174	9879796	Yeah, I've been hearing that, that's pretty good
9893737	9898239	I'm hearing, I was talking to Shane earlier about it, and he says the game's got a great sense of humor.
9898279	9904983	He says he's reminded of Earthbound in the sense of humor, and I'm like, ooh, that's a big name to invoke around Nintendo.
9906944	9908985	But that's pretty cool if it's got that sense of humor to it.
9911146	9912967	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9914668	9915549	No, that will be all.
9915769	9916870	All right, well, take care, buddy.
9916910	9917350	Have a good one.
9918190	9918751	You too.
9918771	9918951	Thanks.
9919151	9919411	Bye.
9921257	9929623	I should have asked if he was into Mario Kart, too, because Mario Kart's kind of a racer that's a little bit toned down so everybody can get into it.
9930064	9933426	You know what I played randomly not that long ago was Mario Kart on the Wii again.
9933466	9937089	I hadn't played that in forever, but it's still all right.
9938150	9942953	One other tweet here from TigerClaw at Twitter.com slash OLR, where you guys can send us tweets every week.
9943414	9947577	Scammers attempt to trick fans with promise of new Mass Effect 3 endings.
9948037	9949138	Oh, this is terrible.
9949138	9950659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9977356	9981019	to give us all your information so you can download the client, like your credit card number.
9981059	9982520	And some people, unfortunately, fall for it.
9982960	9985862	Well, it's happening with the Mass Effect 3 ending stuff.
9986663	9989025	I'll come back to this story in a minute, but we have another call coming in.
9989065	9989986	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9990006	9990326	Who's this?
9990866	9991807	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9991887	9992688	Hey, Ranma, what's up?
9993368	9994449	Not too much, not too much.
9994489	9995370	How about you, good friend?
9996831	9997671	Same old, same old.
9997951	10001154	Just working, sleeping, playing Mass Effect.
10002478	10004459	Aha, Mass Effect, I see that.
10005600	10006180	What's on your mind?
10006941	10019789	Not too much, I was pondering to call see if you had played Kid Icarus yet, because I'm more or less waiting on your review of the game before I go out and buy it, but from the last call you haven't popped it open yet, so I'm kind of anxious about it.
10020789	10023090	I will have a review next week, I promise.
10024350	10025111	I did buy it.
10025211	10026791	I took a leap of faith and bought it.
10027691	10033473	I got it on Amazon, which is kind of funny because I ended up getting, like, it was $39.99, right?
10034574	10038815	They refunded me $10 because I guess Best Buy or somebody else put it out cheaper.
10039395	10042736	So they have that whole, if it comes out cheaper somewhere else, we'll refund your money.
10043176	10044337	So I thought that was kind of interesting.
10045177	10050158	That would kind of explain why I could not find it in Best Buy the last couple of days.
10050178	10052078	Because I just decided to walk in and check.
10052379	10054199	Just out of idle curiosity.
10054379	10055219	Nope, didn't have it.
10055779	10056919	Well, that means it's selling.
10058740	10059960	Which I guess is a good sign.
10060100	10061861	I would like for the series to come back.
10062481	10063741	I'm hoping the game doesn't suck.
10063801	10069002	But the general consensus I'm reading on the internet is that the game is pretty damn good.
10069042	10092329	Good but the controls are so bad it ruins it for some people like it like there's a reason the game came with the little stand that's kind of the general consensus I'm hearing which is a little bit alarming if the controls are that bad it's going to ruin the game but it's good enough to further explore the concept is kind of what I'm getting.
10093452	10094292	Okay, I get it.
10094352	10095393	I get it now.
10096353	10099334	There's also the 3D re-release of the original Kid Icarus.
10099734	10102435	Apparently, it's not just the ROM.
10102756	10106717	I mean, this isn't a huge deal, but they went and added backgrounds, I guess, into it.
10107077	10110438	So they did kind of give it a little something-something they didn't have before.
10110458	10116520	That sounds interesting, because I'm kind of reminded of the times I used to sit there and play the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy.
10117361	10120562	Oh, yeah, the kind of overlooked sequel that really did come out, yeah.
10121261	10122162	Mm-hmm
10138095	10166512	it did have some weird quirky stuff in it but and it tried to do a lot like I think they kind of stretched themselves thin with suddenly it's a vertical scroller now it's a side scroller now it's a dungeon crawler now it's a shooter you know what I mean that's a bit of a mind fuck if you think about it it is but I mean for a child who is you know eight years old with mild ADD it was great pretty much maybe that's why it holds my attention so well
10167901	10171186	Since we're on the topic of 3DS games, I'll make this quick before I bounce off.
10171546	10174050	I finally got around to playing Super Mario 3D Land.
10174250	10174771	Ooh, what'd you think?
10176609	10179570	I kept saying that I want a 3D version of Super Mario 3.
10179871	10182312	That's what I've been screaming for.
10183052	10189116	And this game pretty much comes close to my inner Super Mario 3 fandom.
10189216	10190117	It comes close.
10190937	10192178	It's really good.
10192518	10193158	It is.
10193319	10197541	I really think people don't give it enough credit for what it's doing to the franchise as a whole.
10197601	10198782	I think it's really good.
10200768	10204852	One of my main issues with the game is that all the levels are straightforward.
10204892	10208695	I thought maybe you'd be able to go to 1-1 and 1-2.
10208756	10212159	You could just go down another direction, go to 1-4, this and that.
10212299	10213740	Oh, like in Mario 64, kind of?
10214401	10216163	No, more like the way it was in Mario 3.
10216203	10218785	Oh, I got you.
10218905	10219386	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10220427	10221788	Have you finished the game yet or no?
10223329	10224731	I've fake finished it.
10226112	10228053	I don't want to say too much for spoiler reasons.
10228533	10229434	Okay.
10229914	10230595	Let me put it this way.
10230715	10233556	It's got a Symphony of the Night-esque thing going on.
10233856	10234597	Yeah, I know.
10235057	10236398	I'm playing through it again.
10236718	10240680	In the back of my mind, I'm like, I can't believe I'm going through the levels the way I am.
10241041	10244743	It's like the difficulty kind of jumps around.
10245023	10251907	And then at that last section, when I thought it was done, and then this whole more of it pops up, I'm like...
10253055	10254496	Nintendo, what the fuck?
10255237	10255777	Exactly.
10255817	10256818	What the fuck?
10256958	10258299	Yeah, right.
10258799	10260761	But that's great.
10260781	10261041	That's great.
10261261	10269447	You know, it's not often that games kind of invoke that feeling that you got when you realized, oh my god, Symphony of the Night, I'm not even halfway done.
10272810	10273230	It's awesome.
10273735	10274615	That's all I got to say.
10276916	10277616	Well, good luck.
10277956	10283118	And you know, if you do well enough, you might get to be Black Luigi playing Luigi.
10284118	10287519	I've already gotten to that part.
10288239	10292300	I mean, I like how they redid Luigi.
10292581	10293141	I like that.
10293701	10295721	It's more playable.
10295781	10296942	Anything else before we let you go tonight?
10299635	10300176	No, that's it.
10300616	10300896	All right.
10300936	10301476	Take care, buddy.
10301976	10302356	You too.
10302556	10302836	Bye.
10303457	10305717	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Rob, it's a Mario game.
10305737	10307598	Do we really need spoiler alerts for it?
10307658	10308918	Well, look, I'm just trying to be nice.
10308978	10309218	All right.
10309958	10310899	We have another call coming in.
10310919	10311819	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10311839	10312179	Who's this?
10312679	10313359	This is Shane.
10313539	10315040	Hey, you've been calling a lot lately.
10315080	10315460	What's up?
10316000	10321762	I know, because I stay up later for some reason, which is probably why I fail at work more often than not.
10322182	10322762	It's all good.
10322882	10324202	This show's important, damn it.
10324982	10325603	Totally.
10325803	10326583	What's on your mind?
10327392	10327873	Kid Icarus
10343127	10344929	That's what our last caller wanted to know about.
10345069	10346370	What do you think about Kid Icarus?
10347431	10348232	It's fantastic.
10348272	10360784	The way they paced the game with the terrible control scheme, because let's just be honest, if a game makes you hurt your hands while playing on purpose, it's got a terrible control scheme.
10362446	10377779	but the writing is so good and I think the Earthbound comparison that I gave to you earlier is spot on because it's witty it's stupidly cheesy it makes terrible puns and it breaks the fourth wall constantly
10378960	10380522	That's pretty cool.
10381223	10395019	Maybe because Nintendo is, for whatever reason, and this makes me hurt to say, please don't be mad at me, fanboys, but maybe since Nintendo's kind of abandoned the Mother franchise, maybe they're bringing Kid Icarus in as kind of their silly...
10397330	10399252	Or do you think it's just because it's for four-year-olds?
10399312	10401755	I think it's because it's made by Sakurai is why.
10402336	10402636	You think?
10402936	10403096	Yeah.
10403116	10403577	All right.
10404698	10407361	Well, he's got a great sense of humor then.
10407701	10412186	To be fair, in the interest of full disclosure, you're a big fan of Power Rangers and Pokemon.
10412667	10412927	Yes.
10414109	10416011	So maybe the game's aimed at children.
10417603	10418143	I don't know.
10418263	10424887	When one of the lines is, it's like a birthday party where everybody's trying to kill me, I don't feel like that's really Pokemon.
10425067	10425968	Hey, Shane.
10426468	10426688	Yes.
10427168	10432091	Quick spoiler, because I forgot to talk about this last week during the segment that doesn't exist.
10432151	10433172	Which game are we spoiling?
10433552	10434192	Oh, real quick.
10434452	10440316	I was just going to say, hey, I bet you don't know that there's a Kinect version of Power Rangers Samurai coming out later this year.
10441396	10444398	You mean the game I feel the urge to pre-order now?
10445997	10450660	because I will totally morph and punch things in the air.
10450840	10451920	That's awesome.
10452040	10456823	You know, I played the crap out of the Super Nintendo one.
10457463	10458584	Oh yeah, that was great.
10458604	10460005	That was a really good beat-em-up.
10460685	10466168	And there was a Dairanger game that came out in Japan that I had the ROM for that I played the hell out of.
10467366	10467566	Pokemon!
10467586	10467726	Pokemon!
10489239	10491681	Well, yeah, because everybody should be excited about that.
10492341	10498804	And not to cross-promote shows or whatever, but I'm sure on Horde House we'll talk about this week.
10499625	10507809	They datamined some of the pet battle stuff, and it shows what's weak to what, what's strong against what, and some of the new attacks.
10508290	10512232	So Pokemon in World of Warcraft is just going to make my day.
10513012	10514234	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10530556	10549371	so gosh what else do I ask you about so thank you for the plug for Horde House that's good we always try to cross promote the shows and Kid Icarus so you think Kid Icarus because Ranma said he's waiting for my review to check it out but you're saying don't bother just go get it and you can play the game in 10 minute bursts so that way when your hand starts wanting to die you can take a break and it's okay
10549830	10554533	Yeah, and I really like the way they scale the difficulty for you.
10555774	10557555	There's no hard, easy mode.
10558676	10561158	There's this bar, and you wager hearts.
10561858	10563739	And by wagering hearts, you get better rewards.
10564700	10567522	And the more hearts you wager, the harder the game gets.
10567702	10569603	So if you lose, you lose a whole bunch of hearts.
10569683	10573926	But if you beat it, you get better rewards, and the difficulty just skyrockets.
10574026	10578129	I almost died on wagering to a 4.2 level difficulty.
10579770	10581270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10602356	10617604	so she's like oh remember the eggplant wizard and the nurses and you know and it previously would heal you and he was like if it was like yeah you know I went there so often they named it after me and she's like what he's like hospital get it hospital
10619702	10621284	Oh my god, that is terrible.
10621964	10622425	Isn't it?
10622585	10625748	But it's just so funny when you're playing it.
10625828	10627289	It's like, are you kidding me?
10627410	10628150	This is great.
10628531	10629852	And it's all voice acted, right?
10630132	10632334	Yeah, there's not any text.
10632795	10635577	Oh, there's text, but I mean, it's all dialogue voice stuff.
10635778	10636699	Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
10638201	10652402	or when you are scaling a wall in one of the flying stages and there's like enemies pouring down on you and you beat them all and you get to the top it's like yeah take that wall I'm like that sounds like something I would say that is something you would say actually very much yes
10653002	10654883	That also sounds like something Dan would say.
10655463	10656203	It does, it does.
10657344	10658884	Any online-ish components?
10658924	10660705	Street Pass, Spot Pass, any of that?
10661905	10666447	Yeah, it does have, I believe, an online multiplayer and a local multiplayer.
10666727	10673690	I haven't done them yet because I'm only to world four or five because I fell asleep.
10675511	10676811	And then went back to playing Mass Effect.
10677611	10679032	Yes, and then went back to playing Mass Effect.
10680973	10703705	it sounds like from everything I've read the multiplayer is really fun and a lot of the sort of high risk high reward stuff happens in that too because like if you take I guess one of your better weapons into multiplayer if you when you take a good weapon in there you take you have like a lower health bar so it expects if you have a good weapon you're going to be a better player
10704625	10711347	and I think that's really cool because if I'm going to have a god weapon I should only have a little bit of health because I earned that weapon.
10712407	10712707	Alright.
10713027	10719669	We've got to let you go to wrap up the show but quickly I know you said you weren't going to bring up Mass Effect but I just have to ask one Mass Effect related question.
10720009	10720269	Yes.
10720969	10722870	Jack is the greatest character ever.
10722950	10723590	Yes or yes?
10724750	10724970	What?
10725050	10725390	Sorry.
10725470	10725910	Say it again.
10726090	10727591	Jack is the greatest character ever.
10727651	10728191	Yes or yes?
10728471	10728771	No.
10729511	10731432	But I do like Jack better in two.
10731732	10732512	Don't like the listeners.
10732532	10732832	I mean three.
10733333	10733633	All right.
10734574	10735815	All right, have a good one, Shane.
10735915	10736316	You too.
10736336	10736877	All right, bye.
10737377	10738558	Bye.
10738619	10739980	That'll do it for the Skype line tonight.
10740000	10741201	Thanks to those guys that got through.
10741221	10744926	See, it was a little slow to begin, but then it started to fill up there at the end.
10745006	10746528	So don't be shy next week.
10746788	10749271	I've heard from some of my favorite people today.
10749571	10749671	Oh?
10750732	10751573	on the sky.
10751633	10752854	Oh, on the skyline, yeah.
10753174	10764181	I'm especially, I'm pleased slash angry with Shane because of all of the music that I got in trouble for buying on Amazon after being in a turntable with him.
10765082	10766643	Oh, were you guys turntabling this week?
10766803	10769164	We did two nights ago.
10769465	10769725	Nice.
10769905	10770145	Yeah.
10770345	10770665	Good time.
10771666	10773547	Or last night, I don't remember because I can't remember anything.
10774668	10777210	But I got in trouble for all the music I downloaded.
10777270	10780072	So I have good music, yay, but I'm poor, boo.
10780731	10786974	There is an unofficial official Turntable FM after party for Orange Lounge Radio that HitStun puts together.
10787094	10788074	So it's kind of one of those.
10788654	10789495	We endorse it.
10790075	10791736	It's not us doing it, but we endorse it.
10791896	10793616	I love Turntable FM.
10793656	10795057	It's a great site.
10795157	10799339	It's one of the greatest things to happen to music in a long time since iTunes.
10802180	10807982	Anyhow, I want to quickly say I never finished up the tweet from earlier that TigerClaw sent us, the whole scamming thing.
10808062	10815585	The new scam is Mass Effect 3, and there is a spam email going out, and I can't believe people are falling for this, but unfortunately it's working.
10815985	10826748	You download a zip file containing a password-protected downloader for the supposed new ending, and a text file in the zip tells you to go to a website where you do offers to get the ending.
10826808	10828389	I mean, this is shady as hell, right?
10828949	10830490	So, don't fall for this stuff.
10830510	10832331	And then I'm sure the executable is a virus.
10833312	10836573	If something legit happens, it will be all over the internet.
10836593	10841856	We'll not only report on it here on the show, but if you can't wait until Sunday, just, like, seriously.
10842497	10844138	The Mass Effect 3 stuff has been so big.
10844158	10844458	I don't know.
10844478	10846059	That sounds kind of legit to me.
10846879	10849781	I see stories on my news.google.com.
10849821	10856104	I used to kind of get the aggregate news a lot, and Mass Effect 3 is always in the technology stories.
10856825	10856945	So...
10858809	10861711	Anyhow, that's it.
10861791	10862672	That's it for calls.
10862692	10863572	That's it for tweets.
10863712	10865794	And I think that's it for another episode of OLR.
10866554	10870877	Quickly, though, before we wrap it up and say goodnight, I need to ask if there's any last-minute stories.
10870937	10873199	DarkSakura, Loki, any last-minute stories you want to get out tonight?
10875781	10875861	No.
10876877	10877758	Nothing I want to get out.
10878218	10881440	Geovidea in chat says it's happening for the Guild Wars 2 beta too.
10882321	10883101	That's unfortunate.
10883281	10884942	I really wish I was getting in that beta.
10885683	10891086	Maybe you'll get your zip file executable and you can download the password from a website.
10891106	10892127	Stop.
10893348	10895389	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10897190	10899031	DarkSakura, what's your final thought for the listeners tonight?
10900652	10901293	I want pizza.
10903208	10904229	Wait, we can't do final thoughts.
10904269	10904549	You know what?
10904589	10905270	We skipped something.
10905590	10905830	What?
10906090	10907131	We never did the FUs of the week.
10908152	10908532	Fuck.
10913516	10914897	I'm just not angsty, Rob.
10916839	10918220	Well, you can do a thank you.
10919861	10920782	Bless you or whatever it's called.
10924571	10926754	Actually, I do have a fuck you.
10927775	10943151	To the guy who was setting up the booth outside of Walmart that said, get rid of Obama, vote Republican, with the very poorly handwritten sign, first of all, if you want to draw the right attention, you need a better designed sign, just saying.
10943812	10945993	I really do feel great, except I'm hungry.
10946033	10946353	That's it.
10946373	10946493	Loki?
10971241	10999294	I guess FU to being tired I've had to work hard the last few days because I've had to watch Josh instead of going to work and giving at least a lunch break My FU of the week goes to internet drama because it's very very serious The internet's serious business It is serious business and our lives depend on internet drama
11003835	11007396	Porkchop in our chat says Orange Launch Radio is linked to aggressive and violent hosts.
11008437	11008957	Possibly.
11009317	11013038	Alright, last minute, or excuse me, now our final thoughts.
11013058	11014159	Because we did last minute stories.
11014199	11014599	Final thoughts.
11014619	11015959	So DarkSakura, you get another go at it.
11015979	11016739	What's your final thought?
11017100	11017380	Tea.
11019100	11021421	My final thought of the night is broccoli beef.
11022742	11023742	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11024348	11050755	there are a lot of good projects on Kickstarter so be sure to check out Kickstarter but there are a lot that seem you just have to look at it and how professionally it's being approached and stuff and some of them are quite sickening to the amount of money that they raise for what they've raised it for and for how long those certain things were going for prior to putting a Kickstarter up if you know what I mean I think that's as vague as I can get
11052754	11054435	Alright, and let's see.
11054535	11057177	My final thought tonight... Oh no, I did my final thought.
11057357	11057677	Hello.
11058498	11059819	Sorry, I got distracted by chat.
11060299	11061040	But I will say this.
11061080	11063181	This is the segment I always say at the end of every show.
11063241	11064922	It's the final, final thought from all of us.
11065403	11069686	If you like Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.
11070126	11070607	Thanks for watching!
11087809	11089791	And remember, portal gun for me for my birthday.
11111866	11112447	Yeah, that's right.
11112687	11114128	DarkSakura's birthday is in April.
11114208	11115529	So what can I say?
11115569	11116970	It's going to be a crazy month.
11117070	11120433	So we'll see you next week to do it all again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11120453	11120974	Have a great week.
