What? Crap what?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today's my dad's birthday

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Happy birthday DarkSakura's dad

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
By the way that is Jamie Summers also known as DarkSakura

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am Rob Roberts

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hi

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi how are you?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is Colonel Muster doing to Professor Plum on your shirt?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh you're talking about my shirt

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the library with the wrench?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The lovely Amanda sent me this shirt

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't remember if it was Christmas or birthday

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I think it was Christmas

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And she was the raffle fairy if you saw the umlaut thing

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
She was the raffle fairy

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And yeah she sent me this shirt and it's great

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Get it? It's Professor Plum and Colonel Muster? Okay you'll take a picture and upload it on orangeloungeradio.com

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I have seen that Woot shirt

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah I think it was a Woot shirt

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is a Woot shirt

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey it's Techmaster Loki

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What is up with everybody tonight? Everybody wants to just jump right in before I introduce them

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's alright

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Professional radio at its best

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm just a Woot shirt expert because I check that site all the time

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I'm very

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have to cut down on the amount of t-shirts that I buy because

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You know I have a lot of t-shirts already

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But damn there's so many good video game shirts there

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh yeah

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is that, now do they let fans vote on shirts there or is that only Threadless that does that?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's basically they, yeah they have a thing that they call

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well they have the Derby

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's usually a theme and then they'll create a shirt that wins that theme and then they'll be for sale

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And they also have a thing called the Reckoning which

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They have 20 shirts and they, people you know who buy them whatever shirts are more popular

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Stay on the list and the ones that are not popular fall off the list and they get replaced next week

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Gotcha

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Alright

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know I would like the Woot shirts better though if I could get like

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Better girly style shirts

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah they don't have like girl sizes or anything like that

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the Woot shirts end up just being ridiculous for me because I hate the way that regular t-shirts fit

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because for my ginormous

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You got the boobies

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Rack right

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If I'm gonna get a shirt that's gonna fit me everywhere else it's gonna be too tight on the girls

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Otherwise I look like you know it's the 80s and you wear your shirt all slouched out with the little clip on the side

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No no no no

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Maybe it's time to bring back that style you know sometimes old-fashioned makes comebacks

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay okay how about that rat tail and members only jacket huh

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey I actually wore a members only jacket to a Rocky Horror Show like

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It was probably last year at some point because you know that kind of stuff's funny

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Of course no one's gonna get that because they weren't in on that conversation

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alright look

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Join our chat room chat.orangelaunchery.com

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are a live show we have been for going on almost 10 years now

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And speaking of which Tiger Claw in our chat room starts us off tonight saying

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Episode 448 you guys just have two more shows until you reach 450

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Any plans for the big 450 show?

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No I do

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No that's not really a milestone

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't yeah I don't see 450 as a milestone

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's like diet milestone

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Especially when we have the 10 year coming up in

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Three months

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A little over three months we still we haven't guys legit we have no idea what we're doing for the 10 year anniversary right now

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm gonna address something right now to Raginator

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh what's up

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Nothing is going to get me to eat ham bacon and shellfish

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because I have something called principles

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You did have

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And it's not a whim

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You didn't have that bacon milkshake but there was no real bacon in it

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No and I tasted it

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's no real good in that either

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They just took a vanilla milkshake and said hey we're gonna ruin this

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So there's a difference between like getting a vegetarian to eat you know a piece of beef on a whim a dare

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Rather than having someone break you know a religious tradition

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well if you want to piss off one of the hosts join our chat room chat.com or just launch radio.com

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Say something offensive

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Talking about woot shirts here

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They've got like already on their reckoning right now here's the shirts that they have

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Number 8 1985 the year of the plumber which you know has a bunch of Mario themed stuff on there

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They've got number 11 which is hey listen which depicts Link falling asleep in class

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And let's see here

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They have a number 14 a lot of this is going around which is the arrow through the knee stuff

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And it goes in the dark

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And not really gaming related but they have the IT guys coat of arms which you know refresh reinstall reboot

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know it's just some awesome stuff on there

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I do you know now I'm starting to sound like a commercial but I will say this I have found some good stuff on just the woot general site

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Like that's where I got my Tron gaming mouse that I have for like 35 bucks and I think normally it's about $80

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I do check woot every day for the matching keyboard because I'm like if the mouse went on clearance then the keyboards got to go on clearance at some point

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting I want that Tron keyboard

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I got some jump drives off there once but I lost them all again

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I bought like four of them too and I lost every single one of them all of them they're just like poof disappeared

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I had one disintegrate on me but the other three were lost

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Alright instead of talking about video game t-shirts let's get to video games and I want to kick off tonight talking a little bit about GDC

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Game Developers Conference of course is a huge you know industry event that's happening just across the bridge over in San Francisco not far from us

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And that kicks off this week I think Tuesday maybe Wednesday but a lot of people are starting to show up in town already for it

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm a little bit unknowing to the specifics of GDC because I don't go it's not a media event they don't want media people there

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's really for game developers a great way to do some networking I know people in the industry that go to like look for new people

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And you know hiring event especially with some of the bad news we've had lately in the industry

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like for example one story that didn't make our show roll tonight it's been a big pretty big deal in the industry this week

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Blizzard laid off 600 people this week unfortunately so you know with the change and you know how these subscriber loss and wow

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And the fact that Diablo 3 is pretty much in the can and what have you they unfortunately laid off 600 people

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the good news or I mean the whatever possible good news you can make of that

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The upside?

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah the upside let's put it that way the upside is that hey GDC is this week so maybe some of those folks can you know take their resumes up to GDC and do some networking

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And you never know what you might find so that might be you know some some good to come out of all that so it's a great networking event

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But in the past couple years it does seem like big things have come out of it and there have been some big media things

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And I even remember one year in particular I think it was about two years ago one of those networks Spiker G4 actually covered a Sony press conference

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To talk all about the move and they had released quite a bit of details about the move at GDC

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And now this year kind of leading into GDC we're starting to hear little rumblings about you know SimCity 5 information is apparently leaked to the web and you know that is supposed to be happening

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's the Valve thing we'll talk about in a minute I'm sure is on everybody's mind but do you think there's going to be any whopper of news at GDC this year?

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:57,000
As far as announcements go I don't think so I mean maybe I don't know if Nintendo's gonna be showing any Wii U stuff I don't think Nintendo's there but it would be cool if they were

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They've shown little tidbits in the past like I want to say wasn't the Mario 3D game first revealed like the logo was first at GDC and it showed the raccoon tail like that that came out of last year's GDC

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I thought that was Tokyo Game Show

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then the whole something about a Pikmin game is what turned into Mario Sunshine or something my memory's a little fuzzy on that but I seem to remember something about the Pikmin series ended up becoming something else

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Maybe somebody in chat will remember but Nintendo has dropped little tidbits like that Miyamoto did a keynote one year I seem to recall

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean I hope there's some cool stuff that we'll see out of that there's just a lot of different events going on around the same time you know I mean I don't think we're gonna see a lot from Sony especially on the Vita

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because they have their own kind of event for that we're not gonna probably I would hope I would hope we'd see something on the Wii U because I mean yeah they're gonna show some stuff at E3 but like for developers they kind of have to say hey here's what we have because you're gonna have to make some games for this

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah you might see a little more about the Wii U controller but even that I think is a real stretch like I just from what I'm hearing is that the Wii U stuff is you know changing as is the next Xbox 360 or whatever it's called the lube or whatever the next system is is evolving

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And that's normal that's nothing unheard of you know all the systems change right up to the last minute so I don't see any sense in bringing out this big to do here's the system specs when that's what E3 is gonna be about

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah E3 you know Nintendo's got to bring it to this year's E3 and it's gonna be just a full on this is the Wii U this is the final prototype this these are the games that are coming out this holiday that is what you have to see from Nintendo at this year's E3

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have to so what's interesting to me though is that it would have been a good opportunity for them to do this whole last story reveal and all that stuff that kind of came out last week with their but they did their own thing so whatever

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
One other question I want to ask about Game Developers Conference you know what it really is more about is getting to sit in and hear from seasoned game designers about you know how they think about game design and so on

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like I know something that you might see like you would see through Nintendo would be talking about their new Nintendo network or whatever that they're gonna have the infrastructure for that

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's a great thought

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because it's more stuff that's gonna be catered towards okay here's what we can do for you for development we're gonna allow you to patch your games I know this new technology that's first available now on Nintendo

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know what if Nintendo is gonna be doing something with independent development perhaps like think something like Xbox indie games I know

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well to be fair I know we got one bit of bad news about indie games on the 3DS tonight but VVVVVV Cave Story you know there are some pretty good titles on the 3DS

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I understand that but I think that they'd be worried that someone's gonna trump them at their own game and to be honest yeah there's a lot of indie developers that could make another Mario game or another you know Zelda or something of that caliber

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And they wouldn't want it you know taking away the thunder of some of their own stuff

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well just piggybacking on your thought because I think it's a good thought if Nintendo is gonna do anything for the indie developers I think it's gonna come out at GDC I think there's no better time to announce something like that I think that's a great thought

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So we'll see

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I would like to see Microsoft do something with the indie games you know I mean it's there's a lot of games on there it'd be nice to promote stuff

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If there's gonna be an overhaul at all this would be the great time to do it

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Changes in Sony Home although they just really did a bunch of that so I don't think that could be it but that was the PlayStation Home was all revealed at GDC some time ago about three or four years ago

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not sure what else Sony you know maybe something we haven't thought of yet maybe something with the Vita maybe developing who knows

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let me ask this question though I was about to ask this and you jumped in

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:03,000
GDC is really about kind of hearing from the season developers and you know what they their methods of game design and so forth if you could go to GDC and listen to one developer talk who would you want to hear lecture at GDC

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Anybody? Dark Sakura? Loki? Who would you want to go to GDC and see?

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Kojima

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Kojima why is that just because he's a badass

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Pretty badass well honestly I'd like to get some of the classic you know developers there to lecture the new school on how the old school did it like you know Yuji Naka or Yu Suzuki you know

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Get the get the you know the the guys who pretty much revolutionized video games you know without them we wouldn't have any of this today so I think that's I would want to see the the old guard pass on the baton to the new guard with some good advice

165
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And not necessarily in terms of announcing anything new I want to see them say you know you need to remember all of this in mind and stop putting out crap that's pretty much it

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'd just like to see anybody talk about Grand Theft Auto 5 I don't care who it is just somebody show me some stuff and talk about it you know they could be like and here's we have footage wise go

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Black Wolf in our chat room says Tim Schafer you know especially with all that's going on with the Kickstarter and all that I'd love to hear well I guess I guess the people that paid for that are going to hear about that first we will hear about it at GDC

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You know who I wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe you wouldn't like to hear from David Jaffe

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let me talk about how important Twisted Metal is I don't care

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:47,000
My dream would be Sid Meier you know because I have made it no secret on the show I am a big fan of all things Civilization but it's not even just that like I think I would like to go to a Sid Meier panel where he talks about covert action really wasn't that bad of a game

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because it wasn't and even Sid Meier thinks covert action they tried to do too much old school PC game it was great I'm not going to get into specifics but that would be the panel I'd want to see covert action it wasn't that bad you did hear though that he's got some sort of input on the new XCOM game

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I didn't hear about that Hey we got this problem we need your help and so that's kind of cool Oh act deft brings up Mizuguchi that's a great one I am a whore for all things Q entertainment I'm unapologetically on the show

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Actually, Maya, one true love, Igarashi I knew it I was surprised you didn't say that for sure You know what would be cool is if we saw Harmonix there talking about something because they're cooking something up right now I don't really know what

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know GDC is not a media thing it's not really the time to announce your new games your new platforms not even platforms your new like integrated services your new services yes your new games not so much so alrighty Black Wolf in our chat room says I've seen a Sid Meier talk you know rub it in Black Wolf

175
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Bobby Black Wolf of course before us live at all games radio five o'clock Pacific is when he does his show we're on at six Sunday nights Black Wolf says Will Wright's talks are really really really spastic and all over the place Will Wright has like 500 PowerPoint slides for a one hour talk and I'm not exaggerating

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know I will say this, I was fortunate enough one year to see remember when Spore I remember that we got to go see Will Wright demoing it and was that Will Wright demoing it? I completely forgot that Oh yeah, we didn't see the one where it was Robin Williams demoing it I would have rather see the Robin Williams one I loved seeing Will Wright demo it I was like it was his it was his game

177
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and what happened to that game I mean seriously funny enough I think it's a lot of what I said about covert action a minute ago I also think Spore was not that bad but it just tried to do too much it tried to be 17 different games in one it just didn't didn't work out so well

178
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:05,000
but I loved watching them talk about it you know developers have such a passion for their games you know it's they can even like crappy games like I would watch the guys who made Fusion Frenzy on Xbox 360 or no Fusion Frenzy 2 excuse me the really bad one on 360 I'd watch them talk about their game because they'd be at least enthusiastic about it Barbie Horse Adventures. Heck yeah

179
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you know what what this was at a classic gaming Expo a few years back actually the one that we were all at I got to see a bunch of the Atari guys talking about developing for the how they were it was all vector based and everything and just listening to those guys reminisce and tease each other and talk about the little bits of code they were able to sneak in and like having hardly any room to sneak it in with and that was really cool and I like hearing about all the behind the scenes stuff

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:17:00,000
those guys were fucking rock stars because you have to remember some of those early games were one dude Yars revenge was Howard Scott Warshaw he also did ET but you know forgive him David Crane did some of the early I think he did like slot machine on Atari which you know and say what you will about it but it was an early game but then meeting the guys that did Robotron and you know and also and he's he's a man I've actually had a long conversation with a few times is

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:18,000
he did a lot of the Williams pinball tables was Steve Ritchie really nice guy he did a lot of the voices for no fear and Black Knight and listening to him talk about developing just the pinball tables about the physics that go into and everything I like hearing about that enthusiasm

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:37,000
you know maybe no one else is as into it as they are but it's but their enthusiasm is contagious somebody is if they have these pinball expos across the country yeah but I'm just saying go ahead is even if you're not as interested in it as they are they're still contagious their enthusiasm is contagious absolutely Loki

183
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:55,000
speaking of you know that I actually watched it was a translated video of the guys doing the urinal games at Sega and talking about them and how enthusiastic was and it's no it's seriously it's funny they have like I mean they have a good sense of humor about it

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:08,000
like yeah we know this is weird but you know hey we're developing so with that in mind I'd actually want to see the people like I'd want to hear from the guys they were developing these arcade games like the really weird arcade games in Japan like the ones read the flip the table over

185
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I want to see what the motivation for that I mean that's just amazing or like Tetris with a giant fucking controller I mean that that's just awesome it does sound awesome I like that table flipping game oh my god why won't the arcades here get that it's like it's a one joke pony but damn it's a good joke it's a joke that won't get old

186
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I man if only had the resources. Alright let's get into our gaming weeks we talked a lot about GDC which is great I want to talk about the video games we've been playing this week you know just talking to the crew a little bit before the show it sounds like we had a bit of a classic a little bit of a retro week but let's go around and see what folks have been playing Dark Sakura

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've been playing the shit out of Sonic CD. What'd I tell you? Heck yeah well okay I didn't really play the shit out of it I played like four full levels of Sonic CD. What brought on the Sonic CD urge? Um last night I was looking at Steam I was like holy shit it's on Steam bye and then Dan yelled at me today he's like why are you buying games we already have? That happens a lot on Steam. Oh yeah like he should talk I mean come on.

188
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What? Buying games that you guys already have. I'm actually trying to think about that. How many versions of Strider do you own? A Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Technically the only reason that we have another version of the first Strider is because it came with Strider 2. So that right there. We also have Strider on Genesis and we have the next Strider which is a different game.

189
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I apologize if I'm blending shows together I might have brought this up last week but I loved what you posted on Facebook you posted on Dan's wall and it was Strider NES. It wasn't that bad. I think we brought it up last week. Yeah it was a Capcom blog.

190
00:19:45,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Show us Blur together. Dan says it's a decent game I mean I've read some of the Strider Hiryu manga which is what that game is based off of. What I never realized about the Strider NES game is that damn there really is some assets they just ripped right off of Bionic Commando and DuckTales.

191
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Like you can see some of the assets right in that game it's amazing. What's Scrooge McDuck doing in there? How come Hiryu is using a cane to jump over little things on the moon? They should have had the moon music play in some of the levels just for fun.

192
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That would have been great. At any rate I told them flat out I wanted the Japanese soundtrack because someone did a version of Sonic CD basically using all sprite rips and everything and the Japanese soundtrack and it's like a brand new Sonic CD.

193
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll try to find it and put it on our tumblr but you can download the whole thing burn it and it will play on a Sega CD. But I mean that was Dan's point we've got it on the Sega CD why do we need to have this other one I don't care if it's got better music.

194
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Because it does have better music. Except for the intro and outro it's no lyrics. It's just instrumental. I was like BOO.

195
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But anyway I also played I actually was going to play Sebastian and then I was like no. I did find Blue Dragon.

196
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The girl changed her mind. The girl alt tabbed to a different game instead.

197
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I actually did play a lot of WoW but I sort of like.

198
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Addict.

199
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Dealer who's been on every time I've been on.

200
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Just because I was home sick one day this week alright.

201
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And then last night and we should run a dungeon. Yes we should.

202
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well we did.

203
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was fun.

204
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Anyway even though I hate Olde Man.

205
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Anyway.

206
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But I sort of like I had been hitting this kind of rut like where I would log on to an alt like check my box and then I'm like okay I'm done.

207
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Log. Shut up. My auction. My mailbox.

208
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And then I would log on to another one and go I'm done.

209
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And then log on to another one and go I'm done.

210
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And then just sit on my main chatting with people. Like I wasn't even playing I just used to be talking to people.

211
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And finally I got on the Drendon Gyaru.

212
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Who is going to be dressed like a hoe bag once she's 85.

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because she's a gal.

214
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And decided I actually really like Shadow Priest now.

215
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So I just been I kind of got my love for the game back instead of just you know chatting with people.

216
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And also a really good friend of mine I found out is on there. And so I've been chatting with her.

217
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Sometimes it does just take a change of scenery or a change of character.

218
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And this is you know true of any MMO.

219
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know I know our frame of reference as well but any MMO.

220
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Like you know things unfortunately were starting to get a little stale on the alliance side where I was playing.

221
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Because no one was ever on but you and maybe Jon.

222
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then we weren't raiding anymore so it's like well I'll go try this mage over here.

223
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And raid you know and it's kind of reinvigorated like oh now I have something to do in the game.

224
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well we actually have been invited for raiding with another guild now.

225
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
There's an open invitation.

226
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Oh nice.

227
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So if we actually want to do alliance raids we've got people.

228
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll play more offline.

229
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Alright.

230
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then I was I'm actually going to be on Tuesday night.

231
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Or actually Tuesday during the day before my yoga class I'm logging on to Star Trek Online.

232
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
To find my Scotsman.

233
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And I'm going to be having one day a week at Star Trek Online.

234
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because they miss me.

235
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's been a year and a half and they miss me.

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Does anybody yell out you know.

237
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
She can't handle anymore captain.

238
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It doesn't have the power.

239
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's funny they're all they're mostly architects.

240
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
When the football place the dome collapsed.

241
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They were all in team speak talking about it.

242
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Huh.

243
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like I bet it was cheaply made.

244
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I bet you know they should fire their architect and you know like they probably just did it that way because it's America and we build everything cheap.

245
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Nothing is built to last here geez.

246
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So that's coming up so I've actually been doing some stuff to get my game ready and they're starting episode five.

247
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think it's episode five yeah.

248
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A new episode's coming out I think in a week.

249
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So yeah I've been pretty excited about that.

250
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And they made a lot of changes to DS9.

251
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Like I mentioned it before but you can go in the captain's office and there's a lot of cool stuff in there.

252
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And then I played Luminous over here last week.

253
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I think I mentioned that.

254
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then just that's about it.

255
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
All right.

256
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But I've had a little bit more diverse in the gaming week.

257
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Good times.

258
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Loki how about you?

259
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
How was your gaming week?

260
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I didn't play hardly anything.

261
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Luminous I played that actually for at least a couple hours this week.

262
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Same game too.

263
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well one game was an hour.

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The one I still have paused right now.

265
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So I've been playing that.

266
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And I downloaded the demo for Reality Fires which I hear is really terrible but you know it's a demo.

267
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm free.

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't want to try it so hopefully I'll try that this week.

269
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Really I mean aside from playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto while working on mod stuff still.

270
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because I've been working on one since like a year ago and I want to get it done.

271
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So I don't have to work on it anymore.

272
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Call of Duty.

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

274
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I played that this week.

275
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Played it with my life because we had a bet going that if I lost a game between Wednesday and Friday.

276
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That I'd have to publicly apologize at our company meetings or party whatever you want to call it on the microphone to everybody.

277
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But fortunately I'm that good so I didn't have to.

278
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
All I apologize for at the end of the last...

279
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Did you get something out of it?

280
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
No all I did at the very end of it is I just apologize for them sucking so bad.

281
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah they're rubbing it.

282
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
No it's just fun.

283
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm just playing with them.

284
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I understand their frustration. It seems like I'm kind of...

285
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So humble.

286
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Crazy sometimes. Well I try to be fair.

287
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
They claim shenanigans but there's no such thing.

288
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That's about it.

289
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Alright my gaming week.

290
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I had an interesting gaming week.

291
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I didn't really play a lot of new new stuff.

292
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Maybe a little Final Fantasy 13 too.

293
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm continuing to play WoW as Star Saga mentioned earlier.

294
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But I went back and rediscovered some old stuff that I just skipped.

295
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And one of them you guys are seriously going to laugh at me.

296
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But you know what? We don't have time to play everything.

297
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
He's playing Barbie Pony Adventure.

298
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm not playing Barbie Pony Adventure. Shut up.

299
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But I am playing Uncharted.

300
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The first one from 2007.

301
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yes I finally started getting into the Uncharted series this week.

302
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Why?

303
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't know. I was bored.

304
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Alan had a copy of the game on the shelf.

305
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And I was like, you know what? I finally need to play Uncharted.

306
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Everybody seems to love this game. I'm going to play this game.

307
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Now granted I am fully aware that the series really takes off on Uncharted 2 and 3.

308
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But I can't play Uncharted 2 until I play Uncharted 1.

309
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So I played Uncharted 1.

310
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I like the storytelling a lot in it.

311
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Obviously this is the strength of the series I gather from people as a whole.

312
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The camera and controls kind of bug me a little bit.

313
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Like I really want to spin the camera ways it doesn't want to go sometimes.

314
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But other than those little quirks, which I think is the same complaint you probably heard about this game five years ago when it was new.

315
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But other than those little things I'm really into the story.

316
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I'm having fun with it.

317
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So I definitely want to play more of Uncharted and possibly beat it.

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We'll see depending on what a busy game playing schedule I do or don't have this month.

319
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The other game I've been playing a bit of, which is also at least three years old if not like four.

320
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I got ModNation Racers this week.

321
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm not talking the Vita one. I'm talking the PlayStation 3 one.

322
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I got ModNation Racers on PlayStation 3 for like $17 used.

323
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There's a great little local chain we have here called Dimple here in Sacramento.

324
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And they have all sorts of used games.

325
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Because they have Super Nintendo games, Dreamcast games, and Atari 2600 games.

326
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Which is awesome.

327
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The only unfortunate thing is that the Super Nintendo games.

328
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Because we have a Super Nintendo hooked up to our TV and it still works great.

329
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But the only games I tend to find are like old sports games.

330
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Are the only things I like very rarely.

331
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I did see Pilotwings today and I don't have a copy of Pilotwings.

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And I was really tempted.

333
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But then I saw ModNation Racers for $17 and I was like I've wanted this game for a while.

334
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't want to give you my full impressions on ModNation Racers because PlayStation Network has been down all day.

335
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And that's what I've been playing most of the day while Alan was doing another podcast in the computer room.

336
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So I haven't been able to connect online.

337
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So that's kind of the most essential part of the game.

338
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But with the offline mode I didn't realize I had all these silly little cut scenes and things.

339
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's definitely got heavy little big planet influence when it comes to exactly how you like customize your character and all that.

340
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But you know I have fun with it.

341
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
The controls are a little weird when driving.

342
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's a little different than Mario Kart.

343
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I expected it to be a total clone.

344
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But no they have like a button for drifting which is weird.

345
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I can't think of another racing game off the top of my head that's had like a specific button for drifting which is strange.

346
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But I'm into it.

347
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And I think the creation part will be fun later.

348
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So yeah there you go.

349
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So I've had kind of a renaissance week I guess if you want to call 2007 and 2009 or 10 whenever ModNation Racers came out.

350
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Renaissance.

351
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Renaissance.

352
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Which happened smack dab in the middle of Freddily.

353
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We're humans with day jobs. We sometimes miss big games.

354
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I want a day job.

355
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Somebody hire me.

356
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
But you've been doing a lot of volunteer stuff so.

357
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay.

358
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Keeping yourself busy.

359
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Alright let's move on to some quick housekeeping.

360
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I just want to quickly plug our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

361
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We're also on Google Plus at Orange Lounge Radio and also Twitter. OLR on Twitter.

362
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Keep in mind you can always find different places to interact with OLR in our community on our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

363
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Up in the upper right hand corner is a box called extended play.

364
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And you'll see logos for all big social networking sites.

365
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And it helps you find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners.

366
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And OLR listeners really are the best people because everybody in our little community really subscribes to the theory of don't be a dick when you're playing games online.

367
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So if you want to play with people who aren't assholes I really urge you to play with the OLR because it's a really great bunch of people.

368
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's steam community. There's you know Xbox threads and all that stuff.

369
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So find some OLR fans and play some games.

370
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Alright let's talk about the news.

371
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Loki's going to start us off with a whopper.

372
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah apparently there's a lot of rumors going around saying that Valve is working on a steam box gaming console.

373
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And that it's something that might be announced at GDC this week.

374
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Lots and lots and lots of rumors kind of regarding that.

375
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The first thing was that there was some sort of like coming from this website The Verge.

376
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Basically it's not necessarily going to be a console or it can be a console but it's also like a framework.

377
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So you know other companies if you will can manufacture something to those specs and it will be compatible with the console.

378
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because it's going to be like a PC.

379
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The hardware they're seeing right now is currently an Intel Core i7 with 8 gigs of RAM and an Nvidia GPU.

380
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I guess any devices that are built to those standards will run any PC title and will support any other digital distribution platform like EA's Origin service and stuff like that.

381
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So it sounds like it's almost like some sort of you know digital distribution box which makes sense because that's what Steam is.

382
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Also they're you know talking about that they had some sort of different controllers and stuff that they were working on.

383
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
One that kind of looks a little bit like I guess that MLG pad that they have from Mad Catz.

384
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The one with the swappable D-pads and analog sticks and stuff like that.

385
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So they're going to have some sort of framework or a controller that would allow you to do that.

386
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Where you'd be able to have okay I want an analog stick.

387
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay no I want a joystick you know like an arcade joystick or something like that instead.

388
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Or I want something else.

389
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So that's kind of neat.

390
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The other thing they're saying also that well actually there's some photos that maybe have leaked out of this as well.

391
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Coming from a Twitter account that was one of the Valve employees Greg Coomer apparently from back in November 2nd he's all built this tiny PC an i7 quad core 8 gigs of RAM and a Zotac Z68 motherboard with onboard Nvidia mobile graphics.

392
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Runs Portal 2 fast.

393
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Well isn't that convenient that all those specs happen in the match up with the rumors were.

394
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And you know it would be small enough almost looks like well it's a micro or mini ITX box.

395
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So you know it's like an Apple TV size with Wi-Fi and stuff like that.

396
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So I mean I could see something like that happening.

397
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
God can you imagine if that was like an Apple thing.

398
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Not necessarily oh Steam Box but it's Apple Steam Box or something like that.

399
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't know. I would think Apple would want to focus on something that ties into its own thing.

400
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You know for forever I would think that they would open up the game store to work on Apple TV and I think a lot of people have been wondering about that.

401
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Well we may get that announcement this week isn't there like some big iPad.

402
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah there's the iPad 3 but I don't see that.

403
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So yeah there's definitely some hints or whatever coming from that Twitter account that they're working on some sort of console device or something like that.

404
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So lots of rumored stuff right now and of course you have pictures of the controller.

405
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And you know this is coming from some patents that are out there.

406
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Video game controller having user swappable control components.

407
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So interesting that might be something like that.

408
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You know it's interesting that one of the first and I heard Bobby talk about this on his show too.

409
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I got to admit one of the first things that came to my mind when I read about this was the Phantom console.

410
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It was talked about E3 it was kind of a laughing stock but in some ways it wasn't all that different.

411
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The Phantom was a little PC box it was all digital distribution.

412
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The one thing though that really killed it and why people were like no thanks was that they wanted to charge a fee to just have the damn box.

413
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And then charge for the games on top of that and I definitely don't see a steam box doing that.

414
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But otherwise this concept isn't totally new.

415
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
This is going to be more like on live where they have their streaming box and the controller and stuff like that and then you use their service.

416
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think this could be something similar that I don't I don't know if it's going to be something that you're streaming content with.

417
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Although I could see them doing some sort of streaming service or whatever.

418
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But I think this is more of a digital distribution where you download it and this thing is powerful enough to run most games.

419
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
At least I would hope.

420
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I don't know with a mobile graph a mobile Nvidia chip I mean I guess it's possible.

421
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I mean hell I have a mobile you know Nvidia chip in my laptop and it can run most you know games and it's really hot doing so but it can do it.

422
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So and this is actually pretty old.

423
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Then at least the chip is the whole thing would just be very interesting because you're legitimately just selling somebody a PC that hooks up to their television which you know like I know a dark sacrifice house they already have one and I've seen a lot of and most PCs would hook up to a TV nowadays.

424
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Most of them have if it's got HDMI.

425
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah if it's got dedicated graphics card they always have HDMI out.

426
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's just all in the marketing most people don't think to do that.

427
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah you know and I'm like for real that's I mean what is this box giving us that a lot of laptops.

428
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But that's the thing though is with the specs though basically okay you need to have this much RAM this much processing power this kind of chip release this you know as low as this chip and then basically I can just download the software.

429
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh wait that's steam and I can play games.

430
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So yeah which I can play steam on my TV.

431
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, you know ready.

432
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:07,000
At first I just kind of looked at this like whatever I don't think this is as big of a deal as people make it out to be but then the more I thought about it I was thinking what if this is what they've been saving half life three for what if this is the way to get half life three.

433
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And that would be the huge what I mean my God they could sell an entire console at a one game if there's any game in the world that could push a console by itself it would be half life three.

434
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
All you have to do announce half life three is going to be the pack in game for this console or it's going to be exclusive window 90 day.

435
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This thing's going to sell like a mother.

436
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That has to put a keyboard and mouse attachments, because I mean seriously, it's a PC it's a PC any USB keyboard or USB slot you're set there.

437
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't, that would just be a very dick move.

438
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But the thing is so with the specs, I mean less they're making some actual proprietary boards or something like that which they could be but I don't think they are. I mean, you can't really you could almost like say okay give me the part list and I'll build on myself,

439
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
you know what I mean.

440
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Go to our channel and figure it out though, go to our chat room at chat that orange on twitter.com Tiger class as valve should totally make a special edition steam box shaped like the weighted companion cube.

441
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Talk about another way to sell a ton of homes, just make them cute.

442
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I mean come on that's going to be one of the first it's a case mod for a mic, a micro, you know, it x PC or something like that. You can seriously just most of the case mods out there are like the hell I put one in an Xbox.

443
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Although then I broke the motherboard, few weeks back but I had one in an Xbox at one point.

444
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
At depth in our chat room says be hazard on an HDTV is glorious.

445
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, a lot of games look really good on the TV just because you know it's it's got a different way of the way it's kind of projects the images than a monitor just you know a lot of games look really good, especially when it's a huge TV.

446
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Derek H takes a different position in our chat room saying no non PC gamer knows what half life is. It's no Mario hell, it ain't even Sonic. That's not true.

447
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I was, yeah, I was, are you thinking why I'm thinking the orange box. Yeah, orange box did have half life. I knew a lot of people who have only ever heard of half life.

448
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:30,000
When the orange box came out, I have to admit, I knew what half life was but I didn't play it till I played the orange box. So take that for what it is, but I think I do get the point of and I think this might more be the point.

449
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Why would people that are fans of a primarily PC franchise you know as much as half life was in the orange, orange box is still primarily a PC franchise. How, why, why would those people jump ship to buy a new console.

450
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Now here's the thing, I would buy a console or we probably get pick up multiple consoles, if they were cheap enough, you know if they were somehow getting some sort of discount on the parts and everything where they can manufacture it cheaper than I can build it myself.

451
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You know then that way, oh hey, I can buy PC versions of like Call of Duty or something like that on Steam and we can just play that instead of having to buy a console or whatever.

452
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And you know since there's really small form factor I mean that would be pretty awesome.

453
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You know and I will say again I'm just fueling fanboy fire by my suggestion at half life 3 but it's kind of you know if Valve was going to do what everybody else did it would make sense but we can just hope that Valve wouldn't do something like that.

454
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But no matter what it would sure make a sweet showcase game wouldn't it. If nothing else show off the power. Anyhow.

455
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I just don't see it happening. I mean I would love for them to prove me wrong and then I can just go see you know watch them flop.

456
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I mean yeah half life 3 would sell to the core half life fans but you know before long they try to figure out some way to get it to run on the PC.

457
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You know they try to find ways to, basically if it is going to be a PC they try to find some way of hacking it.

458
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I don't you know again my whole thing was just like maybe like a 90 day window but you know yeah if this thing is just a PC then you know that would be kind of it wouldn't work.

459
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But you know I'm just throwing out ideas and keep in mind.

460
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They already it took them. They you know PlayStation emulation happened on PCs.

461
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Anything that will run on a disk or in some digital format people have tried to emulate on a PC regardless so someone's going to figure it out.

462
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I think they would they might just realize that.

463
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
All right well who knows maybe we'll see something about it at E3 this year that would be the time to show off a new console.

464
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Speaking of E3 there's some rumors this week that the Wii U is going to have its price revealed at E3.

465
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I mean it has to have its price revealed at E3.

466
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But the rumors this week are exactly what that price is set to be.

467
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:58,000
An unnamed source you gotta love those guys disgruntled employee or something told the site Wii U daily that the Wii U will retail for $299.99 when it comes into North America after E3.

468
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I think that's just an educated guess.

469
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
$299 in the US, $299 in Europe, 20,000 yen in Japan.

470
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Nintendo has stated before that they're going to try to price it like it's the 360 of the PlayStation 3.

471
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I talked last week on the show about why it cannot be more than $450.

472
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I think $299 sounds a lot more reasonable for what Nintendo is trying to do here.

473
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And I'm kind of with you Loki this is not I could say an unnamed source told Orange Lounge Radio that and that would be a pretty darn good risk to take.

474
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I mean $299 is a really good educated guess.

475
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Because I mean Wii U daily no offense no one's really heard of you.

476
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You know if you get it correct then like oh hey look we said it first if you get it wrong no one's gonna remember that you said that.

477
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Well yes and we can tell you from first hand because this very show used to blow the lid on something and nobody knew who we were and we knew we were right.

478
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But by the time it was announced nobody cared you know so it happens.

479
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Crush 3D or Crush 3D is cancelled by the way.

480
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What?

481
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's a Sega game Crush 3D.

482
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
What the hell's that I don't even remember.

483
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's a 3DS game they just put demo out for they're not publishing it anymore.

484
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Wait wait wait where did that come from?

485
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Why would they put a demo out if it's been cancelled?

486
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That doesn't make any sense.

487
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Lots of demos come out for games that end up not happening.

488
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I guess but I don't know it just seems like the whole.

489
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well it's not now maybe later.

490
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It could possibly be that the demo was just a way to gauge interest.

491
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I guess they said they were gonna do that for Mega Man at one point.

492
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And the demo didn't even come out for that.

493
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's true.

494
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Wait I have a little more on the Wii U.

495
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
There may have already been some changes to the Wii U.

496
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
There's some diagrams that are circulating out there on the internet.

497
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The original design of the Wii U had like a raised analog stick.

498
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But apparently this new one has those more flat circle pads.

499
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I thought they always have the circle pads.

500
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Like you see on the DS or on the 3DS excuse me.

501
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
A NeoGAF forum poster did this.

502
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Which you know I gotta say NeoGAF there are a lot of industry types that hang out there.

503
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So they tend to be a little more on the right direction than maybe a website you never heard of with an unnamed source.

504
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Rumor is that Nintendo could have leaked it themselves to see how the community feels about it.

505
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Which isn't beyond the realm of possibility and that would be an excellent.

506
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
NeoGAF would be an excellent place to do it.

507
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And apparently two diagrams out there.

508
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It would make sense that we have two circle pads to coincide with the redesigned 3DS with two circle pads that will eventually be coming.

509
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I mean that's just like saying you know tomorrow is Monday.

510
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Um I don't really know how I feel about one or the other.

511
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I think I'm a slight I mean I don't hate the circle pads.

512
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But I think I'm a slight more fan of the analog sticks.

513
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Because you can grab the analog sticks too you don't just have to use them with your thumb.

514
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But sometimes for classic games I'll actually kind of pinch the stick and use it that way.

515
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And you can't do that with a circle pad.

516
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's harder to kind of I don't know there's like less resistance on this.

517
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's like going from an NES pad to the NES Max.

518
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I don't even remember I know what the NES Max is but boy oh boy.

519
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What about the NES Advantage?

520
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Advantage well that's a joystick.

521
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I know.

522
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So that's not so bad but the Max had that round slidey thing and ugh.

523
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yuck.

524
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So well there you go some rumors about the Wii U.

525
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That was only good for versions of Street Fighter.

526
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We will see at E3 I'm sure.

527
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So let's move on Dark Sakura.

528
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Some crap happened and then things happened in the end.

529
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
No I'm kidding.

530
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Um there is that Capcom Namco Sega 3DS game.

531
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Well they've got teasers out in the form of chromosomes.

532
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And they're specially colored chromosomes.

533
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And for people who don't know what chromosomes look like they look like weird disjointed X's.

534
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There's your biology lesson.

535
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
They hang from the ceilings in a lot of science classrooms.

536
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah they do.

537
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In my science classroom my teacher had like a model.

538
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
No we had pencils hanging from our ceilings.

539
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
She also collected Coke cans which is an interesting hobby.

540
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Weird.

541
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Not like Coca-Cola but all the different types like everything that had ever been discontinued.

542
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Like a crystal Pepsi can up on the wall.

543
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
She was an interesting character.

544
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
She also collected cocaine which is also weird.

545
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't want to slander anyone on this program but maybe.

546
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
My papa collected Alabama football Coke bottles.

547
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So he has Bear Bryant foot bottles.

548
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm sure people relatively know who Bear Bryant was.

549
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah I've heard of the old school bottle bottle collecting.

550
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Class bottle collecting.

551
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Anyway back to Namco Sega Capcom Die.

552
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So these are all colored specially and there's some speculation as to what these colors are indicating.

553
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Like one of them is from Namco maybe a Klonoa one it's blue and yellow.

554
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:03,000
From Capcom there is one that's definitely zero colored and the fact that it's red and gold with a little green and a little blue and a little white.

555
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Which definitely is the distribution on zeros colors.

556
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And a Bayonetta one for Sega one that's all mostly black and sexy.

557
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So could this be a weird as an ex become sexy.

558
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It's time.

559
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So it would be black and sexy.

560
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It doesn't matter what it is it's Bayonetta.

561
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Could this be some weird.

562
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I mean either now we're looking at weird ass fighting game Mario or Mario Smash Brothers type thing.

563
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's a breeding game or.

564
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Seriously it's like Pokemans.

565
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What about like a platformer type of thing.

566
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
No I think it's a breeding game.

567
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
A breeding game.

568
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Three companies got together to come up with a freaking breeding game.

569
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You can have like Bayonetta and Zero get it on and have Baya Zero.

570
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well Sega is in this.

571
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
No thank you.

572
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Perhaps we're going to race these characters derby style.

573
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's probably a fucking kart racer.

574
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't think so I don't think so.

575
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Honestly I kind of see like okay if you could have.

576
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Alright think in terms of Soul Calibur how you can make your own custom characters.

577
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If you could have you know pick the best bits of different you know stock characters for these companies.

578
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And then make your own fighting game character that you would upload and share on the internet.

579
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh god do not steal my ideas all of you companies.

580
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And we'll call it Mega Man universe and then we'll cancel it.

581
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
This is just an idea that just suddenly popped through my head that would be I thought would be cool.

582
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What if it's like somebody actually made a game out of Super Mario crossover but it's not Mario.

583
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What if it's a puzzle game.

584
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Bayonetta and Mario Brothers that'd be weird.

585
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's called Puzzle Zone.

586
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Not get Mario Brothers out of your head but the whole crossover like Bayonetta ends up in a Mega Man universe.

587
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
The only thing that here's the thing.

588
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It was Mega Man universe.

589
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Okay well here's the game.

590
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,000
There's only one game that kind of reminds me of this and once again the name escapes me but it was for the.

591
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I want to say the PlayStation 2 and it was a crossover game with I want to say Bandai and Hudson.

592
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So you had Barbie versus Solid Snake versus Bomberman versus you know Optimus Prime.

593
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I played that at some anime convention. I think that was like.

594
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
No I had.

595
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And keep in mind there's always been this Robot Tyson.

596
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The Robot Wars games that have you know multiple series worth of you know you have Evangelions versus Gundams.

597
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And this was a Japanese announcement.

598
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Right. So it could be something you know that's more what we'd see in that market versus what we see.

599
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
DNA Fighter.

600
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You know whatever.

601
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I don't know I just I feel like why another fighting game.

602
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
No it doesn't have to be a fighting game. Remember Namco Cross Capcom.

603
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Tactical strategy game.

604
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Right right right.

605
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That failed. Twice.

606
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So maybe they'll do that.

607
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Rama in our chat room says Peach and Daisy dress like Bayonetta.

608
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think I think that's how you pronounce that.

609
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's how you pronounce that.

610
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But Nintendo is not really involved.

611
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It is on.

612
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It is on the 3DS but it's not a Nintendo wasn't involved as one of the companies so I don't know.

613
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
It's probably just a fucking kart racer I'm going with that.

614
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
If not I like I like the idea of a Pokemon game starring Bayonetta.

615
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
All right let's move on.

616
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Gotta whip them all.

617
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Dream Mix TV World Fighters was the game I was thinking of.

618
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That game was kind of derpy.

619
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Orange Right said it in chat too. There it is.

620
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It was a Nintendo GameCube game.

621
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But I believe it was also PlayStation 2.

622
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There was one on the DS too.

623
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Twinbee in it.

624
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Twinbee is great.

625
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This is just fan wanks.

626
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Let's get to something else.

627
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
All right.

628
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So Sony is going to be announcing some new Vita stuff probably pretty soon.

629
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Actually this week.

630
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
March 9th they're going to be holding their own live streaming Vita reveal event.

631
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Kind of sounds like something Nintendo did last week.

632
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Or the week before last.

633
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
At some point.

634
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
On the day that the Vita came out.

635
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yes on the day the Vita came out.

636
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Nintendo doesn't have any games coming out on the 9th.

637
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh wait they have one.

638
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Wait. No they don't have anything.

639
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Just remind me because Mario Party 9 is coming out next week.

640
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
But yeah.

641
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Anyways so they're going to be announcing some stuff.

642
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's supposed to happen.

643
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I guess at 6am Eastern.

644
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So hope you're up early or like me I'm just going to wake up and read the news the next day.

645
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The 24 hour news sites will be all over this to see whoever can post it first.

646
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So you know it will be out by the time we roll out of bed.

647
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And translated and all that good stuff.

648
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Well I mean we know that there are a lot of games in the pipeline for Vita.

649
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Because when they announced it they were talking about all these freaking games.

650
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Like you know that was like 100 games.

651
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So you know maybe more information about Final Fantasy 10.

652
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Reimagining and some of these other things we've heard about it.

653
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah Metal Gear Solid HD Collection will be this summer.

654
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So that's kind of cool.

655
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They got like first party games coming out.

656
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Nothing for really April yet.

657
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But for May and June they've got that covered already.

658
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
First party titles.

659
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I guess because kind of in March they have a few first party titles coming out.

660
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Well I think we're going to hear through the summer.

661
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And then maybe a couple teasers for holiday.

662
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And then E3 is when they really blow the lid off of holiday games.

663
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So I think this conference is really about the summer.

664
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And I think it's really a way for Sony to reinforce.

665
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Hey we're not abandoning the Vita.

666
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We're going to have this constant stream of games.

667
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
LittleBigPlanet they haven't said a lot about and it's out really soon.

668
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It doesn't have an official street date yet.

669
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But right now it's hovering at the end of March, maybe April.

670
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So that would be a good April title because there's nothing in April right now.

671
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I think that's the game you're going to hear more about at this event for sure.

672
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
LittleBigPlanet, that's a must buy for sure.

673
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So they have a lot of stuff coming out.

674
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's just going to be exciting.

675
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Hopefully it's more exciting than Motorstar Marcy which looks like crap.

676
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
This might also be where they're going to unveil that they made the PlayStation games backwards compatible.

677
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Finally? Maybe? Question mark?

678
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You know, big feature announcement? Question mark? Possibly? Hopefully?

679
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
PlayStation 2? Okay now I'm pushing it.

680
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You never know though right?

681
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You never know.

682
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Alright well speaking of PlayStation 2, there's some games you're not going to be able to play much longer.

683
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Some Sony games.

684
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Some Sony games are having their servers closed on March 29th of this year.

685
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Sony Online Entertainment.

686
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I actually don't think all of these are PS2 games but I know EverQuest Online Adventures is closing.

687
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I totally forgot that this game was on the PlayStation 2 but it was kind of like a spinoff of the main EverQuest game.

688
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Well if you're a fan of this game you'll no longer be able to play it after March 29th, 2012.

689
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The other games that are going away, I honest to god have never heard of any of these.

690
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Cosmic Rift, Infantry, and Star Chamber the Harbinger Saga.

691
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I've heard of Cosmic Rift. I couldn't tell you what it is.

692
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's kind of...

693
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Well let me look.

694
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But uh, I've heard of it.

695
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah.

696
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I honestly thought that all the games on PlayStation 2 had their servers shut off a long time ago.

697
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Like you know when Amplitude went down and all the old sports games.

698
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Are you talking about there's still PS2 games coming out?

699
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Cosmic Rift is a two dimensional massively multiplayer video game designed by lead programmer Jeff Peterson.

700
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It is a science fiction universe.

701
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It is provided as part of the Station Pass through Sony Online Entertainment.

702
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
This is a Windows game.

703
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It was released open beta April 2001 and it's completely free to play as of June 26th, 2011.

704
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But now they're shutting it down.

705
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So it looks kind of like an old school shooter game.

706
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Like old school space shooter.

707
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But obviously these games must have had their fans to keep them going this long.

708
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So it's unfortunate they're probably shaking their fist right now.

709
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like why haven't you heard of my game?

710
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But unfortunately they're getting shut down now because it just wasn't enough to keep it profitable.

711
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
That's what happens.

712
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
That's got to suck when you buy an online game like that.

713
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Well my heart jumped a beat when I saw this headline because I was like,

714
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
fuck, are they going to shut off ModNation Racers a month after I bought it?

715
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Phew, it's okay, but it was all old stuff.

716
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Nothing on PlayStation 3.

717
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, I don't think they would dodge that bullet.

718
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Alright, let's move on.

719
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
We're coming up on release dates here after one more story from Dark Saga.

720
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Again? Okay.

721
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
How about some Minecraft news?

722
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Because I know we have like what, five people to play Minecraft?

723
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Anyway, Minecraft Pocket Edition.

724
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Minecraft Pocket Edition actually hit one million paid downloads on Android.

725
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And apparently it's doing pretty well on iOS.

726
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's the 26th position in the top paid app charts.

727
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So, not bad, huh?

728
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
There's a tweet that came out from Daniel Kaplan, who is the business developer behind it.

729
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It says Minecraft Pocket Edition has now sold more than one million copies.

730
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Thanks all the support, and I hope you will like the coming updates.

731
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So, good?

732
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Hooray for people who like Minecraft.

733
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
That's not bad for, you know, an Android title that, you know,

734
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
based on a port that I'm sure is better on the PC,

735
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
but it seems to be doing pretty well on mobile, so good for them.

736
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

737
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We'll start with the US.

738
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
This week we've got quite a few things coming out,

739
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
starting with a brand new Xbox 360 special edition Kinect bundle with Kinect Sports,

740
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and it's a white console with a white Kinect.

741
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's out this week, 300 bucks for that.

742
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And then, of course, Top Gun Hard Lock on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

743
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Also Showtime Plus, that includes the regular game as well.

756
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And the shark jumping, The Sims 3 Showtime, Katy Perry collector's edition,

757
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that's coming out on PC as well.

758
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The classic bitch game is this.

759
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Katy Perry what?

760
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
The Sims 3 Showtime expansion, Katy Perry collector's edition.

761
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I don't know what deal there is between EA and Katy Perry,

762
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
but there was that whole Simlish song she did.

763
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Which was cute.

764
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
She must be a closet Sims fan.

765
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
No, it's part of this. It's tying into this thing.

766
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I was getting exclusive stage and Katy Perry accessories.

767
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it.

768
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Katy Perry!

769
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Also I need to interject with some breaking news.

770
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
What?

771
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
IOS game for free right now.

772
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Doctor Who The Maze Is In Time is free on the IOS store.

773
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
More important news than Katy Perry.

774
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
For a limited time.

775
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Also this week, in case you want to save a little bit of money,

776
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
we have a 2K Sports 2-Pack NBA 2K12 and MLB 2K12,

777
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
which I think saves you 50 bucks.

778
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Each one of those games is still full price.

779
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Which is kind of interesting.

780
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And then last but not least, Mario Party 9.

781
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
One week today.

782
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
On the Wii, of course.

783
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
God damn, nine of them?

784
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Mario Party 9.

785
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I remember when the first game looked like it was Mario Party 3,

786
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
but it was just the horrible art on the box.

787
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But you know, Mario Party 9 is not technically the ninth Mario Party game,

788
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
because there was one on the DS as well.

789
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Wait a minute, who's making those games now? Isn't it Hudson?

790
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Hudson was making them before, and now who's making them?

791
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Uh...

792
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Nintendo's making them.

793
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I guess they brought it back.

794
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
All right, let's look at Japan.

795
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Japan's got a busy week too on the Xbox 360.

796
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Alan Wake gets a price reduction.

797
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Platinum Collection.

798
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So does Dance Evolution, which we have as dance masters here.

799
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Doo-Dahm Pachi Resurrection gets a price reduction,

800
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
as does Dream Club Zero.

801
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And of course, a big release over there for Japan.

802
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Street Fighter X Tekken in a regular and collector's package.

803
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Two other games coming out this week.

804
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I have to admit, I got really excited,

805
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
because my eyes blended these two titles together for a minute.

806
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
There's Birds of Steel and Blades of Time.

807
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And I read that as Blades of Steel.

808
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
But they are two separate games.

809
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Birds of Steel is kind of your Konami's answer to Ace Combat,

810
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
because those old school flight simulator things are pretty popular in Japan.

811
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Blades of Time is a little more of a God of War, Bayonetta-esque action-y.

812
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It is the unofficial sequel to X-Blades, if you remember that one.

813
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Is it? Oh, okay.

814
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Actually, that is supposed to be coming out this week as well.

815
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I forgot, that's on PS3 and 360.

816
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, so here in the US as well?

817
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yes.

818
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Very cool.

819
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Birds of... wait, no, Blades of Time.

820
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Because I said Blades of Steel.

821
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I guess he used it too.

822
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's confusing, I know.

823
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It is.

824
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay, so Birds of Steel, that's coming out later this month.

825
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It would be funny if it was like a, you know,

826
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's pigeons playing hockey or something like that.

827
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Konami, you need to bring back your hockey classic.

828
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't think they can.

829
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I think that, you know, people have rights to hockey now.

830
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Well, can't you put out just like what they did with Tecmo Bowl,

831
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
where they just make up teaming players or something?

832
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Or make birds play hockey and call it Birds of Steel.

833
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Alright, look.

834
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We got to go to the PlayStation 3 and talk about what they're getting.

835
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Birds of Steel and Blades of Time are there as well.

836
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Mobile Suit Gundam UC comes out in the Japanese and Asian regions.

837
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And Street Fighter X Tekken gets its release on PlayStation 3 as well.

838
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Also, Nobunaga no Yabu Online, Ho no Shou comes out this week.

839
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
This must be another Nobunaga Online game.

840
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I thought they already had one, so I don't know if this is an expansion or what,

841
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
but you know these Nobunaga games are crazy over there.

842
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It is not the Nobunaga Pokemon game because this is not a Nintendo system.

843
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
This is Sony PlayStation 3.

844
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Coming out on the PlayStation Vita this week, Unit 13 in Japan.

845
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Girls RPG, Cinderella Life.

846
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That is for real the name of it.

847
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.

848
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
That will be kind of a big deal I think.

849
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And lastly Hatsune Miku and Future Stars Project Mirai comes out this week

850
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
in regular and accessory sets.

851
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
How about the UK?

852
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Some stuff, actually there's a number of things.

853
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
On the 6th we have Unit 13 for the Vita.

854
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
On the 7th we have I Am Alive.

855
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Trine 2 and Twisted Metal and Velocity.

856
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
On the 8th is Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.

857
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And then on the 9th is Azura's Wrath, Mass Effect 3, and Street Fighter X Tekken.

858
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
The end.

859
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
All right.

860
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Real quick I want to mention this going to our chat room.

861
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Rama dropped a tip about Mario Party 9.

862
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I guess the folks that are actually developing it is ND Cube.

863
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Nintendo might be publishing it because ND Cube is a Nintendo subsidiary.

864
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
They made in the past, they did some GameCube and Game Boy Advance games.

865
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
F-Zero, Maximum Velocity was one of the games that they did.

866
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And Wii Party I guess was their game too.

867
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You remember Wii Party?

868
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So this minigame collection thing is right up their alley.

869
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So there you go.

870
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Wii Party.

871
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Party.

872
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Let's move on with a few more stories and then our classic game of the week.

873
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Loki?

874
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Hopefully it doesn't, well I know it's going to do a lot better than Wii Party.

875
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about patent trolls.

876
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yes, there was another patent troll that came after Nintendo suing them over the Wii Fit game and Balance Board.

877
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I remember even seeing it was the XR Station.

878
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It was just this big lever thing that people squeeze.

879
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It was actually showed I guess in 2008 as it was called Squeeze.

880
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
S-Q-W-E-E-Z-E.

881
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And like a Wii remote peripheral or something like that.

882
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's weird.

883
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But as you can imagine, they lost.

884
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So hooray!

885
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I think that's like three trolls down and millions more to go.

886
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Didn't some other patent troll pop up this week with about like they own the patent on Facebook games or something like that?

887
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know.

888
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Or the whole like there's a picture of Doom and then it's all give us 99 cents for more ammunition was the way the artwork looked.

889
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And it's basically like every Facebook game ever would have to pay money.

890
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
If this came to...

891
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah, it's pretty dumb.

892
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
So how long before patent reform here in the US ever?

893
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Well you would think that that would be really quick but unfortunately it's been like this for years so I don't see any sort of change.

894
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
With Apple getting bigger and bigger and bigger and turning into the behemoth Skynet that it's turning into.

895
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Maybe they'll be able to get something pushed through.

896
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Don't put it past them.

897
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Honestly, as bad as I'd hate to see a company controlling the government, if it's for some positive that would be kind of nice.

898
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Do you really want to finish this train of thought?

899
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Just saying.

900
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Think about what you're really saying.

901
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
If a corporation controlled the US, it might not be so bad if...

902
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
If it was positive.

903
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Remember, corporations are people. Remember.

904
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm not gonna go there.

905
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Did you want to finish your thought?

906
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I already finished my thought.

907
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I said if they did it for the positive, now if they said, you know, fuck you we own the patent system now bitches, then that's a little different.

908
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Alright, well somebody that got told fuck you this week was the makers of The Binding of Isaac.

909
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
This is a popular indie title that is already out there on PC.

910
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It's very Zelda inspired, and so it would have felt right at home on the 3DS, but apparently those talks have broken down.

911
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Binding of Isaac is from Team Meat, of course the folks behind Super Meat Boy.

912
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And after a long internal debate, according to Twitter, Nintendo has decided not to allow The Binding of Isaac on the 3DS.

913
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
They're saying it's because of, quote, questionable religious content.

914
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Now Bobby, the guy before us here at All Games Radio, he wanted me to bring this up on the show.

915
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
He even said it at the end of his show.

916
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Is it more questionable religious content or questionable resemblance to Legend of Zelda content?

917
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I don't know. I mean you gotta...

918
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I don't know if that... I mean I haven't really played The Binding of Isaac extensively.

919
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I've listened to the soundtrack though, oddly enough, but I haven't played the game.

920
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
VVVVV's got a lot in common with Metroid, so I don't know, but...

921
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Interesting.

922
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I guess part of the story is that it's a child running away after God tells the child's mother to sacrifice him.

923
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Or a God-like voice, I should say. Not like THE God, you know, but a God-like voice.

924
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So maybe some of that questionable sacrifice and things is a little much.

925
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
If he read the Bible, he'd know Isaac got away.

926
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Stop.

927
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I know.

928
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So, uh, yeah.

929
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And now, some further stuff that developed this week is that I want to read somewhere that, I don't know if this is fanboy wank, so...

930
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Take this with a grain of salt, but Team Meat's already in talks with Sony.

931
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Which would be the likely alternative. Go to the Vita.

932
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Why not? 3D Dot Game Heroes was awfully a lot like a certain Nintendo classic, and it ended up on the PlayStation 3, so...

933
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Why not?

934
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
The thing too, they were saying, you know, they're basically that maybe it's because it was M-rated or something like that,

935
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
but there's a lot of M-rated content already on there, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D thing.

936
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And here's what my problem with it is, is that if it is M-rated, oh, you know, it's gonna hurt our fans.

937
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
We don't want the little kids playing a game like this, then...

938
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You know, you did build parental controls into your system.

939
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You know people could use those.

940
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I mean, if you're not going to allow all sorts of content on your, you know, shop online,

941
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
then what's the point in having all these content filters if you're going to filter it before it even gets out there?

942
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It does seem like an interesting reason, but something to take with a grain of salt.

943
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Remember that reason is coming from Team Meat, it's not coming from Nintendo.

944
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Once again, once again, though, this is kind of like a whole thing alluding to even the new console.

945
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
There's so much, even with the Wii, it was like, well, maybe not so much with the Wii,

946
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
but like, they were like, okay, listen, we want to shed this, you know, kiddie game company thing.

947
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:42,000
We want to shed that kind of perception of us, and we really want to, you know, bring the hardcore gamer back into, you know, everything with our consoles.

948
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And then, sure enough, when the Wii came out, let's put out kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.

949
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Oh, and we'll put out another game that might appeal to everybody.

950
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Eh, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games.

951
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And then, you know, with this new console, hey, we're making a hardcore console that's going to, you know, support all types of games,

952
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and it's going to be, you know, it's really going to get the hardcore user back behind it.

953
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And then it's going to be kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games, kiddie games in HD.

954
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But, yeah, you may have, you know, Assassin's Creed or something like that, because it can run it now.

955
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Let me bring up this, because Bobby's really kind of stressing his point here in the chat room about this,

956
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and shares a screenshot, and I totally get it, because he's sharing the screenshot, and it looks like the fucking Legend of Zelda.

957
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I mean, the way, on down to the little mini-map with the rectangular rooms in the upper left-hand corner,

958
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
little spaces for the A and B buttons, and your life meter, I mean, the design of the screen,

959
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and even the look of the dungeons, everything is the freaking Legend of Zelda.

960
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Now, maybe it's not so much the questionable religious content, but it's, I think it might be a combination.

961
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's questionable religious content that sure looks a lot like Zelda, and we don't want people thinking Nintendo did this.

962
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Now, who made the statement, though, about why it's not on the shop?

963
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yeah, see, that's the thing, is I would think if it's Nintendo, and they're saying, you know, this looks a little too much like the Legend of Zelda,

964
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
you know, that might look a little weird, you know, because Team Meat would go,

965
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
yeah, we couldn't get on the server because it looks a little too much like the Legend of Zelda, and people are like,

966
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
yeah, I can kind of see that, but when they do the religious content, they're trying to throw some pressure towards...

967
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Well, yeah, I really think it's, yeah, I think it's one of those things where maybe it was a combination, you know.

968
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It's not the fact alone that it looked and felt like Zelda that made Nintendo uncomfortable.

969
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's just that they're worried that people are going to misinterpret it as a Zelda remake,

970
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
because people are that silly sometimes. Not everybody listens to podcasts.

971
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You were going to say they were stupid.

972
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Well, and people would think it's a Zelda game with all this questionable mom sacrifices the child.

973
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
What the hell kind of game is this?

974
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I do agree people are stupid. This is how we get Katy Perry collector's editions of The Sims.

975
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
This is true.

976
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
What about a Katy Perry Legend of Zelda? Would that be offensive?

977
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It wouldn't happen.

978
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yes, it would be offensive to everybody. Everybody.

979
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:04,000
See, Rob, the only other person that I know who does those what-ifs about things that never happen is my friend's four-year-old.

980
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
What if this was a racetrack? Then we would be racing.

981
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But what if we were racing? We're not racing.

982
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah, the layout is Zelda-ish, but there's enough difference.

983
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This screenshot that Bobby shared in the bottom right-hand corner, it says,

984
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
All stats up. Well, Legend of Zelda didn't have stats.

985
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,000
On top of that, if Nintendo was really going to be pushy about that, they could have gone after Newtopia back in the day,

986
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
which was almost exactly like A Link to the Past.

987
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But this game is just down to the design of the freaking screen. At least Newtopia kind of looked a little different.

988
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Team Meat should be ashamed of themselves for blatantly ripping off The Legend of Zelda.

989
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
No, they shouldn't.

990
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Why? I mean, let's play devil's advocate here.

991
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
If we're giving so much shit to Zynga for ripping off Tiny Tower, then why can't we give them shit for ripping off The Legend of Zelda?

992
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
They're not ripping it down to a T, though. Again, the original Zelda didn't have stats.

993
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:19,000
It did, but they weren't actually visible stats, because obviously, why would I pick up different armor or different swords if they all had the same stats?

994
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I see blood in this game. Did Zelda have blood? Don't think it did.

995
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It had sparkles, and sparkles meant violence. And smoke. There was smoke? Where's there smoke? There's fire.

996
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Alright, you're right. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Alright.

997
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Let's go back to a time when gaming was a lot simpler.

998
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
We didn't have quite the ripoffs that we have now. Actually, we totally did have ripoff games back in the day.

999
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Probably more so.

1000
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Probably right. But hey, Dark Soccer's gonna pick a game that wasn't really a ripoff. It was a goddamn pioneer. Maybe a little bit of a ripoff.

1001
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But let's see, Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1002
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Sorry, sorry to interrupt real quick.

1003
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But you do it so well.

1004
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I know. Real quick question on the Dark Soccer. You were talking about that one game that came out that was very similar to Link to the Past or whatever.

1005
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Did that have the Nintendo seal of approval? Because that's basically approving the fact that they like games that look like that.

1006
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It didn't come out on the NES.

1007
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It should still have the seal of approval.

1008
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It was a TurboGrafx game. It was Nootopia and Nootopia 2.

1009
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But they didn't push for any kind of copyright infringement or anything like that. Because even though it looked almost identical, it was a different game.

1010
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Alright, fair enough.

1011
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Can we talk about the other classics now?

1012
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yes, Sonic CD.

1013
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh, Sonic CD it is. So much for that music.

1014
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Well, we already played a bunch of it while Loki was talking.

1015
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
So, okay, I have to start from the beginning. The Japanese version had better music.

1016
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Okay, Rob, if you would do me a favor. Because I'm going to get into the rest of this later, but I'd like for this to stay on.

1017
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Play the US music first, if you don't mind.

1018
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I just want to say the YouTube here is really quiet.

1019
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah, it is. I'm sorry.

1020
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Let's see if the English one is any louder.

1021
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It is.

1022
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Okay.

1023
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Okay, now listen to this everybody.

1024
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
This is the first level in the bad future.

1025
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Skip just a little bit ahead.

1026
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Do you see that? It has that kind of dark jungle-y sound.

1027
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
This sounds like one of those bands, the pan flute bands that play at the strip mall.

1028
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That play at downtown Disney.

1029
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Now play the Japanese one.

1030
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Alright, play the Japanese one. Here you go.

1031
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah.

1032
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Maybe quite a bit more lively.

1033
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
This is more like the rave that's happening in House of Blues.

1034
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Okay.

1035
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So yeah, the game is Sonic CD.

1036
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Well, I should say Sonic the Hedgehog CD that came out in 1993.

1037
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And it was developed by Sonic Team for the Mega CD slash Sega CD.

1038
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And it was the first appearance of Metal Sonic and Amy Rose.

1039
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It came out in Japan on September 23, 1993.

1040
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
In Europe in October 1993.

1041
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
In North America on November 19, 1993.

1042
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
It came out on the PC in 1996.

1043
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And was included in the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005 for PS2 and GameCube.

1044
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
There was an enhanced version that was just recently released in December 2001.

1045
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, iOS, and Android.

1046
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And then we have a PC version that came out January 19, 2012.

1047
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
There is supposed to be a Windows Phone version coming out first quarter 2012.

1048
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Just thought I would mention that too.

1049
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So basically, for anyone who's played a Sonic game, this is a freakin' Sonic game.

1050
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
He has the spin dash.

1051
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You collect the rings. You go underwater, which are the underwater levels.

1052
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You had the invincibility shield. You had the speed shoes.

1053
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The music ran out. Should I play some other tracks here?

1054
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Yeah, play some other.

1055
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Let's do Palm Tree Panic Zone. That sounds like fun.

1056
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That's actually the present version of that same level.

1057
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Which they did a remixed version of this one slower for the American one.

1058
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So anyway.

1059
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So yeah, you also have with the spin dash, you have the super peel out that lets you zoom into quick speed from a standing point.

1060
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Either rolling or in running position.

1061
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And it's faster than the spin dash, but it leaves Sonic more vulnerable.

1062
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And then each of the levels has three acts. You have two main levels and a boss act.

1063
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And one thing I have to say is that the boss levels are actually pretty neat.

1064
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Because it's kind of a departure from the way that the normal boss levels went.

1065
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Like one of the ones that I did right before I left was one where you chase Eggman or Robotnik for people who are sticklers for the American version.

1066
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You chase Eggman all the way through the level until you've got him busted.

1067
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So it's pretty cool.

1068
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
The big thing that makes this one different is that you've got a sort of time travel aspect where you go into the past and the future.

1069
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And basically when you hit a past or future sign, you have to run really fast and these sparkles travel behind you.

1070
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It looks like Sonic is farting glitter.

1071
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And then you end up in the past or the future.

1072
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Now if you go into the future by default, then you go into a bad future.

1073
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Where it's basically over industrialized and everything is dead and decaying and awful.

1074
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You go into the past, it's like, for example, I always forget the name of it.

1075
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Like something Chaos Collision I think it is.

1076
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But I always refer to it as pretty much the casino night.

1077
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Because it's like every Sonic game that has a pinball theme in there.

1078
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And it's not the freaking chemical zone, thank god.

1079
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:04,000
But anyway, instead of it being all pinball-y and nighttime casino looking, it's like this neat looking pristine jungle thing.

1080
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It's really cool looking.

1081
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
But if you've managed to do a lot of good things and destroy things in the past, then when you go to the future again,

1082
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
instead of going back to the modern, you have to basically go through the past and destroy a robot generator that's hidden in the level.

1083
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So that when you go back in the regular time and then you go to the future again, you're sort of in this technogion future.

1084
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Where everything is technology and nature all working together, synergy, you know, it's just...

1085
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
What kind of hippie stuff is this?

1086
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Yeah, it's clean energy and everything is cool.

1087
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
We're sustainable. That's the big key word, sustainable today.

1088
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So basically, in the past when you destroy the robot generator, then that actually kills all the robots in the future.

1089
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
So when you have to go after Robotnik for his level, because his level is always in a bad future,

1090
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
you actually go after him in a good future where he's weaker and you don't have all of the bad guys in your way.

1091
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's really unique.

1092
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So also if you have more than 50 rings, by the end of the act a big gold ring appears and if you jump onto it,

1093
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
then you have to go around and destroy these purple UFOs that are floating around the level.

1094
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And it's kind of that sort of Mario Kart looking, like old school Mario Kart looking pathway where it's all the pixelated mode 70 looking stuff.

1095
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And you can slow down by going through water, you can get speed ups through there,

1096
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
you can destroy blue UFOs that give you more time or you can get speed shoes and different things.

1097
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:58,000
But if you destroy all of the purple UFOs, then you get a time stone and you can get the good ending if you collect all seven time stones.

1098
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Basically, it's this game's version of Chaos Emeralds.

1099
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:11,000
So basically though, you automatically get that good future if you have all the time stones.

1100
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You also have a backup save using either the internal memory on the Sega CD or RAM cartridge.

1101
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And it will save at the end of every third act. What I can tell you too, is that it saves automatically the same way on the Steam version.

1102
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You see the little now saving icon at the bottom, that's cool.

1103
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And it does have an instant game over scenario, so Sonic will just jump off the screen if you leave the game alone for three minutes without it being paused.

1104
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Now for the newer version, you can actually play as Tails, or I should say Miles Tails Prower.

1105
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And he has a spin dash, the spin attack, and he can fly with his little tail rotating, but he doesn't have the super peel out and you cannot earn achievements with him.

1106
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You can also use the spin dash physics from Sonic 2, so that's pretty cool.

1107
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:19,000
So basically, the way that this goes is that Sonic and Amy, Amy Rose, show up at Never Lake where the little planet, not the little big planet, just the little planet,

1108
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
shows up, you know, the last month of every year, so it's the month of the time, basically.

1109
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And they basically find out that Eggman's taking it over and things are getting crappy, and then Metal Sonic kidnaps Amy!

1110
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Oh no, so Sonic has to go get the time zones, the time stones, and the seven jewels that alter time and save Amy and destroy Sonic and free the little planet.

1111
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So yeah, this game, actually, Yuji Naka moved to the US to found the Sega Technical Institute and worked with Sonic Team to make Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

1112
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But in Japan, a separate development team that was headed by Oshima Naoto, who was the creator of Sonic, worked on Sonic CD, and they were supposed to be the same game,

1113
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
just a Sega CD version and a cartridge version, but this really turned into something different.

1114
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And for anime buffs out there, the opening animated sequence was done by Toei.

1115
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Now, as I said from the very, very beginning, it had two soundtracks.

1116
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:38,000
There was the Japanese and European soundtrack, which is the same one, and it had Sonic You Can Do Anything, which is the name of it.

1117
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It was also the Toot Toot Sonic Warrior, which we don't mention in Play Company.

1118
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And Cosmic Eternity, Believe in Yourself. And the boss music also sampled the song Work That Sucker to Death by 70s artists Xavier, Pootsie Collins, and George Clinton.

1119
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So basically, Parliament.

1120
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Nice.

1121
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yeah. So, now the US one was actually redone completely by Spencer Nelson, who did a bunch of Sega Saturn soundtracks.

1122
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And then there was that Sonic Boom song that was redone.

1123
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:24,000
So yeah, I really think, I mean, I'm not saying that the American soundtrack was bad by any means.

1124
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's not. It was really good. But in comparison to the Japanese soundtrack, there's no comparison.

1125
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The Japanese soundtrack was way amazing.

1126
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So there actually, as far as that Sonic You Can Do Anything and the Cosmic Eternity, Believe in Yourself,

1127
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the reason why we have an instrumental version is the lyrics belong to K.C. Rankin, who died in 2009.

1128
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So the rights haven't been released by the estate.

1129
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,000
There is a 20th anniversary soundtrack that came out in Japan that actually has a version of Sonic Boom on it,

1130
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
including a remastered Japanese track.

1131
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So as I said, there were other ports. We had a PC version in 1996, which was the debut Sonic title under Sega PC's brand.

1132
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It came out in Japan on August 9th, 1996, in North America on August 26th, 1996, and in Europe October 3rd, 1996.

1133
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And it has a full animated intro and ending sequence, not just that really clipped looking one that came on the Sega CD,

1134
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
because it could handle the heavy animations like that, as we've all known for anyone of us who had ever owned a copy of Dragon's Lair.

1135
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Just saying, Dragon's Lair, not all that great.

1136
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
It was also re-released with the Sonic Gems Collection on the GameCube and PS2 in 2005,

1137
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and it's the PC version with improved frame rate and action speed.

1138
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And it did have some emulation errors, though.

1139
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And the European version actually of that one used the US soundtrack, but had higher quality versions of it.

1140
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And then, as I said, we've got the Xbox Live Arcade version that was playable at PAX Prime 2011,

1141
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and we've got the versions on PSN, PC, iOS, Windows Phone coming out, and there's Android.

1142
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And then the port was actually re-developed by Scratch using this retro engine.

1143
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
So that's why it's so nice and smooth.

1144
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And now we have it on Steam.

1145
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And it's excellent on Steam, and it's only $4 you owe it to yourself to buy this.

1146
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Commercial, commercial, commercial.

1147
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Okay, I'm running out of soundtrack songs here, so wrap up.

1148
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Okay, well, done.

1149
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Well, that was quick.

1150
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Alright, there it is.

1151
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Actually, just telling you, the Sonic CD story was what became the Sonic the Comic,

1152
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and the story was adapted into the Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog comic book.

1153
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic CD!

1154
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Confession, I've never played it.

1155
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I know.

1156
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
There's a lot of Sonic games out there, and I never owned a Sega system,

1157
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
so I had to kind of play them all at friends' houses, or in retrospect.

1158
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob.

1159
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
What do you want?

1160
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I want to watch you buy it.

1161
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm poor.

1162
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I'm poor!

1163
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Maybe later.

1164
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'll tell you what, when I beat Uncharted and Modulation Racers, I'll buy it.

1165
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Good lord.

1166
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Alright, I've got to beat something.

1167
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I've got something you could beat.

1168
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Oh, shut up.

1169
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,900
All right, we're gonna take a break and when we come back we got plenty more of Orange L'Antrido to come a new segment

1170
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:41,600
Here on the show get excited some news about Street Fighter cross Tekken. I don't think you're gonna like I know Loki doesn't like it

1171
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,840
Maybe a mailbag segment at views of the week, and I apologize in advance

1172
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:52,660
Yes, we are somehow gonna bring up Justin Bieber and related to video games. I am so

1173
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:59,580
So sorry, but you you really have to hear this story. Don't don't disconnect. There's a reason just trust me the Justin Bieber

1174
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,020
singing

1175
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:06,880
Singing a toothbrush is compatible with Xbox Live Arcade. It is not shush. Don't make stuff up all right

1176
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,940
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange L'Antrido stay tuned

1177
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,040
Welcome back everybody to Orange L'Antrido. We are live taping the

1178
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,260
448th episode of our show on March 4th

1179
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:29,620
2012 here at all games radio is where we're always live every Sunday night

1180
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,860
We hope you will join us for a live show sometime and join us in our chat room

1181
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:36,480
we do talk live with our chatters at chat dot orange lounge radio calm and

1182
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:42,580
Sometimes we'll field questions from chat for example. We have somebody in chat right now. That's evil or e3 ville

1183
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:49,500
E3 vl wants to know anyone know if the Vita trophies are separate from PlayStation 3 or is it all cumulative?

1184
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:56,220
It's interesting because it looks like they are cumulative because when you look at your trophies on the vita you see everything

1185
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:00,020
But when you look at them in the PlayStation 3 you don't see the vita games

1186
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:04,300
I don't know if that's what today's maintenance was there to correct, but I I have to imagine

1187
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,980
There's going to be a forthcoming patch. That's going to

1188
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,860
Link the two to bet together a little better

1189
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:13,900
But for right now you do see it all in the vita and they all pump into that same

1190
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:21,020
Trophy level or whatever and percentage and all that which man after you go through those first few trophy levels it takes forever

1191
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:26,340
To gain up levels and I look at those people that are I'm like level six or seven which maybe I shouldn't admit

1192
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:29,460
I'm that low a level, but I look at some people online. They're like level 13

1193
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:33,740
I'm like damn you play a lot of PlayStation alright, so I'm

1194
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:37,620
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news, but first I want to bring up a couple quick things

1195
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:43,460
One I have to follow up to this interesting Twitter discussion that I caught wind of earlier this week

1196
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:50,420
between a listener of ours at Orange Lounge radio and a guy at another podcast and a lot of you

1197
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:56,420
I know are very familiar with the website cheapassgamer and the guy behind the website chibidi who um yeah

1198
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:59,420
I'm I got to admit. I don't have time to listen to every podcast

1199
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:05,500
I'm sorry, so I don't really listen to the show, but I've seen the website. It's a great concept great idea

1200
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:10,420
I'm sure he's done very well for himself off of that. He's a fan of Saints Row 3

1201
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:15,220
I know that and so I we're in good company. I think with that we were big fans of Saints Row 3 too

1202
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:19,540
But I guess what I was gonna say actually I should get that on steam now that it's half price

1203
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:24,060
I think that's the sale boy. You're like a walking commercial tonight young lady. I can't help it

1204
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:28,540
I love steam you are a consumer whore so that console on your way to your house already

1205
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:33,420
So so here's the reason why I bring it up because I guess something was said on the last show about

1206
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:40,120
What's the oldest podcast and they were wondering if it's seven years it might be them. I think I didn't hear it again

1207
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,420
I'm just picking up on what I got for Twitter, so if I miss appropriated that quote

1208
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:48,900
I totally apologize in advance, but one of our listeners jumped in and actually tweeted him and said

1209
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:50,540
actually

1210
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,540
Orange launch radio has been doing this for ten years

1211
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,380
And I just thought that was really awesome that one of our listeners kind of like jumped in there

1212
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,780
Henderson man so big thank you to that

1213
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:04,540
And you know that's why I'm always very careful about jumping it. You know dude made an honest mistake

1214
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,980
It's no big deal whatever

1215
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:11,900
But that's why I'm always very nervous about staking that claim of we are the longest running show on the internet because I'm always worried

1216
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,180
Like what the hell else is out there that I don't know that it exists because like for real

1217
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:20,300
I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys although. We have a great partnership with all games radio

1218
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:25,660
We're here at all games calm. I had no fucking idea that there was ever this whole like game

1219
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:29,540
I did not know what all games interactive was before we hooked up with the show

1220
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:33,700
I did not know this whole pseudo stuff and everything that Scott Rubin had before g4

1221
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,700
I didn't know any of that stuff before we joined forces with them

1222
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:41,980
So that's why I'm always a little nervous like I think we're the longest-running live show about video games

1223
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:45,780
But we're one of where we asked what was the protect one of the?

1224
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:52,220
That's our little protection because we don't know what else really we're the most important stop it stop it all right

1225
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,780
But it's all right. You just have to know that we are the official podcast of the planet Earth

1226
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:00,060
That's right that claim we staked a long time ago, and I'm sorry buddy. It's ours

1227
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,700
So yeah, I just you know you can lease it for a quarter um

1228
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,220
um

1229
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,060
Just to clear the air on a few things though

1230
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:10,760
Just so we set the record straight the very first orange launch radio live show all about

1231
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:18,460
DDR and music based games and community and you know talking shit at the restaurant after a long night of playing DDR was June 23rd

1232
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,980
2002 at live through 65 where we used to have a station and

1233
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:26,740
We released our first podcast January 3rd of 2005

1234
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:31,500
It was a separate show at the time called the orange launch radio to go edition because for a while

1235
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,940
We were here in studio for about four and a half hours

1236
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:39,460
We would do our live three-hour music game community show and then we do our hey guys

1237
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:43,220
It's only going to be 20 minutes show on other games

1238
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:46,660
Bullshit that grew into an hour

1239
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:53,460
I mean just the the talk about other games really took over and that is why in 2006 we merged the two shows and

1240
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:59,120
Because you know the music game stuff was not you know we didn't have enough community things to talk about everything was getting very

1241
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,360
very

1242
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:04,720
Centralized with people playing at home and so forth so that all started

1243
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,360
I think we married him in

1244
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,400
2006 or so I think it was about a year of the to-go show and then we married him in

1245
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,360
2006 I would like to think that this is their bastard stepchild

1246
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,520
When we did that it was so much fun

1247
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,360
Yes, it was so much fun, and then you shot yourself in the foot now SSG 100 Matt says yeah

1248
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,600
But olr has to be the first live podcast to use Skype you use Skype when it was in beta form

1249
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:31,360
I do think we do. Oh, I do think we have that claim. I really do

1250
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,800
I don't think I cuz I was looking around the internet at that time

1251
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,280
So I don't think anybody else was using Skype in a radio format to take calls at the time

1252
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:44,000
But again, I'm nervous to stake that claim cuz I don't know what else is out there. Okay. We are the first proven

1253
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,080
We are

1254
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:51,120
Documented so if somebody else can provide their documentation that they did it before us

1255
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,100
We'll happily relinquish the title but to be fair. I mean it's not a title

1256
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:02,300
We really use you know relinquish more like share, but we we really are the the podcast of the universe all right you guys

1257
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,640
Apparently what was supposed to be a humble thing turned into not so much

1258
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,000
But look guys we don't

1259
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,880
There's a reason we don't want to just like whore ourselves as we're the longest running video game podcast nanny nanny poo poo cuz you know

1260
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,960
Everybody that's doing this pocket it

1261
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:24,940
Having done it this long we can tell you firsthand. It's not that easy it takes a lot of dedication

1262
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,960
So you know what seven years is a fucking great accomplishment?

1263
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:33,680
So props to you know and in the service that the cheapass gamershow provides to the community is is amazing

1264
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,000
And you know lots of people really rely on that website

1265
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,860
You know to drive their game sales so props to their great idea that's taken off and has held for the past seven years

1266
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,120
I know there's a lot of shows that have been running for a very long time

1267
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,600
There's a lot of shows on this network

1268
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:51,940
I know dead pixel lives got something like 600 episodes under their belt because they were daily for a while video game outsiders

1269
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,880
I know it's been around for at least six years Bobby's been doing this for six years

1270
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,440
Plus gamer tag radio has been around since podcasting was first around even though. They're not on the network

1271
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:07,040
They're another show that comes to mind. I know there's a lot of folks that have been doing this a

1272
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:11,440
Long time and I know many of you don't make any money off of it

1273
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:17,320
So you know what props to all of you power to the indie podcasters you guys are on people make some money

1274
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,840
Some people make a little bit. I bet she BD makes a little bit of money

1275
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,080
I mean he did he did buy his way into the Saints Row the third

1276
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:26,740
But you know you know what hey if I had that kind of money. I would have been sniped at what?

1277
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,400
You know what he had a great idea. He did the website

1278
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,840
Prop what what could be more American than that even though he lives in Japan my problem is my wife would not let me

1279
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,840
Spend that kind of money on that if I hadn't met my wife. I would be in Saints Row the third

1280
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:49,440
And then they have a mini a mini mat that is true, and I still am in Saints Row the third

1281
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,360
Thanks to their awesome

1282
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,020
I don't want to discuss this too much longer because this feels very self-serving, but let me address a couple of the comments in chat

1283
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:01,040
Technus in chat says so you guys were around during the days when I still listen to Adam Curry's podcast to find more podcast to listen

1284
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:06,840
To yes, and in fact we were nominated or we won the best gaming podcast for at the first podcast awards

1285
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,080
Jamie went I shook his hand

1286
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:14,320
And he she and right behind his hair and his butt actually his butt was by my head for a while

1287
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,840
You're weird. I was sick

1288
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,040
Okay, I'm at this thing sick as sick can be in

1289
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:29,720
La so I'm even sicker because la aired you know disagrees with me. I turn around and I see this black clad ass

1290
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:36,600
Look up see the the the shaggy. You know Bon Jovi haircut, and oh, it's Adam curry

1291
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,040
I remember watching it on a TV um let's see

1292
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,100
Randy says what were podcast called before podcast. I don't think they really had a name it was audio via RSS

1293
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,400
But I've I know they tried to do

1294
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:55,440
Blogcasts like for a long time major Nelson would not call a show a podcast or there was a zoom cast you know cuz you know

1295
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,440
Xbox Microsoft didn't want to give in to the Apple thing

1296
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,620
Let's see

1297
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,880
SSJ 100 Matt says it's the humble indie podcast bundle segment

1298
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,220
I love that idea they should do something like that the humble indie podcast bundle

1299
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,400
Raised $30,000 for charity. I love that idea

1300
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,520
And s J 100 Matt says I remember getting the show off podcast alley

1301
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:23,360
You know podcast alley still exists go vote for orange lounge radio to go which is still listed in podcast alley

1302
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,360
We need your votes Lord

1303
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,320
All right, I didn't smell his farts acidic vampire

1304
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:34,840
It shatters are weird all right, but I was I was so sick and after we got the award. I'm like I'm leaving

1305
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,880
I feel so sick all right um look. I I want to say

1306
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,680
quickly I

1307
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,640
Just realized I left shows out of my how long video

1308
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,920
I think if there is a show that's been around as long as we have its video game news radio

1309
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,980
For real like I know they were on life just five for a while, too

1310
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:56,160
I don't know when exactly they started so they may be able to make the claim, but they've also

1311
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:00,640
They went non-video game for a while, and then kind of went back

1312
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:05,580
But they're it's so funny because we couldn't have more different of makeup of shows

1313
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:08,720
They're they're also on all games Network. You can hear them. I think they're Monday nights

1314
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:14,120
But I respect them a lot. I know they work very hard at what they do and you know it takes a lot to

1315
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,340
Focus on the show every week, and they they bring it so well

1316
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:22,000
Speaking though of our ten of her Sri mm-hmm coming up

1317
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,640
I would like to repeat what I said last week that I want people to email the mailbag

1318
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:34,160
Under the title olr memories because I am working on something to commemorate our to our ten of her Sri

1319
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:40,440
Alright, I want your favorite. Olr memory, and yes if you use really crappy grammar

1320
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,960
I am going to edit it

1321
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:46,960
And I'm going to send you a copy so that you know what I did so I can make sure that your intent was clear

1322
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:53,160
Okay, I have because nothing that I put in print is gonna have bad grammar. I don't want to do too much of this reflection

1323
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,780
This is the last comment on it, and then I'm done s to 100 Matt

1324
01:37:55,780 --> 01:38:00,000
So I was not sick from smelling his butt he did not say that s to 100 Matt says I

1325
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:05,920
Remember when you guys went to the award show and where they didn't announce your nomination, and you guys yelled at them in the back

1326
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:12,440
If there was speakers that day if there is any moment that better defines our legacy

1327
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:18,640
I mean for real that is the moment that defined orange lounge radio, and I'll tell you exactly what it was

1328
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,000
It was a life 365 best of life 365 awards

1329
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,600
I want to say 2004 so when we went to that Airport hotel out by SFO

1330
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:31,100
And we were sitting in the back had the big atrium and we were nominated for station of the year

1331
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:36,680
Which was amazing, but they're reading the nominees for station of the year and the station of the year nominees are Rockland

1332
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,640
USA and you know all these other stations

1333
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:43,240
And then she starts to open the envelope and when you hear the audio recording of it, and I wish to God

1334
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,480
I still had that clip you can hear in the background Loki going hey

1335
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,440
Hey

1336
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:55,400
And she goes oh, yeah, yeah, and and orange launch radio, and we're all sat there going well

1337
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,480
We know we didn't fucking win drink. I

1338
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,160
Was quite table

1339
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:05,800
But that wasn't we had that was when they did like the bingo thing and I won speakers you did so it wasn't so we

1340
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,360
May not have walked out of there with a plastic award, but we didn't walk out of there with speakers

1341
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,560
You walked out of there speakers. I didn't get shit. I got some cool pictures out on the patio

1342
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,400
That's what I got we got a bunch of sampler CDs all right. Let's move on

1343
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,160
I have one other topic. I want to talk about before rapid-fire news is a game

1344
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,160
I left out of my gaming week, but it's worth mentioning

1345
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,480
iPhone game believe it or not and I think it's a pretty damn good iPhone game

1346
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:34,000
It's 99 cents right now on the marketplace, which is a really good deal for the Midway arcade classics collection, and yes

1347
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,320
It's another one of those retro game collections on the iPhone, and I've got to say though

1348
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,440
They do a pretty damn good job of it especially for 99 cents

1349
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:43,800
It does a little bit of the you know hey

1350
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:48,120
Do you want to play gauntlet and gauntlet 2 well then you pay 99 cents for this pack?

1351
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:54,940
But actually you can also unlock those machines if you play the others for a god-awful long time

1352
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,920
You save up tickets and you can unlock the cabinets that way or you just pay 99 cents to unlock them right away

1353
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,880
Which is kind of interesting they did it that way?

1354
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:07,480
but what I really thought was interesting about it is that there's not just the classic arcade games in it, but there's I

1355
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,120
air hockey and

1356
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,240
ski ball and

1357
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:19,280
The basketball little games you find in an arcade like they really went kind of a step beyond in making it that whole arcade

1358
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:24,620
Experience now don't get too excited. It's an ios game, and I still cannot stand

1359
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,000
Ios controls like trying to emulate the old-school arcade games

1360
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,600
But some of them that have the limited mobility work pretty well like in joust you could only go left or right

1361
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,980
That's pretty hard to screw up with the touch controls, so it controls all right spy hunter

1362
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,560
They do this weird thing with the tilt controls

1363
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:44,860
I'm not sure if I'm a fan, but you know it is what it is 99 cents, but I was thinking

1364
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,160
My god this collection would be great on a system that has tangible controls like oh

1365
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,200
I don't know the 3ds the vita

1366
01:40:54,200 --> 01:41:00,100
But I'm thinking with this title ever come out for just 99 cents on the vita. No hell. No I

1367
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,040
Mean what's up with that?

1368
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:08,160
Why is it the games are only bargain cheap on ios is this really competition because they that?

1369
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:12,320
That they allow them to price their games the way they they are

1370
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,120
These other platforms have minimums, okay?

1371
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:20,960
You can't price your game lower than such and because of that that's why I don't get a lot of 99

1372
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,920
Well, that's why I don't get any 99 cent games on these marketplaces if it was more open and allowed them to do that kind

1373
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,560
Of thing then yeah, you would have a lot more of those

1374
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,600
I still even think for like $4.99 on the 3ds shop this would be a hell of a download

1375
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:37,120
With all the stuff that it includes, but I just I don't see it happening

1376
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:41,620
And it's so odd like this game would be so much better with the tangible controls

1377
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:46,600
But like they'll probably put it on a cartridge for $19.99 if they even if they even do that

1378
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:51,500
You know I don't know they'll say the 3d costs money. It's old arcade games. I don't know again

1379
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:56,160
I'm hypothesizing, but I just I really wish when I play some of these really good ios games

1380
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,460
I'm always like damn it

1381
01:41:57,460 --> 01:42:01,980
Why can't this be on the vita or the vita would be amazing really with that crisp screen?

1382
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,660
And it's already kind of the oh man

1383
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:08,300
It would look great some of those games, but I'm not going to get I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it

1384
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,300
Ain't going to happen

1385
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:15,500
But I just imagine imagine I could tilt my vita sideways and use the analog stick to control spy hunter

1386
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,860
It would be great

1387
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:20,020
Yeah, but I'm not going to hold my breath because I know it's not going to happen

1388
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:25,420
I'm sorry. I was distracted by everyone telling me that capcom should hire me

1389
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,860
Way to derail all right I

1390
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:36,260
Had years of derailment. I have I have a promise though if capcom hires me

1391
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:43,280
I will make manuals that are available for print and PDF web friendly PDF. They have working links

1392
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,800
Just for Bobby and it'll be spelled right it will be spelled right all right there you go all right

1393
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:55,080
Let's talk about some rapid-fire news. I've babbled long enough about various side topics, so let's get to some rapid-fire news all right

1394
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,480
Let's uh let's talk a little bit about

1395
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:03,680
Ridge Racer Ridge Racer a game that was supposed to be launching with the vita

1396
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:08,200
Kind of didn't it got delayed a little bit, and I had hoped hey

1397
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:15,400
Maybe they'll put out a full game instead of three cars and five track or five cars of three tracks

1398
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:24,720
Not so much anyways Ridge Racer is coming to the vita March 19th. There will be some DLC free DLC included with

1399
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,200
I guess if you pot or purchase the initial

1400
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:33,620
This is great the initial retail copies will include the Ridge Racer gold pass

1401
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:39,820
which allows you to get five additional cars and three bonus tracks and two new songs and

1402
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,500
an extended remix of an existing song

1403
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:45,700
and

1404
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:53,060
Apparently also, I guess you can purchase the game on the PlayStation Network store for you know the 10% cheaper

1405
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:58,340
$24.99 as well, and it also includes the gold pass stuff, then I guess

1406
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,180
if

1407
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:07,060
You purchase before April 30th an additional silver pass DLC pack will be available as well

1408
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:11,460
They haven't announced the price for yet also aside from DLC

1409
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:18,220
they're gonna have I guess a system update which include or includes better frame rate better graphics and

1410
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,860
You know that's about it, but I

1411
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:27,220
Come on really really your free DLC is

1412
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:32,900
Three more or five more cars. You're literally doubling the cars and tracks in the game and

1413
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:37,540
You were and that would be a pretty awesome deal in any air racing game

1414
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:41,300
Ten cars and six tracks. I mean come on

1415
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:48,580
I remember back with Ridge Racer 4 where it was fucking like 200 cars in the goddamn game and tracks

1416
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:54,020
I don't even know I mean a lot of them were just deep you know deviations of one another, but I mean come on

1417
01:44:54,020 --> 01:45:01,420
That few tracks for if you were putting the game out for free all right fine. You know that's fine

1418
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:05,140
That's a good starter pack, and I'll buy DLC for it and get some additional cars, but

1419
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,100
$30

1420
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:12,820
It's ridiculous, and I'm not impressed with Namco's approach to this stuff, and it's again. It's the whole

1421
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:18,620
IOS it's taking the IOS mentality now and putting it on the Vita, and it's just weird I

1422
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:24,280
Don't I hope people educate themselves before that I mean you got to be a big fucking Ridge Racer fan to want to buy this

1423
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:32,220
Well, here's something to educate yourselves on just wait for the price to drop because if it's something like this people are gonna bring

1424
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:32,900
in new copies

1425
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,860
And they're not gonna sell and they're gonna be sitting on shelves and it'll drop in price

1426
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:41,100
And then you get that DLC on top of it comment from Derek H in our chat room

1427
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,540
So they're admitting the graphics are crapped in the first version

1428
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:49,140
And that is kind of a weird thing for them to say this yeah fans that they're crisper graphics

1429
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:53,420
Yeah, it's kind of one of those things. They should have kept a secret until it comes out. You know

1430
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:59,060
Yeah, well, maybe it's some depth of field adjustments or something like that, but

1431
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:02,640
Ahamkara in our chat room says Ridge failure

1432
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:09,740
It might I I can't say that until I've played the game, but let's just say I'm shaking my add magic eight ball

1433
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:14,780
This is outlook. Not good. Let's just put this way the reviews for the Japanese word have been too great

1434
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,020
I think a lot of it's because there's

1435
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:20,020
You know three tracks and five cars

1436
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,940
three tracks and five cars

1437
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,880
Seriously, yeah, it's unfortunate now

1438
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:31,820
Here's where I would give them a pass on those cars and stuff if they were tweakable like you can tweak all the different

1439
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:36,340
You know aspects to it cuz a lot of those cars are just like it's been slightly faster. This was

1440
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:41,820
It's slightly better at turning or whatever so they're not you don't really need all of them, but

1441
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:49,540
You know I don't think that's the case in this. I think it's just like hey. We're just gonna sell a bunch of DLC cha-ching

1442
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,620
That's

1443
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:57,780
Not gonna happen. Oh and of course are they gonna advertise to their fans that you know this game is gonna

1444
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:03,180
Be that gimp of course not it's up for the blogs to let people know about that all right anyways enough of that

1445
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:05,260
So let's talk a little bit about a rumored

1446
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:10,020
a sequel to a franchise army of four has apparently been outed by

1447
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,780
a

1448
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,140
Twitter post actually apparently

1449
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,700
There is a guy who was I believe

1450
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:26,320
One of the actors on Stargate a lot or Stargate Atlantis John Shepard

1451
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,740
He or Joe Flanagan he plays a guy named John Shepard on Stargate Atlantis and

1452
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:37,500
apparently he's been asked to do some I guess voice work on the

1453
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:44,940
Well, this is a o4 video game for our electric Tronic Arts. Well. It's gonna be army of four. I mean, that's

1454
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:48,620
It only makes sense that that's what it's gonna be so

1455
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:52,120
Kind of neat. It's maybe something we'll see

1456
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,740
announced at e3 and

1457
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:02,220
Last but not least there's there was tons and tons and tons of leaks before finally it being officially announced Assassin's Creed 3

1458
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,220
will be coming to

1459
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:11,060
Consoles and PC this October on the 30th the new game is gonna take place during the American Revolution

1460
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:19,420
you're gonna play a guy who looks to be Native American and of course having tomahawks and all sorts of cool stuff and

1461
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,900
I

1462
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:25,260
Guess there's gonna be some more info coming in the new game informer

1463
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:28,580
It's the April cover April cover game

1464
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:33,900
But uh definitely a big franchise. Yeah, I was hearing a lot of rumblings about that

1465
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:39,660
Um seems like some of the Assassin's Creed fans aren't really I mean, I don't that's not like uncharted. It's a series

1466
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,540
I haven't really had time to play

1467
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:46,340
But about five years after the first game. I'll finally get around to it. It seems like a lot of fans

1468
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:50,980
I know on Facebook are kind of cautious about the direction this game is taking I mean some people are like yeah

1469
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:55,900
I knew it would be like a Revolutionary War type of game and some are like I'm not sure how I feel about this direction

1470
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,820
So

1471
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:01,660
We'll see. All right. We'll see I guess at the end of the day. How good is the game?

1472
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:06,940
That's the important thing, right? Yep. He could be in space as long as the game that's in screen is

1473
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,460
That's spoiler spoiler

1474
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:18,340
Assassin's in for face. All right, some other quick news for you guys here connect enabled shopping carts

1475
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:25,700
Okay, so like apparently there's this whole Microsoft thing where there's a prototype of a shopping cart

1476
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:30,080
That has connect in it. It's a monitor a motor and a Kinect sensor

1477
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:34,100
Apparently the cart can see your membership card. It will pull up your shopping list

1478
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:40,240
It will scan objects as you place them in the cart and I guess the cart will actually follow you around the store

1479
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:45,100
So like while you're walking it will follow you. This is fucking sky. I have to go to the bathroom

1480
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:54,140
Not gonna not get to fit in the stall stop bringing it to me damn it

1481
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:03,740
The old homeless ladies just watching it walk right out of the store with them. I can't wait to like

1482
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:06,260
Alright ready run away

1483
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:13,020
Hunter be hunted. I guess there's even a video on it, but it's I can't watch it. It's gonna be too hilarious

1484
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:20,540
I think they mentioned Whole Foods, which that does seem to be that is a very I like to smell my own farts kind of thing

1485
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:29,200
My farts are organic and smell what well right right along those lines actually

1486
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:32,780
Apparently in the video it talks about the the spokesperson

1487
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:38,660
Puts the wrong type of spaghetti in the cart and the cart warrants him. You're trying to go gluten-free

1488
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,100
Remember your pansy

1489
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:52,460
You know I do have friends who have celiac disease yeah, and it's a serious

1490
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:56,060
I know I know okay, but I don't think I gotta be real some people do it to be trendy

1491
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:02,100
I think yeah to be honest a guy that's walking around with a connect and able shopping carts probably doing to be trendy

1492
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:08,020
It will not bag your groceries however, but there you go. I actually do remember today

1493
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:12,900
I will say this I will remember a day when they did have the shopping carts used to have these at Rayleigh's Bel Air some time

1494
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,100
ago

1495
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:14,140
They had the little um

1496
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:20,380
Little screens on them that as you're walking through the store the screen would know what aisle you're in and it would like update to

1497
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:22,260
Show you the specials that were in the aisle

1498
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:25,380
And you could actually look up items like it was kind of ahead of its time cool

1499
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:31,700
Doesn't look ridiculous like having a Kinect camera strapped to a shopping cart where it's following you around the store. Oh come on

1500
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:38,780
This is that's the setup for like a really bad 3d horror movie like which by the way piranha 3dd

1501
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:43,160
Oh my fucking god. That looks amazing, but this could be like a great

1502
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:49,240
Shopping cart 3d horror movie like the day the shopping carts took over with Christopher Lloyd

1503
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:52,460
And all I gotta say is hobos are gonna. Go high-tech now

1504
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:56,740
It's like the homeless it's like fuck I got Kinect

1505
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:03,940
And a TV all right Kid Icarus uprising of course a big game coming out on the 3ds soon your copy will come with six

1506
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:09,780
AR cards, but here's the thing there's actually gonna be hundreds of AR cards available

1507
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:16,620
There will be events where you can kind of trade and get new cards and this whole thing so an interesting kind of real-life

1508
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,400
card Pokemon

1509
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:22,140
Yu-Gi-Oh magic type of I have judgment

1510
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:26,420
Oh, I'm sorry what I don't know

1511
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:30,260
I mean, let's see what it adds to the game or if it's just something stupid

1512
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:36,580
But apparently the cards can oh god the cards can face each other and the AR figures will battle

1513
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:44,820
Where the fuck did I hear this before where did we razz this a million times so familiar the cards?

1514
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:49,820
Come to life, and they do the battle and they cameras

1515
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:55,660
That you can't just do with the cards on the table. I'm sorry. I'm just judging this right now with my eyes

1516
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:00,740
I'm judging it right now. I'm gonna keep my eye on this

1517
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:04,980
I think well there is actually a little Cyclops looking thing if you need an extra eye

1518
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,240
But it's not brown it's not brown that's red

1519
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,900
It's for the record

1520
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:16,780
SSJ 100 Matt says he's still waiting for supermarket sweep the game for you know

1521
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:21,420
I have I have a bad feeling that that Kid Icarus game is just gonna tank

1522
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:24,780
Gonna tank so bad

1523
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:31,060
Because you know why cuz no one gives a damn about Kid Icarus you shut your mouth now

1524
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:36,660
Hey, hey, you know I know that the hardcore gamer cares about Kid Icarus, but that's not who they're targeting

1525
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:40,380
I mean Kid Icarus is basically their dress for a new generation

1526
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:43,260
You know it's it's fucking oh

1527
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,020
I don't know

1528
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:49,100
It's a hardcore shmup game and no one's gonna. Give a damn

1529
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:52,980
Did could you imagine the Kid Icarus bullet hell game since we now know their?

1530
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:57,280
Similarities would you care to make a wager on if Kid Icarus will sell a million copies no

1531
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,280
I do not care to wager that

1532
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:02,740
Damn, I try because that doesn't have any additional peripherals

1533
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:07,180
And I'm not gonna bet whether the cards are gonna sell million copies because there's no way to track that so

1534
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,380
I'm still buying it

1535
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:14,060
I got it look. There's a little bit of a I mean and here's the thing too

1536
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:18,060
Why would I go buy cards when I can simply?

1537
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:22,860
Download the images of guards and print them out for free so fuck you

1538
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:28,540
I ain't buying no fucking cards for your stupid game and also not your game because

1539
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,660
Rare one in a glass case of the Nintendo World Store

1540
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:36,820
And it's the only place where you can get the eggplant wizard if only we had a camera with us

1541
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:41,140
If only some sort of device that I was carrying had a camera on it

1542
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:45,940
Well, maybe a phone or an mp3 player or perhaps or my station

1543
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:52,140
But perhaps a game console a portable game console only one of those had a camera on it, but goddamn it

1544
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:58,620
I live in an age where cameras are only available in camera form and not in any other peripheral whatsoever

1545
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,620
I see DDR dollar bill liked my idea

1546
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:03,500
All right, I gotta read this comment

1547
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:13,220
It's on the last story, but it's too good act deaf in our chat room says chopping cart grocery shopping will never be the same as

1548
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:18,980
Have you seen the piranha 3dd trailer hey come on it's piranha

1549
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:24,700
3 double D. Have you have you seen it? I have seen it. Okay. I'm just dark soccer

1550
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:29,500
Have you seen it do I care I'm derailing the fucking show. I don't even care no no

1551
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:35,020
I can't have to see that I can't remember I have temporary amnesia the most amazing fucking movie trailer

1552
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,380
I have ever seen in my entire life, and it is worth derailing

1553
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:39,980
It is the only movie. I give a crap about is the Avengers

1554
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:46,020
Because Hawkeye here. It is 3dd official truck. I movie looks fucking amazing and yet oh

1555
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:50,260
They should make a video game out of it there. I've tied it back to the show

1556
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:59,180
In the world's wildest water park the party a water card hotter water

1557
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:02,740
You did not replace our old life cards with strippers water-certified strippers

1558
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:10,820
But the guests have never been hungrier

1559
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,820
Oh

1560
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,660
We think they're back

1561
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:26,740
Is that Christopher Lloyd fuck yes, it's Christopher Lloyd, okay, I have to see this now

1562
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:33,980
Fish become confused and try to enter man-made great sisters

1563
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:41,460
Shh how the mighty have fallen whatever it is. I don't like it

1564
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:47,540
Oh ladies and gentlemen the most famous lifeguard

1565
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,420
Just when you thought it was safe

1566
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,540
To put your 3d glasses back on

1567
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:11,180
I'm not first of all. I'm not a lifeguard never was

1568
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,980
Secondly that is what natural selection is all about

1569
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:17,940
It's double the okay. That's great

1570
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:23,860
The terror

1571
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:28,100
Double the DS

1572
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,380
Bring me my legs

1573
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:35,620
Oh, that's right with shotgun legs

1574
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:41,940
Yeah, that's that's right, that's why that trailer

1575
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:55,460
I don't even like gory movies, and I'll see that just cuz it looks so horribly stupid

1576
01:57:55,460 --> 01:58:01,740
Oh bring me money. I'm sorry you Christopher Lloyd can't even redeem that to me, so

1577
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:04,740
Orange launch radio road trip

1578
01:58:05,740 --> 01:58:10,860
Avengers Hawkeye, I hope that opens up against Avengers. I'll camp out 48 hours in advance for that

1579
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,880
I'm not hating on Avengers. I swear just you know

1580
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:20,960
Alright, it's just got a root. You got a root for the underdog. I mean seriously under fish

1581
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:25,920
Ving Rhames, I mean I remember when Rose McGowan had the shotgun leg, but Ving Rhames

1582
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,480
I think is a much sexier, babe with that shotgun leg. I'm just saying get me my legs

1583
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:35,480
All right back to rapid-fire news

1584
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:42,620
Bioshock infinite has a release date. Hey, it's October 16th

1585
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,040
In North America and 19th internationally

1586
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:50,640
I know a lot of you Bioshock fans are looking forward to Bioshock infinite not to hate on Bioshock, too

1587
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:55,200
It was a good game in its own merits, but this is in some ways kind of the the true sequel to Bioshock

1588
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:00,080
It's just kind of a different little spin-off there games coming out on 360 PC and ps3

1589
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:04,800
The ps3 will have move support and come with the original Bioshock included

1590
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,000
You know just in case you miss assuming that they stick to the word unlike they did with some of the other games

1591
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,500
We'll see we'll see all right, so there you go. That's what I've got for rapid-fire news. How about you Darcyra?

1592
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:20,260
Um let's see we have a rumor that I've mentioned before

1593
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:28,660
Dark Stalkers 4 may potentially be happening and the theory is that Yoshinori Ono is behind it so I

1594
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:33,780
Don't think they've actually really had anything confirmed for it yet

1595
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:40,020
but then again the original Dark Stalkers was re-released and they like to re-release original versions right before there's gonna be a new one so

1596
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:41,260
who knows and

1597
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:46,620
There was an ESRB rating that's gonna say a re-release of Dark Stalkers 3 is gonna come out

1598
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:54,000
Again, who knows it could be they could just be teasing us. They could be trolling like that like that half-life shirt trolling us

1599
01:59:55,120 --> 02:00:02,880
Also, Jet Set Radio is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade PSN and PC this summer and Sega is gonna have a graffiti contest

1600
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,860
so

1601
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:08,920
They didn't really say if you're gonna be able to import your own graffiti images

1602
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:16,980
but they're having a contest that is available at sega.com slash JSR contest where you can put in your

1603
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:22,820
Designs and last but never least a street fighter and they're doing a street fighter Monopoly game the end

1604
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:27,400
Are the fighters the pieces or the properties I

1605
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:34,700
Would hope that they're the pieces and that like you fight for India or Japan or USA

1606
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:39,540
I mean, I guess I shouldn't say properties cuz you don't really buy and sell people but maybe like by your team

1607
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:44,260
You know, you're you're contracting them to join your super fighting squad or whatever

1608
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:47,580
Mmm, Kylie Minogue's cami

1609
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:51,140
That would be hot. I'm sorry. She didn't make a good cami

1610
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:58,420
Every time I see cami her voice is Kylie Minogue. Sorry right after covert action

1611
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:01,820
It wasn't that bad will be Street Fighter 2 the movie kind of underrated

1612
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:05,960
You know, Dan went bought that on blu-ray. Just I got it for Alan

1613
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:10,980
First gift I ever bought, you know, I saw that twice in the theater. Did you really I did

1614
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:15,700
Was it the cheapo enough? My dad took me to see it because I was only like

1615
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:19,780
11 or 12 when it came out. I saw it the second time at the cheapo theaters. All right

1616
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:26,220
Hey new segment on olr how exciting you ready for a new segment? I'm gonna try something new here

1617
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:29,740
It's a kind of a segment ripped off a hoard house a little bit. It's worked well over there

1618
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:32,860
So we're bringing it over here. It's a new segment called the frugal question of the week

1619
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,460
Little song to sashay to as we go to Facebook

1620
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:48,780
Plus favorite songs to play and beat mania Google thought it made a good theme music here

1621
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:54,040
So frugal you put Facebook and Google together you get frugal. Here's our frugal question of the week a portmanteau

1622
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:59,600
What that's what a combination of two words is called a portmanteau. Oh, okay frugal portmanteau

1623
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,160
It sounds like a wine. All right

1624
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:06,000
Our Facebook and Google Plus question of the week we post these the day of the show and get your questions

1625
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:13,520
Facebook comm slash orange lounge radio or Google Plus search for orange lounge radio because there's no custom URLs on Google Plus yet

1626
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:19,040
We'll post the question in both places and look for your answers or read some of our favorites on the show and talk about this

1627
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,200
topic

1628
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,400
Here's our very first frugal question of the week

1629
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:27,920
There's a lot of massive hype behind Mass Effect 3 coming out this week

1630
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:34,620
Are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs namely the method of storytelling and use of conversation trees in their games?

1631
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:36,420
Why or why not?

1632
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:42,240
Loki dark soccer want to take a stab at this really listeners reap massive hype behind Mass Effect 3

1633
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:48,720
Okay, are you a fan of BioWare's RPGs the way they do storytelling and how they use conversation trees their game honest

1634
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:55,520
I haven't I haven't played many of them. Um, I played yeah played some of Dragon Age Dragon Age. Uh, too

1635
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:01,240
I thought it was interesting for leading to you know a different game experience each time

1636
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,080
but really

1637
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:10,640
You know, I can't say I dislike it I really can't say I dislike it it's just different

1638
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,320
Okay, Loki

1639
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:19,560
Honestly, I kind of stopped playing Mass Effect after well. I didn't even really get very far in the first game

1640
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:20,960
Just wasn't for me

1641
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,640
Not that the whole dialogue trees or anything work and you know

1642
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:29,460
I wasn't against that because you know, I like adventure games and they had dialogue trees. So why wouldn't I?

1643
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:32,640
but I

1644
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:38,520
Don't know. It's just I mean the style is fine. I don't think that's really anything holding me back. I'm playing just time

1645
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:43,960
Yeah for me. Those games are huge time sinks. So when you're trying to juggle MMOs and other games

1646
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:46,220
It's it's it's a big investment to get into those games

1647
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,360
I did play a little bit of Dragon Age

1648
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:52,440
Especially I will say this swot or was really one that I invest a lot of time in and I gotta say

1649
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:59,200
The whole conversation tree aspect of the game kept me engaged in a way that Wow doesn't like I'm not I love Wow

1650
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,760
But I'm not really a morphine and it's not that it's a bad story

1651
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:05,720
It's just one that I tend to skip but in swot or I was really into it

1652
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:10,760
Like I would I would sit there and listen to all the dialogue and then I choose my options carefully and me

1653
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:15,000
I was always going for the dark side because I'm bad, you know, and I was really into it

1654
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Yeah, I thought it really kind of

1655
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,800
Enriched the game on a different level. Unfortunately the game itself got a little stale for me

1656
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,720
But I thought that the way the story was told was great and I can see why people get so into like Mass Effect and stuff

1657
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:33,760
It's it's a series. I've got to get into at some point, but I just you know again a huge time scene

1658
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,280
God, I make it sound like I play nothing. I've like missed all these big game

1659
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:38,280
I swear I play a lot of the big games. It's just

1660
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:42,060
somehow I missed all the ones I see I I kind of like

1661
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:47,460
how the you have set lore for a while, even though they've been trying to retcon it, but I

1662
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:53,760
Don't I don't know I'm always like what I want a story

1663
02:04:53,760 --> 02:05:00,200
I mean if I want a game that's gonna give me the option then I will play it specifically for that

1664
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:05,440
But for the most part I I like it when they've given me a story and playing it is like reading a book

1665
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
All right. Let's read some of the answers from our

1666
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:13,000
Facebook and Google or a foogle because it is to show where every gamer has a voice. We'll start with zither

1667
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,640
I like Mass Effect so far since I bought both games on Steam

1668
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:19,200
But I'm not entirely sure if I really like BioWare's RPGs

1669
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:25,880
The general consensus seems to be that after EA bought them out their RPGs began to suck in both gameplay and story aspects

1670
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,760
As much as I love the environment and gameplay in the first Mass Effect a game knowing that the third game

1671
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:37,080
Which I may never play because of origin may be terrible story wise is pushing me towards the not sure if like side

1672
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:40,960
At origin enhancement really turning people off

1673
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:45,920
I'd be curious for zither why he wouldn't just pick it up on a console then where he doesn't have to worry about origin

1674
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:52,660
But maybe the quality thing is is well, yeah with consoles. You still have to do the EA server thing

1675
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:59,660
That's true in fact with SSX. I just download the demo for they wanted me to sign up for that and do the server thing

1676
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:01,660
I'm like nah play offline

1677
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:07,180
All right, I've had enough of the theme music. I think we should just run it once all right, uh Derek H

1678
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:11,700
Responds, I'm not because one if I'm trying to save the universe

1679
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:18,460
Why can I only take two people with me when I have a ship full of Marines and two it's become a glorified virtual girlfriend

1680
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:21,300
Simulation and three I just don't like RPGs

1681
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,740
interesting

1682
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:25,620
That Derek kind of brings up that the whole lovemaking

1683
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:30,480
Scenes have kind of taken over what the rest of the game is really supposed to be about cuz it does seem like whenever one

1684
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,900
Of these games come out. It's all about who can you fuck?

1685
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:39,660
Now it's male male and it is male male and apparently the scene is only so so and it's really boring

1686
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:42,560
Yeah, and there's some pretty hot chick stuff

1687
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:49,260
You know, but if you want the boobies, it's all about the witcher to okay. I'll be out in April

1688
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:55,260
That's some that's got some hardcore stuff in there and Derek does bring up an interesting point where you know for being such an open-ended

1689
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:57,300
Game, it's not that open-ended

1690
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:01,940
I think that's kind of what I read in the between the lines on the first bullet point so interesting thoughts there

1691
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:07,200
Let's see going to Thomas B. Bioware games are pretty good. Especially the Mass Effect series

1692
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,060
I like that there generally are at least three paths to take in conversation

1693
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:18,340
Paragon renegade and paragade lots of RPGs are so linear that you may as well have the dialogues automatic or just show cutscenes between the

1694
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:19,940
fighting

1695
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:24,380
Robert w says Mass Effect 1 was amazing Dragon Age was great as well

1696
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,140
Then the sequels to both were hugely

1697
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:32,140
Disappointing to me when it seemed that they had an identity crisis when it tried to appeal to everyone and forgot what the originals were

1698
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:35,820
You know, I've heard that a lot especially about Dragon Age 2 except from Dark Sakura

1699
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:40,620
Why keep in mind I didn't play the first one. Okay, you should go back

1700
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,460
See I heard Mass Effect 2 would be more

1701
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:48,940
So me where I thought the first game is a little slow and cumbersome. Where is the second one's more? I guess like a shooter

1702
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:54,180
All right. Let me read two more here. Um, so well, apparently this third one is like pick your combination

1703
02:07:54,180 --> 02:08:00,360
Do you want more story you want more shooter? That's what it sounds really interesting about the third. I will takes shooting and boobies

1704
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:06,000
You don't want to shoot the boobies. No, no, no, she's she's not combined together

1705
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:12,200
Although topless six shooting bots. I'd be fine with that. Why isn't that a game topless chick shooting?

1706
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:18,380
Or is it only time I'm trying to think if I'm trying to think if that is a game. All right, look

1707
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,840
two more answers here

1708
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,840
still in

1709
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:27,780
Resplies, I like the way that Bioware tells the stories and how I can interact with NPCs

1710
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:33,600
I've played Dragon Age and felt really connected to my character and her companions because of that way of conversation

1711
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,220
I skipped the Mass Effect series because I thought that sci-fi games wouldn't be for me

1712
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:41,040
However, after playing swo tour and actually really loving the relationships

1713
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:44,440
I can get with my companions and being dragged into my character's story

1714
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:50,400
I actually am tempted to pick up Mass Effect 1 & 2 secondhand for my PlayStation 3 and start playing the series

1715
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,920
Is it bad that I'm already pondering who to romance?

1716
02:08:54,200 --> 02:09:01,560
Not at all and lastly Shane from courthouse funny enough for applies and says for the most part at least for me

1717
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:08,520
Bioware creates the most immersive RPGs on the market if you care about your character because the argument could be made that like Bethesda

1718
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:12,480
Creates the most immersive RPGs minus things to do with your characters development

1719
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:16,720
They faltered a bit on Dragon Age 2 by taking away a lot to do with the development of your character

1720
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:20,020
And thought it'd be cool to add a terrible story compared to Dragon Age origins

1721
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:25,220
But in terms of storytelling and use of conversation trees Mass Effect has been spot-on for two games

1722
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:28,580
I'm looking forward to Tuesday's release of Mass Effect 3 hardcore

1723
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:34,540
Because of the love they put into developing their characters in world definitely not because of the way the game plays

1724
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:40,760
Sounds to me like Shane might be more in it for the story mode as opposed to the boobies and gun mode. So there you go

1725
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:45,020
That's our frugal question of the week. Thanks you guys for applying

1726
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:49,880
We'll catch you next Sunday with our next frugal question of the week. Meanwhile, let's get back with some more news Loki

1727
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,380
Yes, let's talk a little bit about

1728
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:57,180
Capcom and about a game being released this week

1729
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:59,540
Street Fighter X Tekken

1730
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:04,820
Of course, there's been a lot of discussion with DLC including, you know

1731
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:09,580
first off that the PlayStation versions are gonna have some exclusive characters with

1732
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:12,260
crappy box art Mega Man and

1733
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:19,140
Pac Man and then on top of that the Vita is supposed to be getting 12 characters that are exclusive to it

1734
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,700
with those characters being

1735
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:29,100
Alina, Guy, Cody, Sakura, Dudley, Blanca, and I guess

1736
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:34,540
Alisa, Christy, Jack, Brian, Lars, and Ley

1737
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:38,220
Those are all I guess

1738
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:41,620
Supposed to be in the Vita version in

1739
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:44,460
the fall

1740
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:46,300
however

1741
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:48,300
apparently

1742
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:53,540
Apparently that they're already available on the disc as DLC

1743
02:10:53,860 --> 02:10:58,140
They're already on the disc. I'm actually the Pac Man and

1744
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:03,660
Bad box art Mega Man is that's gonna be released on the 13th, I believe

1745
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,820
or at least next week and

1746
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:12,860
Those are gonna be free DLC if you have the ps3 version

1747
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:20,380
Funny enough though those are also on the Xbox 360 disc as some people already have those discs and have

1748
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:24,700
dug through and actually dumped some of the videos the intro and

1749
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:30,740
Ending videos from those characters, and they're on both discs, so it comes down to

1750
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:36,780
You know what the hell it's all paid unlock content all this shit was done way before

1751
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:42,220
You release the game and usually in games like this it would be like unlock characters

1752
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:44,620
You play well, and you get some new you know characters

1753
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:50,580
But because we're in a day and age where it's fun to charge money for a shit that would normally be free

1754
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:55,820
Then that's what they did. It's on the actual disc and here's the best part about it, too

1755
02:11:55,820 --> 02:11:59,900
There's actually the Xbox 360 version I believe

1756
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:07,820
There's a way to glitch out the game to actually play as one of the unlocked characters or play as Alina

1757
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:12,340
I guess or not really Alina, but as

1758
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:18,100
It's a trick to load Alina's character data instead of poisons, so

1759
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:20,620
Wait the one from Street Fighter 3

1760
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:27,580
Yes, I loved her yes, so there's a way to unlock. I guess her player data, so you can play with all of her moves as

1761
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:29,940
poison

1762
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:33,700
But you know through a glitch in the game, so

1763
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:39,300
That's kind of weird that all these characters that they claim were your PlayStation exclusive of course

1764
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:44,380
Come on folks. I mean are you that surprised that these are gonna be on both systems

1765
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:49,780
You look at Namco and look what they do Soulcalibur 4 and fucking the Yoda and Darth Vader

1766
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:55,620
You knew that those were gonna be downloadable on the other systems because they can make a buck off of it

1767
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:59,020
So why not, but I just have a problem with them

1768
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:04,420
Just doing this as far as putting the content on the disk already because it doesn't to me

1769
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:09,180
And this is one of the things before it. It's just the perception of it

1770
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:12,320
It doesn't seem like it's something that was added later on

1771
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:18,440
But if it's something on the disk that you're under you're unlocking people feel entitled because they own the disk well

1772
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:23,500
They think they own the disk you're really licensing the disk, but fuck that you own the disk okay, and

1773
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:26,540
You have the data on the disk already

1774
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:30,980
Why aren't you being you know? Why is it being locked out?

1775
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:36,020
It would be like if you bought a house, and there's a room. That's locked that you have to pay money to get the key to

1776
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:41,180
Yeah, it's your house. You own it, but you can't access that room because too bad

1777
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:47,340
It's locked it's the classic example of pay to unlock content which Namco especially has been guilty of a lot in the past now

1778
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:51,500
I realize the Street Fighter cross Tekken is the Capcom version of the game, but they've they've done some of this too

1779
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:58,860
Yeah, so well. Yes. It's disappointing. It really is. I mean. It's it's disappointing first off that it doesn't really

1780
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:03,460
First off the extra 12 characters that they're talking about once. I found out who they were I was like yeah

1781
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:09,740
The Vita version doesn't seem that great, but it's something that you know that well. They're not really exclusive

1782
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,900
It's just gonna be available to everybody eventually for a price

1783
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:17,520
So who knows and here's the even sadder part if you really want to look at it that way you know

1784
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:20,220
You know this is gonna be up on you know

1785
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:26,300
The scene sites and stuff like that right they hack keys for games like easy

1786
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:30,580
This is all those characters are gonna be unlocked on the pirated copies

1787
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:34,780
The first week I this just confirms for me

1788
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:38,660
I'm not gonna buy the game when it comes out because you know I was

1789
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:41,660
Considering getting it even though I knew this in the back of my mind

1790
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:45,860
There'll be a year edition best of the year edition or whatever inevitably

1791
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:49,460
And I think now that the discs are already practically made that way

1792
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:54,980
There's for sure gonna be a year-end edition at the end of the year once all these characters are released

1793
02:14:55,100 --> 02:15:01,180
That will include everything it'll be the same disc with the in there exactly right because that's how they don't have to press it

1794
02:15:01,180 --> 02:15:03,180
Twice and they can reuse the old copies

1795
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:07,300
But I think I think that's exactly the grand scheme of what's going on here, and it just confirms for me

1796
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:09,300
you know what Rob you need to wait and

1797
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:10,700
I

1798
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:16,940
Wonder if there's gonna be other people that are where I'm at that'll send a clear message when we don't buy this game and I

1799
02:15:16,940 --> 02:15:23,180
Understand that you know the developers will come out and they will say well listen. We plan to have DLC I

1800
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:28,520
Have a problem when they always say they plan to have DLC. Yeah, I you know I understand like Bethesda

1801
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:33,200
We plan to have expansions to Skyrim. Yeah, okay that makes sense that you're gonna plan to have it expansions

1802
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:37,460
But that fucking content was not already on the disc it was not on the disc

1803
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:40,860
It's stuff that's added you know after the fact you'll be like hey

1804
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:43,800
You know what we thought these characters would be cool to have in the game

1805
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,160
We didn't have time to put them in there, so we're gonna go ahead and create those characters

1806
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:51,420
and we're gonna sell them as DLC remember fucking happened with was it Jill Valentine and

1807
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:57,560
Shima graph or whatever where that was already on the disc as well with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 yes

1808
02:15:58,220 --> 02:16:01,260
And they were like five bucks for each fucking character

1809
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:04,020
$5 per

1810
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:05,040
character

1811
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,040
Capcom never forget that they charge

1812
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:13,200
Five dollars for those fucking characters. Do you think that this is gonna be any different five?

1813
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:17,200
Dollars per character how much was it five dollars per character?

1814
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:19,280
$4.99

1815
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,400
for 99 US dollars for 99

1816
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,680
No, so I'm just saying it's

1817
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:30,400
Don't think that they won't try this shit because they will and come on

1818
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:36,040
I hope that you're smart enough to know that if this is you know a deal-breaker for you if these and they'll be honest

1819
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:41,320
They're they're older characters. It's not like oh my god. It's now. You know Klonoa's in there and shit

1820
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:45,320
You know it's not anything and that would really be the only thing that would kind of get me

1821
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:47,420
They'll be all hey a bunch of new characters

1822
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:50,840
I mean come on Blanca me you know if I want to play as Blanca in a game like that

1823
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:53,920
I could just play you know Street Fighter 4 or something like that

1824
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:58,240
Um I do want to make something clear here before I get the nasty emails

1825
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:02,700
And it's like you know well Rob you bought Final Fantasy 13 too, and now they're putting out all this DLC for it

1826
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:07,240
And it's inevitable that all that's gonna be repackaged at the end of the year, too

1827
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,280
And there's two things I have to say to that one

1828
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:13,060
It's actually DLC you are downloading this extra stuff

1829
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:15,800
You know like the fights and the side content and all that and B

1830
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:19,880
I also you know I have a much bigger love of art role-playing games

1831
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:25,640
And I unlike a lot of you really liked Final Fantasy 13 and so I was really excited about Final Fantasy 13 too

1832
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:30,640
Whereas with fighting games. I'm a little worn out on fighting games right now like yeah

1833
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:35,320
I still got I still have a lot of Soulcalibur 5. I need to explore and you know some of these other fighting games

1834
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:39,360
I've got that I haven't played enough of so it's like do I need to be the first one to own Street Fighter cross Tekken

1835
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:44,720
When I realize that there's gonna be more to come later on no, I don't think I need to be the first to own it

1836
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:47,120
and so

1837
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:48,520
Maybe it's a double standard

1838
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:53,880
But I think it's it's a question a lot of people are asking and you know and you have to you can't go into this

1839
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:55,360
not knowing

1840
02:17:55,360 --> 02:18:02,640
What their their mo is nowadays with these fighting games they release a fucking version of a game then they upgrade it slightly later on

1841
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,760
They'll be balancing tweaks or whatever. I mean they fucking did that was Street Fighter 4

1842
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:11,800
They have Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 then Super Street Fighter 4 arcade edition

1843
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:15,680
Then they have you know Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and ultimate Marvel vs.

1844
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:20,560
Capcom 3 with extra characters and DLC and stuff like that of course they're gonna do that shit

1845
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:26,320
They're they're gonna do it and so why should we be so naive to think that oh?

1846
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:32,800
I need to pay $60 for this game right now when you can pay $60 down the road or maybe $50 who knows

1847
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:35,360
And just pick up the game with all the DLC

1848
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:39,160
Yeah, are you gonna be missing out in the game? You know for a while?

1849
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:39,600
Yeah

1850
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,720
But you know what you need to get if that's such a big deal

1851
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:47,520
Then you need to get over the fact that you need to have stuff day one as soon as you get over the fact that

1852
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:52,560
You need to have games day one. Oh my god your options get so much cheaper and so much better because

1853
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:58,600
You're looking at games that are released like for example Mortal Kombat if you want to get it in on Mortal Kombat right now

1854
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:02,640
Yeah, it came out about a year ago, but you can get it now for the same price

1855
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:08,280
Maybe even less now with all the DLC thrown in so you're saving yourself some money

1856
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:16,080
Instead of having to buy season passes for four games. Yeah pre-order download content

1857
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:21,280
That's what a fucking season pass is they did that with Saints Row the third Gears of War well

1858
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:26,480
You know there's a little difference though between Gears of War and like Call of Duty Elite service at least that you kind of know

1859
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:30,360
What you're getting, but gears are Saints Row the third. It's been cheap ass

1860
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,360
DLC expansions with like 30 minutes of content for $7 each

1861
02:19:35,720 --> 02:19:39,280
No, thanks. I you know what's interesting if I've counted this up correctly

1862
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:42,520
There's 38 characters in Street Fighter X Tekken by default

1863
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:47,280
And then there's an additional what we have 12 characters on the Vita and then five

1864
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:52,800
Extra guest characters so about 17, so that's about I mean I'm doing sloppy math here

1865
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:58,000
But that's about so what 50 characters total 55 characters 17 of them are behind a paywall

1866
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,040
That's a quarter of the game a quarter of the game is paid to unlock

1867
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:08,560
That is crazy that I think that that's too far and three months from now ultimate edition

1868
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:11,360
the for real a

1869
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:17,320
Quarter of the game is on the disc and you're gonna have to pay possibly possibly five dollars per character

1870
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:19,720
Possibly if track record is to be followed

1871
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:26,200
Yeah, I mean, let's just let's just say that they're gonna be reasonable and do two character packs five bucks each

1872
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:28,920
That's still I

1873
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:32,760
Mean buying all the DLC will be the price of the full

1874
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:39,880
You know re-release of the game when it comes out in the year or less because you know look at you know

1875
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:43,260
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom that only came out about nine months later

1876
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:50,160
February was or I believe is February that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was released November was when the sequel came out or the

1877
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:56,900
Upgrade came out and you know what to be fair with ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at least they added something to that

1878
02:20:57,220 --> 02:21:00,240
You know the DLC characters were thrown in and a whole lot more

1879
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:05,080
Which made it kind of sting even more for the people about the original Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1880
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:10,920
They now to be fair. There could be another element

1881
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:17,480
That is download like included with the unlock that is actually downloaded. We don't know. I mean, I know it it's

1882
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:23,760
Snowballs chance in hell, but we don't know it could happen that could enrich what we're assuming and straight up

1883
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:28,520
And that's not where it ends. You know if you think about it. Remember they have this whole gem system now and

1884
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:32,080
They're gonna be selling those gem cards or whatever

1885
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:34,080
that's

1886
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:40,140
Cha-ching show me the money. I hate that our console games are turning into

1887
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:43,960
Crap Facebook games. Here's the problem though

1888
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:49,360
And the problem is because people are such hardcore fans out there for these games that they're willing to pay this kind of money

1889
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:51,660
So people are willing to do that. Look at Skylanders

1890
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,720
Skylanders is a ridiculous cash-in thing and people cannot get a

1891
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:59,440
Enough of that game and I'm telling you these people right now

1892
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:02,760
You are the downfall of this goddamn, you know industry

1893
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:07,240
This is what's gonna turn into because you cannot fucking get some I

1894
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:12,120
Don't sense to yourself that you're like, I don't have these stupid figures that don't do anything

1895
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:16,960
I mean you're collecting little figures that don't do anything and what are they gonna do?

1896
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:23,420
They're gonna sell more expensive figures that don't do anything the next time around and you're gonna buy them because you're a consumer whore

1897
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:28,560
But you know what if you don't buy into it, they'll stop doing it and maybe this shit will go away

1898
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,880
They'll start actually saying hey, you know what?

1899
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:37,480
let's put everything out of this because when we start adding, you know DLC that's already all of this people don't fucking like it and then

1900
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
that's not a viable means of

1901
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:44,200
your revenue anymore, but unfortunately, this is the way things are going and

1902
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:48,800
That's it. So you just gotta play smart you buy the game

1903
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,880
you know

1904
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:57,200
either buy it used later on buy it for cheap buy it later when the game of the year edition comes out and just

1905
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:03,640
Give it some time. I'm going to our chat room SSJ 100 Matt says Rob. You're talking me out of my pre-order. You know, I'm not I

1906
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:06,440
I

1907
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:10,840
Well, I talked myself out of it earlier this week. So I'm just trying to be honest

1908
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:13,720
I'm not saying like if you buy this you're dumb or anything like that

1909
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,160
No

1910
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:15,640
I think you just have to ask yourself

1911
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:21,720
How much is this game worth to you because Capcom is about to try and charge you double for it basically and for some people?

1912
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:29,000
That is that is worth it to them and that some passionate fighting game fans are gonna be lined up day one

1913
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,960
There is nothing wrong with that. But for me, I don't consider it to be a worthy investment

1914
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:40,040
Some people would side-eye me going. What are you doing ordering this collector's edition of Final Fantasy 13, too

1915
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:43,520
Did you play the first game? Oh, isn't that good? But I'm like, you know what? I enjoyed it enough

1916
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:48,840
I'm gonna take a risk on it, you know, so you really just have to value for you. Is

1917
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:52,440
Is it worth it when you know, this is coming?

1918
02:23:54,760 --> 02:24:00,560
That's what it's really about is it worth it? I don't think so, but that's me

1919
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:04,120
Every gamer gets a voice. I

1920
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:07,280
Mean, it looks like a neat game, but maybe we should just wait

1921
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,880
We can pick it up at Christmas. I don't time to play it right now anyways, so

1922
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:17,840
Oh, I I'm telling I'll get it when the year-end edition comes out, but I I

1923
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:24,680
Don't know what series if fighting games. I'm willing to buy day one anymore. Maybe Soul Calibur and that's about it

1924
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:26,000
But I really like Soul Calibur

1925
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,200
Well, there's a lot of games like I'm not I know a lot of series of games that are gonna come out

1926
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,840
They're gonna have like game of the year additions

1927
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:37,920
Like, you know Borderlands 2 I know is gonna have a game of the year edition at some point

1928
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:41,000
But you know what? That's a game where the DLC was worth it

1929
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,880
That was something it wasn't on the disc already and they put some effort into that shit. You know Skyrim is gonna be

1930
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:52,520
Flipping epic DLC. Yeah, they're gonna have a game of the year edition of Skyrim because they got the room to do it

1931
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:56,560
They can put it on one disc. It's gonna be awesome. And that's fine. But like

1932
02:24:57,080 --> 02:24:58,560
you know

1933
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:04,280
Fighting games. I'm not gonna give my money to because I know that they're gonna come out with some sort of addition

1934
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:08,960
That's gonna be cheaper later on and just like stuff that I'm kind of ho-hum about. I'm just gonna wait on

1935
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:12,800
Dark Sakura, you look like you want to comment on this or jump in here?

1936
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:18,000
Actually, it was something that I wanted to mention speaking of Skyrim. This is just before I forget it

1937
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:24,440
Someone's done a berserk patch for Skyrim for PC where you can play as got to from berserk nice

1938
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:30,040
Just saying you need to go look at Alan by the way is almost 200 hours Skyrim. It's pretty awesome

1939
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:37,560
You got to go see the portal thingy. He downloaded the valve mod official thing. He's got like Wheatley in his bag. That's awesome

1940
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:40,120
Yeah, anyhow. All right, we need to move on in the interest of time

1941
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:44,180
To cover some other stories if you want to send us a mailbag on this topic

1942
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:46,840
I'm sure a lot of you have something to say mailbag at orange laundry calm

1943
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:50,280
Where do you stand? Maybe that'll be the question of the week next week the food old thing. I don't know. We'll see

1944
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:52,600
Alright, let's move on. Um

1945
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:59,260
This is kind of controversial this contest going on at Atari and it's in a nutshell make your own version of pong to win

1946
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:03,480
Six digits a hundred thousand dollars and a publishing agreement with Atari

1947
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:12,320
You do your own version of pong you submit to March 31st your own take on pong and it's gonna be judged by a panel

1948
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:15,120
That includes Nolan Bush Bushnell who did the first pong?

1949
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:21,440
Three winners will get prize money and you'll actually get to publish your games on the iOS Apple Store now

1950
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:28,560
There's a lot of controversy going on with this because some websites are reporting the whole little contract for this game. Is that

1951
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:30,320
Let's see

1952
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,120
according to gamasutra

1953
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:40,000
Atari's pong indie developer challenge seeks to get all entrants to give away game ideas to Atari that Atari can then exploit and the entrant

1954
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:43,360
relinquishes all further interest in the idea Atari then selects 20

1955
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:49,600
Semifinalists to put in months of work into building out their ideas and a playable versions that Atari has full ownership over

1956
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:55,040
Half of those finalists then get a modest 5k payment for putting in even more work to complete their game

1957
02:26:55,040 --> 02:27:00,960
finally the top three winners will receive half of the advertised prize as a result of their work and are then subjected to a

1958
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,600
Horrendous royalty structure as they seek to earn out the rest of their awarded prize

1959
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:08,840
so in other words you're having to develop this whole game and you might get nothing and Atari owns it and

1960
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:10,800
Atari

1961
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:15,360
Atari's not doing too. Well, okay. I don't know if any ways notice Atari Atari

1962
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:20,740
All that Atari has right now going for it is the witcher 2 which is coming, you know to

1963
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:23,720
Consoles as well now. Well Xbox 360

1964
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:25,040
and

1965
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:28,080
test drive Ferrari Racing Legends, which

1966
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:32,640
It's not exactly a strong title. That is it. I mean, so

1967
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:38,000
Yeah, maybe they're gonna relaunch pong. I mean they try to a centipede in that bombed

1968
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,280
So I always think that pong on the PlayStation years ago. I mean, I

1969
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:50,680
Don't know you honestly you could probably get away with pong version out there on the iOS platform

1970
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:54,840
And they probably wouldn't even notice. You know what this all sounds like to me is it sounds like

1971
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:57,400
American Idol

1972
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:00,200
You know how like on American Idol if you're in the top

1973
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:06,480
50 you have to sign some type of contract that you're like Fox owns your ass for a year and then all those people don't

1974
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:09,440
Get through and they're fucked like they can't do anything

1975
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:13,060
They can't put out their own because they've had the limited exposure on the show

1976
02:28:13,060 --> 02:28:17,600
But they weren't in the top 12 like I know that's a fucking weird comparison

1977
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:22,320
but it's kind of the same thing like if you're the runner-up in this contest Atari's gonna own your game and

1978
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:25,720
You don't get much out of it

1979
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,040
But let's be fair

1980
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:28,560
I mean

1981
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:32,400
I don't think coding a pong game is gonna be too much of a challenge

1982
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:40,560
Punk for the person who's gonna reinvent it which by the way whoever made pong combat in the 1990s just needs to revive that idea

1983
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:48,440
Yeah, I remember pong combat on the PC. Nope. Oh my god. I have it had pong paddle fatalities and everything it was hilarious

1984
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:52,600
Oh my god. It was like oh god. I was in like junior high or high school

1985
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:56,480
It's like 94 95 when this game was out the pong combat was great

1986
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:03,600
All right somebody in our somebody in our chat room must know what I'm talking about

1987
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,840
All right

1988
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,920
Let's go to the mailbag. Do we have emails tonight?

1989
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,280
We got one, but it's from Bobby

1990
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:17,900
Alright, well a Bobby email will have to do tonight mailbag at orange lounge radio comm is where you guys send us emails every week

1991
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,640
Here we go

1992
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:23,320
Since Rob won't read my chat comments because Loki already started another story

1993
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:29,400
The reason you don't see many 99 cent games on 3ds vita, but do on iOS is it's because of licensing fees

1994
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:33,560
It costs $99 a year to get as many apps as you want on the App Store

1995
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:37,760
You have to pay more than that per title to be on the 3ds slash vita

1996
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:41,600
So the prices have to be higher to recoup licensing fees now Rob

1997
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,440
I need your help on something to circumvent something. So read the last paragraph, please

1998
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:54,100
Allow he's you know, he's trolling you with this. All right, here we go. I'll read this is why I'm having you read it

1999
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:58,960
This is total troll bait. Are you sure you want to go? I'm having you read it

2000
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:04,960
All right, so that it completely negates a statement, you know, they say don't read feed the trolls. I'm negating a statement

2001
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:08,280
But having you read it. All right, here's the last last paragraph of Bobby black wolf

2002
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:13,600
Host of the Bobby black will show at all games radio whose opinions are his own. Yes

2003
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:19,920
Oh and the US soundtrack to sonic CD is far far far superior to the Japanese soundtrack

2004
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:25,140
This is a verifiable fact. And since dark soccer just said this in her voice. It is doubly true

2005
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,200
haha

2006
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:30,200
counter troll

2007
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,840
Counter troll well played dark soccer

2008
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:36,640
Lies, so wait, my voice doesn't mean anything

2009
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,800
But I'm this I'm the Sega nerd

2010
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,720
It's a trap sweet

2011
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,240
sweet

2012
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:51,000
Vengeance Bobby black wolf is protesting live in our chat room

2013
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,880
If you want to start a protest here at Orange, Ontario mailbag at Orange lounge radio is the place to send your angst

2014
02:30:56,880 --> 02:31:04,120
Do not try to outsmart the ducks dark Sakura speaking of I have been trolling since I was born

2015
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:07,160
true I pooped on my granny once

2016
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:13,640
You really want to share that on this program my mom already did on this program, right? It's been a long ten years. All right

2017
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:30,400
And speaking of angst

2018
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:38,100
If you to the potential of having to take a job in customer service again, I really I mean, okay

2019
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:41,360
I'm good at it. I'm good at dealing with people all

2020
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:47,240
Appearances on the show to the contrary, you know, I'm really freaking good at customer service

2021
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:54,640
But I did it. I've done it for a long time and I don't want to keep doing it. I want to work in design

2022
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,960
So tell Capcom or whoever

2023
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:03,760
that I have amazing grammatical skills know how to use my spell checker and

2024
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:07,640
Know how to use a dictionary and a thesaurus

2025
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:13,760
You may be screwed by Association for Capcom based on earlier rants on this program. I

2026
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:17,240
Didn't say the views and opinions. Hello

2027
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:26,520
Keep in mind I have probably every fighting game cap comes ever made including cyber BOTS Capcom's number one game. I

2028
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:35,140
Have the deluxe version to have two copies of it anyway, so go to GDC I wish

2029
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:37,140
but

2030
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:42,540
It's it's just really difficult because I have experience in my field

2031
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:45,620
I have I've got clients who will vouch for me

2032
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:51,540
But they want that extra piece of paper that says that I've you know, basically taking classes and stuff. I know how to do

2033
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:57,580
Gee, well, I've done a bunch of classes and stuff. I already know how to do do I have to do more classes and stuff?

2034
02:32:57,580 --> 02:33:02,540
I know how to do so and and you know, I have nothing against going to school

2035
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:07,700
I love going to school and I love taking classes and I like learning from not just my teachers

2036
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:11,060
But from the other people in my classes the people around me, you know my peers

2037
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:14,460
But at the same time I really really

2038
02:33:15,220 --> 02:33:19,500
Would like to have the stuff that I can do be recognized. That's all

2039
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:27,260
I've got a few people who are who are giving me some work. So that's good. But I need I need some regular work

2040
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:29,780
Just saying done

2041
02:33:29,780 --> 02:33:31,780
Mr. Loki

2042
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:37,700
Fuck you for drinking them with a two-liter Pepsi. That's a lot of Pepsi

2043
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:40,700
You did it. Yeah

2044
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:44,260
Almost almost it's almost empty, but I'm ladders gonna say fine

2045
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:49,100
I'm not gonna finish that my a few of the week goes to believe it or not pizza

2046
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:51,100
And I'm not talking about the pizza

2047
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:54,980
I gotta toss those two because they can't I can't really leave them my car take it home

2048
02:33:54,980 --> 02:34:01,780
But I had pizza earlier in the week. Maybe really take it home. Well, because it we don't have room in our fridge for it

2049
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:06,980
You're gonna toss it. Maybe Alan will eat it for lunch tomorrow. Yeah, you can you can have the rest

2050
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:08,980
I mean, it's just I don't know

2051
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:14,740
If you do I have almost a full bag if you do the credit music starting early, um, that's really it

2052
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:16,660
if you do pizza, but

2053
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:20,460
Bless you to that amazing crazy bread, which I will also have another piece of

2054
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:23,340

Let's end the FU music. Oh my god, crazy bad crazy bread

2057
02:34:28,460 --> 02:34:33,520
It was good hot cold lukewarm wet if you think if you love crazy bread

I'm telling you you got to try their new their new breadsticks that they have

2059
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:41,220
Less food more games. Oh, no. No, it's just like it's epic. It's got pepperoni

2060
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:47,120
Who's paying you guys off tonight? Like if this whole thing will have to it's delicious. All right hormones

We'll get there in a minute for now Loki. I don't want to talk about this, but

2065
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:11,260
Justin Bieber, it's being sued by a game company

2066
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:15,100
That put out a game called joustin beaver

2067
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:19,980
It's a beaver. That's jousting things with a pole and

2068
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:27,580
Yes, obviously it's parody and it's cheap and the ripoff

2069
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:30,420
the Justin Bieber name

2070
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:32,440
but

2071
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:37,620
Anyway, so wind up happening is Justin Bieber are his lawyers. I should say

2072
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:40,300
Fields of the game is infringing on

2073
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:42,060
his

2074
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:48,500
Trademark and publicity. So it's the other way around. It's the other way around. Oh, just so so they Justin Bieber is doing Justin Bieber

2075
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:49,940
well, they sent

2076
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:51,540
you know a

2077
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:54,380
C synthesis or whatever and the company ours

2078
02:35:54,860 --> 02:35:59,300
RC3 that made the game feels that the game is parody and protected under the First Amendment and

2079
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:05,340
they said of course the parody app portrays beaver floating now a log on a river and the beaver presents

2080
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:11,380
Are just presented with bangs and the lance in a purple sweater the beaver knocks off

2081
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:14,620
fought hogs and

2082
02:36:14,860 --> 02:36:22,380
Attempts to or to take his do young lady do young twelve-year-old lady beavers faint in his presence

2083
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:25,700
you're basically fighting like the paparazzi as pigs and

2084
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:33,500
Yeah, so I guess the beaver also signs otter graphs and

2085
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:35,500
Yeah, my god

2086
02:36:36,060 --> 02:36:43,420
It's just so just to be clear just because I thought when you originally said this you said that that the joustin beaver folks were

2087
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:46,780
Suing Justin Bieber, which I thought was ridiculous. That's his name. No, that is what they're doing

2088
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:50,220
They're suing him because because they're suing each other

2089
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:57,780
Yeah, because the fact that they're trying to you know, cease and desist this and they're saying well, we're protected by the first amendment rights

2090
02:36:57,780 --> 02:37:03,980
Okay, and so we're I get to you know, so Justin Bieber's company sued these guys

2091
02:37:03,980 --> 02:37:08,760
And now it's a counter suit saying you're full of shit. Really. They should be sued by the people who'd made tuben

2092
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:12,620
Honestly, it looks like yeah

2093
02:37:13,380 --> 02:37:15,380
and really I

2094
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:21,160
Mean also Justin be just his teeth aren't that bad. Let's be real

2095
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:27,780
I mean, I can't believe I'm fucking defending. I know the the beavers teeth are not as bad as the real thing picture exists

2096
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:30,300
this picture of

2097
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:36,260
Justin Bieber dressed up like he's going into Tron with fucking he looks like the Ozzy Osbourne like

2098
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:40,180
Like some creepy devil guy that's in Tron or you know

2099
02:37:40,180 --> 02:37:47,860
Who should be suing joustin beaver is sue Sylvester from glee because that looks more like sue Sylvester than Justin Bieber

2100
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:50,700
I mean, let's be real, you know, I

2101
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:58,620
Mean, it's fun to hate on the other popular singer and yeah, whatever, you know, it's not it's not music

2102
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:02,740
That's our demographic at all. So that's fine. Whatever, you know

2103
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:10,140
But at the same time hey, come on, man, you released an app. That's just it's just different enough

2104
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:12,580
You're just cashing in on the high. It's Justin Bieber

2105
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:18,300
I'm gonna download this because it's a beaver but it's not really Justin Bieber is funny

2106
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:19,500
And you know what?

2107
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:24,420
It just appeals to those people there that fucking dumb that will buy any of this stupid bullshit or that poke

2108
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:29,100
These are the people they're on gold thing. Yes. Yes, the yellow yellow. Pokemon yellow thing

2109
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:31,300
These are the people that are also dumb enough to buy

2110
02:38:32,020 --> 02:38:36,540
Fucking down our on diss download content for Street Fighter cross Tekken. So

2111
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:43,020
a comedy gold from our chat room tonight. There's a to drink minimum in chat tonight. Just wait for this stuff

2112
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:46,180
Let's see going to our chat. I'm a chat that orange lounge radio.com

2113
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:52,340
Sj100 Matt says 12 year old beavers. This show has gone down a dark path. You know what I meant?

2114
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:54,820
jerk

2115
02:38:54,820 --> 02:39:01,300
Let's see. DDR dollar bill says I sue you you sue me. Let's go and sue everybody

2116
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:03,760
I really did just sing that on the show

2117
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:05,080
Um

2118
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:09,040
message a 100 Matt says I want to sue both of them for wasting my time well said and

2119
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:14,480
Blackwolf says Rob likes glee. Lol. No, I do not. I like the first half

2120
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:19,640
I'd like the first half of the first season and then I'm like this joke is done. This joke is over

2121
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:22,580
This is like this is this is the guy that won't leave the party

2122
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,680
And Justin Bieber's company hasn't sued them yet

2123
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:31,800
it's just that they received this a cease and desist letter and so now, you know that company is flying filing a

2124
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:35,000
Counter suit or a suit before the other suits, so

2125
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:38,080
Yeah, whatever

2126
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:40,960
All right, let's move on to something less

2127
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:47,240
You know and I feel bad that we even talked about that game because now there's like oh hey

2128
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:51,120
We got our game talked about people are going to be interested in and really it should just die

2129
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:57,560
With all those other really crappy knockoff games. I have like I have a punch Obama. I haven't played it

2130
02:39:57,560 --> 02:40:02,620
I can't knock on a game till I play. Yeah. Yeah, you can. Okay, maybe a little bit. All right

2131
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:08,820
Well, believe it or not. This is something older much older than Justin Bieber who turned 18 this week

2132
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:11,320
Can you believe it but this guy's turning 30?

2133
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:15,600
No, it's not me. That was already happened the Pac Man

2134
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:21,280
Pac Man is getting a new 3d animated series

2135
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:27,080
It is produced by a former Marvel executive Avi Arad is doing this

2136
02:40:27,080 --> 02:40:33,240
Now I'm called bond. I actually announced that it is going to be shown. It's got the pilot has been picked up for a full series

2137
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:36,200
It's gonna be on Disney XD in fall

2138
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:40,540
2013 I love Disney XD because it makes me think of the face XD

2139
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:44,360
But Disney XD is also where the Tron on a main thing is gonna be so they're you know

2140
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:46,360
Picking up some new work and Phineas and Ferb

2141
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:51,280
This is called pack. Where does Adventure Time show because I like that show but I are to network

2142
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:51,680
Okay

2143
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:56,480
I only ever watch it on like Netflix and stuff but that shows I know and I did I did watch Phineas and Ferb one day

2144
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:00,800
And it actually was pretty good Phineas and Ferb is awesome. Anyhow back to Pac Man

2145
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:04,080
This new series is called Pac Man. The Adventure begins

2146
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:08,920
I don't think it has anything to do with the old 80s cartoon, but it should be noted

2147
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:12,700
You know Pac Man has been a cartoon once before but this is going that whole

2148
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:20,480
Pixar route, although I don't know if this will be it's just because that shit's cheaper to produce nowadays and actually hand drawing anything

2149
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:23,860
That's why it's all CG animated kind of sad

2150
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:26,160
but true it doesn't make

2151
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:32,340
All right, doesn't not make sense. Okay, Ron Matt. Well you saying Avi Arad left Marvel

2152
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:34,900
Disney owns Marvel

2153
02:41:36,820 --> 02:41:39,120
Remember Disney owns Marvel

2154
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:44,140
The end that's true get some Marvel rides at Disneyland

2155
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:46,960
Yeah, hey, I always you know

2156
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:52,300
If they end up building a third park in Anaheim, which has been rumored for years as soon as they get to Disney, California

2157
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:54,300
So where are they gonna put parking in space?

2158
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:56,340
underground

2159
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:59,340
Underground in space. There's no there's a whole nother law

2160
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:01,140
All they have to do is build another parking structure

2161
02:42:01,140 --> 02:42:05,220
Well, one of the lot where the Toy Story lot is now and they have a whole other space back in there

2162
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:07,740
That they could use

2163
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:10,740
They could build another a third part subterranean park

2164
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:14,980
I don't think it'll be right next door to the other parks, but Florida's kind of spread out a little bit

2165
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:18,820
So it could work. Anyway, this isn't a Disney podcast. I'm trying to make it one

2166
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:23,060
But I could see a Marvel theme park competing with Six Flags

2167
02:42:23,780 --> 02:42:30,060
Hmm makes sense. Mm-hmm all those Six Flags has the DC properties because they have the Batman ride that is air the Superman ride

2168
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:32,580
and anyway

2169
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:38,700
Let's move on more stories dark soccer. You're next. I'm sorry. I'm wondering where Perry is. Okay

2170
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:42,100
This is a sad chapter in gaming

2171
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:49,320
Basically, and I can never pronounce this. I don't know how to pronounce this guy's name, right? His name is Aris

2172
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:53,380
Bactanians, I guess

2173
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:55,220
he was

2174
02:42:55,220 --> 02:43:03,460
Interviewed as part of a fighting game thing going on the cross-assault reality show that Capcom does and they were doing a promotion

2175
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:06,740
for Tekken cross assert fright for sheep right across Tekken and

2176
02:43:06,740 --> 02:43:10,780
And he apparently was saying some

2177
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:17,140
rather lewd things about the only female that was participating in that who happened to be his team member and

2178
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:20,000
Like

2179
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,740
Talking about how she should take off her shirt and all kinds of really just awful hideous things

2180
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:28,420
And so finally a Capcom person, you know

2181
02:43:28,420 --> 02:43:34,860
basically said the views and opinions expressed by cast members in the live segment of cross-assault do not reflect those of Capcom as

2182
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:36,060
a

2183
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:41,260
Company Capcom believes that everyone should be treated with respect and you basically they said we're sorry

2184
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:45,960
If anyone got offended on our show, we are completely distancing ourselves from this guy

2185
02:43:46,180 --> 02:43:50,900
You know what? This reminds me of speaking of like crazy analogies since I compared something American Idol earlier

2186
02:43:51,060 --> 02:43:55,620
This really reminds me of things that have happened on the CBS show big brother

2187
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:59,180
We're contested because you know, the cameras are always on a big brother

2188
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:02,180
My understanding about this reality show is it's not like the tester

2189
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:09,580
it's something that's always live and some people on Big Brother have said some really dumb things like one gal in one season said these really

2190
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:14,820
Ignorant things about Jewish people and just got you know, and the clip was on YouTube and she got taken to the cleaners

2191
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:16,820
I mean this poor guy probably didn't find work

2192
02:44:16,820 --> 02:44:19,540
Oh, I shouldn't say this poor gal because she said it and it was a dumb thing to say

2193
02:44:20,060 --> 02:44:22,060
And she couldn't find work after the show

2194
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:29,260
And then some some other guy in another season said like Dumbledore was a bad influence and shouldn't be in a kids book

2195
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:30,900
Cuz he's gay I am paraphrasing

2196
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:37,220
I'm not giving you the exact quote but guys people in these reality shows have put their foot in their mouth before and the networks

2197
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:39,140
Have to say hey, hey

2198
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:44,140
This isn't our opinion. This is just you know, some people were throwing money at to you know

2199
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:46,980
Make fools of themselves on television. Well, just one of his quotes here

2200
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:49,220
So this is a community that's you know

2201
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:54,820
15 or 20 years old and the sexual harassment is part of a culture and if you remove that from the fighting game community

2202
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:56,940
It's not the fighting game community at Starcraft

2203
02:44:56,940 --> 02:45:01,140
Um, you know what I'm gonna say this as

2204
02:45:01,740 --> 02:45:06,900
I've worked in Namco arcades and regularly kicked people's asses when taken three came out

2205
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:12,140
No, I never experienced any of that. I've had a perfectly wonderful

2206
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:17,940
Experience in the fighting game community for as long as I've been in it because the people that I hung out with were not assholes

2207
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:19,940
like you

2208
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:22,140
End of story

2209
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:24,580
He's just an asshole

2210
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:28,820
He is a misogynistic head up his ass asshole

2211
02:45:28,900 --> 02:45:33,460
Like he could probably smell his own, you know shit really really well

2212
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:37,380
I don't know. He probably thinks it doesn't stink do it like part of me

2213
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:40,860
you know part of me wants to be that whole hippie angle like oh

2214
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:46,260
Well, maybe the guy was just under a lot of pressure and you know being on a reality show

2215
02:45:46,260 --> 02:45:49,780
It's got to be a lot of pressure and maybe some dumb stuff leaves your mouth and all this stuff

2216
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:55,580
But then the more I think about I'm like nah cuz he's trying to kind of throw the gaming community under the bus

2217
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:57,580
for something that

2218
02:45:57,580 --> 02:46:02,020
Seems to be something out of coming out of his mouth now granted later on in the talk

2219
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:09,900
It talks about how it's been overheard at tournaments some really hideous things about particular characters that are female in games

2220
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:16,500
They'll say really bad things. I don't care to repeat on this program, you know about about girl fighters

2221
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:22,420
And I'm not talking about girls playing the game but girl fighters in the game will get called things that men fighters

2222
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:28,900
Don't get called that are that are like ten times more hideous, you know, and and that's really unfortunate but I

2223
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:34,540
Think it's also kind of ignorant to think that this is only part of the fighting game community

2224
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:36,780
Like have you ever signed into Xbox Live?

2225
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:39,700
Have you ever played a game on Xbox Live?

2226
02:46:39,700 --> 02:46:48,780
It's just people complaining that it's it's people that end up getting their asses kicked in games or whatever because and so they talk

2227
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:52,780
Up a big, you know, they talk about big storm and then they get their ass handed to them

2228
02:46:52,780 --> 02:46:57,460
I've dealt with them all the time and you know Call of Duty or

2229
02:46:58,380 --> 02:47:02,660
Grand Theft Auto and stuff. It's just like oh, I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna kick your ass

2230
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:06,300
You little bitch and blah blah and then you just beat the shit out of them and they quit

2231
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:13,060
As 100 Matt in our chat room says but apparently plenty of people in the fighting game community agreed with him many professional players, too

2232
02:47:13,420 --> 02:47:18,980
Well, it's interesting what people will say behind the monitor. But as far as the professional players go, you know, I

2233
02:47:20,300 --> 02:47:25,620
What I the the silver lining to this story has if you can find one

2234
02:47:25,900 --> 02:47:33,620
Is that it does seem like the gaming community as a whole is largely rejecting this and saying we don't fucking tolerate this

2235
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:39,340
Yeah, and I think that's exactly what needs to happen in all community and those professional gamers out

2236
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:41,660
There might want to watch what they say

2237
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:47,100
maybe maybe you shouldn't lend your comment to a story like this considering that you know, you have people sponsoring you and

2238
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:52,680
Some companies maybe like mad cats or whatever might not want to sponsor someone that says oh

2239
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:57,940
I think women women should go get raped or something like that, you know, because they were there whatever

2240
02:47:57,940 --> 02:48:02,420
I don't know making like how they basically say that whenever anyone uses Phoenix in

2241
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:04,420
in NBC 3 I

2242
02:48:05,700 --> 02:48:07,700
Just to put a

2243
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:10,780
Ironic spin of sorts on this, you know, this isn't

2244
02:48:11,420 --> 02:48:16,540
this isn't restricted to the fighting game community you remember this show was about the DDR community and

2245
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:19,800
There's been a lot of great things in the DDR community

2246
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:22,960
I've let him met a lot of wonderful people such as my co-host here on this show

2247
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:29,700
I have met some awesome friends for life from playing that game, but I've also met people who will call me fat and ugly

2248
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:31,620
just

2249
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:33,220
based on

2250
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:36,780
you know things that they may or may not know about me and it's just

2251
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:39,500
Really interesting how some of that?

2252
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:42,420
Comes back up all this time later

2253
02:48:44,700 --> 02:48:50,540
Wow, I was reading a little bit further into this and apparently she to basically

2254
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:56,760
Get out of the match. She just started losing on purpose because it was really the the girl that was

2255
02:48:56,760 --> 02:49:02,880
You know made all that he made all those comments about she eventually started losing on purpose and the winner handed over all of his

2256
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:04,880
prizes to her and

2257
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:06,680
I thought that was

2258
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:13,680
Pretty same time. You know what and and I understand that she felt offended by all this name-calling so it's fuck well on TV

2259
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:20,920
Okay, I don't care if it's I'm a marginalizing her where the public can see it. That's national embarrassment. I understand. It's embarrassment

2260
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:25,720
It's embarrassment to the person that's actually seen it. But you know what? It's a fucking embarrassed. He was an asshole

2261
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:30,520
Okay, well then that's fine. He's fine being an asshole. But you know what it's getting into someone's head

2262
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:35,160
That's part of playing a game and I understand that this kind of language is unacceptable as far as you know

2263
02:49:35,160 --> 02:49:40,800
It being on display and stuff, but at the same time you've got to fight through that. In fact, they weren't even playing

2264
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:44,840
Okay, well still though. It's still he was saying it during an interview

2265
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:47,880
Well, then he's just an asshole. So he was an asshole

2266
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:50,680
Embarrassing a teammate

2267
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:55,200
Well, he's an idiot then yeah, I mean there's no room for it

2268
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:58,920
You have to drop even while playing the game and you're trying to psych somebody out

2269
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:02,400
There's just a line that has to be drawn and this guy's crossing it

2270
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,280
I mean, I'm all for you know

2271
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:10,840
I'm all for playful ribbing but dear God some of the stuff you hear on Xbox Live is just repulsive

2272
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:14,640
It's that's not that is it's not somebody trying to get in your head

2273
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:20,720
It's just somebody trolling and saying things that they know are unacceptable in culture, you know and just things

2274
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:28,080
that they they say because they're cowards and they're hiding behind their headset and their little monitors and saying these

2275
02:50:28,480 --> 02:50:33,560
Ridiculous things that would get their ass kicked in any public setting. Well, like I'll give you an example

2276
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:41,440
when I'd play because I told you my first experience playing a land game was playing a Duke Nukem 3d and

2277
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:46,600
When we were in there playing it was quiet except for the voice macros

2278
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:50,840
but then I went later on and they had a private room land and

2279
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:54,820
You just got people talking shit through the mic the whole time

2280
02:50:54,820 --> 02:51:01,360
And I was like it and it was some of the same people that played with before it's just when you get them set

2281
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:03,720
it's like a different reality and

2282
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:09,760
It's really nice but to have this done to your face and in front of all these people that's even worse

2283
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:13,600
that's like the worst kind of marginalization and this guy honestly if

2284
02:51:14,600 --> 02:51:18,660
If I were a more violent person, I would just cut his tongue out

2285
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:25,320
That's a bit extreme. I'd cut his tongue out in a story. That's that's a little crazy. I'm sorry

2286
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:28,560
That's why I said if I was more violent, I would cut his tongue out in a room

2287
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:31,400
Xenocore I think this is important to say

2288
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,080
Guys, the main thing that needs attention here is the following one and this from our chair one

2289
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:41,100
The person at fault here was the team coach someone in a supervisory position. Oh shit. I didn't know that

2290
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:47,600
Too he was still there after the occurrence the fact that an entity will not remove someone that is acting appropriately

2291
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:51,260
Should not be tolerated in a professional position. I

2292
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:57,060
Will just throw this out there. I'm not gonna say I agree or disagree but in that crazy CBS comparison

2293
02:51:57,060 --> 02:52:04,160
I made a minute ago those houseguests who said the anti Jewish and the anti gay things were not thrown out of the house just

2294
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:07,880
Not saying that's right or wrong. Just that it makes for better TV

2295
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,120
Change channel

2296
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:20,140
Well, why do you think I don't play online? Honestly, I I don't play online either unless I know the people

2297
02:52:20,140 --> 02:52:23,040
I mean, it's gotten to that point. It's it's gross and

2298
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:26,200
There are certain communities of games

2299
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:32,320
I will that's one thing I do kind of agree with that in some communities. You don't get it as much as in others

2300
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:34,320
like

2301
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:40,860
For example when I played on PSU for the most part I knew the kind of players I was playing with

2302
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:46,160
There are people who were in the same kind of games that I was and if we had somebody like that

2303
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:48,160
We would block them. I do that on Wow

2304
02:52:48,600 --> 02:52:53,360
You know, I'll even find people in trade chat that are just being complete assholes and block them for no

2305
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:57,760
You know just because I don't want them to remotely message me or anything. I don't want to be around these people

2306
02:52:57,760 --> 02:53:02,120
and cuz sometimes I read trade chat because it's funny, but

2307
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:08,520
It's a matter of putting yourself in that environment and I think that she went into this environment

2308
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:13,320
Not expecting to pretty much be blasted in front of everybody that was there

2309
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:16,120
so I

2310
02:53:16,120 --> 02:53:20,640
Mean if I knew I was gonna get I was going to a situation where that was gonna happen

2311
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:25,760
Well, first of all, I do have to say in myself when I have been in those situations

2312
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:29,080
I have stuck up for myself and have pretty much torn people apart

2313
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:35,300
Because I don't take shit. I really don't I don't take crap. I don't care where I am. I won't take it

2314
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:37,120
but

2315
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:40,300
You know when you've got when you're you know, got a larger guy

2316
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,840
Going off on you. It's really hard to kind of stand up

2317
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:46,120
You know

2318
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:52,280
She really either needed an advocate or he needed to be thrown out and he sort of does look like Hagrid from Harry Potter

2319
02:53:52,280 --> 02:53:56,160
Just saying or the guy from lost. I knock it off. All right

2320
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,040
This is a very polarizing

2321
02:53:59,300 --> 02:54:01,260
Variety of opinions out there in the community

2322
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:04,180
I'm sure a lot of you have something to say it is the show where every gamer has a voice

2323
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:09,460
mail bag at orange laundry calm if you want to have your say or we'll be opening up the skype line in just a

2324
02:54:09,460 --> 02:54:14,580
Minute at username orange lounge radio on skype or are not toll-free number

2325
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:21,420
It's our sub number tonight because the toll-free is down nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven is the phone number again

2326
02:54:21,420 --> 02:54:27,080
That is not toll-free. However, many of you with cell phones probably have nationwide long-distance, please

2327
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:32,800
Please look up the rules of your carrier before you give us a call nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven

2328
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:35,020
We have two more stories before we get there Loki

2329
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:42,260
So Zynga is trying to get away from being supported purely by Facebook release majorly by Facebook

2330
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:47,880
They are coming out with the Zynga platform. It's basically like a website

2331
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:53,080
A run like a portal that you'll be able to kind of interact socially with other people

2332
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:56,080
And be able to play games, you know

2333
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:58,560
Like words with friends and stuff like that

2334
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:03,560
It'll feature a live social stream where you'll be able to see your friends activities player profiles

2335
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:09,000
Also selection of games from other companies as well and

2336
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:10,880
they'll be

2337
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:13,060
launching at Zynga comm

2338
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:19,500
And probably in no way will copy Facebook because you know Zynga is a company that puts out completely original games

2339
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:21,540
They would in no way rip off

2340
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:25,260
You know social media website or anything. That's very successful

2341
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:33,780
Not in least no not even Zynga minus will be the name of it face Zynga minus

2342
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:38,620
they'll have a thing that's called the time stream instead of the timeline and

2343
02:55:40,020 --> 02:55:42,020
You know

2344
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:48,160
They'll have approves instead of likes or you know thumbs up miles smiles

2345
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:51,620
frowny faces I

2346
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:55,540
I

2347
02:55:55,900 --> 02:56:00,780
Good riddance by I just don't know anyone who would go off to Zynga to do this

2348
02:56:00,780 --> 02:56:01,780
I mean

2349
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:07,220
I think part of why Google Plus is struggling is because Facebook has its foot so damn jammed in the door

2350
02:56:07,220 --> 02:56:10,340
Why would you like are they gonna pull their games from Facebook?

2351
02:56:10,340 --> 02:56:15,760
Is that what they're planning on doing because why would I go somewhere assuming I'd play these games, which I'm not

2352
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:24,700
Why would I go somewhere other than Facebook or first five levels on Facebook next 20 levels on Zynga minus?

2353
02:56:24,700 --> 02:56:27,000
Or whatever it's called for Zynga minus

2354
02:56:27,940 --> 02:56:31,100
Well, I don't think that Facebook would let them do that

2355
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:34,060
All right

2356
02:56:34,060 --> 02:56:38,720
One more story for you guys tonight. Hey, this is this is kind of fun. I like these types of hacks

2357
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:42,600
It's Mario meets portal. It's Mari zero

2358
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:50,320
Mario or Mario and Leet speak it's a game of Super Mario Brothers played with the portal gun. I I

2359
02:56:51,160 --> 02:56:56,000
Don't know how I feel about the makers of this game. It's called stab yourself dotnet made this game

2360
02:56:56,480 --> 02:56:59,400
What a what a family-friendly vibe I get from that

2361
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:05,800
It's that the same guy that made nesticle in Genesis. I don't know stab yourself dotnet released Mario

2362
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:10,760
And you can actually there's this whole little youtubey trailer that shows you how it works

2363
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:15,240
Which which is weird because they replace scenes from the wizard and all right, whatever

2364
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:20,920
but it's fun because it's portal and the little cheap cheeps go flying in and out of portals and

2365
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:26,680
They have like all sorts of cool stuff with that it is

2366
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:35,400
A neat idea and there's like level editors and stuff like that in fact show all that stuff well keep scrolling through the end of

2367
02:57:35,400 --> 02:57:37,440
The let me go to the end of this little trailer here

2368
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:40,840
level editor

2369
02:57:42,040 --> 02:57:46,200
I like have a little Mario kind of moves his hand at the guys painting different shares

2370
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:55,720
Horse hats that's cool little super like literally Super Mario and four player co-op really it's kind of fun

2371
02:57:57,640 --> 02:57:59,640
Slow Mario

2372
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:04,880
All for free get it before Nintendo shuts it down run don't walk

2373
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:12,320
Although it has hit the internet now so once it's on the internet. It's on the internet

2374
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:18,960
There's no how long how long before a cease-and-desist go there's no leaving the internet except in the case of

2375
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:23,120
Being Bobby Brown which all episodes have vanished from the internet

2376
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:27,960
Has it really and well they have pretty good lawyers apparently?

2377
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:36,400
The kiss my ass clip hasn't left the internet though. No that has not it's good. It's good to know all right

2378
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:39,960
Let's open up the skyline. We're running a little long tonight, but we got time

2379

Olr

2388
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:17,040
Let's see

2389
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:19,560
Reading some chatroom comments here

2390
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:27,760
Retertainment tweeted us kind of talking about something we were talking about earlier rumor has it the valve is working on a console called the steam

2391
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:31,880
Also, Walmart is working on a console called the stoner employee

2392
02:59:31,880 --> 02:59:38,960
But a bunch it's a redder tainment live in our Chatham. Hey, we got calls coming in hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2393
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:42,640
It's Shane. Hey Shane. What's on your mind, buddy?

2394
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:51,000
Yeah, effect three massive a god Mass Effect 3. Well. We read your comment earlier. What's what's what you thinking about Mass Effect 3?

2395
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:54,000
I'm just thinking about how

2396
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:59,080
You know Tuesday. I'm gonna spend all day trying to romance Caden

2397
02:59:59,080 --> 03:00:03,720
That's it don't even care about the story that day. That's a to try to get my

2398
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:08,640
Sex on with Caden I guess now since I don't which sex should you take I?

2399
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:13,920
Know since I don't follow the Mass Effect story very closely explain to me like

2400
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:16,600
how these

2401
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:23,380
Same gender opposite gender storyline or love mances are kind of integrated into the story I

2402
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:29,100
Don't know well not for the family because this will be the first time by

2403
03:00:29,420 --> 03:00:32,820
Now Shepard can actually get with any guys

2404
03:00:33,420 --> 03:00:39,020
It's near the tree. Yeah, but couldn't wasn't there like female on female romance in the first game. It was all yeah everywhere

2405
03:00:39,140 --> 03:00:41,340
But that's disgusting why would I say that?

2406
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:44,860
To you, maybe but to other people it's kind of hot

2407
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:47,860
well it was I

2408
03:00:47,860 --> 03:00:53,500
Guess you could like romance this the sorry chick Liara

2409
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:59,220
but she's like kind of you know the kind of not and then in the second one there is a

2410
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:02,420
Girl named Kelly who is worthless

2411
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:07,580
they can also let die that you can like have a fling with I guess but nobody cares about that because

2412
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:13,940
Caden can be romanced in three and that's the most important development in this entire series and that is confirmed absolutely

2413
03:01:13,940 --> 03:01:17,660
Confirmed you can have hot gay sexy times with Caden

2414
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:22,500
From everything I'm reading the official strategy guide says no

2415
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:27,940
But you know those aren't always like a final versions that get but people are finding sound files

2416
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:31,820
There's been pictures posted I guess and then somebody unlocked an achievement

2417
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,600
Romancing him with the male Shepard, so

2418
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:40,020
Yes, this is what I've been looking forward to for weeks now because that's as long as I've been into the series

2419
03:01:40,020 --> 03:01:46,100
Why is it limited to only certain characters? Do you think it's just kind of like an assets thing like because there's so much voice

2420
03:01:46,100 --> 03:01:48,100
Acting that goes into it and all this stuff

2421
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:53,340
it could be that but honestly they're trying to build a world there and

2422
03:01:53,940 --> 03:01:59,620
As they probably saw with Dragon Age 2 if you make everybody bisexual it really takes away from

2423
03:02:00,340 --> 03:02:05,780
Like real true character development not everybody should be romancable by everybody else

2424
03:02:05,780 --> 03:02:10,960
All right, if you play the games Caden clearly wants you as a male Shepard. He just won't act on it

2425
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:15,740
I'm gonna assume that gay Lovins isn't the only reason you play Mass Effect. Although maybe it is

2426
03:02:16,380 --> 03:02:23,620
Why no, it's it's like the best sci-fi story. I have experienced since probably Battlestar Galactica

2427
03:02:23,620 --> 03:02:31,140
There you go. I'm really into the characters and the different races and like just the back story is really interesting

2428
03:02:31,620 --> 03:02:35,420
Here's my question. I you know have kind of missed the boat on Mass Effect

2429
03:02:35,420 --> 03:02:39,820
Um, it convinced me I should play Mass Effect and what game should I start with?

2430
03:02:39,820 --> 03:02:42,980
Should I go back and start with one or should I just jump right into three?

2431
03:02:44,420 --> 03:02:48,700
No, you should not just jump right into three because every game carries

2432
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:57,140
Information over from the previous one with the exception of one obviously and three and that one will give you default

2433
03:02:58,060 --> 03:03:03,700
Choices that you will could have made in the previous games and you will come up like such an evil terrible person

2434
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:08,740
If you start with the default choices from what I've read like you let some of your team members die

2435
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:12,660
You don't care about a lot of things. You're pretty much just a complete jerk

2436
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:16,980
But what what would you be playing it on? That's how I'll tell you what to start with

2437
03:03:16,980 --> 03:03:22,220
Well, cuz I was gonna say I want to play it on PlayStation 3 because that's kind of my console right now

2438
03:03:22,220 --> 03:03:24,220
But they don't have Mass Effect 1 on it

2439
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:25,220
No

2440
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:31,820
But if you pick up two it has this thing called Mass Effect Genesis where you play an inert like an interactive

2441
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:35,280
graphic novel of the first thing so you make

2442
03:03:35,820 --> 03:03:41,140
Choices that are important in the first game through that graphic novel that will carry into the second one

2443
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:45,900
But but then I would say play it on PC, but play it on PC

2444
03:03:46,900 --> 03:03:51,740
Because you can usually get them pretty cheap like I've seen a lot of $5.00 sales for both one and two

2445
03:03:51,740 --> 03:03:53,740
But then I don't know trophies

2446
03:03:54,620 --> 03:03:56,620
They have achievements though

2447
03:03:56,620 --> 03:04:02,740
You really need trophies. I need to increase my trophy level my trophy levels pathetic Shane. I

2448
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:05,540
Think mine is too, but I don't care

2449
03:04:07,740 --> 03:04:09,740
Like started beyond one trophy

2450
03:04:10,220 --> 03:04:15,980
Hits done in our chat room says so there's actually an achievement for the gay option now now all the completionists will see it true

2451
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,620
Is it to is that true?

2452
03:04:17,620 --> 03:04:19,620
No, no the paramour

2453
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:26,020
It's just a pair more achievement from where I understand which is when you romance any character as any Shepherd. There you go

2454
03:04:26,020 --> 03:04:32,340
So I could have got that with stupid that Chobot chick from IGN her character

2455
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:37,220
Acidic vampire in chat says Genesis is still not the same as the full experience

2456
03:04:37,220 --> 03:04:44,340
Oh, no, it won't be but it'll still have some important decisions that you actually get to make decisions off now

2457
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:48,940
Remember, I know I'm terrible Shane. I am terrible at shooters. Well, I still okay

2458
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:56,060
All right, well the first one barely qualifies as a shooter. So if you got that on PC, you would be fine. Um

2459
03:04:56,060 --> 03:04:59,740
You don't have to worry about ammo you worry about overheating your gun and there are classes

2460
03:05:00,100 --> 03:05:06,300
That play like mages or kind of play like rogues and stuff like that. So it's that you can handle to

2461
03:05:07,100 --> 03:05:14,180
More shooting than the first game, but it also goes a lot quicker like the combat

2462
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:18,980
So it's not so bad 3 is just pretty much a shooter from what I can tell from the demo

2463
03:05:18,980 --> 03:05:22,440
But it's still really fun. You know, it's a shooter, right?

2464
03:05:23,300 --> 03:05:28,560
What you can also disable the shooter from what I hear like there's like story only mode or short for shooting mode

2465
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:33,420
You can't it's funny because they give you that option to demo but I haven't even tried

2466
03:05:34,060 --> 03:05:38,380
The the story only or the shooting only I just go back to the the default

2467
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:43,900
That's the effect experience. I should probably do that at some point. All right

2468
03:05:43,900 --> 03:05:49,820
I need one decision in the first game that is hunting me now and I kind of want to start the entire series over

2469
03:05:49,820 --> 03:05:54,460
But I only have tomorrow. That's such a you know, I can't do it. All right, Shane

2470
03:05:54,460 --> 03:05:55,780
I gotta let you go so we can get more calls

2471
03:05:55,780 --> 03:06:00,020
But um, I I will give it some thought if I can tear myself away from Wow

2472
03:06:00,580 --> 03:06:05,940
And you saw those pictures of Kayden, so, you know what you're missing out on send me more

2473
03:06:05,940 --> 03:06:09,860
I think I might need more when you unlock the special scene. Send me a copy

2474
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:18,260
When what when you unlock the special scene, send me a copy. I'll pick fraps pictures with it. All right, sounds exciting. All right

2475
03:06:18,780 --> 03:06:20,460
All right. Bye

2476
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:25,060
All right. I thought at first he said faps pictures and I'm like, oh that's kind of awkward

2477
03:06:25,060 --> 03:06:31,740
I don't need to I don't know that's we're friends not like that. No fraps Oh fraps. That's what he said fraps

2478
03:06:31,740 --> 03:06:36,620
More calls the skylines lighting up tonight. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2479
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:40,300
Yo guys is Preston from OKC. How you doing? Hey, how you doing?

2480
03:06:40,300 --> 03:06:45,340
Xenocore, of course Xenocore from Oklahoma City. What's on your mind tonight? Not much, man

2481
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:48,980
I wasn't sure if I talked about on this show, but I've been playing a bit of air mech

2482
03:06:50,500 --> 03:06:54,820
Here's Ogg's way clone that got made last year. No, I don't know about this. Tell me more about this

2483
03:06:55,140 --> 03:07:01,260
Alright, it's on the the Android the Chrome Android marketplace and it plays within the Chrome browser

2484
03:07:01,260 --> 03:07:04,620
But essentially it's here's Ogg's way in a 3d environment

2485
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:10,500
Not a full 3d game might you still place like the old here's Ogg's way, but it's updated in 3d and stuff. It's really cool

2486
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:12,860
That's not a game. I'm super familiar with I have to admit

2487
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:19,300
So what if assume I don't know anything about this game because I don't so well soccer. Can you hook me up on this one?

2488
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:21,500
What's that?

2489
03:07:21,500 --> 03:07:24,700
I was hoping soccer might be able to fill you in on here's Ogg's way

2490
03:07:24,700 --> 03:07:30,500
Here's that's more of a classic gaming kind of her dog's why oh shoot. I haven't played that in ages

2491
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:33,260
It's a really good game though. Yeah, it's pretty much the first

2492
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:39,420
RTS that was created on a console at least on the 16-bit consoles. Anyway, yeah, it was on

2493
03:07:39,980 --> 03:07:47,900
Genesis correct. Yes. I have I know I have it. It's I haven't touched it in ages. But yeah, it's it's pretty good

2494
03:07:47,900 --> 03:07:49,940
I should lend you my Genesis so you can play it

2495
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:54,880
Well, I have this thing called an emulator and I know it's questionably legal, but let's be real Rob

2496
03:07:54,880 --> 03:07:57,660
How many Genesis do I have? That's true. You have a lot

2497
03:07:57,660 --> 03:08:02,340
Yeah, but uh, but did because they have actually have it in the browser

2498
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:06,100
I thought it was actually gonna come out on a marketplaces for the different systems

2499
03:08:06,100 --> 03:08:11,180
I was browsing around to find out for now. It's beta so you can play it for free. We're just kind of awesome. So

2500
03:08:11,740 --> 03:08:14,580
That's pretty cool. So where what's the website where I can play this app?

2501
03:08:15,100 --> 03:08:21,280
Well, actually you open up your Chrome browser and type in air mech chrome and it takes you right to the link in the marketplace

2502
03:08:21,280 --> 03:08:26,940
To get it. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's one of those like chrome store things like they're kind of version iOS

2503
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:32,740
Yeah, I know what you're talking about. All right, I'll check that out. Yeah, it plays really simple. It's not too complicated and

2504
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:35,700
Its speed is really quick, too

2505
03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:41,080
I haven't had a chance to play with too many other people since it isn't beta and I'm guessing they're not usually playing when I

2506
03:08:41,080 --> 03:08:44,900
Am but yeah, it really feels good. It feels like the old-school game

2507
03:08:44,900 --> 03:08:48,380
All I'm missing is the soundtrack pretty much and it'd be awesome. Right, right

2508
03:08:48,900 --> 03:08:52,180
What else have you been playing this week? Are you on the Mass Effect 3 hype trainer?

2509
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:59,900
Not really because my roommates gonna ruin it for me because he's been posting all over just two more days, man

2510
03:08:59,900 --> 03:09:01,620
It's like he's partying already

2511
03:09:01,620 --> 03:09:07,220
but uh, but he plays through it non-stop and we all get sucked in because we know it's a solid story and

2512
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:10,100
We're all in half

2513
03:09:10,340 --> 03:09:16,620
Because me and our roommates are all ex-military guys half this stuff that happens in the accident half the words

2514
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:20,240
We just giggle laugh all day long as we heard it elsewhere, too. So

2515
03:09:20,240 --> 03:09:24,120
So I'm gonna hide in my room until they come out with a game of the year edition

2516
03:09:24,120 --> 03:09:27,560
And maybe I'll pick it up then kind of what we were saying earlier about Street Fighter cross Tekken

2517
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,800
You're taking that approach the game of the year edition

2518
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:36,520
Well, I don't really see any difference between on disk content and content is downloaded later either way. They're screwing you

2519
03:09:36,520 --> 03:09:42,360
It really doesn't matter what medium you happen to whether it comes early on the disk or later through a download

2520
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:48,200
It's stuff they're holding back and it's nowhere near what they used to do with expansion packs back in the day

2521
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:50,960
So as far as I'm concerned I can wait for it all I think again

2522
03:09:50,960 --> 03:09:57,100
It's really about and it's a really tricky thing to weigh especially with the iOS games really screwing up the whole economy of games

2523
03:09:57,100 --> 03:10:00,360
I mean you really just have to weigh is the game

2524
03:10:00,360 --> 03:10:06,400
I'm getting on disk with with no unlocks and all that is that content worth the 50 60 dollars

2525
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:08,160
I'm being asked to pay for it and you know

2526
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:13,620
for example Mass Effect 3 has been very controversial for this very thing about the whole they have the day one DLC and some people

2527
03:10:13,620 --> 03:10:16,200
Are like that's a ripoff and it should be free and dah-dah-dah

2528
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:19,360
You really just have to weigh well throwing that aside

2529
03:10:19,360 --> 03:10:25,040
It's not paid to unlock content is the content on the disk worth $60 and for example, Shane our last caller

2530
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:29,720
I'm sure would say yes, but other people might look at that and go, you know what? No, not so much

2531
03:10:29,720 --> 03:10:31,760
I'm gonna wait for the game of the year edition, you know

2532
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:35,160
I remember hearing I was listening to the early

2533
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:42,080
Coverage of the beta that like total biscuit was doing online and he was ratting and raving about the content on the disk being

2534
03:10:42,080 --> 03:10:45,880
Unlockable. It's like dude. The game was finished three months ago

2535
03:10:45,880 --> 03:10:50,800
There's to have time to put more project space if there's more project space to fill they're gonna fill it

2536
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:54,840
you know not to mention the fact that it's like one of the characters is is a

2537
03:10:56,080 --> 03:11:01,220
Character essential. It's not even essential to the storyline. It's just a character they threw in as

2538
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:06,080
DLC that happened to be finished before the release date. So they put it on the master disk

2539
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:11,400
So half the people that are bitching because of what what I'm trying not to be too spoilery about it

2540
03:11:11,400 --> 03:11:18,120
But half the people that are, you know whining and moaning. It's like what it's it's this guy. It should be in the main game

2541
03:11:18,120 --> 03:11:21,840
No, it doesn't have to be in the main game. It was made after the fact when the main game was finished

2542
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:26,840
So deal I mean if you if you want it by if you don't, you know

2543
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:30,480
Hold on to your money and wait for them to package it all together the game of the year edition

2544
03:11:30,480 --> 03:11:32,480
Like I did with Batman Arkham Asylum. Oh

2545
03:11:33,240 --> 03:11:35,860
Yeah, it's another one that's had a lot a lot of DLC

2546
03:11:35,860 --> 03:11:37,800
But see I love I love Arkham City

2547
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:41,960
The base game was was worth it to me, but I can see where some people get turned off by all that DLC

2548
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:45,760
Lots and lots of it. Yeah, I might end up by Arkham City, too

2549
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:48,880
I'm not really waiting on any DLC or anything, but uh, it's still

2550
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:54,320
It's a solid game without all the DLC even the I mean the Catwoman stuff

2551
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:57,680
I mean, I like it a lot and I think it's kind of worth the new price

2552
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:00,000
But you know, I think even if you took it all out

2553
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:04,200
I still think you'd have a solid game. So I thought she was still playable a bit in the main game

2554
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:08,720
I think she's cut out completely see the thing is if you have her DLC

2555
03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:11,680
They integrate her very slickly into the main story

2556
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:15,740
But if you don't have her DLC all her little stuff is kind of cut out just skipped over

2557
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:18,360
So I think you see her and you interact with her

2558
03:12:18,360 --> 03:12:22,440
But you never do the stuff where you play as her and see poison ivy and all that

2559
03:12:22,640 --> 03:12:26,120
Yeah, because yeah when I saw it when I saw her combat mechanics like you know

2560
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:29,720
That's an interesting way to rework the way this mechanic works. That was kind of cool

2561
03:12:29,720 --> 03:12:34,720
So I was kind of curious to see that so remember what I seen earlier about how oh, yeah

2562
03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:36,720
it's gonna take them, you know a

2563
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:42,600
Couple weeks, you know about a week to have it on there. You have it all locked hackers already got all that

2564
03:12:42,600 --> 03:12:46,680
Are you fed across Tekken? Yep, and there's oh by the way, they're selling call. He's away with code

2565
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:49,800
There is always a way with code. All right, Zena core

2566
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:53,200
I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls any quick final thoughts you want to get out

2567
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:58,660
Yeah, just hold on to your money people go buy food and stuff. That's not getting more expensive every day

2568
03:12:58,660 --> 03:13:02,860
Yeah, the rising cost of gas. It's gonna cost more to drive to the game store than to buy the game

2569
03:13:02,900 --> 03:13:06,780
All right, Zena core. Take care, buddy. Thanks for calling. All right. Later. Later

2570
03:13:07,460 --> 03:13:13,740
And no, it's even squeeze in one more call orange launch radio on Skype or 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67 not toll-free

2571
03:13:14,540 --> 03:13:16,860
No, it's even funnier too is the fact that

2572
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:21,960
Nevermind

2573
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:23,960
Alrighty, then I'll go back to Twitter. All right

2574
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:29,680
Uh, we got a tweet here from Tony texture saying hey guys just listening live for the first time

2575
03:13:29,880 --> 03:13:34,520
Hopefully I can get in on Skype. Did I mention I'm an Aussie. Well, I hope you do get through I want to hear the

2576
03:13:34,520 --> 03:13:36,040
accent

2577
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:39,860
Because you know Americans love the Aussie accents. I don't know the DLC

2578
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:43,000
They're the codes or whatever the actual like

2579
03:13:43,880 --> 03:13:49,080
Hashes or whatever for each all the DLC characters was in a CSV file the main directory of the game

2580
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:51,200
Oh, you've got to be kidding. It seems so lazy

2581
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:58,400
All right. Let's go to the phones and take one more call here tonight. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2582
03:14:00,880 --> 03:14:07,840
Soul throw hi, I'm sorry. Who's this soul throw soul throw what's on your mind?

2583
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:16,460
It's the one you is it the guy that I just read his tweet yeah, he's calling are you Tony texture on Twitter?

2584
03:14:16,460 --> 03:14:21,260
Yes. Yes. I am. Oh my hi. Talk about timing. Good lord

2585
03:14:21,620 --> 03:14:27,820
Well, there must be a hideous delay going across the pond, but that's alright. What's on your mind? What welcome to the show?

2586
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:30,020
How you doing? Thank you. Uh, I

2587
03:14:30,540 --> 03:14:33,940
Just want to say I'm a big fan. I've been listening since

2588
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:37,820
Episode 250 so it's been a while. Oh my god

2589
03:14:39,820 --> 03:14:41,820
Yeah, I know

2590
03:14:41,820 --> 03:14:47,300
But well my just you know call I've actually this is the second call I've ever used on Skype

2591
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:53,260
So yeah, well it works if the first call was to the echo 1 2 3 lady and the second call was to us

2592
03:14:53,660 --> 03:14:55,660
We can let you know it worked

2593
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:58,020
Well, what kind of game what kind of games are you playing lately?

2594
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:03,700
I'm playing gives 3 so I'm just going through the horde mode with some buddies. Mm-hmm

2595
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:10,180
Saints Row, I'm about quarter way into that Saints Road the third. It's so amazing. Yep, and

2596
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:11,700
and

2597
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:13,700
just going through

2598
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:15,740
Street Fighter Super Street Fighter, so

2599
03:15:16,580 --> 03:15:21,260
Classic, let me ask you about this since you are from an from Aussie land

2600
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:27,700
In Australia has been in the news even up here a lot lately with this whole ratings board stuff that's going on

2601
03:15:27,700 --> 03:15:32,620
And oh, yeah good times. Good times. Yeah, good times. The fact that some games you guys know, it's true

2602
03:15:32,620 --> 03:15:40,620
You guys have not been able to buy Mortal Kombat yet, right? No, no, there's many other ways to get so some of the ways

2603
03:15:40,620 --> 03:15:42,820
Loki was talking about with unlock content. Yes

2604
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:48,460
But now apparently it seems like it is the the motion has started to create a new

2605
03:15:49,020 --> 03:15:52,100
Rating there so that you can get some of the more adult games

2606
03:15:52,460 --> 03:15:55,980
How do you how do you kind of feel about how your country's been handling a lot of that? Oh

2607
03:15:56,620 --> 03:16:01,500
It's just just messed up. I don't know. They always change their mind all the time

2608
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:06,500
It was actually my state that is holding back to our rating. So

2609
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:09,940
It's all you guys, huh? Yeah, pretty much

2610
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:15,900
Well, I hope that August would are you interested in playing the ultra-violent games?

2611
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:21,580
Some of them yeah, I've already played Mortal Kombat if that's what you're asking

2612
03:16:21,580 --> 03:16:24,020
I was gonna say if you're playing Saints Row the third

2613
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:28,620
I wonder how that one got through because that one's pretty bad. But yeah, Mortal Kombat I guess is even more extreme

2614
03:16:28,620 --> 03:16:31,700
Yeah, I don't know. I think it's sort of like, you know a

2615
03:16:32,380 --> 03:16:34,140
bit more stylized

2616
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:36,980
When Mortal Kombat's got a lot of blood, you know

2617
03:16:38,260 --> 03:16:42,260
Right Wow, you know a lot of folks in the chat room are commenting

2618
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:45,860
I love in the fact that somebody from Australia is on the line Australia in the house and

2619
03:16:46,620 --> 03:16:48,340
some folks in chat

2620
03:16:48,340 --> 03:16:50,840
Frisbee says I'm so glad the internet as fast as it is

2621
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:55,100
I mean think about it from Australia to California in only a few seconds of delay, you know

2622
03:16:55,100 --> 03:16:56,960
That's one of the really humbling things about doing the show

2623
03:16:56,960 --> 03:17:00,220
I gotta say, you know, we went from doing a show or you know

2624
03:17:00,220 --> 03:17:06,220
Being friends playing it one arcade in one little city in one state, you know to having this worldwide

2625
03:17:07,220 --> 03:17:09,220
shit talking fest

2626
03:17:10,740 --> 03:17:18,420
I was actually worried about the the lag. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so I've got a question for you. All right, go for it

2627
03:17:18,420 --> 03:17:25,820
Um, what's the game you love but everyone else hates like, you know for me it's a

2628
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:33,460
Alone in the dark for 360 everyone else hates it, but I loved it. So, I don't know and why did you love alone in the dark?

2629
03:17:34,460 --> 03:17:40,100
I don't know. I was a big fan of the original one the one that was actually 3d but was terrible terrible 3d

2630
03:17:40,100 --> 03:17:44,260
But I liked it was pretty scary at the time. So I just thought I'd buy it

2631
03:17:44,260 --> 03:17:47,500
I bought it cheap so, you know, but everyone was telling me don't buy it

2632
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:52,780
I only bought it for about 12 bucks Aussie. So I'm not sure what that is the u.s. Probably like

2633
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:56,140
$15 something probably sounds about right. Mm-hmm

2634
03:17:56,660 --> 03:18:02,380
Yeah, so what games do you love and everyone else hates good damn question?

2635
03:18:02,380 --> 03:18:06,220
What game do you love that? Everybody else hates anyone want to take a stab at it? I

2636
03:18:07,140 --> 03:18:10,780
Have had some people give me crap for liking fantasy zone

2637
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:16,240
Because honestly, I love fantasy zone and yeah, you saw that on the master system

2638
03:18:16,240 --> 03:18:20,900
Yeah people I think games kind of derpy and I actually like the Tengen version for the nest

2639
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:23,760
Even though it's probably not one of the greatest versions

2640
03:18:25,580 --> 03:18:29,340
I'll answer this for you blue dragon. I love blue dragon. Oh

2641
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:35,840
See what I tell you what I tell you I got one my he loves it and everyone else is like not

2642
03:18:35,840 --> 03:18:41,900
I won't touch it. I like to be evolution games that were all in Dreamcast. They were pretty good and

2643
03:18:42,860 --> 03:18:44,860
I liked

2644
03:18:44,860 --> 03:18:46,540
I

2645
03:18:46,540 --> 03:18:52,500
Have a number of games that every time I bring them up. My husband goes. Oh, that's so bad. I'm like you suck

2646
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:59,400
I'm trying to think there was one that I mentioned earlier that I absolutely love and he was just going off on it and

2647
03:18:59,980 --> 03:19:01,980
Offered life of me. I can't remember what it was

2648
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:08,900
That's the usual way of conversations go in my house as I love games that he hates. So nice. That's the way to go

2649
03:19:08,900 --> 03:19:14,540
Um for me, I guess I have a couple answers for I I think one of them would honestly be Final Fantasy 13

2650
03:19:14,540 --> 03:19:17,940
I think I really loved Final Fantasy 13 and there were so many people that just

2651
03:19:18,660 --> 03:19:23,860
Despised it. Yeah, you defend that with the sword and shield. I do. I don't think it was I

2652
03:19:24,460 --> 03:19:26,540
Here's the thing though as much as I defend the game

2653
03:19:26,540 --> 03:19:28,660
I get why it has haters

2654
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:35,380
Because it did go a radically different direction from the earlier games and it did kind it was pretty linear in the beginning

2655
03:19:35,380 --> 03:19:39,900
But the battle system alone just kind of oh my god, just just just makes it so amazing

2656
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:42,780
So that's that's kind of the one I would pick

2657
03:19:43,300 --> 03:19:49,880
Otherwise, I'm gonna go with another interesting pick and it might sound weird to the listeners of this show, but I think DDR

2658
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:54,100
I think there's a lot of people that looked at dance dance revolution back in the day and went

2659
03:19:54,580 --> 03:20:00,100
What a bunch of crap music that people stomp on arrows to what the hell are they doing up there?

2660
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:02,700
And you know, we all defended that game

2661
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:09,020
So much and we really loved that game and we were very passionate when it stopped for a while and so forth

2662
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:14,180
So I think I think in a way even though a lot of listeners of this show may not realize there's a lot of haters

2663
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:16,180
out there DDR

2664
03:20:16,300 --> 03:20:22,660
Loki you have an answer the game that you loved everybody hates. That's easy. They're gonna be earth defense force. Oh, yeah, I love that

2665
03:20:23,220 --> 03:20:24,780
site

2666
03:20:24,780 --> 03:20:32,580
um, I think a lot of people like the excite truck excite truck would be one that was you know, definitely um, I

2667
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:35,940
Thought I a lot of people like excite truck. It's hard to say just didn't sell

2668
03:20:35,940 --> 03:20:41,700
Well, it's it's hard to you know, big game that people don't like maybe gals panic. Not a lot of people like

2669
03:20:45,060 --> 03:20:48,660
It's not bad, I don't know if I like that game it was fun

2670
03:20:48,660 --> 03:20:55,780
Um, let's see, I'm reading some of the comments in chat I really love this

2671
03:20:56,380 --> 03:20:59,460
DDR dollar bill says I love Tony Hawk underground 2

2672
03:21:00,100 --> 03:21:04,140
Infidel Final Fantasy mystic quest that's a good one

2673
03:21:04,700 --> 03:21:10,420
Yeah, I remember wasn't there a time that you were playing like the crap out of that game. Yeah, there was

2674
03:21:11,220 --> 03:21:13,700
Final Fantasy mystic quest is awesome. Let's see

2675
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:16,700
Rama says Duke Nukem forever for me

2676
03:21:16,700 --> 03:21:22,500
DDR dollar bill says Robocop on the NES chiggers says EVO on Super Nintendo

2677
03:21:23,460 --> 03:21:29,700
Lots of lots and comments on the chat room on that. So, uh, was it Street Fighter EX 3?

2678
03:21:31,140 --> 03:21:34,700
Good, but a lot of people gave it, you know a lot of trouble

2679
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:41,400
I really liked um that it integrated I didn't start sharing the engine that rival schools was using

2680
03:21:41,400 --> 03:21:47,280
Yeah, yeah when they did was a project something or other for Dreamcast. Yeah

2681
03:21:49,720 --> 03:21:54,160
Yeah, because I think that EX 3 started using the same fighting engine that rival that

2682
03:21:56,120 --> 03:21:58,120
The project justice was using

2683
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:05,920
Yeah, I was hoping that one of those characters would pop over to Street Fighter Tekken or maybe Marvel vs. Capcom

2684
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:12,400
So, but they might be owned by the other developer or whatever

2685
03:22:12,400 --> 03:22:14,760
I hope to do the X-rays

2686
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:19,040
Well, who was your main your main character in that in that series? Cuz I was I used

sort of joust them into the air and then you

2693
03:22:37,680 --> 03:22:43,040
Punch them down from earth or something like that from the moon. It was crazy. That game was just so underappreciated

2694
03:22:43,480 --> 03:22:46,760
I'm glad to find somebody else who likes that series. All right

2695
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:50,560
Well, well, we could nostalgia all night long, but unfortunately we got to wrap up the show here

2699
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:09,240
Wow, okay easy. Well, it's almost dinner time and I gotta say I knew we do have another Australian

2700
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:16,260
That's very close to olr. Deke man was originally from Australia. He's moved to Canada since he's an Aussie in Canada

2701
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:21,880
But he's the guy who built our website. Yes. Oh, we've had a lot of great contributions from Australia

Love the worldly calls

2706
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:39,760
It leaves me on warm fuzzies that oh my god. This show is like really out there. It's crazy

2707
03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:42,900
I have always want to go to Australia. I really have

2708
03:23:44,200 --> 03:23:49,560
It's just amazing. All right, let me finish up a few of these tweets. We do have a few more tweets

2709
03:23:49,560 --> 03:23:52,360

2710
03:23:52,760 --> 03:24:00,600

2711
03:24:00,600 --> 03:24:03,440
Yeah, oh, it's gonna be free interesting

2712
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:08,640
The game was originally gonna be $20, but now it is going to be free. It will still have microtransactions

2713
03:24:08,680 --> 03:24:15,040
But it's not a pay-to-win game meaning. It's not a Facebook game. So we'll see what that really adds up being in the future

2714
03:24:15,300 --> 03:24:18,340
Thanks for the tweet. I had no idea about that and I was curious about that game

2715
03:24:19,320 --> 03:24:23,840
Act deaf sends us a couple tweets here. One of his on Darkstalkers for which we already talked about

2716
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:26,960
I want to wrap up the show here quickly. He also sends us a

2717
03:24:26,960 --> 03:24:32,800
Trailer for Forza Horizon. Did you watch it already? Yeah, I mean, here's the thing

2718
03:24:32,800 --> 03:24:39,580
It's like I don't know if that's it doesn't look real to me. I mean really it's it's all like stock footage

2719
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:41,580
and then like the title Forza

2720
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:44,880
Forza Horizon and

2721
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:50,200
It's just like someone typed it out. So I mean, yeah. Yeah. Well the new Forza game coming sure

2722
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:54,600
I'll buy that but I don't know. I don't even know if that's a legit trailer or not

2723
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:58,640
Oh and since I didn't mention it before I did close the skype line guys. Sorry to those that didn't get through

2724
03:24:58,640 --> 03:25:00,560

2725
03:25:00,560 --> 03:25:05,000
Um, please send us an email with your thoughts mailbag orange on twitter.com or a tweet for next week

2726
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:12,160
Other quick thoughts here dark Tetsuya says for those going to game developers conference the glorious train wrecks kiosk

2727
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:16,120
I remember him talking plugging this on an earlier show will be a play kiosk 23

2728
03:25:16,120 --> 03:25:22,520
I'm most proud of ball buster invasion think breakout meets space invaders. It could be interesting. Very cool

2729
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:28,680
I wish I was going to GDC. Unfortunately, I'm not and act F sends us the jet set radio HD trailer

2730
03:25:28,680 --> 03:25:33,700
Is this different from that teaser? We saw earlier? Yeah, it's actual game. I did not see let me look at this real quick here

2731
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:41,600
I just want to know if they're gonna have the music

2732
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:50,120
Well, you know somebody brought up a good point last week and that is you know, there were licenses

2733
03:25:50,120 --> 03:25:53,200
Yes, but there was a lot of Sega in-house music done for it

2734
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:55,880
That was still really good and somebody brought that up in chat last week

2735
03:25:55,880 --> 03:25:58,960
And I think that's important to remember so we will get the Sega stuff for sure

2736
03:26:03,080 --> 03:26:05,080
It was so awesome

2737
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:14,080
You

2738
03:26:14,080 --> 03:26:16,080

2740
03:26:25,160 --> 03:26:30,200
Love the Celsius style. Yeah, it's a great art style. I love that summer 2012 for that

2741
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:35,160
Well, that'll be part of summer of arcade you think yeah you think

2742
03:26:35,800 --> 03:26:37,560
All right. Um

2743
03:26:37,560 --> 03:26:44,040

2744
03:26:44,360 --> 03:26:52,080
Apparently it was outed by the Xbox Live marketplace that a new fable game is coming to Xbox Live arcade that being fable heroes

2745
03:26:52,080 --> 03:26:54,080
It's like a Mario Party type game

2746
03:26:54,640 --> 03:26:56,640
that's a beat-em-up also and

2747
03:26:56,640 --> 03:27:02,960
It may be expecting an announcement that's gonna become an uh, maybe during GDC. Will it be on reels?

2748
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:09,280
It probably is because it's a board game. So yes, I had to go there. Sorry

2749
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:13,000
That's it and

2750
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:14,000
Yeah, it says well

2751
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:19,280
It says players will be earning gold coins that can be spent to upgrade characters and items in both

2752
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:23,960
That game and fable the journey which would be coming for Kinect sometime later this year

All right dark soccer your final thought tonight corporations are not people

2772
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:47,240

2773
03:28:47,560 --> 03:28:48,720
awesome

2774
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:52,160
