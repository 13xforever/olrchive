1
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:12,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:20,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, March 25th, 2012, a classic arcade game will come to Xbox Live Arcade with Kinect controls.

3
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon stopped stocking one release from this month.

4
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And could games soon carry a warning similar to cigarettes?

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,920
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

6
00:00:58,436 --> 00:00:58,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Hungry?

7
00:00:59,217 --> 00:00:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Hungry?

8
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you about to participate in the Hunger Games?

9
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:04,423
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so hungry?

10
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:05,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

11
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Hungry Hungry Hippo Games?

12
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm actually not hungry because I had broth, but I will be fasting every Sunday now.

13
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:12,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is this a religious thing?

14
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:12,852
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

15
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:13,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you never know.

16
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the shot, right?

17
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for my health.

18
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:17,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

19
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:21,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a new, I don't want to say a new craze, but... No, it's not.

20
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:25,158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something I've been debating doing for like the last year or so, so now I'm actually doing it.

21
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:28,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming you've done the appropriate research and all that good stuff.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Just letting the listeners know.

24
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you're doing on a whim.

25
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:36,964
[SPEAKER_06]: In a month, I will be discussing my results.

26
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you incorporating any extra gaming into this?

27
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:41,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Same stuff I'm always doing.

28
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I do yoga like every day.

29
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:44,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm good.

30
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:45,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

31
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:45,898
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

32
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Also say hello to definitely not fasting Techmaster Loki.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny you used to say that actually.

34
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:55,202
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife wants me to do that too starting after.

35
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think your wife may or may not have been influenced by a co-host on this show?

36
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:06,772
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she did that because she had to not eat for a couple days for a procedure she just had done.

37
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:12,096
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's like, well, if I can keep doing that, I can lose some weight.

38
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:14,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is dangerous territory, though.

39
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:16,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Fasting actually isn't bad for you.

40
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I just want to make, you know, it's a gaming show, we're getting way off topic, but this is much different than, you know, some people don't eat, I mean, it seems like with this fasting thing, you're still eating some, and it's a scheduled thing, you're still eating some nutritional value things, it's just not a lot of the...

41
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:43,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically just cutting out, you know, and part of it for me that I really like about it is that I have a full 24 hours where I don't think about food.

42
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:52,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been more productive, I've gotten so much stuff done, and honestly I felt super energized after I was done with my first one.

43
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Wednesday from 3 o'clock p.m.

44
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,309
[SPEAKER_06]: to Thursday, 3 o'clock p.m.

45
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Went to yoga that night, felt great.

46
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: and it really is kind of crazy.

47
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:05,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just sort of like my energy level shot way up.

48
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:10,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to draw a clear line between what you're doing and what someone with a mental disorder who doesn't eat does.

49
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:12,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just trying to make that distinction clear.

50
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: A person with a mental disorder would just not eat.

51
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:17,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, completely not.

52
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:18,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

53
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe do like, what was her face on the Partridge family?

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan Day?

55
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Who'd ate nothing but carrots and turned orange.

56
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:24,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:25,262
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

58
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that happened to me when I was a baby.

59
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:27,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

60
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:28,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beta carotene.

61
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different when you're a baby.

62
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:36,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I mean, I'm saying that, you know, there's people that will just, you know, do all this stuff.

63
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is really something that I've put research into and read a bunch of different stuff.

64
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm doing what I do with anything.

65
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:44,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I try it for a month.

66
00:03:45,177 --> 00:03:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I see how I feel.

67
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:46,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Check my health.

68
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is someone who used to get blood tested every six months.

69
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to make that clear for the listeners, especially if it's your first time listening.

70
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to make that clear.

71
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:55,765
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a clear difference here.

72
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:56,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not stupid.

73
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:58,827
[SPEAKER_02]: All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

74
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,796
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

75
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:27,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, as he mentioned tonight, he's going on a brief hiatus for the next two weeks.

76
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll just have to tune in right at 6 o'clock for the next couple weeks because we'll be on there at All Games Radio.

77
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, www.allgames.com.

78
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:42,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We also always have our chat room with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us and chat with us throughout the evening.

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,397
[SPEAKER_02]: and some folks are coming up with cute little names.

80
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:49,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Fitness Lounge Radio from Actdeft and Diet Diet Revolution there from HitStun.

81
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:49,860
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

82
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:50,860
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

83
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:55,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into some gaming news and how our gaming weeks were and all that.

84
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually we have a little kickoff topic here at the start.

85
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:02,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to talk about this tonight because this is what lots of people are talking about.

86
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,130
[SPEAKER_02]: If Facebook is any indication, it's like everybody's freaking talking about this.

87
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:31,163
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's that movie The Hunger Games right which you know is announced today what best non-sequel opening ever uh best uh it beat Twilight which that that's can't be bad news uh you know I personally have not seen the movie myself I haven't um read the books or anything um I'm interested in seeing the movie mostly because all my friends are like it's so good it's so good and you know I'm not gonna hate something just because it's you know

88
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:31,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

89
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:32,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you're doing that.

90
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:33,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you go see it?

91
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and saw it.

92
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the wife took you to see it.

93
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:35,345
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think?

94
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:36,685
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the wife didn't take me to see it.

95
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I had tickets to see it.

96
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:38,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

97
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:39,507
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare I?

98
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,467
[SPEAKER_10]: It was free.

99
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:41,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Free popcorn.

100
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:44,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It was alright.

101
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,411
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, you know, my wife had described it as Battle Royale meets Twilight.

102
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:55,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like as in there's, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend, garbage, and, you know, people killing each other.

103
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:00,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The best description I read on the internet was Battle Royale for soccer moms.

104
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,691
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really, no.

105
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:09,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's not even, they don't really touch on the whole relationship stuff that much.

106
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:13,678
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of briefly there, and it actually is part of a plot point.

107
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:25,906
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not necessarily, without spoiling too much, they try to work up the whole relationship thing to get more sponsors, to get more perks in the actual games themselves.

108
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,868
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's kind of why they're doing it that way.

109
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not even that big a deal.

110
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,972
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh my god, it's Bal Royale.

111
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:44,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, I do have to say that the filmmaker must have gone to the Michael Bay School of Camera Work because that shit was shaky all over the goddamn place.

112
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather you not mention that evil person's name.

113
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, does this have to do with a certain Ninja Turtle?

114
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:51,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

115
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:53,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

116
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make this clear, too.

117
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not bad.

118
00:06:58,408 --> 00:06:59,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And Woody Harrelson's in it.

119
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,991
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always a pleasant surprise because Woody Harrelson's character is awesome.

120
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:19,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the Hunger Games fans shoot me down with a bow and arrow, I want to talk about the Battle Royale thing because I do think people are running a little far with this whole comparison thing because, hello, Battle Royale's like 12 years old.

121
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely different kind of book that's very political in nature.

122
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:24,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got re-released.

123
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they're going to time the re-release with what's going on here because of the distant similarity.

124
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:39,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But my whole thing is that, for one, there was Logan's Run, there was the Stephen King novel back in the 70s.

125
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:42,758
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been other stuff about this type of topic too.

126
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:44,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can you go...

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:08:03,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle Royale and Hunger Games are like the same movie and Hollywood does... How can you say that and turn your head away from the fact that we have this Julia Roberts Snow White movie and Chick from Twilight Snow White movie coming out within literally three months of each other going on over here?

128
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,801
[SPEAKER_02]: To which I hear the trailer for both were being played before the Hunger Games and I'm like...

129
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,722
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you fucking sit there and compare the 100 years to Battle Royale when this shit's going on?

130
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,442
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they did not have the Mirror Mirror trailer.

131
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:17,923
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I'm well aware of Mirror Mirror.

132
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,963
[SPEAKER_10]: At first I thought they were the same movie.

133
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:23,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, man, that first trailer was really dark, but this one makes it look like a comedy.

134
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really confused at what's going on here.

135
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:26,525
Right?

136
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:32,026
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, it's just... It's...

137
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,586
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit dark.

138
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not as dark as Battle Royale.

139
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:39,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's killing and stuff, and they have kind of the same stuff.

140
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:43,990
[SPEAKER_10]: There's alliances and that kind of thing, but I think Battle Royale is a lot darker.

141
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a little bit similar where they pick people and have them fight to the death and stuff like that, but at the same time, it's just...

142
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,127
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little weird.

143
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:54,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

144
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:59,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamer Girl in our chatroom says Logan's Run is getting a re-release too, and that's not really surprising.

145
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:07,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything remotely resembling The Hunger Games is going to come back because, again, it's the biggest non-sequel ever.

146
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:14,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It has come to take Harry Potter's place for a few years in Hollywood as the young adult because ain't no one going to admit they like Twilight.

147
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:18,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Next year we'll see The Long Walk and then another Lord of the Flies.

148
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Stephen King novel I was trying to think of.

149
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:21,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The Long Walk.

150
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,685
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll adapt that.

151
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:24,886
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit is getting greenlit in the next couple months.

152
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll get an American Battle Royale.

153
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.

154
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope not.

155
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,531
[SPEAKER_10]: The next one's going to be Ender's Game.

156
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:33,714
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be the next big one that's going to be coming out in a year from now.

157
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,956
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, you know Logan's Run came out the year I was born?

158
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:36,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

159
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

160
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's an old movie.

161
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:39,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

162
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: You set yourself up for that.

163
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the video game?

164
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the video game?

165
00:10:26,223 --> 00:10:26,603
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

166
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:27,544
[SPEAKER_10]: How so?

167
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's not really anything you could do.

168
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,748
[SPEAKER_10]: You play as a character, and you go and kill other kids.

169
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:37,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, do they really want a killing kids video game?

170
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:42,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten years on this show, or ten years ago on this show, we used to love Battle Royale.

171
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:43,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when we all first saw that movie?

172
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:49,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the paper play stuff, and we said, there is no fucking way this movie is ever coming out in America.

173
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not going to do it.

174
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:50,702
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to do it.

175
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:51,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they are.

176
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:55,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put kids killing kids on the screen, not in this day and age, ten years ago.

177
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:02,049
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why Battle Royale is coming out is because the mainstream studios wouldn't bring it out.

178
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:08,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's either Anchor Bay or some Hong Kong movie distributor that's actually putting it out over here.

179
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:11,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not necessarily some mainstream.

180
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:16,917
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like Warner Brothers or Lionsgate or something like that is putting it out here.

181
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:23,881
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so much smaller scale, it wouldn't really work as an action game or stealth action game or something like that because

182
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:29,185
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only 24 kids originally in that.

183
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:34,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just not... Whereas Battle Royale is a little bit more freeform.

184
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just hunting people down and stuff like that.

185
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,572
[SPEAKER_10]: It just wouldn't really work.

186
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the later movies or later books would work.

187
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:48,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to say, maybe... Now, without spoiling, but I understand the later books are more of a her against the government type of piece.

188
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So put it very plainly like that.

189
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that would translate better towards a video game?

190
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:54,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that might work.

191
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:55,477
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

192
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to our chat room at chat.orangesonsradio.com.

193
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Stan says, I would love to see an American Battle Royale movie with Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and all them assholes shoot each other.

194
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:06,170
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, wait a minute.

195
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,892
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of shooting in Battle Royale.

196
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some, but not a lot.

197
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,196
[SPEAKER_06]: There was plenty of gunfire.

198
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:13,485
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

199
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:33,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if I want to spoil... Don't.

200
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read another comment from chat.

201
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Derek Gage in chat says, Titanic was a sequel?

202
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I said biggest opening weekend.

203
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Titanic made all its money because it was number one at the box office for like, what, four or five months?

204
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:47,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people were going to see it multiple times.

205
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll admit, I saw Titanic in the theater three times.

206
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't... I saw it once on VHS and I wanted to kill myself.

207
00:12:53,616 --> 00:13:00,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I loved Titanic, but you have to realize my dad was very into Titanic stuff way before the movie.

208
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember watching a National Geographic special when I was seven years old, way before the movie.

209
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:07,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to see it with him.

210
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:12,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I went to see it with some other friends in college because a bunch of them hadn't seen it one to go.

211
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:16,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I ended up seeing it one other time really cheap for some reason.

212
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:21,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good movie, but I won't see this 3D re-release.

213
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:22,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not see the 3D re-release.

214
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,491
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's James Cameron doing the reading.

215
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:26,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that might not be bad.

216
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:27,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

217
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:29,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow.

218
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:31,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all right.

219
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:35,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying the Hunger Games video game didn't happen because it's not possible.

220
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:37,817
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't be good.

221
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,943
[SPEAKER_10]: No, at least not that I'm worried.

222
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:01,844
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Facebook game.

223
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,067
[SPEAKER_10]: The next movie game that they have coming out is Madagascar 3.

224
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the movie video game genre die?

225
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:09,930
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

226
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,094
[SPEAKER_10]: See, in the month of May, you have Madagascar 3 from D3.

227
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: You have two from Activision, Men in Black, and Battleship, the movie based off the board game.

228
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,764
[SPEAKER_10]: The video game based off the movie, based off the board game.

229
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:26,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

230
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will still not have our Liam Neeson saying E5!

231
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:37,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe you would ruin Battleship the movie.

232
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:59,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, who cares?

233
00:14:59,566 --> 00:14:59,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So what?

234
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:00,887
[SPEAKER_10]: He dies, big deal.

235
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:04,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's like, honestly, Battleship, the movie, is like Independence Day.

236
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you look back at Independence Day, I loved the movie, but it was fucking ridiculous.

237
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:09,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It made no sense.

238
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:10,934
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just ridiculous.

239
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:11,615
[SPEAKER_10]: This is true.

240
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:12,876
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

241
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,877
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fucking entertaining movie.

242
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Independence Day, I think the second, the third, and the fourth.

243
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe the fifth.

244
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw it like four or five days in a row.

245
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:23,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like...

246
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,065
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was great every time.

247
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they make a video game out of Independence Day?

248
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did on the PlayStation 1.

249
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I forget.

250
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so long ago.

251
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:32,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fucking terrible.

252
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was.

253
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:42,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, I hope the Battleship movie climaxes with a strategic battle in the style of the board game.

254
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

255
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way you could convince me to see it is that Liam Neeson and Rihanna sit down and they go to town on a game of Battleship.

256
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even care.

257
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to be awesome.

258
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:57,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's such a terrible... It's a movie you go into and you know what it is.

259
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,868
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just explosions and nonsense.

260
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:01,129
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Michael Bay for you.

261
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Explosions and nonsense.

262
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,232
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's what you want, then you go see that movie.

263
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I want, so I'm going to go see that movie.

264
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,556
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll see The Avengers because that looks awesome.

265
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:16,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I do need to catch up on the Avenger movies leading up to it because I've only seen Iron Man 1.

266
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,342
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I are in the same boat.

267
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:19,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

268
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:24,285
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I need to get together and do this because I have only seen Iron Man 1.

269
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:24,906
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

270
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:25,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any of the others.

271
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them.

272
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:28,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't see Thor.

273
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't see Captain America.

274
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I'm not hating.

275
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:36,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, last year I did not go to the movie.

276
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go to the movies at all last year.

277
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:38,894
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a kid?

278
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lazy.

279
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:42,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Thor.

280
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:43,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Thor was good.

281
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:48,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see the second Iron Man movie because it's just pretty much Robert Downey Jr.

282
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,960
[SPEAKER_06]: being Robert Downey Jr.

283
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:51,401
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that a bad thing?

284
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunk and asshole.

285
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

286
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:54,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That Robert Downey Jr.

287
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:55,085
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's fine.

288
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,646
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

289
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:57,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I own it.

290
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I just haven't bothered to see it yet.

291
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of like I wasn't excited.

292
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the first one.

293
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw Hulk, even though it's, you know, not the same dude.

294
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like same universe-ish thing.

295
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, honestly, I really wish they had had Edward Norton.

296
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Really wish they had Edward Norton.

297
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,735
[SPEAKER_06]: He was so good.

298
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You met the other guy, right?

299
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:17,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have.

300
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:18,955
[SPEAKER_10]: He signed my Xbox.

301
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,016
[SPEAKER_06]: But, man, I... Hawkeye.

302
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolfInChat says, you guys did notice in the first Battleship trailer that the bombs were in the shape of Battleship pins, right?

303
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:29,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

304
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't notice that.

305
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:31,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your...

306
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any other big movies this summer that I'm not thinking of that might have video games made out of them?

307
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like there was a lot of stuff coming out this summer.

308
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think.

309
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:45,338
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

310
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,841
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly don't remember what the summer lineup is this year.

311
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:57,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, other than Batman and the new Snow White movie, which, I don't know, looks all right.

312
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:58,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to go see it, though.

313
00:17:58,648 --> 00:17:59,649
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife wants to see it.

314
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

315
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

316
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, we'll start to talk more about the summer stuff when it gets closer to summer.

317
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:04,753
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

318
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:11,901
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, let's talk about, right now, this week, the types of video games we've been playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

319
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,102
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

320
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:15,500
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was retro.

321
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:23,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We bought Bust a Move 2, as in Puzzle Bobble, arcade edition for the PlayStation.

322
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:32,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And my husband and I actually had a fairly even match in playing, even though I'm usually the much better player.

323
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:38,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We also picked up Taito Legends for PS2.

324
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I have that on Xbox One.

325
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:14,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We have video games related to the series, but I have to say that watching the Evangelion 2.22 really is kind of depressing, but awesome!

326
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:15,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

327
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:17,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

328
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly there's a bit of a retro day with the Taito stuff.

329
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,288
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a series that had its ending changed.

330
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it...

331
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,781
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

332
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:47,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, before we get to Loki's Gaming Week, from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, some folks in the chat are naming some other possible titles.

333
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,598
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says maybe they should make a video game on Prometheus.

334
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:52,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's supposed to be a pretty big one, right?

335
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:59,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, technically there's the Aliens Colonial Marines, which is coming out later this year, so that could tie into Prometheus.

336
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:05,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinell names one that I particularly am looking forward to seeing, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.

337
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,081
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be fucking awesome.

338
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,343
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty awesome.

339
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:09,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that one.

340
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:11,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Platinum Games putting it together, that'd be awesome.

341
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Very awesome.

342
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, meanwhile, your gaming week, Loki.

343
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:15,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's see.

344
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,147
[SPEAKER_10]: This week I didn't play a lot of games.

345
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:23,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Call of Duty briefly because I was only working for three days this week.

346
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:28,530
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of the time I've been just working in Excel.

347
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would I try to program something in Excel?

348
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm weird like that.

349
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:35,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So I like programming.

350
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,472
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you making in Excel?

351
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:37,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it still a secret?

352
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:38,472
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not a secret.

353
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:38,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It never was.

354
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:41,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm making a map editor for Grand Theft Auto IV.

355
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,399
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually works.

356
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just fucking slow because it's in Excel.

357
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: In Excel.

358
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:47,534
[SPEAKER_10]: In Excel.

359
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:47,976
[SPEAKER_10]: You've made a...

360
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:50,998
[SPEAKER_02]: How does a map editor in Excel work?

361
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:52,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning you draw it out in the little cells?

362
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:53,560
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

363
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,682
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like basically it opens a format.

364
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,383
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a WPL.

365
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:00,924
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a placement list or something like that.

366
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:08,409
[SPEAKER_10]: You can import stuff I make out of the Simple Native Trainer, which is a trainer in the game.

367
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,630
[SPEAKER_10]: You can spawn objects, move them around, place them and stuff.

368
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can export those to a file and dump them into this.

369
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:17,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I can save them as the actual map files that are used by the games.

370
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:17,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

371
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:32,001
[SPEAKER_10]: or I can actually paste the hex code in there from, you know, you open up the file in the hex editor and dump it in there and it'll actually read everything and, you know, you can also save it as that and it'll, you know, do that fun stuff.

372
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:38,283
[SPEAKER_10]: But it works and it's weird because the editors that they have out there now are broken.

373
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:39,284
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't really work well.

374
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:41,525
[SPEAKER_10]: So the fact that I'm making something very inefficiently

375
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,209
[SPEAKER_10]: It works, and that's all I care about is the fact that it works.

376
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:49,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't know how to program in C Sharp or C++ or whatever.

377
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:58,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I could learn how to do that, but for some reason my mind can't wrap around that.

378
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet, complex stuff in Excel, I can do that.

379
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:01,967
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

380
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:03,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear ya, I hear ya.

381
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:04,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculous formula.

382
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me put it this way.

383
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:12,054
[SPEAKER_10]: My Excel file, I had to convert it to the new format because I was going to try to make it compatible with everything else.

384
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It ended up being 75 megabytes.

385
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:14,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my lord.

386
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:15,916
[SPEAKER_10]: 75 megabytes is huge.

387
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:16,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it work in OpenOffice?

388
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:17,717
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

389
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm an OpenOffice user.

390
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,179
[SPEAKER_10]: OpenOffice doesn't really work that well for this.

391
00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:20,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

392
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was that.

393
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:28,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And then kind of a weird, it's not weird, something I'm doing.

394
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:32,405
[SPEAKER_10]: As I mentioned before, Mark Ruffalo has signed my Xbox before and a couple other people have as well.

395
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:36,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I have this Xbox that I'm kind of using as almost like an autograph book.

396
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:38,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I get celebrities to sign it.

397
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:42,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if people always consider these people celebrities.

398
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,554
[SPEAKER_10]: This week we had a visit from Duff Goldman from Ace of Cakes.

399
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:48,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Duff Beer?

400
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:50,255
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not Duff Beer.

401
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,818
[SPEAKER_10]: From Ace of Cakes or Charm City Cakes.

402
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:54,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Really cool guy.

403
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:56,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had him sign my Xbox.

404
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,441
[SPEAKER_10]: He must have went like, I'm a cake maker.

405
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I signing an Xbox?

406
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:01,683
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought it was cool.

407
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:02,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

408
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:23,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't consider Orlando Bloom or Mark Ruffalo, who's starring as the Hulk in the Avengers.

409
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:23,777
[SPEAKER_10]: B-minus list.

410
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:44,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, fine.

411
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:54,097
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, it's just, I have signatures from a bunch of different celebrities at my work, like a bunch of posters, but they're sitting in a pile on my desk and collecting dust.

412
00:23:54,177 --> 00:24:02,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I have William H. Macy, and I had, oh, who the hell's, Jeff Goldblum at one time.

413
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,047
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just, that guy is fucking weird.

414
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:07,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

415
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:52,306
[SPEAKER_10]: um but yeah like you know we we met before he died you know we met um Patrick Swayze oh nice uh so that was kind of cool um I like to get pictures yeah well yeah I get pictures too uh but you know I just I figured because I like you know I keep my Xbox in better shape than those posters so the way I figured I'm all it's it's more of an honor to sign this Xbox than it is good point

416
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:56,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't... I mean, this guy's a big geek.

417
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:03,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he was talking about, you know, totally geeking out at, like, LucasArts and, you know, Skywalker Ranch and stuff like that when they went and made the cake there.

418
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he also try to fling meatloaf at George Lucas?

419
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

420
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:33,699
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh you know so I I think that I'm sure that he plays video games I'm sure that he thought it was cool so whatever I like Derek H's counter about Mark Ruffalo's celebrity status Derek H says well Ruffalo is Bruce Banner a few hundred computers are playing the Hulk that is true facts true facts all right um fair enough anything else you want to get out there for your game um

421
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all I've played.

422
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:41,786
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I tried playing a little bit of the Mario Portal game, the Mario game.

423
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:42,446
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

424
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:44,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't play that on my laptop.

425
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:45,469
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an art piece.

426
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't play very well with a touchpad.

427
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:54,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not very keyboard mouse, so it's very awkward for me to play that.

428
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:56,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you're a laptop person.

429
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a little weird.

430
00:25:59,042 --> 00:25:59,302
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

431
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's it.

432
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

433
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:01,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Then My Gaming Week.

434
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,946
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, I tried that new Hunger Games on the iPhone.

435
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:09,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

436
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:12,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play one game a lot this week, actually.

437
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely forgot.

438
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Stardust Delta.

439
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:16,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that game.

440
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,553
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually really awesome.

441
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:18,993
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

442
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:20,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Brad from PodCulture.

443
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, he hooked me up with the code and I've been playing the crap out of that.

444
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:25,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a really fun game.

445
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:26,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

446
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:27,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm thinking about getting it.

447
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:28,636
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely worth it.

448
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:29,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fun.

449
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:32,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I still never cashed in my 3G thing.

450
00:26:32,777 --> 00:26:33,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did either.

451
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:36,158
[SPEAKER_02]: That feature on my Vita has literally gone to waste.

452
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:39,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have until the 31st to do something with it or you lose it or something like that.

453
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to make sure I get that taken care of.

454
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,789
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, who cares?

455
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, well, they have the GPS, though, with the 3G one.

456
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, that's kind of helpful.

457
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:52,291
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I mean, I just can't use 3G.

458
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:52,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

459
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:53,292
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

460
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,152
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're finally done with Game Week.

461
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:55,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

462
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:55,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

463
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:55,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

464
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:56,392
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my Game Week.

465
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:59,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, before I talk video games, I need to talk board games.

466
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I went to a board game party yesterday.

467
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:02,634
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a lot of fun.

468
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:03,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play some new board games.

469
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:07,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them that I really, really, really, really liked was called Seven Wonders.

470
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:10,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure some of you board card game enthusiasts will know this game.

471
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, not that I think they should turn every game into an Xbox game, but some of them have worked rather well, right?

472
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:20,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Ticket to Ride and Catan and all that, right?

473
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:24,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to see Seven Wonders because that was... I had a lot of fun playing that game.

474
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:25,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

475
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,559
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a game called Seven Wonders.

476
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,640
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one of those match-three games.

477
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's not even the same thing.

478
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:32,461
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a more... It was kind of like...

479
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:57,612
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually to me felt and Alan made this comment too like the stages of the game are similar to like civilization it's resource collecting and then you can kind of hedge yourself into technology or military or like what I would call cultural types of points you know you can kind of it's either really inspired by civilization or kind of right down that same line but you know I love Civ so I like this game too

480
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:14,876
[SPEAKER_02]: and some other friends of ours came over we played Dominion again which I think I've talked about that on the show but that's a card game I really enjoy that would be really hard to pull off on a console though I think that's something you really have to play in person because there's so many ways you can kind of mix and match the different cards and the expansions and all that

481
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've been playing tangible games this week.

482
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:19,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

483
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:22,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, though, haven't been short on those.

484
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, I talked about how I have suddenly just... I want to say out of the blue, but not really.

485
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:35,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane from Horde House kind of... We'll just say he berated me into playing these games, but it worked.

486
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:36,427
[SPEAKER_02]: The games are really good.

487
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:37,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, right?

488
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat Mass Effect 1.

489
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:47,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I realize a lot of you might be going, yay, golf clap for you, you beat a game that came out five years ago.

490
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But really think about that statement if you've been listening to Orange House Radio for any length of time.

491
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:57,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the attention span to beat a game playing it start to finish.

492
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:00,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a huge endorsement, I think, for the game.

493
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I beat Mass Effect.

494
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:03,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did I do when I beat Mass Effect?

495
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:08,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in my Mass Effect 2 disc that I picked up last week for $20, and I started on Mass Effect 2.

496
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm about nine hours into Mass Effect 2.

497
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:16,117
[SPEAKER_06]: and now I'm going to go home and start Mass Effect tomorrow.

498
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:21,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and now Jamie is taking my Mass Effect on Xbox and she said she's going to check it out.

499
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:33,945
[SPEAKER_02]: However, she understands she has until the time I beat Mass Effect 3 to finish it because then I want to play Mass Effect 1 again as a renegade and as a woman so I can have lesbian romance.

500
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:39,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to start off as a woman because I play every game as a woman because it's fun.

501
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:42,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Saints Row the 3rd yet?

502
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:43,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Me?

503
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:44,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons.

504
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:44,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Her.

505
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:44,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

506
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:48,848
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't because we don't have a system that I can play it on right now.

507
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless someone would like to lend me a copy of it.

508
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:54,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you have... I have the 361 from you still, right?

509
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,750
[SPEAKER_02]: So, do you want to borrow the 361?

510
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:56,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

511
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

512
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give it to her, okay?

513
00:29:59,331 --> 00:29:59,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

514
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot you even had it.

515
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

516
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:02,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

517
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I've been playing Mass Effect 2.

518
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:12,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't know how constructive it is for me to review a game that's about two or three years old.

519
00:30:13,168 --> 00:30:13,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But, what?

520
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:15,251
[SPEAKER_06]: One question from Acidic Vampire.

521
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:15,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

522
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:16,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Who did you choose to bang?

523
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,070
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

524
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That will set it up so that in the third game, this person will be around for me to bang.

525
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will bang them.

526
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:44,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots.

527
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:47,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I'll just leave it at that.

528
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:50,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else?

529
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:52,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm off track here.

530
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Mass Effect 2.

531
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:57,331
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's a few years old, but it's really good.

532
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:03,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is just a step up in the storytelling and in the voice acting and everything.

533
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that the first game was bad, but the second game is just even more.

534
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I have laughed out loud at the game.

535
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:14,879
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a particular character I just got into my little squad that literally made me laugh out loud with what they were saying.

536
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

537
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:20,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics are a step up.

538
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:23,684
[SPEAKER_02]: They got rid of the Mako stuff, thank God.

539
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:25,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Planet Scanning's a little derpy.

540
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets a little bit old really fast, but whatever.

541
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:29,405
[SPEAKER_02]: The hacking's better.

542
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: The combat, I still have mixed feelings on.

543
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:44,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people generally agree that combat in 2 is better than combat in 1, but I will agree it's more fast-paced because you can kind of map skills to buttons so you don't have to bring up the menu.

544
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of do things that way, but I don't know.

545
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of find I don't like the way that just...

546
00:31:50,169 --> 00:32:09,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Enemies keep coming out in waves and waves and waves And you're kind of just like stuck in one spot Gunning them all down At least that's the way I kind of find them doing it Just kind of gunning them all down until the wave's finally over And you can kind of move into the next room Like I feel like the first game kind of made you It was a little more Metal Gear in the way that The enemies didn't just run out until they actually saw you

547
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:25,665
[SPEAKER_02]: so I kind of like it made the conflicts a little more consistent but don't take that as a harsh gripe on the game I mean it's a really minor bitch it doesn't take away from the experience of the story that I'm really really really enjoying so

548
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:27,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

549
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

550
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: What else have I been playing?

551
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,001
[SPEAKER_02]: What other game I want to mention?

552
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:39,003
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Vita, Mod Nation Racers Road Trip.

553
00:32:39,244 --> 00:32:40,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I played on the Vita for a little bit.

554
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:42,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

555
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:43,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.

556
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:47,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the PlayStation 3 version condensed down for the Vita.

557
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:50,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics and everything are pretty good.

558
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they do on the PlayStation 3.

559
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:57,275
[SPEAKER_02]: The track editor, I was very impressed that it's pretty much all there.

560
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:05,740
[SPEAKER_02]: You can import all the stuff from the PlayStation, which is pretty impressive, and you can therefore build up a pretty good library of stuff.

561
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,622
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem with Mod Nation Racers is...

562
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,893
[SPEAKER_02]: They stripped out everything online about the game.

563
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:24,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you can do online on the Vita version is have ghost racers, and you can download other people's tracks, but you can't do races online, which is kind of an important element of custom track making.

564
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:31,986
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because a lot of these games, they're just not able to do... That's why you get a lot of this asynchronous multiplayer garbage.

565
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:40,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do ad hoc in the same room and do it that way, but it really feels lacking.

566
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:47,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sitting here going, this racing game gets kind of basic after you play it for a while.

567
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:54,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some interesting power-ups and things they do, but at the end of the day, I'm just like, this game gets kind of old.

568
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:57,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, at least what?

569
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:59,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only $30, but I rented it through.

570
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:03,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an account with a game rental company, and so I got it through a rental.

571
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's a worthy rental.

572
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I would pay $30 for it.

573
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,275
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really like racers.

574
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:13,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you're getting a lot of objects for it through the little passing.

575
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:14,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some.

576
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Check into Nier while you're here, because I need some of those objects.

577
00:34:17,258 --> 00:34:24,360
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, we're going to talk about this later, because there's a story coming up about LittleBigPlanet cart or whatever.

578
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:33,721
[SPEAKER_10]: The trailer looks cool, but it kind of made my heart sink when I heard, by the creators of Mod Nation Races, I'm like, ugh.

579
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:37,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Because their load time is fucking terrible.

580
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the load time's really bad.

581
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:47,490
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, I was really surprised at how much the online piece being missing really hurt the game.

582
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wouldn't call the one on the PlayStation 3 a basic bitch racer.

583
00:34:51,733 --> 00:35:09,907
[SPEAKER_02]: because the community element kind of saves it because there really is just a stronger sense of community in the PlayStation 3 one and you can really get these random organic experiences in the PlayStation 3 one that just feel very forced and very vanilla on the Vita one and that's the problem with it.

584
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:15,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's impressive that they otherwise got most of the PlayStation 3 one in there

585
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:19,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope LittleBigPlanet didn't get neutered this way.

586
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:25,213
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, LittleBigPlanet... You could play LittleBigPlanet online, but it wasn't as key to that game.

587
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I think LittleBigPlanet Vita will be alright.

588
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,074
[SPEAKER_10]: See, here's my question, though.

589
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:36,296
[SPEAKER_10]: If they did that, though, if it's really neutered, I guess, on the Vita version, do you have the PSP version?

590
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:38,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think I got that as the PSP version.

591
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if it was neutered on there, too, or if they...

592
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:43,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

593
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:56,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

594
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Hot Shots, Golf, Wipeout, and MLB 12 are the only games.

595
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Unit 13 does.

596
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:24,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that did though.

597
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:31,439
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are the three and possibly four games that I know of right now that actually have multiplayer.

598
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'll say this.

599
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:38,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to totally bash out Monday's Racers because I don't think it's a bad game necessarily.

600
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:40,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to remember it's a launch title.

601
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:44,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a launch title, it's surprisingly decent.

602
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:46,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that.

603
00:36:46,814 --> 00:36:49,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strong launch title for the Vita community.

604
00:36:50,257 --> 00:37:12,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not as strong as, say, Luminous or some of the other choices that are out there Or what also kind of shoots this game in the foot a little bit is that I have to say that free Motorstorm game they put out last week It's kind of a better racing experience for me I mean, maybe because it was free, and it was more like Iron Man off-road racing

605
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:38,173
[SPEAKER_10]: which I really enjoy that style but I'm well see the thing is like I'm kind of embracing a little bit more of the uh online or not even online stuff but the digital stuff now um thanks to some of these offerings the fact that well the fact that the Michael Jackson game was free was kind of fun but um you know the the on that Motorstorm game is pretty awesome and I'm actually thinking of thinning out my collection because I have four games right now and cart form and

606
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:40,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably going to, well, Lil Deviance is gone.

607
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:43,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that game looked like terrible shit.

608
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:50,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, Rayman Origins I'm probably going to get rid of because I'm just not playing it.

609
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:51,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that it's a terrible game.

610
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:53,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a terrible game at all.

611
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:58,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an awesome game, but it's just I'm not finding myself playing or wanting to play that game.

612
00:37:58,295 --> 00:37:58,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

613
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:02,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloundtrader.com.

614
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just now catching up on some of the comments from chat.

615
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Acidic Vampire says, the characters in Mass Effect 2 are some of the best characters in any video game.

616
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:11,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

617
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:22,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, although I haven't played enough of Mass Effect 2 to really say that's true or that's false, I can see so far where that is probably a true statement.

618
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is some strong characters in Part 2.

619
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:25,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, even...

620
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,244
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's so funny I'm sitting here saying that because as I keep saying this about two, I feel like I'm bashing one, but I'm not.

621
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:39,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that one set the bar pretty high and two actually exceeds it in almost every area.

622
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pretty neat.

623
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shane says, pics of Kaiden put him over to actually trying the series out.

624
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,454
[SPEAKER_02]: That may or may not be true.

625
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

626
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I deny these allegations.

627
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's enough about our gaming weeks.

628
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:58,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news after I quickly mention some housekeeping.

629

634

[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the number one rule of the OL Army though, don't be a dick.

635
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,685
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to play games online, don't be a dick.

636
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:21,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be nice.

[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

643
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:38,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into gaming news, Loki.

644
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:48,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's rumors that Sony is shutting down one of their first party developers, Zipper Interactive, who just put out the Vita game, Unit 13.

645
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:51,565
[SPEAKER_10]: They may be gone.

646
00:39:52,685 --> 00:40:00,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently there's been some chatter for several days about an impending closure and the possibility of cancellations of a current project.

647
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Sony hasn't made a comment on it.

648
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:06,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And besides, you know, Unit 13, they're of course the ones behind Zipper.

649
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:09,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Socom, US Navy SEALs, and MAG.

650
00:40:10,351 --> 00:40:14,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So they kind of know their shooters, but I don't know.

651
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:19,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's just because they can't really compete with, say, Call of Duty or Battlefield.

652
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:23,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe this is why they're kind of letting them go and restructuring.

653
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:24,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

654
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm well it's never good to hear about studios closing but I mean wasn't SOCOM still a pretty strong series or did I miss something?

655
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:51,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Um I don't know how well SOCOM 4 did um I would have thought that they would have you know tried to well maybe they tried with MAG maybe that was the whole thing is um you know they were trying to you know do something with that but um maybe it just didn't really work out.

656
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:53,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, also.

657
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also is a rumor.

658
00:40:55,416 --> 00:41:03,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the other thing might have kind of hurt SOCOM 4 was the fact that SOCOM 4 launched right before the whole PlayStation Network blackout there.

659
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:04,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

660
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:11,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I remembered there was something that kind of like about SOCOM 4 that was like iffy in the community.

661
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:12,122
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

662
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:13,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.

663
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:16,304
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it came out the week they took the network down for like a month.

664
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:16,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

665
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:17,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

666
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably didn't help.

667
00:41:19,805 --> 00:41:19,885
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

668
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:44,285
[SPEAKER_02]: but interesting that all this time later something happens I'm also surprised if that in spite of that they didn't try to relaunch SOCOM for the holidays or maybe they did and I just you know that's not usually a series I follow so but I'm surprised there wouldn't be like a SOCOM 4 game of the year edition since that's what they're all called or SOCOM 4 platinum guns edition or something that comes out at the end of the year to try and relaunch it

669
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:45,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised too.

670
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

671
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:49,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think SOCOM 4 is a bad game.

672
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:51,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it got pretty good reviews.

673
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:54,768
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just... I don't know.

674
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:56,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's just not enough room right now.

675
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:58,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're focusing on something else.

676
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:03,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're just getting rid of these guys because they're going to have someone else working on SOCOM.

677
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

678
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:03,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe...

679
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,151
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

680
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:21,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

681
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:46,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

682
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, over in Xbox territory, there is yet another arcade promotion going on.

683
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:13,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like Xbox, Microsoft, and all them have found success in these, you know, summer of arcade.

684
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,796
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the winner one called?

685
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Block Party, right?

686
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:18,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So since it's so successful... Let's do it quarterly.

687
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade Next Trials Evolution

688
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:47,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloodforge on April 25th, Fable Heroes on May 2nd.

689
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:50,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is not the It's Not on Rails fable.

690
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Mario Party fable, right?

691
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:52,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks all right.

692
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:57,988
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like a little bit Mario Party crossed with Castle Crashers, I guess.

693
00:43:58,328 --> 00:43:58,668
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

694
00:43:59,369 --> 00:43:59,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

695
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, obviously, this is the huge one, the big one, May 9th, Minecraft.

696
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:06,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be 1,600 Microsoft points.

697
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:29,286
[SPEAKER_02]: and it should be noted too that because of the recent change in the gamer score for arcade all of these games will now offer the 400 gamer score it's not going to be because April's the month they're starting that right so all these games will now have you know 400 gamer score instead of 200 available to you I mean I'd like to try Minecraft out you know again

698
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of want to give Minecraft a second chance.

699
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to pay 1,600 points for it, only to be... if I'm disappointed in it.

700
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:40,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the Xbox... Yeah, they come with demos, so I'll...

701
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:46,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's everybody cross your fingers that the Minecraft one's really good because I want to give it another chance.

702
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:47,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

703
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:48,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

704
00:44:48,925 --> 00:44:50,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I am kind of curious about Trials.

705
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of skipped the first one, but it sounds interesting.

706
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:53,669
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed another one.

707
00:44:53,689 --> 00:45:01,037
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a picture I saw where I think it was the devs that did Limbo did a level that looks like Limbo in Trials.

708
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:02,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

709
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to point out the price of the other games.

710
00:45:05,448 --> 00:45:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable Heroes will be 800 points.

711
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,111
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about 10 bucks.

712
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,533
[SPEAKER_02]: All the others, Evolution, Bloodforge, 15 bucks.

713
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:13,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the pricing for those games.

714
00:45:13,456 --> 00:45:18,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we haven't heard about, I have not heard anything about what you get if you buy all four games.

715
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, that was an important part of the promotion for Block Party and Summer of Arcade, is like buy all four, get...

716
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:47,369
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 points in the mail or something like that right or get 1200 points or get a game for free you know depending on what what promotion it is but yet I'm not hearing anything with this so this is just straight up a send out a press release to all the gaming sites and get the games more exposure right get an ad in magazines it's still a while away I mean they could always announce something

717
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:47,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

718
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:49,305
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be something coming out later.

719
00:45:50,907 --> 00:45:59,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's something derpy, like something for your, I keep wanting to say your me, but for your avatar, like a little next shirt or something.

720
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even if they throw something like that in there, there'll be people that give it a shot just to have that, you know?

721
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:10,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Not very many people, but there will be people.

722
00:46:11,064 --> 00:46:11,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Never know.

723
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:17,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Derek H in chat says, does that mean Minecraft is the highest priced Xbox Live Arcade game ever?

724
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Penny Arcade game was also $1,600.

725
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:27,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say, well, some of them you may consider Xbox Live Arcade and some you may not.

726
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:37,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, some games are released not as Xbox Live Arcade, but as actually those games on demand because they don't fit within the constraints of the file size.

727
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:46,986
[SPEAKER_02]: True, and one could argue that a game that didn't get released here, like wasn't there that Japanese import shooter that you could only get through on demand?

728
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:47,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

729
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:48,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there something like that?

730
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:50,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was this original Crisis, too.

731
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:52,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Crisis, I think, was HD or something like that.

732
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,011
[SPEAKER_10]: They had come out.

733
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:55,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember if that was $20.

734
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:56,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was at least $20.

735
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:56,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

736
00:46:56,732 --> 00:47:06,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, if you want to count just strictly what's in the category of XBLA, then it ties for most expensive game ever, yes.

737
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

738
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,522
[SPEAKER_10]: They're probably going to try to inch that up a little bit, but...

739
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:15,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there might be DLC that'll bump it up a little, especially in a game like Minecraft.

740
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:17,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.

741
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:18,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, will they go there?

742
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,065
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

743
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

744
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:27,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've discussed this till we were blue in the face, but Mass Effect 3.

745
00:47:28,843 --> 00:47:49,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't like the ending Well, Bioware is listening I don't know why, but they're listening And the co-founder, Ray, and I always mispronounce his name, Musica Has said that they are actually going to work to answer those open-ended questions And give closure to the fans

746
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:56,683
[SPEAKER_06]: and described the fan feedback as incredibly painful.

747
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:11,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically everyone bitched and they're putting out some DLC to I guess expand more on the ending but he's saying, and this is a quote, our first instinct is to defend the work and point out the high ratings offered by critics.

748
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,888
[SPEAKER_06]: What do critics know?

749
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:20,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of respect to our fans, we need to accept the criticism and feedback with humility.

750
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:23,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry you didn't like it.

751
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to change that much about it, but maybe you'll like this.

752
00:48:28,692 --> 00:48:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I can tell.

753
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the only thing to do is wait and see.

754
00:48:35,342 --> 00:49:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a terrible idea I've calmed down a little bit on the idea I still don't think this excuses certain behaviors of certain people on the internet namely those that are harassing the employees of Bioware that's totally fucking unacceptable I don't give a fuck how much you've spent or invested in the Mass Effect series some of the vile shit I've read on the internet about the creators of the games like seriously, fuck off

755
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game.

756
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole, I don't think this is on the show roll later, so the whole using Child's Play, I think, went a little bit far.

757
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe somebody was good intentioned with that whole thing, but at the end of the day, people were calling Child's Play, saying, how much do I have to donate to get the ending changed?

758
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And Child's Play's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

759
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:41,846
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we here?

760
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:49,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we an organization that's supposed to help you get your beef with game publishers resolved?

761
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are we an organization trying to bring joy into sick children's lives?

762
00:49:54,578 --> 00:50:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they came out with a clarification that if you do a fundraiser for Child's Play, Child's Play is the cause.

763
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: There is to be no other cause.

764
00:50:01,885 --> 00:50:02,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Child's Play is the cause.

765
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say bravo to that.

766
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:14,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm not as harsh on that because I realize there might have been good intentions there, but unfortunately some people aren't smart.

767
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to put it.

768
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:23,505
[SPEAKER_10]: But like what you just said, and this is why I'm just scared of what this kind of precedent says.

769
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:27,189
[SPEAKER_10]: How much money do I have to pay for them to change the ending?

770
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,834
[SPEAKER_10]: How much money do I have to pay for them to change the ending?

771
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:32,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

772
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Are people actually asking that question?

773
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:35,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough.

774
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:36,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Jamie.

775
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, that right there is America.

776
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:43,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to say, funny enough, Loki, that's the part where I become okay with this.

777
00:50:43,846 --> 00:50:54,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Because although I've been bashing all these things, I realize the vast majority of people out there that probably went to go click like on the page or have said a nasty tweet about, God, that ending sucked or whatever.

778
00:50:55,389 --> 00:51:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize the vast majority of those people aren't insane like some of the other people I just mentioned.

779
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:07,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if they're going to put it out there, like, if BioWare does a DLC ending, I will buy it and I will support it.

780
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, alright, then fine.

781
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:14,954
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you'll have the choice if you want to invest that money or not.

782
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, if people want to buy it, then fine.

783
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:20,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird, weird precedent.

784
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:23,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just talking about this a little bit with Bobby before us here tonight.

785
00:51:24,316 --> 00:51:26,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was mentioning about Final Fantasy VII.

786
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:29,397
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people hated that ending too.

787
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:32,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that game came out today, a lot of people would probably be doing the same thing.

788
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow, two of the characters were just fucking missing in the ending.

789
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:41,500
[SPEAKER_10]: But, once again though, it's so what if it was a terrible ending for Final Fantasy 7?

790
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,500
[SPEAKER_10]: People bought Final Fantasy 8.

791
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,780
[SPEAKER_10]: People bought Final Fantasy 9.

792
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,021
[SPEAKER_10]: People bought Final Fantasy 10.

793
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:47,061
[SPEAKER_10]: They bought 10 too.

794
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,381
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably bought 11.

795
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:49,361
[SPEAKER_10]: They bought 12.

796
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:50,782
[SPEAKER_10]: They bought 13.

797
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:55,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it really hurt the sales of those because they didn't like the game?

798
00:51:55,703 --> 00:51:56,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody bought Final Fantasy 11.

799
00:51:57,563 --> 00:51:59,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, don't send the hate mail.

800
00:52:00,186 --> 00:52:09,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were a lot of Final Fantasy fans that did reject XI, but there were enough that embraced it that gave us XIV, which truly nobody bought XIV.

801
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:12,441
[SPEAKER_10]: When that shit goes free to play, watch how many fans reject that.

802
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:15,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, back to the topic here.

803
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:16,538
[SPEAKER_02]: E.A.

804
00:52:16,618 --> 00:52:17,779
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of invented that mess.

805
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:39,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't invent it, but they perfected it, let's say.

806
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: They did start the online pass, did they not?

807
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've figured out how to milk all the extra dollars for a video game.

808
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:51,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that capacity, EA kind of has themselves to blame for the fan backlash.

809
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:57,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if this were 10 years ago, fans wouldn't be saying this because there wouldn't really be anything they could do about it.

810
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:01,700
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have to just write on their live journals, I don't like the ending.

811
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: What they should do is just fucking shut the hell up.

812
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:05,482
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

813
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:21,728
[SPEAKER_10]: What about their time?

814
00:53:22,348 --> 00:53:28,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, devil's advocate, I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with you, but just giving you another perspective that's on the internet.

815
00:53:28,091 --> 00:53:37,896
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of talk on the internet that the ending was changed at the last minute and that the writers of the original ending were basically shafted because I guess there was a leak that had ruined it.

816
00:53:38,597 --> 00:53:41,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wasn't following the Mass Effect series then, so I don't know much about this.

817
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:42,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hearing it secondhand.

818
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess there was a leak that spoiled the first ending, so the creator kind of made this new ending...

819
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:59,289
[SPEAKER_02]: If the internet is to be believed, literally pulled it out of his ass and that's the ending we have because they wanted to get back at the spoiled leak, I guess.

820
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:01,774
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't make any sense.

821
00:54:02,235 --> 00:54:02,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

822
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:32,369
[SPEAKER_10]: and also like I take you know I have a problem with the fact that all these people hate it and then like you know the game reviews and stuff and granted everyone is you know open to their own opinion but a lot of the game reviews have been really positive for it I didn't hear anyone saying they're not letting a 15 minute ending or even if it's an hour ending ruin what is otherwise exactly and that's how everybody should take it instead of just being so goddamn focused on the last 15 minutes of the game

823
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:42,013
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100 Matt has some pretty strong words in our chatroom at chat.orangesoundradio.com Let the artists paint the picture and write the image they want.

824
00:54:42,373 --> 00:54:43,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamers aren't entitled to nothing.

825
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:45,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

826
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:47,416
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like the ride, get the fuck off it.

827
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:49,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, and you don't have to purchase their next game.

828
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:51,038
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, I think that's why they did it.

829
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:51,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Two reasons.

830
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:54,100
[SPEAKER_10]: One, so they could possibly sell more DLC.

831
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, the publisher's like, yeah, yeah, you should make a new ending.

832
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:01,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give you a little bit of money, and we're going to make a lot of money in return.

833
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:08,381
[SPEAKER_10]: and it appeases the fans so that when Mass Effect 4 comes out, because you know there will be a Mass Effect 4, that they will buy it.

834
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:36,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think this whole sense of entitlement thing that's going on in this country is probably the most ridiculous thing to ever happen it's a truly modern phenomenon and people really need to get over themselves and realize that you know it not being what you want or not getting what you want doesn't mean that it's a complete affront to you in particular you know that it's they're doing this on purpose you know

835
00:55:37,964 --> 00:55:38,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop being a baby.

836
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:39,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that makes no sense.

837
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:39,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

838
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:05,161
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like fanboy speculation.

839
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:10,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be interesting very much to see the impact that this has on an inevitable Mass Effect 4.

840
00:56:11,428 --> 00:56:17,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, fans, I realize that apparently they have said there's not going to be any more Mass Effect.

841
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:18,114
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously?

842
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucking believe that?

843
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

844
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

845
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:24,921
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't going to be any more Halo after Halo 3 either.

846
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was...

847
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll find a way to do Mass Effect 4 it may not be called Mass Effect 4 the series will continue it's too fucking big to not it might not be Bioware so you may really not want it to happen but it'll happen somebody will do it

848
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:47,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney Interactive announced Disney's Epic Mickey 2, The Power of Two.

849
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:11,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I was really hoping for The Power of Love, but you know, that's... It sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie to me.

850
00:57:11,538 --> 00:57:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: The Power of Two.

851
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:13,359
[SPEAKER_02]: The Power of Two.

852
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:24,523
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, this new, you know, as all the kind of rumors were, it actually is going to feature both Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

853
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:29,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And Oswald's going to be AI controlled, of course.

854
00:57:31,007 --> 00:57:31,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

855
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:50,972
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks neat.

856
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:52,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched the trailer for it.

857
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:57,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I didn't play the original game, which is kind of a fault on my part because it looked like a pretty awesome game.

858
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:01,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll check it out on the 360 when it comes out.

859
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:08,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just glad Disney Interactive is making something because for a while there, they didn't have anything since Disney Universe.

860
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:10,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, damn, did they just go away or something?

861
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting worried, but...

862
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:20,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, the split second was the Disney game.

863
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:24,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That studio got obliterated, didn't it?

864
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:24,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, BlackRock.

865
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:26,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's unfortunate.

866
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:27,533
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another movie tie-in game.

867
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:29,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Brave has a movie coming up.

868
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you know, I expect the kiddie games to all get tie-ins.

869
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are usually the first ones to have, like, the movie tie-in.

870
00:58:36,886 --> 00:58:39,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there wasn't really anything for Twilight, unless you count seeing it at Twilight.

871
00:58:40,008 --> 00:58:40,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami!

872
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:41,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Way to go, Konami!

873
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,552
[SPEAKER_02]: What in the fuck would a Twilight video game be?

874
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I can't believe I'm about to admit this on the radio, but I saw Breaking Dawn Part 1.

875
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:52,318
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only Twilight movie I've seen.

876
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: In my defense... In my defense... Put the hate mail down.

877
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: In my defense...

878
00:58:58,263 --> 00:59:02,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with Riff Trax, which I think is the only tolerable way to see.

879
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:04,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the only way to see those movies.

880
00:59:04,328 --> 00:59:06,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But my God.

881
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:09,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was the plot in that movie?

882
00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:18,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally like 30 minutes of them fucking and being on the beach and like, I love you and we're going to be together.

883
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:23,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh my God, people paid a lot of money to see this in the theater.

884
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: You would pay $50 for a video game for Breaking Dawn Part 1?

885
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck would you do?

886
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:35,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see a game that was controlled very much like Dragon's Lair.

887
00:59:35,297 --> 00:59:36,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just like left, right.

888
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:39,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Be emo to the left.

889
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Be emo to the right.

890
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:43,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Sulk to the right.

891
00:59:44,483 --> 00:59:45,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Sulk to the left.

892
00:59:47,385 --> 00:59:48,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Sparkle.

893
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:54,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Prevent this wedding from becoming her hallucination by pressing A repeatedly to stop them from turning into vampires.

894
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it would be kind of funny.

895
00:59:56,431 --> 00:59:58,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, someone has to have the sense of humor to do that.

896
01:00:02,051 --> 01:00:02,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

897
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and 3DS is getting a version as well.

898
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:11,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Power of Illusion, which made me think of Castle of Illusion, so maybe that's a good sign?

899
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:15,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That is interesting.

900
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:18,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic Mickey, we've known about this for a while from some of the leaks.

901
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've talked about it on the show before, but...

902
01:00:20,672 --> 01:00:25,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting all that aside, are we surprised it's actually happening, or no?

903
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:27,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Epic Mickey... It sold well.

904
01:00:28,074 --> 01:00:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

905
01:00:28,554 --> 01:00:28,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

906
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:33,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe for those of us that focus more on our 360s... It had a lot of neat stuff in it.

907
01:00:34,036 --> 01:00:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.

908
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:39,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it was a bad game, but the Wii-only thing really kept it away from the hardcore.

909
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:46,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and see, that's kind of... I think that's the reason why I didn't play the game, was remember the original concept art for...

910
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:50,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Epic Mickey, where it's going to be really fucking twisted and dark.

911
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:58,830
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, not necessarily Tim Burton, but Guillermo del Toro put out a version of Mickey Mouse.

912
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,353
[SPEAKER_10]: That was like fucking the game right there.

913
01:01:02,553 --> 01:01:05,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just really crazy and steampunk and all this stuff.

914
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we got the version that came out in the Wii, and they just kind of like...

915
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,000
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, kind of washed all that.

916
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:17,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there was still a lot of dark stuff in there, but it wasn't anywhere near like this adult Mickey game that was supposed to be coming out.

917
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:20,566
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of like, oh, it's Mickey saving the land.

918
01:01:20,586 --> 01:01:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't have a truly adult Mickey game.

919
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:27,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, why can't you have a... Okay, let's put it this way.

920
01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:30,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Not an adult game, but a very, very dark.

921
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:32,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark, dark, dark, dark Mickey game.

922
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:34,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Epic Mickey is about as dark as you're going to get.

923
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:36,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's the Disney image.

924
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:40,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to associate Disney with dark things.

925
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:42,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking the company and Mickey Mouse as a whole.

926
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:48,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney does some dark-ish... I mean, you could call Alice in Wonderland a little bit dark.

927
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:48,943
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Kingdom Hearts, though?

928
01:01:48,963 --> 01:01:50,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Tron, even, is a little bit dark.

929
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Kingdom Hearts kind of goes a little bit dark with stuff.

930
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:55,007
[SPEAKER_10]: But even Kingdom Hearts is a little bit kiddy.

931
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:56,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love Kingdom Hearts.

932
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:02,491
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying, like, touching on more of like, you know, just having the stuff be all really twisted.

933
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:08,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's dark that comes out of Disney really comes from Touchstone or whatever their movie arm is.

934
01:02:08,255 --> 01:02:09,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

935
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Buena Vista or whatever it's called.

936
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:13,838
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just have it produced by Touchstone Interactive or whatever.

937
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:14,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Make up a company.

938
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:16,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

939
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:17,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

940
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:17,638
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

941
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:22,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they're doing PlayStation 3 and Xbox as well.

942
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:27,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be, you know, because the Wii is on its way out, especially with the Wii U coming out this year.

943
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they're stepping it up to the other systems.

944
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:31,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is on its way out.

945
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:35,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's literally hardly any games coming out at all for the Wii.

946
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, a page right out of the 23rd Magus Jokes book.

947
01:02:40,514 --> 01:02:41,315
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready for this one?

948
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:44,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture in chat says, Adult Mickey?

949
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you fucking goofy?

950
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:51,164
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it got his main laugh.

951
01:02:51,224 --> 01:02:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to...

952
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:06,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Ragenator in our chatroom says, Sky, please tell us you were either drunk and or high when you saw Twilight.

953
01:03:06,269 --> 01:03:08,210
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was neither drunk nor high.

954
01:03:08,631 --> 01:03:09,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fat.

955
01:03:10,172 --> 01:03:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I was eating pizza at the time.

956
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:14,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was fat, but I was not drunk or high.

957
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:19,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think pizza contains things that will get you wasted?

958
01:03:19,419 --> 01:03:19,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

959
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

960
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me put it this way.

961
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:25,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Twilight, even Rift Tracks couldn't make that movie good.

962
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that love it.

963
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: They swear it's only for the guilty pleasure.

964
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:33,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You should really question your friendship with them.

965
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, because they're close friends of mine, but it's like, oh my God.

966
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:38,393
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you know what?

967
01:03:38,493 --> 01:03:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my things too.

968
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:42,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody understands Rocky Horror Picture Show, so whatever.

969
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:43,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Xanadu.

970
01:03:44,315 --> 01:03:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you are a little weird.

971
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:46,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

972
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair

973
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it isn't on Xbox Live Arcade.

974
01:04:07,502 --> 01:04:10,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the one fucking platform Dragon's Lair isn't on.

975
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:14,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I could get it on, oh God, I could get it on DVD.

976
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:15,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it on my DVD player.

977
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:16,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Blu-ray.

978
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it on my iPhone.

979
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:20,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get it on the PlayStation.

980
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:22,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega CD.

981
01:04:22,535 --> 01:04:25,158
[SPEAKER_02]: This game has been on everything CD-based.

982
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:28,541
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when the early versions were out, the best version was on the CD-i.

983
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?

984
01:04:30,182 --> 01:04:31,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was the full version.

985
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:32,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

986
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair Dragon's Lair

987
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,060
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several ways you can look at this.

988
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,944
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go, well, I mean, they've put it out so many other times, they had to do something new to it.

989
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could look at it and go, they're ruining my childhood in front of my eyes.

990
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:39,190
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about this?

991
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I especially want to know, DarkSakura, because you like Dragon's Lair.

992
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about Kinect support?

993
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm indifferent about it because I'm not going to buy it.

994
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:50,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, how many other versions of Dragon's Lair do I own?

995
01:05:51,877 --> 01:06:02,226
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it kind of would be like, you know, for all the people who like... Actually, I can think of a benefit on this.

996
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:06,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people who may not be able to use a controller...

997
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:37,124
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe people with no arms they can use their feet well to be fair you would have to like some of the motions they're talking about are raising your hand up to grab the rope so unless you can trick the Kinect to think your foot is your hand which maybe is possible or use something else I don't know you're right there could be somebody with a disability where they can't use a controller but I don't know how many people would fit into the category of can't use a controller can use these Kinect commands

998
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:39,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they have no hands.

999
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:42,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're missing fingers.

1000
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:43,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're stretching.

1001
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:47,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just saying that they put it out there for a reason.

1002
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:49,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's gonna probably like it and pay for it.

1003
01:06:50,328 --> 01:06:50,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me.

1004
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:51,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't care.

1005
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them do whatever they want to with it.

1006
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not costing me any money.

1007
01:06:57,033 --> 01:07:02,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com Stan in our chatroom says, Oh no, does that mean you can put your face on that guy's face?

1008
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:03,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirk the Daring, you mean?

1009
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:05,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope not.

1010
01:07:07,082 --> 01:07:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's really hope not.

1011
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:09,424
[SPEAKER_02]: More like Derp the Daring.

1012
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:13,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says, Dragon's Lair plus Kinect.

1013
01:07:13,647 --> 01:07:15,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they think this was a good idea?

1014
01:07:16,569 --> 01:07:16,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1015
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:21,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're props to them trying to do something new.

1016
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:23,413
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about the nicest thing I can say.

1017
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:25,555
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to make it a party game, a social game.

1018
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:28,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, because it's Dragon's Lair.

1019
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:29,918
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to do something to... Oh, yeah.

1020
01:07:29,938 --> 01:07:32,400
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think party, I think bust out Dragon's Lair.

1021
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,320
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

1022
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:58,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I got your news.

1023
01:07:58,548 --> 01:07:59,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I got your news right here.

1024
01:08:00,969 --> 01:08:04,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior.

1025
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:05,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Warning.

1026
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up!

1027
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:09,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not true, but still.

1028
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:23,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is another bill that wants to label any game that's E or higher that exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior.

1029
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,039
[SPEAKER_02]: E or higher?

1030
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:28,136
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be all games.

1031
01:08:28,836 --> 01:08:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I can think of maybe two games that had the Y, the youth rating on it.

1032
01:08:35,483 --> 01:08:36,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's old.

1033
01:08:36,164 --> 01:08:37,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's EC nowadays.

1034
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:40,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, I can think of maybe two games.

1035
01:08:42,597 --> 01:08:45,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Frank Wolf, Virginia, Joe Baca, California,

1036
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:28,548
[SPEAKER_06]: who basically want they call it the Violence of Video Games Labeling Act and I mean basically they've done this before they did it in 2009 which was for TNUP they're just not giving up and it's already been proven to be unconstitutional so I don't know what they're thinking you know there's a saying that doing the same thing multiple times in a row and expecting different results is insanity

1037
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're insane.

1038
01:09:33,726 --> 01:09:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't vote for them.

1039
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:38,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Bros.

1040
01:09:38,744 --> 01:09:40,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii will lead to aggressive behavior

1041
01:10:08,524 --> 01:10:09,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine Babies.

1042
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:12,830
[SPEAKER_02]: SingStar Abba will lean to aggressive behavior.

1043
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza.

1044
01:10:14,232 --> 01:10:26,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here, basically, this is what they said about the last time they tried to do this, is that basically that the Supreme Court found all of the data lacking and unpersuasive.

1045
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:41,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, even these own studies, if you go and read them, they contradict themselves because they also bring up that violent movies or any movie causes the same reaction in a child already predisposed towards it.

1046
01:10:41,923 --> 01:10:47,609
[SPEAKER_06]: It has just as much influence as a movie, as a book, as songs, as anything audiovisual.

1047
01:10:49,031 --> 01:10:52,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So, these men are clearly insane.

1048
01:10:53,137 --> 01:10:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that I can say.

1049
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is insanity.

1050
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:05,882
[SPEAKER_02]: On a tangent here for a minute, speaking of politicians who don't understand video games, did you hear the latest in the Leland Yee saga?

1051
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what?

1052
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:14,368
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing is that this is a bill that you look at and go, yes, we do need this.

1053
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:25,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Leland Yee was the guy in California, I want to say Democrat out of San Francisco, who was trying to pass the bill on violent video games not being able to be sold online.

1054
01:11:26,176 --> 01:11:28,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1055
01:11:47,589 --> 01:11:51,450
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote a bill this week that actually you look at and go, okay, now that makes sense.

1056
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That's technology he does understand.

1057
01:11:53,751 --> 01:12:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: He authored a bill in California which will make it illegal for employers to ask you for your Facebook password because you might have been hearing the stories this week, the nightmare stories about people that went into job interviews and the interviewees were like, okay, log into Facebook for me so I can check out what you're really like.

1058
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's like, wow, that's an invasion of privacy.

1059
01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:15,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Employers shouldn't be able to do that.

1060
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, Facebook has come out and said, don't do it.

1061
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And now Leland Yee is going to make it illegal in California.

1062
01:12:21,743 --> 01:12:24,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, well, that's a smart – oh, wait.

1063
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:25,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's him.

1064
01:12:26,086 --> 01:12:28,148
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all right.

1065
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:29,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Better read the fine text.

1066
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:31,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure he's got violent video game stuff hidden in there.

1067
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:32,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be hidden in there.

1068
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:32,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to look for it.

1069
01:12:33,011 --> 01:12:33,431
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.

1070
01:12:33,472 --> 01:12:34,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pass it through.

1071
01:12:34,252 --> 01:12:40,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually posted a comic on my Tumblr yesterday that was a woman in an interview.

1072
01:12:40,098 --> 01:12:42,020
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, okay, well, you've passed all of this.

1073
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let me see your Facebook.

1074
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:45,183
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, let me see yours.

1075
01:12:46,954 --> 01:12:48,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's what I would say too.

1076
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:51,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably wouldn't get the job, but would you want to work for a company that does that?

1077
01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:51,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1078
01:12:51,435 --> 01:12:57,456
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough because in this day and age, people really, really need jobs and it's kind of gross.

1079
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gross that employers are exploiting that.

1080
01:13:00,437 --> 01:13:01,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross.

1081
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I think employers that do that should be called out.

1082
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should have a list of employers that are violating the privacy of their employees.

1083
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:11,119
[SPEAKER_10]: And create two Facebook pages.

1084
01:13:12,665 --> 01:13:13,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, right?

1085
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just say, I don't have one.

1086
01:13:15,966 --> 01:13:16,666
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't believe you.

1087
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:17,366
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't believe you.

1088
01:13:17,386 --> 01:13:18,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll search for you.

1089
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:22,047
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a fake name on the internet, it'll be hard to find.

1090
01:13:23,488 --> 01:13:25,548
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, anyone can read my Facebook page.

1091
01:13:25,688 --> 01:13:26,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

1092
01:13:26,288 --> 01:13:27,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't post anything private on there anyways.

1093
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:28,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1094
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:31,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my mother and my rabbi are on my Facebook.

1095
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So, really.

1096
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see where not everybody would want their employers on their Facebook.

1097
01:13:36,384 --> 01:13:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1098
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:43,049
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's a private... Yes, I have co-workers on Facebook, but it's my choice.

1099
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:48,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want him on my Facebook either because I just don't want to talk to him on Facebook.

1100
01:13:49,234 --> 01:13:49,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really care.

1101
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:51,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

1102
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:54,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with some release dates.

1103
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:58,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a gaming store near you.

1104
01:13:58,561 --> 01:13:59,302
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the U.S.

1105
01:13:59,862 --> 01:14:00,923
[SPEAKER_10]: That's slowing down a bit.

1106
01:14:01,424 --> 01:14:03,806
[SPEAKER_10]: GoGo Crazy Bones on the Nintendo DS.

1107
01:14:03,846 --> 01:14:05,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that was delayed to this week.

1108
01:14:06,168 --> 01:14:07,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee to aggressive behavior.

1109
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:08,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Those crazy bones.

1110
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn them.

1111
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:13,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Supremacy MMA for the PlayStation Vita.

1112
01:14:13,974 --> 01:14:15,596
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming out this week as well.

1113
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:18,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Myst on the 3DS.

1114
01:14:18,298 --> 01:14:19,659
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in 3D and it's Myst.

1115
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:21,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1116
01:14:21,593 --> 01:14:23,714
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's awesome, 15 years ago.

1117
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:26,156
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have a parody of that game called Pissed.

1118
01:14:26,676 --> 01:14:28,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that, actually.

1119
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:29,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I never played it.

1120
01:14:29,738 --> 01:14:30,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was funny.

1121
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:36,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can guarantee that there's 100% more mist in that game than there is in the Silent Hill HD Collection.

1122
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:39,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you did there.

1123
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:42,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Country Dance All-Stars for Kinect.

1124
01:14:47,041 --> 01:15:07,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Warriors Orochi 3 on Xbox 360 Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week including collector's editions if you really need a collector's edition for a golf game sure why not the Capcom Digital Collection on Xbox 360 which is a collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that are already out there

1125
01:15:10,441 --> 01:15:15,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe or maybe not this week, because no one seems to have the answer for it, Ridge Racer Unbounded.

1126
01:15:16,007 --> 01:15:19,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly coming out this week, possibly delayed to who knows when.

1127
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:21,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even Namco doesn't know.

1128
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:24,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So, possibly this week.

1129
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:27,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, going to Japan.

1130
01:15:28,019 --> 01:15:28,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we good to go to Japan now?

1131
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, we're going to Japan.

1132
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:37,004
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo 3DS in Japan this week, probably a big release some of you might care about.

1133
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:38,865
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be worth importing to some of you.

1134
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:45,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance gets released on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan on the 29th.

1135
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:50,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, you can't import from the 3DS unless you have a Japanese region 3DS.

1136
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, it is not region-free like the original DS was, right?

1137
01:15:53,693 --> 01:15:54,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1138
01:15:55,053 --> 01:16:01,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you want to get a Japanese 3DS, there is specifically a Kingdom Hearts 3D DS that you can get.

1139
01:16:01,497 --> 01:16:06,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a black one that kind of looks nice, like a little inscription of Disney.

1140
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's a sticker they put on it, but it looks like an inscription.

1141
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:09,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1142
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:14,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little more permanent, so that's good.

1143
01:16:15,325 --> 01:16:18,448
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, kind of your big release, and that's on the 3DS this week.

1144
01:16:18,468 --> 01:16:20,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some other games coming out in Japan this week.

1145
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:31,680
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PlayStation Vita, there's Pro Yakyuu Spirits 2012, Otumao to Seven-Nin no Himi Gimitachi, Shin Osamu Monogatari.

1146
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming out from Konami this week.

1147
01:16:34,362 --> 01:16:38,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is a series I recognize on the Vita.

1148
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:44,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a chibi character role-playing game.

1149
01:16:47,322 --> 01:16:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the people at first, I was like, oh, it's like Suikoden, but it's definitely not.

1150
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:55,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too cartoony to be that, so something a little different there.

1151
01:16:55,108 --> 01:16:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's from Konami, which is a pretty big publisher in Japan.

1152
01:17:00,111 --> 01:17:03,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the consoles real quick, let me take a look at the Xbox 360.

1153
01:17:04,735 --> 01:17:06,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Japan gets Duke Nukem Forever.

1154
01:17:08,411 --> 01:17:09,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay away from it.

1155
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.

1156
01:17:11,072 --> 01:17:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Root Double, Before Crime, After Days, Mahjong, Dream Club, all on the 360.

1157
01:17:16,454 --> 01:17:21,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, on the PlayStation 3 this week, Grand Theft Auto, episodes from Liberty Cities.

1158
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:22,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a price reduction.

1159
01:17:22,896 --> 01:17:24,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem Forever is out there as well.

1160
01:17:24,777 --> 01:17:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: The Silent Hill HD collection makes its way to Japan.

1161
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:34,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Idol Master, Gravure for You, Volume 6, comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.

1162
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go, your Japanese releases.

1163
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:39,697
[SPEAKER_02]: How about UK?

1164
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:40,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a few.

1165
01:17:41,618 --> 01:17:47,220
[SPEAKER_06]: For the UK releases, we have on the 28th, we have Wrecked, Revenge Revisited.

1166
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:50,521
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 29th, Silent Hill HD Collection.

1167
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:59,665
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 30th, Silent Hill Downpour, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Ridge Racer Unbound, Warriors Orochi 3.

1168
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:02,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1169
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:04,709
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1170
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1171
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

1172
01:18:08,912 --> 01:18:10,013
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1173
01:18:10,633 --> 01:18:18,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently Ubisoft is hoping that they can get rid of their DRM that they have on PC.

1174
01:18:18,918 --> 01:18:27,664
[SPEAKER_10]: According to a recent interview with Eurogamer, Chris Early, who is the vice president of digital publishing at Ubisoft, said,

1175
01:18:28,544 --> 01:18:34,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Talked about some of their anti-piracy measures and how it's a tricky balancing act.

1176
01:18:36,327 --> 01:18:48,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they were talking a little bit about how it's kind of inconveniencing some of their customers and that at the same time, they don't want to put...

1177
01:18:50,652 --> 01:18:57,722
[SPEAKER_10]: They're having a hard time convincing themselves to not put DRM on their PC tiles because they know they're going to get pirated.

1178
01:18:57,762 --> 01:19:06,736
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're trying to find a balance where they can offer enough value in a game where people will want to buy it legitimately without having to

1179
01:19:07,437 --> 01:19:08,578
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1180
01:19:26,501 --> 01:19:53,431
[SPEAKER_10]: but right now they're saying the question is with enough ongoing content development content release engagement at the community level we can create that kind of MMO value system I think we can as the rest of the game industry continues to evolve the more you hear about cloud gaming the more you hear about companion gaming the less pirated games should work in all of that environment

1181
01:19:54,031 --> 01:20:01,813
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, they're trying to make it where you're... Well, cloud gaming, I mean, they're basically making it where you don't have any of the content.

1182
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,993
[SPEAKER_10]: You just kind of access it.

1183
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:10,976
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the MMO stuff, just kind of more... It sounds like a lot of pay-to-purchase, pay-to-play stuff.

1184
01:20:11,376 --> 01:20:11,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1185
01:20:12,256 --> 01:20:18,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, yeah, they're trying to enrich it by giving it more to download.

1186
01:20:18,818 --> 01:20:21,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like the Mass Effect 2 thing I'm going through right now.

1187
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a copy of Mass Effect 2 for $20, brand new.

1188
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, fuck yeah, sweet, a copy of Mass Effect 2.

1189
01:20:26,999 --> 01:20:31,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost got pissed as hell when I saw it came with a free code for the Cerebrus Network.

1190
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Expires January 1st, 2012.

1191
01:20:34,481 --> 01:21:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just bought it off the shelf at Fry's brand new like but it's still I tried using it anyway it still worked so crisis averted right so by the way those pro tip those codes might not actually expire when they say they do just throwing it out there but the other thing I wanted to say is that I find that now I'm being told oh I have to buy the $7 DLC because it will change some things in three and then there's other DLC I might have to drop another 20 bucks in DLC to get the full experience and

1192
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're still going to get $40 out of me for the whole game, even though I thought I was getting it on sale.

1193
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:17,337
[SPEAKER_10]: What they really should do, and like I was saying before with the whole Killzone 3 online thing, how that was free, that's how you get people interested in your game.

1194
01:21:17,617 --> 01:21:19,438
[SPEAKER_10]: You put that shit out there digitally for free.

1195
01:21:20,818 --> 01:21:21,959
[SPEAKER_10]: You can even do it like a demo.

1196
01:21:22,599 --> 01:21:25,281
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you add content and you're basically free to play.

1197
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: You're free to start playing it but then you pay for additional content or you can get everything boxed together.

1198
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:35,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like the whole idea that Ridge Racer on the Vita would be awesome if it was free?

1199
01:21:37,222 --> 01:21:48,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't go as far as saying it'd be awesome, but it'd be a lot easier to swallow that, okay, yes, there's only three tracks and five cars because this is the free version of the game versus the $30 version of the game.

1200
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:49,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's the Motorstorm.

1201
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:52,400
[SPEAKER_02]: The Motorstorm game's free, and they have a lot of DLC for it.

1202
01:21:52,620 --> 01:22:11,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, that's kind of a perfect example there, although that DLC, you don't really need any of it, I mean, because it's just cars that change the appearance of your cars, which, since you're not really racing anybody anyways, I don't really see the point of making your car look different, considering that I don't think they handle any different, but whatever.

1203
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:17,752
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can do that, and that DLC, though, is anywhere from like a quarter a pop to like a buck, I mean, which...

1204
01:22:18,232 --> 01:22:19,373
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1205
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:47,914
[SPEAKER_02]: and I knew this comment was coming in the chat room.

1206
01:22:47,954 --> 01:22:51,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Acidic Vampire says, Sky, just drop the money for it.

1207
01:22:51,296 --> 01:22:54,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect 2's DLC is worth it and all the Mass Effect fans are joining in.

1208
01:22:55,078 --> 01:22:59,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinel says, you don't really need the Weapon Armor DLC and Shane says, yeah, forget it, just get the story stuff.

1209
01:23:00,382 --> 01:23:09,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, alright, yeah, yeah, you guys made your point but, you know, and Mass Effect 2 is kind of one game out of a lot that I would be willing to do that for.

1210
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:12,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, I actually, it held my attention long enough to beat it.

1211
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:13,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That says a lot right there.

1212
01:23:14,551 --> 01:23:14,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

1213
01:23:16,232 --> 01:23:16,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1214
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:20,333
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get around to it, I may have DLC codes for you for Mass Effect 3.

1215
01:23:21,054 --> 01:23:21,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice!

1216
01:23:22,554 --> 01:23:23,874
[SPEAKER_10]: For some of the pre-order stuff.

1217
01:23:23,974 --> 01:23:26,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I still have some left over.

1218
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:27,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Send those my way!

1219
01:23:27,415 --> 01:23:29,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Save one for when I borrow Rob's.

1220
01:23:30,056 --> 01:23:34,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Jamie is already resigned to the fact that she's going to have to play the whole damn series.

1221
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:40,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and hey, if anybody needs any of the Genki codes for Saints Row the Third, I think I have like 200 of them still, so...

1222
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:42,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like one of those too.

1223
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:44,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Send me a direct message on Twitter.

1224
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:52,502
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Mass Effect fans in chat, especially Shane, do I get like a big old high five or a big old cookie for paying it forward to Jamie?

1225
01:23:52,962 --> 01:23:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Where now she's taking my copy and she's going to get sucked into this?

1226
01:23:56,764 --> 01:24:00,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, she might come on the show next week and go, I hated it.

1227
01:24:00,985 --> 01:24:01,845
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are stupid.

1228
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:02,465
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1229
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:08,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I think right there, that's a perfect example of how they should be treating games instead of saying, oh, well, we want each person to play an online pass.

1230
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:09,807
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1231
01:24:31,044 --> 01:24:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitstone wants to know if any of those codes are for PC.

1232
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:47,740
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1233
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:49,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1234
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:50,823
[SPEAKER_10]: PS3 and 360 only.

1235
01:24:50,843 --> 01:24:52,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1236
01:24:53,585 --> 01:24:53,846
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1237
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:55,607
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story for you guys.

1238
01:24:55,647 --> 01:24:58,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's a slow news week, so I'm going to let this story through.

1239
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:02,493
[SPEAKER_02]: In a more busy news week, it would have been cut, but we needed something.

1240
01:25:02,573 --> 01:25:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go ahead and address these rumors about Grand Theft Auto V, supposedly from an ex-Rockstar employee on the GameSpot forums.

1241
01:25:12,162 --> 01:25:12,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1242
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:15,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Fat Grain Assault.

1243
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm doing this instead of Loki so that Loki can sit here and go, it's bullshit or, oh, it sounds like it's legit.

1244
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, there will be one protagonist character, one character alone.

1245
01:25:28,215 --> 01:25:29,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Albert Da Silva is the name.

1246
01:25:30,396 --> 01:25:34,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Half Hispanic man who was once a part of a crime city, crime family in Vice City.

1247
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:35,819
[SPEAKER_02]: True or false?

1248
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:36,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1249
01:25:38,285 --> 01:25:39,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not very fun to play with.

1250
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:43,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer will hold 32 people on the Xbox and PlayStation 3.

1251
01:25:45,008 --> 01:25:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Unknown about PC.

1252
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:49,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Red Dead Redemption, you'll be able to form gangs.

1253
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:52,211
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not ranked through XP, but through reputation.

1254
01:25:53,671 --> 01:25:58,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we know that to be true already, but I think a lot of it is just speculation.

1255
01:25:58,213 --> 01:25:59,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I think all this is speculation.

1256
01:25:59,774 --> 01:26:00,614
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know.

1257
01:26:02,556 --> 01:26:06,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of this seems like educated speculation to me when I read it too.

1258
01:26:06,798 --> 01:26:09,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's educated speculation.

1259
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:18,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, the map is about five times as large as the Grand Theft Auto 4 map and the city of Los Santos takes up just under half of this area.

1260
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:20,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's bigger than two Grand Theft Auto 4 Liberty Cities.

1261
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:21,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, safe bet.

1262
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:50,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they can do it like that I mean it could be bigger because I think the Red Dead Redemption map was pretty big but I mean it's a lot of it's just fitting in textures and fitting in the maps themselves I mean the object placement formats and stuff like that it's pretty small but it's when you get all the different textures in the game so I don't know if it's gonna be five times as large I mean it's gonna be pretty big but I don't know I just assume it's gonna be larger

1263
01:26:51,823 --> 01:26:54,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Cars and guns are customizable to an extent.

1264
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:58,530
[SPEAKER_02]: For an example, you can customize a gun to have a suppressor on it, and you can install nitrous into cars.

1265
01:26:59,051 --> 01:27:03,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you could already do that in Grand Theft Auto.

1266
01:27:03,756 --> 01:27:05,457
[SPEAKER_10]: They used to have that in San Andreas.

1267
01:27:05,898 --> 01:27:09,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily the suppressors, but that would be a nice feature.

1268
01:27:09,382 --> 01:27:12,625
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's going to be legit or not.

1269
01:27:12,867 --> 01:27:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let me get to some of the other good stuff, because this is getting boring already.

1270
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:21,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Radio stations now do traffic reports that are actually correct.

1271
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't know what route to take, you can check the traffic reports on your phone or on the Radio 7.

1272
01:27:26,086 --> 01:27:27,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The in-game TV has more channels.

1273
01:27:28,049 --> 01:27:29,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that seems like a safe bet.

1274
01:27:29,651 --> 01:27:35,116
[SPEAKER_10]: But once again, though, those in-game TV channels are fucking huge as far as the files go.

1275
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:41,642
[SPEAKER_10]: They're BIC-encoded videos that take up hundreds of megs.

1276
01:27:41,702 --> 01:27:55,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if they're going to fit that shit on a disc, they're going to have to do some sort of compression or something, because as of right now, on four episodes from Liberty City, they're not compressed at all, besides what the actual encoder does.

1277
01:27:55,814 --> 01:27:55,974
[SPEAKER_10]: But

1278
01:27:57,195 --> 01:28:11,882
[SPEAKER_02]: The protagonist can take drugs, which will have some effects, but smoking weed on the streetwalk will lead to getting a one-star wanted level.

1279
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,611
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like Saints Row 1 shit.

1280
01:28:15,732 --> 01:28:18,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know if I'd go with that.

1281
01:28:18,595 --> 01:28:20,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bored of this story already, so here's the biggest one.

1282
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:22,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is due in May 2013.

1283
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:28,447
[SPEAKER_02]: A more specific date has not been decided because the game is still needing six months to be fully developed.

1284
01:28:28,827 --> 01:28:30,449
[SPEAKER_02]: They will have a playable demo at E3.

1285
01:28:31,943 --> 01:28:38,048
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, again, speculation because we already know what their... We already know what the next quarter game is going to be, Max Payne 3.

1286
01:28:38,088 --> 01:28:47,577
[SPEAKER_10]: We already know what the fourth quarter game is going to be, which is going to be... Well, it's not necessarily the Rockstar, but Take-Two, which is going to be NBA 2K, NHL 2K if they actually put one out this year.

1287
01:28:47,737 --> 01:28:53,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, the big, big, big one is Bioshock Infinite.

1288
01:28:53,642 --> 01:28:55,383
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, that stuff's going to be coming out.

1289
01:28:55,443 --> 01:29:00,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you've got to figure, you know, it's going to be first or second quarter.

1290
01:29:00,245 --> 01:29:05,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, estimating they've got some other 2K stuff.

1291
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:10,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit, I completely forgot if, like, you know, XCOM's still in there somewhere.

1292
01:29:13,092 --> 01:29:16,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I want to say, like, the summer games probably.

1293
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:21,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Spec Ops, they've still got in there somewhere in June, I believe.

1294
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:23,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1295
01:29:23,577 --> 01:29:26,118
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of it just sounds like speculation.

1296
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:37,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, because I do follow a lot of Grand Theft Auto communities and stuff, there is one person each week saying, I heard something from a random rock star employee.

1297
01:29:38,262 --> 01:29:43,164
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to make these educated guesses so that if they're close, then yeah, people will say, hey, I said it first.

1298
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they're wrong, then no one will remember.

1299
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:47,305
[SPEAKER_02]: People have a need to be first sometimes.

1300
01:29:47,505 --> 01:29:47,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1301
01:29:48,986 --> 01:30:00,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I love some of the comments in our chatroom at chat.orangesentree.com Porkchop, what a delicious handle in the chatroom, says why would anyone waste time watching TV and Grand Theft Auto when you can go out and stomp hookers?

1302
01:30:00,713 --> 01:30:03,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually did watch a lot of the TV when Dan was playing it.

1303
01:30:04,435 --> 01:30:04,916
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

1304
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:06,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You're boring.

1305
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be killing more hookers.

1306
01:30:10,433 --> 01:30:15,637
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, What Grand Theft Auto V really needs is the SimCity Action News Reporter.

1307
01:30:15,797 --> 01:30:16,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1308
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:19,119
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love your topical sense of humor.

1309
01:30:19,179 --> 01:30:23,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do, because it gives me an excuse to play a clip from SimCity Action News.

1310
01:30:25,243 --> 01:30:28,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other news today, SimCity had its Founders Day Parade.

1311
01:30:29,566 --> 01:30:29,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait.

1312
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:31,407
[SPEAKER_00]: This just in.

1313
01:30:33,349 --> 01:30:33,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.

1314
01:30:40,472 --> 01:30:48,818
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, but I am told that Funzilla is cutting a path of destruction through SimCity, devastating the transportation system.

1315
01:30:50,399 --> 01:31:06,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently this 20-story lizard is picking up cars and buses and throwing them hundreds of yards as he moves closer to the SimCity Action Studios, which means that this is Carol Davenport signing off and getting the hell out of here.

1316
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Give her an Emmy.

1317
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Give her a goddamn Emmy.

1318
01:31:12,264 --> 01:31:13,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Lifetime Achievement Award.

1319
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,912
[SPEAKER_02]: At least give her a series on Bravo.

1320
01:31:18,553 --> 01:31:22,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Jurassic Park had just come out that same year, so that's funny.

1321
01:31:27,762 --> 01:31:32,187
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey!

1322
01:31:50,362 --> 01:32:00,471
[SPEAKER_02]: You kids need to stop playing your Grand Theft Auto V's and your SimCity Action News's and you need to check out this awesomely classic game.

1323
01:32:00,511 --> 01:32:01,492
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the classic game of the week?

1324
01:32:01,612 --> 01:32:04,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's classic game is Star Fox.

1325
01:32:05,135 --> 01:32:05,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1326
01:32:05,975 --> 01:32:07,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking great choice.

1327
01:32:07,657 --> 01:32:13,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Which came out as Starwing in Europe and Australia because there was a trademarked game that came out like in 1983. 1983.

1328
01:32:17,717 --> 01:32:17,937
[SPEAKER_02]: StarFox

1329
01:32:40,044 --> 01:32:45,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Fox is a rail shooter that used 3D polygon graphics.

1330
01:32:45,889 --> 01:32:49,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first Nintendo game to use full-on polygons.

1331
01:32:50,013 --> 01:32:54,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was powered by the Super FX chip, which was basically a coprocessor so that it could handle it.

1332
01:32:55,758 --> 01:33:08,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the characters were all designed by Takaya Imamura, based off of Kemono characters, basically, from old, I believe, 16th century Japanese art.

1333
01:33:08,805 --> 01:33:09,526
[SPEAKER_06]: This is pretty cool.

1334
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:12,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, basically, anthropomorphic characters.

1335
01:33:13,048 --> 01:33:13,288
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1336
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:17,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody in chat asked if they could do a barrel roll so I slapped them with a fish.

1337
01:33:17,743 --> 01:33:18,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.

1338
01:33:19,984 --> 01:33:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, this music is so epic.

1339
01:33:22,365 --> 01:33:23,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the first level music.

1340
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:25,666
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack was so fucking good.

1341
01:33:25,686 --> 01:33:26,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn this up a little bit.

1342
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:26,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1343
01:33:27,207 --> 01:33:29,228
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like seriously my favorite music in the game.

1344
01:33:30,788 --> 01:33:31,829
[SPEAKER_02]: What, the planet music?

1345
01:33:31,849 --> 01:33:33,369
[SPEAKER_06]: The very first level.

1346
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:35,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the music here.

1347
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The canary level.

1348
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:38,592
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole takeoff sequence and all that is awesome.

1349
01:33:38,632 --> 01:33:40,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's listen here for a minute here.

1350
01:33:40,713 --> 01:33:41,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Mark.

1351
01:33:43,206 --> 01:33:44,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1352
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:45,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Emergency.

1353
01:33:45,509 --> 01:33:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: This bridge has so much memories.

1354
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, the most epic music ever right here.

1355
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:13,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, Falco.

1356
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:15,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, Slippy.

1357
01:34:19,295 --> 01:34:23,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear, I spent the whole game going, I freaking hate Slippy, die!

1358
01:34:23,739 --> 01:34:24,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And shut up, Falco.

1359
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That was me the entire time I was playing this game.

1360
01:34:26,581 --> 01:34:32,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, this music just evokes the... America!

1361
01:34:33,046 --> 01:34:33,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah!

1362
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:35,609
[SPEAKER_06]: For a Japanese game, sure.

1363
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:42,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it involves Fox McCloud, who is the leader of the Star Fox team.

1364
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:52,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have these ships called Arwings, which are really floating polygon-y things, and they're pretty cool.

1365
01:34:52,986 --> 01:34:57,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got thrusters and retro rockets that let you speed up or slow down.

1366
01:34:58,331 --> 01:35:02,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got bombs and pew-pew laser things.

1367
01:35:03,234 --> 01:35:04,175
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear the pew-pew noises?

1368
01:35:04,515 --> 01:35:05,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1369
01:35:09,924 --> 01:35:15,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got a little bit different thing in the damage on here.

1370
01:35:15,647 --> 01:35:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You've actually got an energy shield that controls how much damage you can absorb before the craft destroys.

1371
01:35:21,929 --> 01:35:26,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can bump into stuff and you take some damage, you don't just immediately explode.

1372
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:38,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes if your wings clip against certain obstacles, they'll break off and it will affect the handling of your Arwing, which was pretty innovative, I thought, for a game of its time.

1373
01:35:39,432 --> 01:35:43,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that was interesting about this is that it didn't have a difficulty selection.

1374
01:35:44,554 --> 01:35:49,776
[SPEAKER_06]: After you finished the first stage, you actually would pick a path that you could go on.

1375
01:35:50,856 --> 01:35:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you could pick the easy option, the normal option, or the hard option, depending on which path you took.

1376
01:35:57,098 --> 01:36:01,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could mix and match your game any way, and it had multiple patterns.

1377
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Outrun Outrun Outrun Outrun

1378
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:29,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So you also have your wingmen.

1379
01:36:29,584 --> 01:36:36,890
[SPEAKER_06]: You have Peppy Hair, Slippy Toad, sucker, and Falco Lombardi, who I hated Falco so much.

1380
01:36:38,071 --> 01:36:47,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was kind of cool because if you accidentally shot one of your guys, you wouldn't hurt him, but they would say, Hey, what are you doing shooting at me?

1381
01:36:48,061 --> 01:36:49,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Falco and I suck.

1382
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I suck at these things off my toes.

1383
01:36:51,585 --> 01:36:57,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you actually have to save your wingmen from being attacked by other enemies too, which was almost always slippy.

1384
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:03,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so you have to help them so that they'll always be there with you.

1385
01:37:03,758 --> 01:37:06,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And you even have, you know, your little flying formation thing, which is pretty cool.

1386
01:37:08,035 --> 01:37:09,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

1387
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:14,481
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a few really neat things with this, too.

1388
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:18,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it was using the Super FX chip.

1389
01:37:18,404 --> 01:37:26,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually was based off on... There was a prototype on the NES that was called NES Glider that was inspired by a game called Star Glider.

1390
01:37:27,152 --> 01:37:29,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they brought the prototype to this NES.

1391
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:30,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And once they...

1392
01:37:31,636 --> 01:37:38,484
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually hired a company to create the Super FX chip so that they could have the 3D graphics in there.

1393
01:37:39,586 --> 01:37:46,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a lot harder, a lot more powerful than the SNES processor.

1394
01:37:46,354 --> 01:37:50,699
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a joke going around that the SNES was basically just a box to hold the chip.

1395
01:37:52,304 --> 01:37:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Ima Mura Hajime Hirasawa

1396
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:22,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also stated by Miyamoto that he wanted to use animal characters since he didn't want to do conventional sci-fi with robots, monsters, and superheroes.

1397
01:38:23,818 --> 01:38:25,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's how it came about.

1398
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:34,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So, moving a little bit forward, there's secret levels in the game.

1399
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:37,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever do any of the secret levels, Rob?

1400
01:38:37,336 --> 01:38:37,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1401
01:38:37,616 --> 01:38:44,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there the thing where you had to shoot the little planet, and the little planet that would pop out for like a half second, you had to do something, and you had to shoot it in the eye?

1402
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:45,261
[SPEAKER_06]: There were, okay.

1403
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:49,383
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember this correctly, because keep in mind, it's been a while since I've done it.

1404
01:38:49,544 --> 01:38:55,648
[SPEAKER_06]: To get to the black hole level, you have to shoot these rings.

1405
01:38:55,948 --> 01:38:57,329
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little central part.

1406
01:38:57,549 --> 01:38:58,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the slot machine level?

1407
01:38:58,850 --> 01:38:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the slot machine.

1408
01:38:59,631 --> 01:39:00,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the slot machine.

1409
01:39:02,533 --> 01:39:02,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1410
01:39:03,153 --> 01:39:06,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going from the easy one to the... This video is somebody actually doing it.

1411
01:39:06,656 --> 01:39:08,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll... No, that's the first one.

1412
01:39:10,418 --> 01:39:11,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The slot machine's later on.

1413
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me fast forward the video a little bit then.

1414
01:39:14,141 --> 01:39:14,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the slot machine?

1415
01:39:15,021 --> 01:39:15,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.

1416
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:17,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that's the one.

1417
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:18,678
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the slot machine one.

1418
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think somebody axes it here because here's the... Yeah, that's the slot machine.

1419
01:39:24,941 --> 01:39:43,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyway, let me... There was one where you have to shoot these certain rings a certain way and then fly through the center of the explosion and then this ugly-ass planet pops up that looks like... You know, it kind of looks like the moon from Majora's Mask.

1420
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:45,632
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a troll face to me.

1421
01:39:46,575 --> 01:40:06,068
[SPEAKER_06]: to me it looks like the moon from Majora's Mask and you have to shoot it or fly into it or something and so you get to go to the first black hole and the black hole basically whatever different ring pops up in the black hole if you fly through it it warps you to that level shut up Slippy anyway

1422
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,830
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1423
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:25,302
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1424
01:40:43,502 --> 01:40:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1425
01:41:08,584 --> 01:41:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: and all this crazy Mood 7.

1426
01:41:10,426 --> 01:41:13,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And FX.

1427
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1428
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there only one other game that had the FX chip in it?

1429
01:41:17,073 --> 01:41:18,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be Stunt Race FX.

1430
01:41:18,555 --> 01:41:20,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was one more.

1431
01:41:20,897 --> 01:41:22,058
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a robot game.

1432
01:41:22,779 --> 01:41:23,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, there was.

1433
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:23,720
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

1434
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep in mind, there's the Star Fox 2 prototype.

1435
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,267
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1436
01:41:50,042 --> 01:41:52,303
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a number of Star Fox games come out since then.

1437
01:41:52,383 --> 01:41:54,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Fox 2 was in the works for Super Nintendo.

1438
01:41:56,724 --> 01:42:00,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the head programmer said that they actually finished the game.

1439
01:42:02,346 --> 01:42:04,967
[SPEAKER_06]: There was Star Fox 64.

1440
01:42:06,107 --> 01:42:11,889
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually ROM dumps of Star Fox 2 that were from different stages of development.

1441
01:42:12,449 --> 01:42:16,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And someone actually translated it and made a patch for it.

1442
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:45,659
[SPEAKER_06]: there is Star Fox on the GameCube that was Star Fox Adventures by Rare we had Star Fox Assault for the GameCube that was done by Namco and it was a third person shooter there was Star Fox Command that was on the DS and now there's Star Fox makes appearances in a micro game in Wario where Smooth moves and you fight basically the Nintendo robot who has a huge mungus zapper and that's it

1443
01:42:47,034 --> 01:42:47,334
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1444
01:42:47,894 --> 01:42:48,695
[SPEAKER_02]: A true classic.

1445
01:42:49,395 --> 01:42:50,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Fox.

1446
01:42:50,476 --> 01:42:52,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, one of those games I had to go, really?

1447
01:42:53,097 --> 01:42:54,457
[SPEAKER_02]: She's never done Star Fox before?

1448
01:42:54,697 --> 01:42:54,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1449
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:55,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go, really?

1450
01:42:55,978 --> 01:42:57,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never done Star Fox before?

1451
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1452
01:42:59,099 --> 01:43:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, 200 episodes into this or whatever.

1453
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:01,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Also funny.

1454
01:43:02,881 --> 01:43:05,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The Star Wing logo uses a completely different font than Star Fox.

1455
01:43:05,962 --> 01:43:06,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1456
01:43:06,663 --> 01:43:06,803
Hmm.

1457
01:43:07,623 --> 01:43:11,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some folks in chat were like, boy, Nintendo really ruined this franchise.

1458
01:43:11,126 --> 01:43:14,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the Star Fox Adventures, of course, was not very well received.

1459
01:43:14,349 --> 01:43:17,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think people liked Star Fox 64 enough.

1460
01:43:18,472 --> 01:43:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of Star Fox 2 kind of went into that.

1461
01:43:20,353 --> 01:43:23,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, Star Fox Adventures wasn't really pretty.

1462
01:43:24,096 --> 01:43:24,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's too bad.

1463
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:28,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we are going to take a quick break.

1464
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:28,760
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go anywhere.

1465
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,342
[SPEAKER_02]: We got more Orange Lodge Radio to come.

1466
01:43:30,602 --> 01:43:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that might actually be better than Star Fox.

1467
01:43:33,649 --> 01:43:35,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, maybe not, but they're still pretty good, so stick around.

1468
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,627
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1469
01:43:44,847 --> 01:43:47,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1470
01:43:47,449 --> 01:43:52,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live with episode number 451 for this March the 25th of 2012.

1471
01:43:54,595 --> 01:44:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we can't play these live break songs that we do on the podcast, but we were playing some music from DDR days.

1472
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:06,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And by coincidence, I happened to pick songs that were both from Dance Dance Revolution third mix, Korean songs.

1473
01:44:07,245 --> 01:44:09,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and man, I miss those games.

1474
01:44:09,746 --> 01:44:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss DDR back when it was so good.

1475
01:44:12,086 --> 01:44:18,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that, that community and everything we had in the songs were like legit, like, like not everybody ever understood the songs.

1476
01:44:18,448 --> 01:44:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some of you listening to the show now probably go, really, you guys kind of like that music.

1477
01:44:22,169 --> 01:44:24,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, there is just something about DDR music.

1478
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:25,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't explain it.

1479
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't put my finger on it.

1480
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:27,731
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, I miss those days.

1481
01:44:28,631 --> 01:44:28,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1482
01:44:30,616 --> 01:44:36,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually asked by Technus, who has played a third mix machine that was not a Korean version?

1483
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:37,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

1484
01:44:38,379 --> 01:44:40,059
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one here locally somewhere, didn't they?

1485
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:48,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the one that I played, I think it was AX2000, was a Japanese third mix from Arcade Infinity.

1486
01:44:48,662 --> 01:44:49,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, nice.

1487
01:44:51,264 --> 01:44:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear, I think, that they're trying to restart Arcade Infinity in another location or like something like it.

1488
01:44:57,578 --> 01:44:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.

1489
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it happens.

1490
01:45:00,204 --> 01:45:00,564
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1491
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:04,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news with some rapid fire news.

1492
01:45:05,433 --> 01:45:06,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Some quick stories for you guys.

1493
01:45:06,734 --> 01:45:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1494
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:19,464
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we heard about LittleBigPlanet carding, which was leaked out of the PlayStation event.

1495
01:45:19,685 --> 01:45:20,405
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation event.

1496
01:45:20,425 --> 01:45:21,006
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation event.

1497
01:45:21,026 --> 01:45:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell was it called?

1498
01:45:21,947 --> 01:45:21,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

1499
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:25,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.

1500
01:45:28,712 --> 01:45:30,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Low-key PlayStation event.

1501
01:45:30,914 --> 01:45:34,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it's going to be coming out on the Vita and PlayStation 3.

1502
01:45:35,238 --> 01:45:44,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Not surprisingly enough, though, it's actually being done by United Front Games, who are the developers behind Mod Nation Racers.

1503
01:45:45,027 --> 01:45:50,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So they kind of have a little bit of experience in play, share, create racing games.

1504
01:45:51,833 --> 01:46:00,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, at the same time, that makes me a little worried because... Well, maybe they'll take some of the feedback from the last one and make it better.

1505
01:46:01,162 --> 01:46:01,462
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1506
01:46:01,903 --> 01:46:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe?

1507
01:46:03,414 --> 01:46:03,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

1508
01:46:04,755 --> 01:46:06,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the trailer looks neat.

1509
01:46:06,757 --> 01:46:08,218
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a trailer out for it now.

1510
01:46:08,879 --> 01:46:10,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has potential.

1511
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:20,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just really sad that Media Molecule is not having a lot of feedback on it.

1512
01:46:20,268 --> 01:46:21,429
[SPEAKER_10]: At least I hope that they do.

1513
01:46:21,729 --> 01:46:22,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1514
01:46:22,329 --> 01:46:23,210
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't really say.

1515
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:24,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1516
01:46:27,913 --> 01:46:29,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Destination PlayStation, that's what it was.

1517
01:46:30,013 --> 01:46:31,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Destination PlayStation.

1518
01:46:32,994 --> 01:46:37,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, they're going to be doing an Adventure Time game for Nintendo DS.

1519
01:46:37,816 --> 01:46:48,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's being done by WayForward, who have... I guess they were behind some new... I'm trying to remember games they put out.

1520
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:52,400
[SPEAKER_10]: The Henry Hatsworth game, they had that come out.

1521
01:46:54,181 --> 01:47:13,998
[SPEAKER_10]: so that was not a bad game and I haven't really said too much about what the game is although the creator of the show actually posted some really funny like animated gifs so neat I'm sure the game will be pretty awesome which is pretty cool it's a great cartoon

1522
01:47:15,086 --> 01:47:22,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but not least, they announced that Max Payne 3 is going to have a new feature for the multiplayer.

1523
01:47:22,731 --> 01:47:24,652
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have what they're calling crews.

1524
01:47:25,293 --> 01:47:35,580
[SPEAKER_10]: And now what the Max Payne 3 crews are, are kind of like these multiplayer clans that you have that you can play through the game and kind of...

1525
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1526
01:47:56,676 --> 01:47:57,997
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:48:14,206 --> 01:48:26,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Last week or so, actually, this is kind of one thing that we didn't talk about, but on the hacking scene for Grand Theft Auto 4, they released online scripts for Grand Theft Auto 4 for multiplayer.

1528
01:48:26,829 --> 01:48:33,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to see a lot more hacking shenanigans on Grand Theft Auto 4 if you're playing that online, which is kind of sad.

1529
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:37,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I legitimately had a really high rank on that game.

1530
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:43,693
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, you know, now anyone can game it to get the top of the leaderboard.

1531
01:48:43,753 --> 01:48:46,454
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of over and done for now.

1532
01:48:47,434 --> 01:48:52,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But five, man, I am looking forward to playing five multiplayer for sure from day one.

1533
01:48:52,656 --> 01:48:56,317
[SPEAKER_10]: But Max Beam 3, not much interest in that game.

1534
01:48:56,337 --> 01:48:58,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's not Grand Theft Auto.

1535
01:49:00,353 --> 01:49:00,693
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1536
01:49:01,014 --> 01:49:07,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on to some other games, kind of in the same category as Grand Theft Auto, another Rockstar game.

1537
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: L.A.

1538
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:11,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire is getting a touch-controlled version.

1539
01:49:12,923 --> 01:49:20,248
[SPEAKER_02]: OnLive, of course, put out some various tablet apps, and Rockstar is doing a touch version of L.A.

1540
01:49:20,308 --> 01:49:26,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire, making this kind of more of a touchscreen-friendly game or an iOS or whatever phone it is game.

1541
01:49:27,453 --> 01:49:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: OnLive says those controls are now available so you can play L.A.

1542
01:49:30,795 --> 01:49:43,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire with OnLive Mobile and yeah you can swipe across the screen to do some motions I guess you don't need to use virtual buttons or a wireless controller or any of that you do need to buy L.A.

1543
01:49:43,641 --> 01:49:55,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire if you want to play it and have an OnLive account and all that but it is interesting that they actually kind of adapted it however there are free trials for all the games and the OnLive client is free so you can check it out for free

1544
01:49:55,754 --> 01:49:56,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's good to know.

1545
01:49:57,016 --> 01:49:58,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to see if this is up your alley.

1546
01:49:58,860 --> 01:49:59,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if L.A.

1547
01:49:59,541 --> 01:50:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire would work in touch motion for me, but okay.

1548
01:50:03,478 --> 01:50:04,419
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is it's L.A.

1549
01:50:04,439 --> 01:50:04,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire.

1550
01:50:05,019 --> 01:50:08,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The interrogation parts will be fine, but it's the rest of it.

1551
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:10,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I got bored with that game really fast.

1552
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:11,982
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

1553
01:50:12,222 --> 01:50:13,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII 2.

1554
01:50:14,463 --> 01:50:20,105
[SPEAKER_02]: What's funny is that I didn't finish XIII 2, and part of the reason I wasn't able to do it is because I got sucked into Mass Effect.

1555
01:50:20,565 --> 01:50:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, worlds can now collide on March 27th.

1556
01:50:23,986 --> 01:50:28,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They've announced that there will be Mass Effect 3 DLC for Final Fantasy XIII 2.

1557
01:50:28,268 --> 01:50:28,348
[SPEAKER_02]: What?! !

1558
01:50:30,569 --> 01:50:31,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's true.

1559
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:33,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as big as you think, though.

1560
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:43,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that now Sarah and Noel, who are of course the big two characters in the game, are going to get N7 armor that they can dress up in to make them look like Mass Effect characters.

1561
01:50:43,975 --> 01:50:48,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And although there's a part of me that goes, that's stupid, there's another part of me that goes, but that's really awesome.

1562
01:50:49,659 --> 01:50:53,701
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Mass Effect is not the only kind of game hopping that's going on.

1563
01:50:54,061 --> 01:50:56,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Assassin's Creed Revelations outfits are supposed to be on their way.

1564
01:50:57,202 --> 01:50:58,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, I believe, only in Japan right now.

1565
01:50:59,563 --> 01:50:59,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1566
01:50:59,844 --> 01:51:02,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a date has been announced for the US.

1567
01:51:02,365 --> 01:51:03,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll eventually happen, though.

1568
01:51:03,765 --> 01:51:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1569
01:51:05,186 --> 01:51:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is interesting?

1570
01:51:06,367 --> 01:51:08,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really interesting.

1571
01:51:09,488 --> 01:51:15,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII's who got some other DLCers getting some that throws the game back to Final Fantasy VI, right?

1572
01:51:16,431 --> 01:51:16,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Typhon Typhoon

1573
01:51:33,710 --> 01:52:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: but is the other I always see 1-0 so whatever but is the other character that will be available as well this is more of one of those arena fights and if you beat them in the arena then you can use them as your monsters because you know your third person can always be a monster so I thought it was kind of funny that they kind of went back to the past with that so that's pretty cool so there you go no announcement when that is out in the US March 27th in Japan however so probably soon thereafter

1574
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:04,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1575
01:52:25,629 --> 01:52:28,090
[SPEAKER_02]: They did post Capcom on their Street Fighter blog.

1576
01:52:28,530 --> 01:52:30,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily it sounds like something that's easily treatable.

1577
01:52:45,214 --> 01:52:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, it also sounds like he didn't suffer from exhaustion the same way that that one guy did that's all over TV.

1578
01:52:50,456 --> 01:52:52,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to make that joke.

1579
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:59,139
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's not something to really joke about in this guy's case, so too bad.

1580
01:52:59,859 --> 01:53:00,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope he feels better.

1581
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:02,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's sad.

1582
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,621
[SPEAKER_10]: However you might feel about the game aside, he's better.

1583
01:53:04,961 --> 01:53:08,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, both did suffer exhaustion while handling their fight sticks.

1584
01:53:09,383 --> 01:53:09,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it.

1585
01:53:09,723 --> 01:53:18,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for a game coming out in Japan called, well actually I think it's coming out here too, it's by Platinum Games, Anarchy Reigns.

1586
01:53:18,812 --> 01:53:22,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Famitsu put out images that Bayonetta is going to be in the game.

1587
01:53:24,137 --> 01:53:26,620
[SPEAKER_06]: No other news about it, just, hi Bayonetta.

1588
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:30,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic & Knuckles is gone, as well as the Master System version of Sonic 1.

1589
01:53:46,963 --> 01:54:02,184
[SPEAKER_06]: which is too bad because you know it's impossible to get Sonic 1 on any other platform well there's no I mean the master system I know what you mean but you know what I mean but yeah but there's no word about it in the US or Europe yet but I'm sure it's gonna follow

1590
01:54:02,865 --> 01:54:08,487
[SPEAKER_06]: and then fans of ThinkGeek who have, I'm sure, seen more and more and more Portal stuff pop up there.

1591
01:54:09,028 --> 01:54:15,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure have, including an inflatable sentry and a little talking sentry plushie that I totally want.

1592
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:18,931
[SPEAKER_06]: The Portal gun is for sale for $140.

1593
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:22,893
[SPEAKER_06]: 5,000 replicas have been made and somebody better buy me one for my birthday.

1594
01:54:23,033 --> 01:54:23,573
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

1595
01:54:25,934 --> 01:54:27,475
[SPEAKER_02]: No secret what you want, huh?

1596
01:54:28,295 --> 01:54:29,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1597
01:54:29,555 --> 01:54:30,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday's next month.

1598
01:54:31,236 --> 01:54:33,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the Fugle question of the week.

1599
01:54:33,656 --> 01:54:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: We missed it last week, but it's back tonight.

1600
01:54:35,116 --> 01:54:40,157
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fugle question of the week.

1601
01:54:40,237 --> 01:54:47,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook and Google Plus get a question every week, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program for you guys.

1602
01:54:47,519 --> 01:54:51,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those in studio want to answer, I don't know if they did the question in advance.

1603
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:52,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a toughie.

1604
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,160
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that takes a little bit of thought tonight.

1605
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:58,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start at Google+, but Orange Launch Radio.

1606
01:54:58,982 --> 01:54:59,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Question of the Week.

1607
01:54:59,903 --> 01:55:08,487
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go back and change a classic game's ending, since, you know, it's all the rage right now talking about changing the ending of games, what ending would you change and what would the new ending be?

1608
01:55:09,227 --> 01:55:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, let's stick to classics because we don't want to spoil any new games.

1609
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:14,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did force people to think classics.

1610
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:19,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting though, we got a lot of varied responses that kind of took the question in a different direction.

1611
01:55:20,054 --> 01:55:23,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And Derek H. starts us off on Google in that direction.

1612
01:55:38,926 --> 01:55:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine some kid complaining after the planet exploded in Stargate or when Pauline kept getting kidnapped by Donkey Kong or that the ambulance always passed you in Turbo.

1613
01:55:47,815 --> 01:55:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That would never happen because in those days gamers weren't spoiled little punks who need closure after having pretend sex with an alien.

1614
01:55:58,045 --> 01:56:03,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So some pretty strong words there about back in my day, back in the old day.

1615
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: that's true though, a lot of Atari 2600 games never ended, very few had an ending you know the ending, the only game I can think of, a couple of them that actually had endings oops, no, no holic during the foogle question, thank you um Pitfall and Pitfall 2 and at the end of Pitfall it just stops it freezes, I don't think there's anything to it and the ending of Pitfall 2 he jumps up and down, a lot and you won

1616
01:56:33,717 --> 01:56:37,078
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because games back then were trying to recreate the arcade experience.

1617
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:40,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Games today are about touching you emotionally.

1618
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:46,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, going to Facebook, reading some of the answers there.

1619
01:56:47,261 --> 01:56:48,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue2 says, That's a tough one.

1620
01:56:48,802 --> 01:56:50,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of any ending I would change.

1621
01:56:50,262 --> 01:56:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: However, like thousands of gamers out there, finish Half-Life already, Gabe.

1622
01:56:55,544 --> 01:56:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So he kind of ignored the question of the week and just said finish Half-Life.

1623
01:56:58,605 --> 01:57:01,606
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, Alan was telling me about how Half-Life...

1624
01:57:02,626 --> 01:57:13,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-Life 2 Episode 1 did kind of go back and patch a few things up from what was originally out there for Half-Life, so they've kind of tinkered with those endings before.

1625
01:57:16,644 --> 01:57:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Jim H answers on Facebook saying, Since I just beat it again yesterday, I would change the ending of Super Mario Bros.

1626
01:57:23,669 --> 01:57:26,812
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 so it isn't a dream at the end.

1627
01:57:27,772 --> 01:57:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was a different game they just plugged in Mario characters into, but since they did end up using enemies from the game in later sequels, it would be nice if it fit into the continuity better.

1628
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the original, it was all a dream ending.

1629
01:57:40,982 --> 01:57:41,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario 2, right?

1630
01:57:42,964 --> 01:57:43,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1631
01:57:43,204 --> 01:57:43,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1632
01:57:44,372 --> 01:57:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I said noholic.

1633
01:57:45,053 --> 01:57:45,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1634
01:57:59,432 --> 01:58:01,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd change the ending of the original Super Mario Bros.

1635
01:58:02,013 --> 01:58:20,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make it so that when Mario saves Peach from Bowser, she tells her that he, I think he tells her that he is enrolling her in some Taekwondo lessons with Chun-Li, so that when Bowser tries to kidnap her, at least she'd be able to put up a fight, and she wouldn't get kidnapped so damn frequently, and Nintendo wouldn't have to whore the Mario series out so much.

1636
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, she doesn't fight with Kung Fu, she fights with emotions.

1637
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,721
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Super Princess Peach, that's what we learned.

1638
01:58:28,292 --> 01:58:31,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, Robert C. on Facebook says, I'd change the ending to Mortal Kombat.

1639
01:58:32,193 --> 01:58:35,413
[SPEAKER_02]: The mandatory final fight would be between Katana and Sonya.

1640
01:58:35,853 --> 01:58:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd suddenly both swap fighting styles to Brazilian Jutsu in a big pool of mud or jelly.

1641
01:58:41,954 --> 01:58:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: The final scene would obviously be a slow motion montage of them moving from fighting to kissing.

1642
01:58:47,515 --> 01:58:48,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Cue the 70s porn music.

1643
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:51,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you.

1644
01:58:54,256 --> 01:58:55,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what you did there.

1645
01:58:56,497 --> 01:58:57,137
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be kind of hot.

1646
01:58:58,792 --> 01:59:01,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Any classic games you guys here in studio would want to change?

1647
01:59:02,114 --> 01:59:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you haven't had a lot of time to think about the answer.

1648
01:59:04,996 --> 01:59:08,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say let's go back to Ghosts and Goblins and give them proper grammar.

1649
01:59:09,319 --> 01:59:10,020
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

1650
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:12,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That was part of the fun.

1651
01:59:13,362 --> 01:59:14,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

1652
01:59:18,845 --> 01:59:20,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really think of anything because you know what?

1653
01:59:20,867 --> 01:59:24,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a little bitch with a sense of entitlement.

1654
01:59:28,038 --> 01:59:29,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having fun.

1655
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I will tell you which game needs another different ending.

1656
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: The Legend of Zelda.

1657
01:59:35,784 --> 01:59:36,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs a third quest.

1658
01:59:38,826 --> 01:59:43,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I would give a better ending to Zelda A Link to the Past after how fucking hard that game is.

1659
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:43,590
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1660
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:44,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of get a shitty ending.

1661
01:59:45,271 --> 01:59:46,552
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was epic.

1662
01:59:47,012 --> 01:59:47,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, don't get me wrong.

1663
01:59:48,033 --> 01:59:51,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking tremendous game, but kind of a crap ending.

1664
01:59:51,176 --> 01:59:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1665
01:59:53,177 --> 01:59:55,078
[SPEAKER_10]: They really... You know what would be awesome?

1666
01:59:55,098 --> 01:59:56,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally on a tangent here.

1667
01:59:56,858 --> 01:59:57,058
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1668
01:59:57,298 --> 02:00:02,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Is they should totally go with the LittleBigPlanet style to like the Legend of Zelda games.

1669
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:06,141
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how they have a ton of ROM hacks and stuff like that with custom levels for the Legend of Zelda?

1670
02:00:06,561 --> 02:00:11,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not have like a Legend of Zelda game that was like Link to the Past but with a ton of fucking custom games in there?

1671
02:00:11,822 --> 02:00:12,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know.

1672
02:00:12,322 --> 02:00:18,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Because no one would ever play your new Zelda games because they'd be too busy enthralled with the custom made stuff.

1673
02:00:19,024 --> 02:00:21,205
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the Legend of LittleBigPlanet?

1674
02:00:22,647 --> 02:00:28,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I want The Legend of Zelda with a really kick-ass editor that's officially sanctioned.

1675
02:00:28,651 --> 02:00:34,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of just the endings of different games, and really I keep thinking back to how epic many of them were.

1676
02:00:34,955 --> 02:00:39,078
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like Hitler's head blowing up at the end of Bionic Commando?

1677
02:00:40,579 --> 02:00:49,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how you felt bad for the baby Metroid when it got killed and...

1678
02:00:51,095 --> 02:00:52,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all kinds of sad-facedness.

1679
02:00:53,916 --> 02:00:57,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go back and make sure that every Silent Hill game had a dog ending.

1680
02:00:57,837 --> 02:00:58,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1681
02:00:59,598 --> 02:01:04,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I would change the ending to Shattered Memories because I wanted to like that game a whole lot.

1682
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:12,442
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I think that the next Silent Hill game should be directed by Peter Molyneux and you should play as the dog.

1683
02:01:14,864 --> 02:01:16,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the idea of a game called Silent Dog

1684
02:01:33,457 --> 02:01:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be a dream game.

1685
02:01:34,918 --> 02:01:35,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold up.

1686
02:01:35,839 --> 02:01:36,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, dream game.

1687
02:01:36,660 --> 02:01:37,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Dog.

1688
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:42,264
[SPEAKER_10]: The dog must confront the demons of its past.

1689
02:01:42,364 --> 02:01:44,986
[SPEAKER_10]: All the legs they've peed on.

1690
02:01:45,226 --> 02:01:46,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Chasing its tail.

1691
02:01:47,388 --> 02:01:51,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Being chased by a faceless postman with claw hands.

1692
02:01:52,272 --> 02:01:54,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Tires that they can just never catch.

1693
02:01:55,494 --> 02:01:58,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbees of doom with razor blades on them.

1694
02:01:58,137 --> 02:02:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And mandatory, Akira Yamaoka is forced to do all the music.

1695
02:02:04,616 --> 02:02:06,297
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just not a Silent Hill game.

1696
02:02:06,337 --> 02:02:08,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, it should just be the dog song throughout the whole game.

1697
02:02:12,259 --> 02:02:14,040
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need to play that, Rob.

1698
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have the dog ending music readily accessible.

1699
02:02:17,781 --> 02:02:18,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you do.

1700
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:19,402
[SPEAKER_10]: You have YouTube.

1701
02:02:19,542 --> 02:02:20,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do.

1702
02:02:21,762 --> 02:02:27,565
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would love to see like the saga of the UFO ending, Silent Hill the UFO.

1703
02:02:29,105 --> 02:02:29,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That would just be great.

1704
02:02:32,366 --> 02:02:32,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1705
02:02:32,666 --> 02:02:33,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding it for you guys.

1706
02:02:33,767 --> 02:02:34,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just...

1707
02:02:34,733 --> 02:02:35,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It was you the whole time?

1708
02:02:36,195 --> 02:02:39,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Praying there's no, uh... There it is.

1709
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:41,361
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome.

1710
02:03:03,655 --> 02:03:12,620
[SPEAKER_02]: but we can't forget about the most important part of Silent Dog which I think is at the very end of the song I like that he growls at that one horrible guy

1711
02:03:27,091 --> 02:03:27,791
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so great.

1712
02:03:27,831 --> 02:03:31,013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the canon ending to Silent Hill 2, right?

1713
02:03:31,053 --> 02:03:31,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1714
02:03:31,273 --> 02:03:32,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.

1715
02:03:32,633 --> 02:03:39,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Silent Hill 3 that had like the... Here's the most important scene of the entire game.

1716
02:03:39,195 --> 02:03:39,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1717
02:03:59,231 --> 02:04:01,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, does it do the chorus one more time?

1718
02:04:02,093 --> 02:04:02,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1719
02:04:02,394 --> 02:04:02,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1720
02:04:03,514 --> 02:04:08,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering, I wonder if the voice actor has been changed for the dog in the HD collection.

1721
02:04:08,718 --> 02:04:09,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here it is.

1722
02:04:09,499 --> 02:04:09,699
Ah.

1723
02:04:09,819 --> 02:04:09,959
Ah.

1724
02:04:19,375 --> 02:04:27,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, the all-important sex scene where the adults are having sex and the dog is just forced to watch with that blank expression on their face.

1725
02:04:27,798 --> 02:04:29,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are my owners doing?

1726
02:04:29,399 --> 02:04:34,360
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, actually, one of my LiveJournal icons is the dog and it says, Game Over.

1727
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:40,741
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love the dog ending, I still like the Silent Hill theme.

1728
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:44,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill, Silent Hill.

1729
02:04:44,222 --> 02:04:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: From one of the UFO endings.

1730
02:04:46,323 --> 02:04:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I don't know how we got on this topic, but Silent Dog, make it happen.

1731
02:04:50,925 --> 02:04:53,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were going to get into news at some point, right?

1732
02:04:53,886 --> 02:04:54,146
[SPEAKER_02]: News?

1733
02:04:54,206 --> 02:04:57,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we were talking about Silent Dog, so that is very important.

1734
02:04:58,908 --> 02:04:59,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, our dream game.

1735
02:05:02,570 --> 02:05:02,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1736
02:05:04,588 --> 02:05:12,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone needs to explain to me once again why we have these online passes, because I swear, it's just like, I never hear anything going smoothly with them.

1737
02:05:12,153 --> 02:05:14,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't understand, but whatever.

1738
02:05:15,036 --> 02:05:24,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Ninja Gaiden 3 came out this week, and yeah, apparently no one could redeem the online passes for that game.

1739
02:05:24,562 --> 02:05:32,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even the reviewers could redeem the online passes, because they had forgot to flip the switch to allow those passes to be redeemed.

1740
02:05:32,868 --> 02:05:50,352
[SPEAKER_10]: haha um so yes none of the codes worked at all at launch I think they work now they may be working soon but as of you know earlier this week they were not working at all so fun um

1741
02:05:56,116 --> 02:06:01,878
[SPEAKER_10]: MLB 12 The Show, another game with an online pass, also had its issues.

1742
02:06:01,938 --> 02:06:06,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions had a problem.

1743
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:13,703
[SPEAKER_10]: If the Vita players tried to redeem the online pass, they couldn't do it via the Vita.

1744
02:06:14,083 --> 02:06:16,544
[SPEAKER_10]: They could only do it if they had a PlayStation 3.

1745
02:06:17,325 --> 02:06:18,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the funny thing.

1746
02:06:18,165 --> 02:06:23,327
[SPEAKER_10]: If they did it via the PS3, it unlocked online play for the PS3 version that they don't own.

1747
02:06:27,696 --> 02:06:31,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, apparently they were working out problems with that.

1748
02:06:34,097 --> 02:06:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

1749
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:37,158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting, I guess.

1750
02:06:37,638 --> 02:06:40,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And then last but not least, there is one more game that had an online pass.

1751
02:06:41,799 --> 02:06:44,380
[SPEAKER_10]: EA Sports MMA.

1752
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,641
[SPEAKER_10]: It had an online pass and it had online play.

1753
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:50,101
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't a very popular game.

1754
02:06:50,861 --> 02:06:53,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And on April 13th, they will be shutting down the server for it.

1755
02:06:57,556 --> 02:06:59,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the failure board, sorry.

1756
02:07:00,738 --> 02:07:01,658
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed appropriate.

1757
02:07:01,818 --> 02:07:04,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Other games that are going to be getting their servers shut down as well.

1758
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:10,523
[SPEAKER_10]: EA Create Game, which was supposed to take on LittleBigPlanet, and that sucked.

1759
02:07:11,263 --> 02:07:14,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And EA Sports Active 2, which I didn't even know they had online.

1760
02:07:15,566 --> 02:07:22,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Xbox Live Arcade game Spare Parts is also going to be getting its servers shut down.

1761
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:27,132
[SPEAKER_10]: On top of that, Boom Blox for the Wii, Burnout Revenge for Xbox 360.

1762
02:07:28,352 --> 02:07:29,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it, I own Boom Blox.

1763
02:07:29,853 --> 02:07:38,437
[SPEAKER_10]: EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp for the Wii, FIFA 10 for the PSP and the Wii, Godfather 2 for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1764
02:07:39,837 --> 02:07:51,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Need for Speed Pro Street on PS3 and 360, and the Saboteur for PS3 and 360 is going to lose access to the Midnight Club, which is some exclusive club, but that was in the game if you pre-ordered.

1765
02:07:53,023 --> 02:08:00,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the 31st, they're shutting down Battlefield 3 Aftershock for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch.

1766
02:08:03,412 --> 02:08:05,215
[SPEAKER_10]: and a few other iPad games.

1767
02:08:05,335 --> 02:08:11,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, that $10 that funds that online pass, it costs a lot to shut a server down.

1768
02:08:13,584 --> 02:08:14,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto

1769
02:08:37,145 --> 02:08:39,847
[SPEAKER_10]: They just re-released for free.

1770
02:08:39,867 --> 02:08:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: APB?

1771
02:08:40,508 --> 02:08:41,328
[SPEAKER_10]: APB, yeah.

1772
02:08:41,368 --> 02:08:42,349
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it wasn't that quick.

1773
02:08:46,372 --> 02:08:51,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Dartetsuya in our chatroom says, I called that section the online pass blooper reel.

1774
02:08:51,656 --> 02:08:54,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, when I was reading all this news, all I could hear in my head was...

1775
02:09:03,445 --> 02:09:08,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those poor bastards that are buying some of those games used, and now they're just going to be offline.

1776
02:09:08,826 --> 02:09:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shutting down the servers is nothing new, but now we have a game that people paid $10 to play online, and it's not forever.

1777
02:09:17,468 --> 02:09:21,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand that these games may not have been popular or whatever, but...

1778
02:09:22,689 --> 02:09:32,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, that's nice that it might not have been popular, but you... I don't know, I mean, I guess eventually it has to happen.

1779
02:09:33,277 --> 02:09:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out a way to consolidate then.

1780
02:09:35,219 --> 02:09:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize I'm talking out my ass here, but shouldn't there be a way where maybe you could consolidate some of the servers and just have a computer that runs for whatever occasional game?

1781
02:09:47,248 --> 02:09:48,209
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like combined...

1782
02:09:48,749 --> 02:09:56,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine that, like, you know, EA, Sports MMA, and the reason they shut them down is because not many people are playing them right now, but there's still a few people playing them.

1783
02:09:57,033 --> 02:09:59,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Just drop the amount of servers that you have.

1784
02:10:00,614 --> 02:10:01,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop it to one.

1785
02:10:01,935 --> 02:10:03,796
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only have one person play online at a time.

1786
02:10:03,916 --> 02:10:07,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, still, that's better than none at all, and especially for people that paid.

1787
02:10:08,458 --> 02:10:09,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Just unfortunate.

1788
02:10:11,078 --> 02:10:17,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well anyhow, here's something else that's unfortunate and kind of along the same topic of something we were just talking about.

1789
02:10:17,461 --> 02:10:24,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the Silent Hill HD collection just recently came out and apparently it's getting very, very mixed polarized reviews.

1790
02:10:24,905 --> 02:10:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it myself yet, so I can't say one way or the other, but you've got some people that are like, yay, it's Silent Hill, it's in HD, it looks great.

1791
02:10:32,269 --> 02:10:38,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are like, the game is fucking missing fog, the frame rate is hideous, the voice acting is terrible.

1792
02:10:39,413 --> 02:10:54,421
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's gotten to the point, I don't know if you want to call this entitlement or what, Amazon.com is no longer stocking the game that just came out two weeks ago because there are too many user reports that there is a problem with the item.

1793
02:10:55,122 --> 02:10:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So Amazon.com is doing an investigation to see if it's problematic.

1794
02:10:57,723 --> 02:10:59,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't even come out two weeks ago, it came out last week.

1795
02:10:59,744 --> 02:11:00,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

1796
02:11:02,119 --> 02:11:28,390
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know what though I have to agree with them as far as the fog thing goes because even the art director or whatever said hey we use a lot of transparent textures for fog and you can even see it there's a lot of objects that don't quite go all the way they're not complete objects because the fog would normally be obscuring them and so without the fog it looks like oh hey look I've got these telephone wires that just disappear what the hell that doesn't make any sense

1797
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:47,246
[SPEAKER_02]: but what's interesting I tried to go to like I wanted to see what the user feedback was so I went to Amazon.com to read some of the reviews and it's still kind of divided and like I don't know if that's like fanboys versus you know or what it is but it's very divided because for like let me go to Metacritic real fast and do Silent Hill

1798
02:11:47,606 --> 02:11:52,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it should be noted, the PS3 one is getting more flack than the Xbox 360 one seems to be.

1799
02:11:53,408 --> 02:11:55,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of put that out there.

1800
02:11:55,409 --> 02:11:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the user score, 5.1.

1801
02:11:57,870 --> 02:12:00,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Six positive reviews, five negative reviews.

1802
02:12:01,131 --> 02:12:04,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have some people that are giving it 10s going, I don't understand why people are hating on this.

1803
02:12:05,673 --> 02:12:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami says relive the two best horror games of all time, strong graphics.

1804
02:12:10,795 --> 02:12:16,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get some people that are bombing it, putting the game has far too many bugs to recommend to first timers or veterans alike.

1805
02:12:18,541 --> 02:12:18,681
[SPEAKER_02]: 0-0-10-10-0-10-9-0

1806
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:30,701
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's funny.

1807
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:32,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's in the middle.

1808
02:12:32,742 --> 02:12:35,084
[SPEAKER_02]: They're either all the way here or all the way there.

1809
02:12:37,226 --> 02:12:50,658
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a perfect example right there of what's wrong with review scores and what's wrong with review scores by just average people sometimes because those people are obviously fanboys because a game, trust me, that game doesn't warrant a 10 and it doesn't warrant a 0 either.

1810
02:12:50,718 --> 02:12:53,100
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just ridiculous.

1811
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1812
02:12:54,281 --> 02:12:54,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Critics 90, 80, 70

1813
02:13:11,850 --> 02:13:14,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's been more average for sure.

1814
02:13:15,211 --> 02:13:16,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what I've been reading out on the internet too.

1815
02:13:17,472 --> 02:13:28,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like if you've never played Silent Hill and the old games are too hard to get now, then go ahead and play this, but otherwise get your PS2 and go hook up the old games because they were better.

1816
02:13:29,335 --> 02:13:29,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1817
02:13:30,652 --> 02:13:32,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Ramma in chat says, how the hell did they fuck this game up?

1818
02:13:32,933 --> 02:13:33,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never know.

1819
02:13:34,094 --> 02:13:35,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not putting Fog in there.

1820
02:13:36,635 --> 02:13:40,697
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, was that only on the PS3 version or something like that?

1821
02:13:40,997 --> 02:13:43,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they were saying, oh, well, we had trouble rendering the Fog.

1822
02:13:43,738 --> 02:13:46,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, why would you have trouble rendering the Fog on the PlayStation 3?

1823
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my other concern.

1824
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they feel the need then to put this game out now?

1825
02:13:51,462 --> 02:13:54,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we have a shortage of Silent Hill in the world right now.

1826
02:13:55,244 --> 02:13:56,444
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had Downpour.

1827
02:13:56,825 --> 02:13:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have the Vita game coming out.

1828
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:03,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does this need to be out right now?

1829
02:14:03,428 --> 02:14:04,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Go back and make it right.

1830
02:14:04,789 --> 02:14:07,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say for whatever reason, okay, we can't do the fog.

1831
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:20,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Did anybody that was QAing that game realize, hey, it looks a little fucking weird that something that's supposed to not be there or something that's supposed to be obscured by fog is just stopping in the middle of the air.

1832
02:14:20,778 --> 02:14:21,979
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't make any sense.

1833
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:29,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we should, I don't know, recreate the object or something like that instead of porting all the assets over and going, eh, whatever, close enough.

1834
02:14:29,423 --> 02:14:30,443
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1835
02:14:30,503 --> 02:14:31,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, come on.

1836
02:14:32,104 --> 02:14:37,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like spend the two seconds it would take to recreate the object or I don't know, go back and fix it.

1837
02:14:37,465 --> 02:14:39,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Was the Metal Gear collection this bad?

1838
02:14:39,746 --> 02:14:41,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fuzzy looking.

1839
02:14:41,247 --> 02:14:43,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't like the look of it, but I don't think it was this bad.

1840
02:14:45,068 --> 02:14:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly haven't seen because Dan keeps playing the MSX versions.

1841
02:14:48,969 --> 02:14:50,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it really have the MSX games in there?

1842
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:50,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1843
02:14:50,810 --> 02:14:51,190
[SPEAKER_06]: In English?

1844
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:51,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1845
02:14:53,548 --> 02:14:59,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Metal Gear Solid Collection got good reviews.

1846
02:14:59,273 --> 02:15:02,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.

1847
02:15:03,777 --> 02:15:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is fog on the PS3 difficult?

1848
02:15:06,219 --> 02:15:10,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Fog in the same way they did it on the PS2 is probably difficult, but okay.

1849
02:15:11,464 --> 02:15:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, take the time to redo it if you're going to do this.

1850
02:15:15,087 --> 02:15:16,249
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly my problem.

1851
02:15:16,429 --> 02:15:18,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like those fucking people at Capcom...

1852
02:15:19,071 --> 02:15:26,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They're complaining, well, we didn't know how to do local team play in Street Fighter Crosstek and we didn't want to bother to learn that.

1853
02:15:27,334 --> 02:15:31,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo fucking hoo that you couldn't spend the time to figure out a program in your game.

1854
02:15:32,716 --> 02:15:35,156
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can't do any goddamn programming, then quit.

1855
02:15:35,316 --> 02:15:39,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Because seriously, you're of no use to us if you can't make a game.

1856
02:15:40,499 --> 02:15:43,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we had to make new assets for this game.

1857
02:15:43,461 --> 02:15:47,604
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean I couldn't just straight port the shit over and up-res the textures?

1858
02:15:48,165 --> 02:15:49,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you may have to do a little bit of work.

1859
02:15:50,787 --> 02:15:53,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Porkchop in our chatroom says, Maybe we'll have a DLC bundle.

1860
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:55,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it the Fog and Dog Pack.

1861
02:15:56,632 --> 02:15:56,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1862
02:15:57,433 --> 02:16:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Acidic Vampire says, Maybe someone should file an issue with the Better Business Bureau and get the fog eventually implemented.

1863
02:16:03,698 --> 02:16:05,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give people ideas.

1864
02:16:08,839 --> 02:16:09,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to say this though.

1865
02:16:10,461 --> 02:16:12,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the reviews were half and half.

1866
02:16:12,883 --> 02:16:14,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So not everybody's hating on it.

1867
02:16:15,826 --> 02:16:18,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And Konami, they've had issues with the Silent Hill series.

1868
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:20,671
[SPEAKER_10]: They really have.

1869
02:16:21,112 --> 02:16:26,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Well, Akira Yamaoka going somewhere else didn't help.

1870
02:16:26,727 --> 02:16:27,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's true.

1871
02:16:27,988 --> 02:16:34,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and it's not our show role, but, you know, and as I mentioned weeks ago, the Vita version has been delayed.

1872
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:34,931
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1873
02:16:35,011 --> 02:16:35,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, right?

1874
02:16:35,951 --> 02:16:37,132
[SPEAKER_10]: To May or something?

1875
02:16:37,232 --> 02:16:40,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the rumor is May right now, but I don't think there's actually a date yet for it.

1876
02:16:40,993 --> 02:16:41,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1877
02:16:42,514 --> 02:16:44,415
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, the Vita version's been delayed.

1878
02:16:45,055 --> 02:16:46,255
[SPEAKER_10]: They have one more chance.

1879
02:16:46,375 --> 02:16:48,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami has one more chance at this HD collection thing.

1880
02:16:48,556 --> 02:16:52,038
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got the Zone of Enders collection coming out in the fall.

1881
02:16:52,338 --> 02:16:53,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So, cross fingers?

1882
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:54,479
Yeah.

1883
02:16:54,759 --> 02:16:55,700
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1884
02:17:21,357 --> 02:17:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You had fog obscuring it before It does also make me worry, like, if they can't render fucking fog, like, granted it's another company we're talking about here, but is that Final Fantasy X HD remake gonna blow?

1885
02:17:32,727 --> 02:17:38,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not that they couldn't render fog, they couldn't render enough fog, like, certain textures they couldn't render Needs more fog!

1886
02:17:39,693 --> 02:17:42,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, it's like, how did you fuck this up?

1887
02:17:44,417 --> 02:17:47,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Transparent textures, the PS3 just can't do that

1888
02:17:49,662 --> 02:18:16,901
[SPEAKER_02]: or Konami doesn't know how to do that alright let's move into the mailbag speaking of strong opinions and so forth every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange launch radio dot com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and picks oh she got a little sticky tonight picks a few of her favorite mails to read to us here in studio all two of them mailbag at orange launch radio dot com email us

1889
02:18:17,982 --> 02:18:18,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Greetings, OLR.

1890
02:18:18,843 --> 02:18:20,064
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1891
02:18:20,465 --> 02:18:28,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year when I bought my beast video card for my PC, it came with Civ V. Rob, I'm sorry, but as much as I tried, I was always so bored by it.

1892
02:18:28,714 --> 02:18:29,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out.

1893
02:18:29,935 --> 02:18:31,697
[SPEAKER_06]: But last week, I found the answer.

1894
02:18:31,838 --> 02:18:32,338
[SPEAKER_06]: QuickPace.

1895
02:18:32,919 --> 02:18:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever since I found that little option, I can't stop playing the game.

1896
02:18:35,842 --> 02:18:36,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you can stay.

1897
02:18:36,642 --> 02:18:41,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to be a huge German board game player and this is a very involved board game to me.

1898
02:18:42,205 --> 02:18:44,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was because you always talk about how great the game is.

1899
02:18:45,207 --> 02:18:46,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for that.

1900
02:18:46,327 --> 02:18:47,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I have a request for OLR.

1901
02:18:47,968 --> 02:18:55,512
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife of seven years just had her birthday and I was hoping that at the end of reading this email you could wish a very happy birthday to French Fry.

1902
02:18:56,032 --> 02:18:57,913
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, you are an integral part of my week.

1903
02:18:57,953 --> 02:18:59,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Siri Turtle.

1904
02:19:00,215 --> 02:19:02,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, French Fry.

1905
02:19:03,056 --> 02:19:04,757
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I'm more of a fan of onion rings?

1906
02:19:06,292 --> 02:19:07,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we give a shout out to Onion Ring?

1907
02:19:07,453 --> 02:19:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a hoe.

1908
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:08,773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1909
02:19:09,073 --> 02:19:10,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, French fry.

1910
02:19:11,575 --> 02:19:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, French fries.

1911
02:19:12,975 --> 02:19:15,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sea salted French fries a lot at Wendy's, just saying.

1912
02:19:16,797 --> 02:19:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email.

1913
02:19:18,138 --> 02:19:19,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any relation to French toast?

1914
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:27,163
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me staring at Rob with a, you didn't just say that face.

1915
02:19:27,223 --> 02:19:28,883
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me recycling the happy music.

1916
02:19:31,345 --> 02:19:31,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearts.

1917
02:19:32,005 --> 02:19:33,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making hearts at Rob now.

1918
02:19:33,326 --> 02:19:33,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1919
02:19:34,346 --> 02:19:35,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, not eating makes you a bitch.

1920
02:19:36,502 --> 02:19:37,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't?

1921
02:19:38,144 --> 02:19:39,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I have lots of energy.

1922
02:19:39,425 --> 02:19:41,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been drinking so much.

1923
02:19:42,548 --> 02:19:43,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just fucking with you.

1924
02:19:43,849 --> 02:19:46,471
[SPEAKER_06]: All the times, by the way, that I've been quiet, I've been in the bathroom.

1925
02:19:48,694 --> 02:19:50,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing nothing but drinking broth.

1926
02:19:50,535 --> 02:19:50,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1927
02:19:51,276 --> 02:19:51,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert H.M.

1928
02:19:52,037 --> 02:19:52,197
[SPEAKER_06]: here.

1929
02:19:52,217 --> 02:19:53,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm peeing nothing but broth.

1930
02:19:54,939 --> 02:19:56,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I said drinking nothing but broth.

1931
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:57,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1932
02:19:58,211 --> 02:19:58,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email, yes.

1933
02:19:59,791 --> 02:20:02,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I never heard your thoughts on the Muppets DLC pack for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1934
02:20:03,614 --> 02:20:06,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, I enjoyed it but haven't gotten to sit down to get everything yet.

1935
02:20:07,376 --> 02:20:08,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Relatedly, is that a word, relatedly?

1936
02:20:09,677 --> 02:20:09,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1937
02:20:10,357 --> 02:20:15,921
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about the level pack DLC for the game and possibly others staying hosted on the server?

1938
02:20:16,901 --> 02:20:21,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Such is that the levels out at the time were inaccessible during the PSN outage.

1939
02:20:21,764 --> 02:20:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the only positive is that one doesn't have to wait for hundreds of megabytes at PSN speeds to download.

1940
02:20:28,348 --> 02:20:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It does update the game itself, though.

1941
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:35,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is the content now being loaded in and I have no idea what I'm writing about?

1942
02:20:36,093 --> 02:20:41,657
[SPEAKER_06]: The LittleBigPlanet stuff is generally fun but frustrating content, especially trying to get all the prize items.

1943
02:20:43,308 --> 02:20:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had no idea.

1944
02:20:44,749 --> 02:20:45,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, confession time.

1945
02:20:46,689 --> 02:20:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved LittleBigPlanet 1.

1946
02:20:48,970 --> 02:20:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't bought LittleBigPlanet 2.

1947
02:20:51,691 --> 02:20:56,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting for it to go on sale, and every time I check, it's still like 50, 60 bucks.

1948
02:20:57,354 --> 02:21:03,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it's the Game of the Year edition that comes with all the extra stuff, but I'm kind of waiting for it to get a little cheaper before I buy it.

1949
02:21:03,156 --> 02:21:04,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I just totally missed it.

1950
02:21:04,837 --> 02:21:07,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out at a time when a ton of other games came out.

1951
02:21:08,038 --> 02:21:09,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never got around to getting it.

1952
02:21:10,099 --> 02:21:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to get it so I can check out this Muppets DLC and all that.

1953
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to sit here and make up an opinion on something I haven't played.

1954
02:21:18,241 --> 02:21:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm still interested in checking it out.

1955
02:21:20,162 --> 02:21:21,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it that way.

1956
02:21:23,163 --> 02:21:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the server and stuff, I had no idea that was going on.

1957
02:21:26,704 --> 02:21:27,724
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird, though.

1958
02:21:28,984 --> 02:21:31,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you not...

1959
02:21:33,311 --> 02:21:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it because you either have to download it to your drive or you have to download it to play it server-side even.

1960
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:42,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's doing an on-live thing where it's streaming.

1961
02:21:42,378 --> 02:21:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like... I don't think it could handle it.

1962
02:21:44,299 --> 02:21:44,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

1963
02:21:47,021 --> 02:21:58,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds very like Final Fight, Magic Sword, locks you out when PSN is down type of thing to maybe prevent hacking and cracking like what we're seeing happen with Street Fighter X Tekken.

1964
02:21:58,230 --> 02:21:58,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's...

1965
02:21:59,961 --> 02:22:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got something about that too coming up.

1966
02:22:01,662 --> 02:22:05,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony needs to stop assuming that PSN is always going to be up because it's not.

1967
02:22:08,324 --> 02:22:08,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1968
02:22:10,684 --> 02:22:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strange.

1969
02:22:11,725 --> 02:22:14,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, that's the last email.

1970
02:22:15,766 --> 02:22:17,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

1971
02:22:17,666 --> 02:22:20,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com to send us emails in the future.

1972
02:22:21,648 --> 02:22:22,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, Loki.

1973
02:22:23,988 --> 02:22:24,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1974
02:22:24,949 --> 02:22:28,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk a little bit about hacking.

1975
02:22:28,650 --> 02:22:29,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily...

1976
02:22:30,097 --> 02:22:39,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Hacking of... Things that some people might find controversial, but fan-translated stuff, for example.

1977
02:22:40,401 --> 02:22:49,785
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, there's two games that recently have been hacked to translate them into English because no English versions were made available.

1978
02:22:51,085 --> 02:22:52,366
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those being...

1979
02:22:53,586 --> 02:23:19,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Tales of Vesperia on the PS3 Tales of Vesperia of course came out on Xbox 360 in the US but never on the PS3 the PS3 version which I believe was superior to the Xbox 360 version had a lot more content to that was available in Japan so what people are doing of course is hacking the game to actually use the Xbox 360 translation

1980
02:23:21,111 --> 02:23:25,634
[SPEAKER_10]: to translate the text in the PS3 version, and of course doing their own translation for the new content.

1981
02:23:25,854 --> 02:23:34,038
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's funny, nothing said that actually the Xbox 360 translated version text was actually hidden in the PS3 code, because you know, you don't clean up your code.

1982
02:23:35,659 --> 02:23:37,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're working on translating that.

1983
02:23:38,161 --> 02:23:45,605
[SPEAKER_10]: They were originally doing the Tales of Graces, but since that actually did get localized over here, they stopped working on that when that announcement was made.

1984
02:23:47,786 --> 02:24:05,560
[SPEAKER_10]: and I guess of course they're saying that this will have a patch to the game and of course it will require you to have a jailbroken PS3 with a firmware of 3.55 or lower and they're going to release documentation on how to patch your game if you wish to do so.

1985
02:24:06,721 --> 02:24:21,379
[SPEAKER_10]: and then on top of that there of course is another fan translated thing that actually finished and that is Fatal Frame 4 Mask of the Lunar Eclipse has been translated into English for the Nintendo Wii and

1986
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,601
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a big ol' effort with that.

1987
02:24:24,721 --> 02:24:41,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, you have to patch a version of the game that you have dumped to an ISO, or you can always download a pre-patched version and run it from your hard drive because they made it so freaking easy to do that.

1988
02:24:41,909 --> 02:24:42,329
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um...

1989
02:24:44,279 --> 02:24:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't usually endorse the piracy of games, but if they're not going to release it here, they're not going to give you the opportunity.

1990
02:24:51,569 --> 02:24:52,590
[SPEAKER_10]: What other choice do you have?

1991
02:24:52,850 --> 02:24:53,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1992
02:24:53,531 --> 02:25:02,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, if you had it before, then, you know, you might as well translate in English so you can actually understand it.

1993
02:25:03,844 --> 02:25:15,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it should be noted that they're also they have fully translated into Spanish and German and French translations are about halfway done as well.

1994
02:25:17,632 --> 02:25:19,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty interesting.

1995
02:25:21,423 --> 02:25:25,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Microsoft has put out an interesting patent.

1996
02:25:25,885 --> 02:25:29,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we sometimes get what's coming in the gaming industry from what's going on with patents.

1997
02:25:30,406 --> 02:25:33,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And Microsoft has patented this weird helmet device.

1998
02:25:34,308 --> 02:25:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a laser scanning virtual image display and it will display an image very close to your eyes.

1999
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:46,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, by doing this, the two displays could be in a helmet and you'd be able to see stereoscopic 3D.

2000
02:25:46,092 --> 02:25:48,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a similar trick to what the 3DS uses.

2001
02:25:48,533 --> 02:25:49,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2002
02:26:13,112 --> 02:26:29,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I remember, okay, I remember, like, 20 years ago, renting from the local store, don't ask why we did this, but we rented a headset VR display, and all it was, you put this headset on, it fucking looked like something on Lawnmower Man, it was just a TV right in front of your eyes.

2003
02:26:31,107 --> 02:26:34,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the amazing VR display you could play Super Nintendo games on.

2004
02:26:34,048 --> 02:26:38,390
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a VR type thing over at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz.

2005
02:26:38,811 --> 02:26:42,952
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could play versions of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake.

2006
02:26:44,433 --> 02:26:46,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually played Quake on that.

2007
02:26:46,814 --> 02:26:47,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was terrible.

2008
02:26:49,495 --> 02:26:53,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like I had my eyes straight up to my PC screen.

2009
02:26:53,257 --> 02:26:53,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was it.

2010
02:26:55,078 --> 02:26:58,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, yeah, it's so immersive with the 640x480 graphics.

2011
02:26:59,949 --> 02:27:03,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And SGA100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com brings up the virtual boy.

2012
02:27:03,675 --> 02:27:05,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of a similar gag too.

2013
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:10,687
[SPEAKER_02]: This image may be partially transparent so you can see the world around you.

2014
02:27:12,145 --> 02:27:13,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way you can play your game, man.

2015
02:27:13,706 --> 02:27:15,047
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.

2016
02:27:15,067 --> 02:27:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game from Star Trek.

2017
02:27:15,768 --> 02:27:17,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see the people laughing at you.

2018
02:27:17,069 --> 02:27:20,232
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, from Next Generation where they had the little thing that shot lasers in their eyes.

2019
02:27:20,492 --> 02:27:23,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see the people laughing at you for wearing a giant helmet.

2020
02:27:24,095 --> 02:27:30,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Chiggers, at the exact same time you said that, Chiggers in chat said, it's like that Star Trek Next Generation episode and everybody will be zombies.

2021
02:27:30,961 --> 02:27:33,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are both really big nerds.

2022
02:27:34,023 --> 02:27:34,304
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

2023
02:27:38,348 --> 02:27:39,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there you go.

2024
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:44,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you even say, oh, this is the next Xbox, no.

2025
02:27:45,113 --> 02:27:45,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down.

2026
02:27:45,614 --> 02:27:45,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

2027
02:27:46,274 --> 02:27:48,576
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we've been down that territory.

2028
02:27:48,636 --> 02:27:50,057
[SPEAKER_10]: OMG, Microsoft Portable.

2029
02:27:50,357 --> 02:27:50,537
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2030
02:27:51,058 --> 02:27:51,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Sit down.

2031
02:27:51,598 --> 02:27:57,243
[SPEAKER_10]: God, you know, that Wii prototype, the one that was fake, would have been pretty fucking awesome.

2032
02:27:57,803 --> 02:27:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

2033
02:27:59,597 --> 02:28:03,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as mentioned earlier, Capcom is cracking down.

2034
02:28:04,379 --> 02:28:20,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, a statement, and I actually did read this on the Capcom Unity forums, but they're talking about people using the downloadable characters on discs using hacked Xboxes.

2035
02:28:22,729 --> 02:28:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: and one of the big guys at Cat Community said quite ballsy for folks to be taking hacked Xbox 360s on live where they are detectable.

2036
02:28:32,793 --> 02:28:38,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're also saying in any event we have open channels of communication with Microsoft on these issues Friday night.

2037
02:28:38,555 --> 02:28:45,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they started asking people to take screenshots and record videos of the offenders but they closed the video and said oh we'll catch them ourselves.

2038
02:28:46,772 --> 02:28:51,495
[SPEAKER_10]: They do realize that you can't take screenshots of a fucking Xbox 360, right?

2039
02:28:51,736 --> 02:28:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can.

2040
02:28:52,616 --> 02:28:53,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can if you're a developer.

2041
02:28:54,818 --> 02:28:57,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and what if you have one of those capture cards?

2042
02:28:58,180 --> 02:29:04,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, that's a capture card, but I'm talking about like, you can't just, it's not like that Vita where I can push two buttons and take a screenshot.

2043
02:29:06,827 --> 02:29:10,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wouldn't... And there's iPhones and cameras.

2044
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:13,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And we wouldn't have this problem if they didn't put the DLC on the fucking disc.

2045
02:29:13,792 --> 02:29:14,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

2046
02:29:14,913 --> 02:29:15,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

2047
02:29:17,823 --> 02:29:21,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And this smells a lot like CD Projekt Red a few months ago.

2048
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna catch those hackers!

2049
02:29:23,593 --> 02:29:24,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're gonna let the hackers go.

2050
02:29:26,738 --> 02:29:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna be Batman.

2051
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:28,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Batman.

2052
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:35,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I do agree with the point that you gotta be pretty bold to play this shit online.

2053
02:29:35,204 --> 02:29:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's kind of that gamer mentality you see sometimes in some gamers where it's like, I gotta be the first, and I gotta, I'm gonna show these guys online that my penis is the biggest, and I'm using characters you're not supposed to have.

2054
02:29:47,694 --> 02:29:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Rah!

2055
02:29:48,655 --> 02:29:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a little bit silly.

2056
02:29:51,809 --> 02:29:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at my pain.

2057
02:29:53,012 --> 02:29:53,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back in.

2058
02:29:54,034 --> 02:29:54,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2059
02:29:54,495 --> 02:29:58,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of a dumb thing to take it online where, you know, they're watching.

2060
02:29:59,865 --> 02:30:00,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what Sugar says.

2061
02:30:00,787 --> 02:30:01,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I will hit you with a coelacanth.

2062
02:30:10,066 --> 02:30:31,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Zynga has purchased the company OMG Pop, the makers of the game Draw Something, and of course they purchased them for quite a bit of money, including approximately $200 million between a cash deal and $30 million or so for employee retention and payments.

2063
02:30:33,314 --> 02:30:37,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, you know, they're going to be working with them to create some new games, I guess.

2064
02:30:38,756 --> 02:30:41,157
[SPEAKER_02]: In related news, I deleted Draw Something this week.

2065
02:30:41,417 --> 02:30:43,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing it pretty hardcore for a little bit.

2066
02:30:43,978 --> 02:30:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like 15 games going at once.

2067
02:30:45,819 --> 02:30:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.

2068
02:30:47,019 --> 02:30:48,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, nope, I'm done.

2069
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:53,241
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, there's another iPhone app you might want to check out if you are in the same boat I am.

2070
02:30:53,301 --> 02:30:54,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Sheradium.

2071
02:30:55,482 --> 02:30:58,063
[SPEAKER_02]: CharaDium

2072
02:31:20,451 --> 02:31:25,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's more paint styles and it's more of a robust paint program than Draw Something was.

2073
02:31:26,093 --> 02:31:27,853
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to pay for extra colors and shit.

2074
02:31:27,893 --> 02:31:30,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pay for extra colors?

2075
02:31:30,554 --> 02:31:33,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and Draw Something, if you wanted more than just red, what was it?

2076
02:31:33,795 --> 02:31:36,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Red, blue, yellow, and black were the only colors you could use.

2077
02:31:36,276 --> 02:31:44,479
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted green and purple, you either saved up enough tokens from winning games or you had to pay 99 cents to get them.

2078
02:31:44,519 --> 02:31:45,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.

2079
02:31:45,519 --> 02:31:45,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

2080
02:31:46,939 --> 02:31:48,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew people that had tons of colors.

2081
02:31:51,243 --> 02:31:51,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's sad.

2082
02:31:52,004 --> 02:31:52,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2083
02:31:52,444 --> 02:31:53,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Your money, spend, buy what you want.

2084
02:31:53,585 --> 02:31:54,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, though?

2085
02:31:54,305 --> 02:32:02,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, but until the Zynga news, I bought, I spent 99 cents buying the legit, you know, ad-free draws because I'm like, this is a great new game.

2086
02:32:02,411 --> 02:32:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to support this.

2087
02:32:03,512 --> 02:32:04,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this happened.

2088
02:32:04,673 --> 02:32:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, ugh.

2089
02:32:05,493 --> 02:32:14,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I, honestly, I can't fault some of the employees at Zynga because, you know, they're just working, but it's, you know, obviously the higher ups that... Well, it's the...

2090
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:16,401
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop

2091
02:32:34,528 --> 02:32:34,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

2092
02:33:01,892 --> 02:33:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

2093
02:33:02,412 --> 02:33:03,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I want some class action.

2094
02:33:03,593 --> 02:33:04,333
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I get in on that?

2095
02:33:04,353 --> 02:33:05,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Work for GameStop.

2096
02:33:06,554 --> 02:33:08,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they might try to go the other way around and sue me.

2097
02:33:09,695 --> 02:33:09,995
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2098
02:33:11,536 --> 02:33:18,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2099
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:19,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But not just yet.

2100
02:33:20,479 --> 02:33:25,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one more story for you guys tonight, and it's another fucking Kickstarter.

2101
02:33:26,962 --> 02:33:27,662
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a trend.

2102
02:33:27,802 --> 02:33:28,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not liking this trend.

2103
02:33:28,982 --> 02:33:29,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say I...

2104
02:33:31,083 --> 02:33:32,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much.

2105
02:33:33,225 --> 02:33:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in the world wants a piece of this Kickstarter thing.

2106
02:33:35,787 --> 02:33:37,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I'm sorry.

2107
02:33:37,569 --> 02:33:40,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that got in on it early, like the Double Fine and stuff, good for them.

2108
02:33:40,932 --> 02:33:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's just getting old.

2109
02:33:42,553 --> 02:33:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there may be some folks that are really into this.

2110
02:33:45,536 --> 02:33:46,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So good for you guys.

2111
02:33:47,317 --> 02:33:49,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Tex Murphy may make a comeback.

2112
02:33:49,599 --> 02:33:54,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Finish Games is going to start up a Kickstarter page on May 15th.

2113
02:33:54,343 --> 02:33:57,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems weird to me that you'd announce like six weeks in advance.

2114
02:33:57,086 --> 02:33:58,427
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start a Kickstarter page.

2115
02:33:58,747 --> 02:34:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But alright, they're going to round up funding for a sixth game in this full motion video adventure series.

2116
02:34:04,971 --> 02:34:06,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, I remember these games.

2117
02:34:07,793 --> 02:34:08,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2118
02:34:08,994 --> 02:34:12,016
[SPEAKER_02]: On May 15th, they're going to go live and you can donate to all this.

2119
02:34:12,317 --> 02:34:15,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy who plays Tex Murphy is on board.

2120
02:34:15,559 --> 02:34:21,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually see him in a YouTube video where they're actually trying to kind of hawk the whole Kickstarter event.

2121
02:34:23,044 --> 02:34:23,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

2122
02:34:24,745 --> 02:34:53,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's like I don't want to hate Kickstarter but I just hate the trend I think is what it is and I don't hate every campaign on Kickstarter but there's some that are pretty gross but I've already talked about that on a previous episode there's one in particular I saw that was downright offensive and I think people who contributed to it I think in some ways got suckered and swindled but that's your choice, your money anyhow

2123
02:34:54,443 --> 02:34:55,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to happier topics.

2124
02:34:56,424 --> 02:34:57,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe worse topics.

2125
02:34:57,724 --> 02:34:58,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all up to you guys.

2126
02:34:58,644 --> 02:34:59,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the hands of the listeners.

2127
02:34:59,925 --> 02:35:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Skype line is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2128
02:35:04,506 --> 02:35:07,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2129
02:35:08,267 --> 02:35:08,568
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2130
02:35:08,648 --> 02:35:12,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And going to our chat room, DDR Dollar Bill says, I like the Tex Murphy games.

2131
02:35:12,069 --> 02:35:13,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying they were bad games.

2132
02:35:13,549 --> 02:35:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this trend is a little strange.

2133
02:35:16,730 --> 02:35:18,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of this.

2134
02:35:19,651 --> 02:35:20,272
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2135
02:35:36,309 --> 02:35:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss my games!

2136
02:35:37,531 --> 02:35:37,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Cries.

2137
02:35:38,051 --> 02:35:40,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty happy with our Panasonic.

2138
02:35:40,954 --> 02:35:42,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshiba makes good ones, too.

2139
02:35:43,017 --> 02:35:46,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, go look... If you've got a Fry's in town, go to Fry's.

2140
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:48,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They have specials all the damn time.

2141
02:35:49,124 --> 02:35:51,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't buy anything on impulse.

2142
02:35:52,127 --> 02:35:54,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard for me to recommend you a specific TV game or girl.

2143
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:55,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not get a Plasma.

2144
02:35:57,414 --> 02:35:58,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Get an LCD.

2145
02:35:58,275 --> 02:36:01,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard for me to recommend a TV gamer girl because I don't know what type of setup you have.

2146
02:36:01,657 --> 02:36:05,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have like a gigantic living room that you want a gigantic TV to fill?

2147
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:10,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want something for your bedroom that maybe you're not going to be able to use the living room an awful lot?

2148
02:36:10,804 --> 02:36:19,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want a bedroom TV, maybe, and it's specifically for gaming because you said I miss my games, maybe you should look into that PlayStation monitor that's out.

2149
02:36:19,891 --> 02:36:24,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it's not terrible and you could do the whole 3D games if you have the consoles to support it.

2150
02:36:25,534 --> 02:36:30,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't really have a PlayStation 3, then that TV is kind of a waste.

2151
02:36:30,156 --> 02:36:31,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to think about.

2152
02:36:32,056 --> 02:36:36,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you're going for a bedroom TV, why not go for a computer monitor?

2153
02:36:36,717 --> 02:36:45,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a cable that will hook an Xbox 360 up to the computer monitor as well as PlayStation 3 can hook up to a computer monitor, right, with a particular cable?

2154
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: HDMI to DVI adapter

2155
02:37:03,453 --> 02:37:03,973
[SPEAKER_10]: That will do it.

2156
02:37:04,193 --> 02:37:06,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we'll work with the USPS3s.

2157
02:37:07,214 --> 02:37:09,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Brad from PodCulture in our chatroom suggests Vizio.

2158
02:37:09,855 --> 02:37:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Best bang for the buck.

2159
02:37:10,875 --> 02:37:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually what we have.

2160
02:37:12,535 --> 02:37:13,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy with the Vizio.

2161
02:37:13,655 --> 02:37:14,336
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to do it.

2162
02:37:16,156 --> 02:37:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Rama says Samsung.

2163
02:37:17,276 --> 02:37:18,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Best TVs ever.

2164
02:37:18,256 --> 02:37:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiggers says Sony Bravia all the way.

2165
02:37:20,757 --> 02:37:28,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Gamer Girl, it's really hard when we don't know your circumstance and your budget to pinpoint one correct TV.

2166
02:37:29,039 --> 02:37:30,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But do your research.

2167
02:37:30,419 --> 02:37:31,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your research online.

2168
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:32,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Read reader reviews.

2169
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:48,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to the store on a whim and let the sales guy know, yeah, I need to get a new TV because I can't play games anymore because they are going to try to take it to the cleaners because they're going to know you need a new TV and they're going to be like, oh, this chick's not going to leave without one.

2170
02:37:48,186 --> 02:37:48,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like shopping for a car.

2171
02:37:49,007 --> 02:37:49,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

2172
02:37:51,168 --> 02:37:53,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid to say no and don't let them know you want it.

2173
02:37:54,509 --> 02:37:54,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2174
02:37:55,309 --> 02:37:56,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't buy a plasma.

2175
02:37:57,170 --> 02:38:00,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Well now, some folks in the chat room disagree with you.

2176
02:38:02,097 --> 02:38:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, get a plasma, very little lag.

2177
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiggers agrees though, saying plasma hurts my eyes.

2178
02:38:08,105 --> 02:38:12,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Niche, or Niche, I don't know if you've seen that, says plasma is better than LCD.

2179
02:38:13,171 --> 02:38:13,472
[SPEAKER_02]: WTF.

2180
02:38:14,073 --> 02:38:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Disagree, because with plasma you can also deal with more burn-in in some cases.

2181
02:38:19,697 --> 02:38:29,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say also, Gamer Girl, go to the store and kind of look at the TVs, especially a place where you're less likely to get hounded, like Best Buy or even like Target.

2182
02:38:30,605 --> 02:38:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to a furniture store.

2183
02:38:31,826 --> 02:38:32,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a Walmart even.

2184
02:38:32,726 --> 02:38:35,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never have thought to get TVs at a furniture store.

2185
02:38:36,068 --> 02:38:41,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, go to a place where you're less likely to get hounded and just kind of look and go, oh, I like the look of this.

2186
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you can make your own decision on plasma versus LCD.

2187
02:38:43,813 --> 02:38:45,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll look at a plasma and go, I want this.

2188
02:38:45,894 --> 02:38:47,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, you can.

2189
02:38:47,895 --> 02:38:49,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would do that.

2190
02:38:49,716 --> 02:38:53,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a Target or a Walmart is a great place to look because you're not going to get hounded by salesmen.

2191
02:38:53,964 --> 02:38:54,686
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to buy.

2192
02:38:55,107 --> 02:38:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look.

2193
02:38:55,928 --> 02:39:00,156
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the TVs at Walmart are probably not... I mean, they're cheap for a reason.

2194
02:39:00,316 --> 02:39:00,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that.

2195
02:39:02,778 --> 02:39:05,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually super agree with Technus.

2196
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:11,625
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a membership to Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's, I recommend them because of the return policies.

2197
02:39:11,806 --> 02:39:13,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Agree, agree, agree.

2198
02:39:13,807 --> 02:39:21,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best place in the world actually, and here we go with advertisements, but I'm saying it because I believe it, I think the best place in the world to get a TV is Costco.

2199
02:39:22,634 --> 02:39:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: because their return policy used to be a lot more generous than it is now.

2200
02:39:27,197 --> 02:39:31,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, I had a TV break like two years after I bought it and Costco took it back.

2201
02:39:31,440 --> 02:39:32,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I was astounded.

2202
02:39:33,095 --> 02:39:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that with us.

2203
02:39:34,076 --> 02:39:35,457
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have our model anymore.

2204
02:39:36,197 --> 02:39:41,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So we traded it in from a 58-inch to a 52-inch and paid just another $100.

2205
02:39:42,562 --> 02:39:42,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

2206
02:39:43,003 --> 02:39:44,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I was astounded.

2207
02:39:44,564 --> 02:39:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think their policy is as generous anymore.

2208
02:39:48,067 --> 02:39:48,947
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a receipt now.

2209
02:39:49,027 --> 02:39:49,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2210
02:39:49,688 --> 02:39:57,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just the price and the fact you don't get hounded and the selection I think is a great place to try it.

2211
02:39:58,632 --> 02:39:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

2212
02:39:59,933 --> 02:40:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the phone's not ringing.

2213
02:40:01,475 --> 02:40:02,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's working.

2214
02:40:02,336 --> 02:40:05,600
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangetown Radio.

2215
02:40:05,980 --> 02:40:07,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the listeners are just being shy tonight.

2216
02:40:07,482 --> 02:40:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

2217
02:40:08,123 --> 02:40:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens sometimes.

2218
02:40:12,608 --> 02:40:14,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have also just been a little bit of a slow news week.

2219
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:15,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

2220
02:40:15,531 --> 02:40:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that happens.

2221
02:40:17,173 --> 02:40:19,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you just call and ask me a question, people?

2222
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:21,940
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura wants attention.

2223
02:40:22,801 --> 02:40:26,442
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just trying to get some life into the phone line.

2224
02:40:27,022 --> 02:40:30,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm checking to make sure the 800 number is actually working because it's been having some problems lately.

2225
02:40:31,124 --> 02:40:31,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's working.

2226
02:40:31,804 --> 02:40:33,784
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people who've got problems.

2227
02:40:34,945 --> 02:40:37,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on to a couple more tweets.

2228
02:40:38,366 --> 02:40:44,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Tigerclaw links us to a story about NASA helped with Angry Birds space.

2229
02:40:44,736 --> 02:40:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that came out.

2230
02:40:46,937 --> 02:40:47,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

2231
02:40:48,678 --> 02:40:56,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But Angry Birds Space did come out and apparently NASA collaborated in this with what's called a Space Act Agreement.

2232
02:40:56,521 --> 02:40:57,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does NASA team up with this?

2233
02:40:58,421 --> 02:41:03,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It saw an opportunity to teach kids about space, science, and the laws of physics.

2234
02:41:03,543 --> 02:41:10,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And considering that NASA's kind of taken some hits lately with funding and all that, I can see why they'd want to get on board with this.

2235
02:41:11,206 --> 02:41:11,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I...

2236
02:41:12,967 --> 02:41:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a kid, I'd be really into this, I think.

2237
02:41:15,970 --> 02:41:17,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is actually a good thing.

2238
02:41:17,811 --> 02:41:18,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hate on this.

2239
02:41:19,813 --> 02:41:22,355
[SPEAKER_02]: A comment from, what is this?

2240
02:41:23,256 --> 02:41:26,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Station Trajectory Operations Officer.

2241
02:41:26,759 --> 02:41:31,664
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to demonstrate how we can use trajectories to get from one place to another.

2242
02:41:32,224 --> 02:41:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good example of how interplanetary probes can take gravity assets from other, or gravity assists, excuse me, from other planets.

2243
02:41:40,650 --> 02:41:42,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, our phone line's lighting up now.

2244
02:41:43,012 --> 02:41:45,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're hemming and hawing work, DarkSakura.

2245
02:41:45,413 --> 02:41:45,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a call.

2246
02:41:46,294 --> 02:41:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2247
02:41:47,235 --> 02:41:47,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2248
02:41:48,756 --> 02:41:49,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

2249
02:41:49,876 --> 02:41:50,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Actdeft.

2250
02:41:50,477 --> 02:41:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?

2251
02:41:52,378 --> 02:41:54,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Just checking if Skype works.

2252
02:41:55,300 --> 02:41:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

2253
02:41:56,101 --> 02:41:56,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It does work.

2254
02:41:56,861 --> 02:41:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

2255
02:41:57,441 --> 02:41:58,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's on your mind?

2256
02:41:58,142 --> 02:41:59,123
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing lately?

2257
02:42:00,844 --> 02:42:01,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, really.

2258
02:42:02,145 --> 02:42:05,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been playing mostly Team Fortress 2 on Steam.

2259
02:42:06,267 --> 02:42:06,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And Forza 4.

2260
02:42:07,028 --> 02:42:07,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Forza 4?

2261
02:42:07,208 --> 02:42:07,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2262
02:42:10,851 --> 02:42:14,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza, that's a series I never really got into because it's a little too pro for me.

2263
02:42:14,954 --> 02:42:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you like about Forza?

2264
02:42:17,076 --> 02:42:17,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Forza 4.

2265
02:42:19,458 --> 02:42:24,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Forza, pretty much, it's pretty much like Gran Turismo in the simulation sense.

2266
02:42:25,783 --> 02:42:32,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very precise, and when you have to accelerate turns and all that, it's like driving a real car.

2267
02:42:32,609 --> 02:42:39,135
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that Forza has as a series is that it has an arcade feel.

2268
02:42:39,975 --> 02:42:44,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a car guy in real life?

2269
02:42:44,898 --> 02:42:48,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to mod cars and pimp your ride and all that?

2270
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:51,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhat.

2271
02:42:52,481 --> 02:43:00,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like cars, though I don't know that much to mod or modify cars like that.

2272
02:43:00,125 --> 02:43:05,328
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a car aficionado in real life, so I do know some stuff.

2273
02:43:05,948 --> 02:43:12,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so yeah, I, you know, I just kind of noticed usually the people that get into these games are car aficionados and there's nothing wrong with that.

2274
02:43:12,715 --> 02:43:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Cars can be very sexy machines.

2275
02:43:14,276 --> 02:43:15,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I recognize that.

2276
02:43:16,098 --> 02:43:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't necessarily drive a state of the art car, but I was, I even parked next to a guy today.

2277
02:43:20,683 --> 02:43:21,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's a sexy car.

2278
02:43:22,604 --> 02:43:24,026
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had more money, I'd want that car.

2279
02:43:26,144 --> 02:43:34,909
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, something that, like I said, for so fast, it doesn't feel like a simulation at all.

2280
02:43:35,489 --> 02:43:44,314
[SPEAKER_01]: You have all the customization, you can paint your car, you can tune it out, and you can pretty much do everything with your car.

2281
02:43:44,434 --> 02:43:46,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also drives like a real car.

2282
02:43:46,895 --> 02:43:50,217
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, the moment you're playing the game,

2283
02:43:50,997 --> 02:43:51,278
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

2284
02:44:11,135 --> 02:44:13,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, are you a fan of arcade racers?

2285
02:44:13,196 --> 02:44:17,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the split seconds, the blurs, the burnouts of the world?

2286
02:44:18,318 --> 02:44:20,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a fan of both type of games, really.

2287
02:44:21,259 --> 02:44:27,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I do mostly play arcade racers like Ridge Racer, the Dirt Series, and all that.

2288
02:44:29,023 --> 02:44:30,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Then tell me, am I right or am I right?

2289
02:44:31,564 --> 02:44:33,865
[SPEAKER_02]: F-Zero needs to be a Wii U launch title.

2290
02:44:34,565 --> 02:44:35,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it does.

2291
02:44:35,746 --> 02:44:36,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

2292
02:44:38,174 --> 02:44:39,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been hearing that, that's pretty good

2293
02:44:53,737 --> 02:44:58,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing, I was talking to Shane earlier about it, and he says the game's got a great sense of humor.

2294
02:44:58,279 --> 02:45:04,983
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he's reminded of Earthbound in the sense of humor, and I'm like, ooh, that's a big name to invoke around Nintendo.

2295
02:45:06,944 --> 02:45:08,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's pretty cool if it's got that sense of humor to it.

2296
02:45:11,146 --> 02:45:12,967
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2297
02:45:14,668 --> 02:45:15,549
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that will be all.

2298
02:45:15,769 --> 02:45:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, take care, buddy.

2299
02:45:16,910 --> 02:45:17,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2300
02:45:18,190 --> 02:45:18,751
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2301
02:45:18,771 --> 02:45:18,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

2302
02:45:19,151 --> 02:45:19,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2303
02:45:21,257 --> 02:45:29,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have asked if he was into Mario Kart, too, because Mario Kart's kind of a racer that's a little bit toned down so everybody can get into it.

2304
02:45:30,064 --> 02:45:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I played randomly not that long ago was Mario Kart on the Wii again.

2305
02:45:33,466 --> 02:45:37,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't played that in forever, but it's still all right.

2306
02:45:38,150 --> 02:45:42,953
[SPEAKER_02]: One other tweet here from TigerClaw at Twitter.com slash OLR, where you guys can send us tweets every week.

2307
02:45:43,414 --> 02:45:47,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Scammers attempt to trick fans with promise of new Mass Effect 3 endings.

2308
02:45:48,037 --> 02:45:49,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is terrible.

2309
02:45:49,138 --> 02:45:50,659
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2310
02:46:17,356 --> 02:46:21,019
[SPEAKER_02]: to give us all your information so you can download the client, like your credit card number.

2311
02:46:21,059 --> 02:46:22,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people, unfortunately, fall for it.

2312
02:46:22,960 --> 02:46:25,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's happening with the Mass Effect 3 ending stuff.

2313
02:46:26,663 --> 02:46:29,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come back to this story in a minute, but we have another call coming in.

2314
02:46:29,065 --> 02:46:29,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2315
02:46:30,006 --> 02:46:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2316
02:46:30,866 --> 02:46:31,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

2317
02:46:31,887 --> 02:46:32,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ranma, what's up?

2318
02:46:33,368 --> 02:46:34,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much, not too much.

2319
02:46:34,489 --> 02:46:35,370
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, good friend?

2320
02:46:36,831 --> 02:46:37,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Same old, same old.

2321
02:46:37,951 --> 02:46:41,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Just working, sleeping, playing Mass Effect.

2322
02:46:42,478 --> 02:46:44,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Aha, Mass Effect, I see that.

2323
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2324
02:46:46,941 --> 02:46:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too much, I was pondering to call see if you had played Kid Icarus yet, because I'm more or less waiting on your review of the game before I go out and buy it, but from the last call you haven't popped it open yet, so I'm kind of anxious about it.

2325
02:47:00,789 --> 02:47:03,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have a review next week, I promise.

2326
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:05,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I did buy it.

2327
02:47:05,211 --> 02:47:06,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a leap of faith and bought it.

2328
02:47:07,691 --> 02:47:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it on Amazon, which is kind of funny because I ended up getting, like, it was $39.99, right?

2329
02:47:14,574 --> 02:47:18,815
[SPEAKER_02]: They refunded me $10 because I guess Best Buy or somebody else put it out cheaper.

2330
02:47:19,395 --> 02:47:22,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have that whole, if it comes out cheaper somewhere else, we'll refund your money.

2331
02:47:23,176 --> 02:47:24,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was kind of interesting.

2332
02:47:25,177 --> 02:47:30,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That would kind of explain why I could not find it in Best Buy the last couple of days.

2333
02:47:30,178 --> 02:47:32,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just decided to walk in and check.

2334
02:47:32,379 --> 02:47:34,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Just out of idle curiosity.

2335
02:47:34,379 --> 02:47:35,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, didn't have it.

2336
02:47:35,779 --> 02:47:36,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that means it's selling.

2337
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:39,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I guess is a good sign.

2338
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:41,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like for the series to come back.

2339
02:47:42,481 --> 02:47:43,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping the game doesn't suck.

2340
02:47:43,801 --> 02:47:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: But the general consensus I'm reading on the internet is that the game is pretty damn good.

2341
02:47:49,042 --> 02:48:12,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Good but the controls are so bad it ruins it for some people like it like there's a reason the game came with the little stand that's kind of the general consensus I'm hearing which is a little bit alarming if the controls are that bad it's going to ruin the game but it's good enough to further explore the concept is kind of what I'm getting.

2342
02:48:13,452 --> 02:48:14,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I get it.

2343
02:48:14,352 --> 02:48:15,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it now.

2344
02:48:16,353 --> 02:48:19,334
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the 3D re-release of the original Kid Icarus.

2345
02:48:19,734 --> 02:48:22,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it's not just the ROM.

2346
02:48:22,756 --> 02:48:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this isn't a huge deal, but they went and added backgrounds, I guess, into it.

2347
02:48:27,077 --> 02:48:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did kind of give it a little something-something they didn't have before.

2348
02:48:30,458 --> 02:48:36,520
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds interesting, because I'm kind of reminded of the times I used to sit there and play the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy.

2349
02:48:37,361 --> 02:48:40,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, the kind of overlooked sequel that really did come out, yeah.

2350
02:48:41,261 --> 02:48:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm

2351
02:48:58,095 --> 02:49:26,512
[SPEAKER_02]: it did have some weird quirky stuff in it but and it tried to do a lot like I think they kind of stretched themselves thin with suddenly it's a vertical scroller now it's a side scroller now it's a dungeon crawler now it's a shooter you know what I mean that's a bit of a mind fuck if you think about it it is but I mean for a child who is you know eight years old with mild ADD it was great pretty much maybe that's why it holds my attention so well

2352
02:49:27,901 --> 02:49:31,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we're on the topic of 3DS games, I'll make this quick before I bounce off.

2353
02:49:31,546 --> 02:49:34,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally got around to playing Super Mario 3D Land.

2354
02:49:34,250 --> 02:49:34,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, what'd you think?

2355
02:49:36,609 --> 02:49:39,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I kept saying that I want a 3D version of Super Mario 3.

2356
02:49:39,871 --> 02:49:42,312
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I've been screaming for.

2357
02:49:43,052 --> 02:49:49,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And this game pretty much comes close to my inner Super Mario 3 fandom.

2358
02:49:49,216 --> 02:49:50,117
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes close.

2359
02:49:50,937 --> 02:49:52,178
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really good.

2360
02:49:52,518 --> 02:49:53,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

2361
02:49:53,319 --> 02:49:57,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think people don't give it enough credit for what it's doing to the franchise as a whole.

2362
02:49:57,601 --> 02:49:58,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really good.

2363
02:50:00,768 --> 02:50:04,852
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my main issues with the game is that all the levels are straightforward.

2364
02:50:04,892 --> 02:50:08,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought maybe you'd be able to go to 1-1 and 1-2.

2365
02:50:08,756 --> 02:50:12,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You could just go down another direction, go to 1-4, this and that.

2366
02:50:12,299 --> 02:50:13,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like in Mario 64, kind of?

2367
02:50:14,401 --> 02:50:16,163
[SPEAKER_09]: No, more like the way it was in Mario 3.

2368
02:50:16,203 --> 02:50:18,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got you.

2369
02:50:18,905 --> 02:50:19,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2370
02:50:20,427 --> 02:50:21,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you finished the game yet or no?

2371
02:50:23,329 --> 02:50:24,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I've fake finished it.

2372
02:50:26,112 --> 02:50:28,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say too much for spoiler reasons.

2373
02:50:28,533 --> 02:50:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2374
02:50:29,914 --> 02:50:30,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

2375
02:50:30,715 --> 02:50:33,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a Symphony of the Night-esque thing going on.

2376
02:50:33,856 --> 02:50:34,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

2377
02:50:35,057 --> 02:50:36,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing through it again.

2378
02:50:36,718 --> 02:50:40,680
[SPEAKER_09]: In the back of my mind, I'm like, I can't believe I'm going through the levels the way I am.

2379
02:50:41,041 --> 02:50:44,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the difficulty kind of jumps around.

2380
02:50:45,023 --> 02:50:51,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at that last section, when I thought it was done, and then this whole more of it pops up, I'm like...

2381
02:50:53,055 --> 02:50:54,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo, what the fuck?

2382
02:50:55,237 --> 02:50:55,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2383
02:50:55,817 --> 02:50:56,818
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?

2384
02:50:56,958 --> 02:50:58,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

2385
02:50:58,799 --> 02:51:00,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's great.

2386
02:51:00,781 --> 02:51:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

2387
02:51:01,261 --> 02:51:09,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not often that games kind of invoke that feeling that you got when you realized, oh my god, Symphony of the Night, I'm not even halfway done.

2388
02:51:12,810 --> 02:51:13,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

2389
02:51:13,735 --> 02:51:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I got to say.

2390
02:51:16,916 --> 02:51:17,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good luck.

2391
02:51:17,956 --> 02:51:23,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you do well enough, you might get to be Black Luigi playing Luigi.

2392
02:51:24,118 --> 02:51:27,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already gotten to that part.

2393
02:51:28,239 --> 02:51:32,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I like how they redid Luigi.

2394
02:51:32,581 --> 02:51:33,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

2395
02:51:33,701 --> 02:51:35,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more playable.

2396
02:51:35,781 --> 02:51:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else before we let you go tonight?

2397
02:51:39,635 --> 02:51:40,176
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.

2398
02:51:40,616 --> 02:51:40,896
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2399
02:51:40,936 --> 02:51:41,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2400
02:51:41,976 --> 02:51:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2401
02:51:42,556 --> 02:51:42,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2402
02:51:43,457 --> 02:51:45,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Rob, it's a Mario game.

2403
02:51:45,737 --> 02:51:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really need spoiler alerts for it?

2404
02:51:47,658 --> 02:51:48,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, I'm just trying to be nice.

2405
02:51:48,978 --> 02:51:49,218
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2406
02:51:49,958 --> 02:51:50,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another call coming in.

2407
02:51:50,919 --> 02:51:51,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2408
02:51:51,839 --> 02:51:52,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2409
02:51:52,679 --> 02:51:53,359
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Shane.

2410
02:51:53,539 --> 02:51:55,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you've been calling a lot lately.

2411
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:55,460
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

2412
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:01,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because I stay up later for some reason, which is probably why I fail at work more often than not.

2413
02:52:02,182 --> 02:52:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

2414
02:52:02,882 --> 02:52:04,202
[SPEAKER_04]: This show's important, damn it.

2415
02:52:04,982 --> 02:52:05,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.

2416
02:52:05,803 --> 02:52:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2417
02:52:07,392 --> 02:52:07,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Kid Icarus

2418
02:52:23,127 --> 02:52:24,929
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what our last caller wanted to know about.

2419
02:52:25,069 --> 02:52:26,370
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about Kid Icarus?

2420
02:52:27,431 --> 02:52:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fantastic.

2421
02:52:28,272 --> 02:52:40,784
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they paced the game with the terrible control scheme, because let's just be honest, if a game makes you hurt your hands while playing on purpose, it's got a terrible control scheme.

2422
02:52:42,446 --> 02:52:57,779
[SPEAKER_04]: but the writing is so good and I think the Earthbound comparison that I gave to you earlier is spot on because it's witty it's stupidly cheesy it makes terrible puns and it breaks the fourth wall constantly

2423
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:00,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

2424
02:53:01,223 --> 02:53:15,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because Nintendo is, for whatever reason, and this makes me hurt to say, please don't be mad at me, fanboys, but maybe since Nintendo's kind of abandoned the Mother franchise, maybe they're bringing Kid Icarus in as kind of their silly...

2425
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:19,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's just because it's for four-year-olds?

2426
02:53:19,312 --> 02:53:21,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's because it's made by Sakurai is why.

2427
02:53:22,336 --> 02:53:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?

2428
02:53:22,936 --> 02:53:23,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2429
02:53:23,116 --> 02:53:23,577
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2430
02:53:24,698 --> 02:53:27,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's got a great sense of humor then.

2431
02:53:27,701 --> 02:53:32,186
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, in the interest of full disclosure, you're a big fan of Power Rangers and Pokemon.

2432
02:53:32,667 --> 02:53:32,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2433
02:53:34,109 --> 02:53:36,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the game's aimed at children.

2434
02:53:37,603 --> 02:53:38,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2435
02:53:38,263 --> 02:53:44,887
[SPEAKER_04]: When one of the lines is, it's like a birthday party where everybody's trying to kill me, I don't feel like that's really Pokemon.

2436
02:53:45,067 --> 02:53:45,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Shane.

2437
02:53:46,468 --> 02:53:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2438
02:53:47,168 --> 02:53:52,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick spoiler, because I forgot to talk about this last week during the segment that doesn't exist.

2439
02:53:52,151 --> 02:53:53,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Which game are we spoiling?

2440
02:53:53,552 --> 02:53:54,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, real quick.

2441
02:53:54,452 --> 02:54:00,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say, hey, I bet you don't know that there's a Kinect version of Power Rangers Samurai coming out later this year.

2442
02:54:01,396 --> 02:54:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean the game I feel the urge to pre-order now?

2443
02:54:05,997 --> 02:54:10,660
[SPEAKER_04]: because I will totally morph and punch things in the air.

2444
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:11,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

2445
02:54:12,040 --> 02:54:16,823
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I played the crap out of the Super Nintendo one.

2446
02:54:17,463 --> 02:54:18,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that was great.

2447
02:54:18,604 --> 02:54:20,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really good beat-em-up.

2448
02:54:20,685 --> 02:54:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a Dairanger game that came out in Japan that I had the ROM for that I played the hell out of.

2449
02:54:27,366 --> 02:54:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon!

2450
02:54:27,586 --> 02:54:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon!

2451
02:54:49,239 --> 02:54:51,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, because everybody should be excited about that.

2452
02:54:52,341 --> 02:54:58,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to cross-promote shows or whatever, but I'm sure on Horde House we'll talk about this week.

2453
02:54:59,625 --> 02:55:07,809
[SPEAKER_04]: They datamined some of the pet battle stuff, and it shows what's weak to what, what's strong against what, and some of the new attacks.

2454
02:55:08,290 --> 02:55:12,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So Pokemon in World of Warcraft is just going to make my day.

2455
02:55:13,012 --> 02:55:14,234
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2456
02:55:30,556 --> 02:55:49,371
[SPEAKER_02]: so gosh what else do I ask you about so thank you for the plug for Horde House that's good we always try to cross promote the shows and Kid Icarus so you think Kid Icarus because Ranma said he's waiting for my review to check it out but you're saying don't bother just go get it and you can play the game in 10 minute bursts so that way when your hand starts wanting to die you can take a break and it's okay

2457
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:54,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I really like the way they scale the difficulty for you.

2458
02:55:55,774 --> 02:55:57,555
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no hard, easy mode.

2459
02:55:58,676 --> 02:56:01,158
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this bar, and you wager hearts.

2460
02:56:01,858 --> 02:56:03,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And by wagering hearts, you get better rewards.

2461
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:07,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more hearts you wager, the harder the game gets.

2462
02:56:07,702 --> 02:56:09,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you lose, you lose a whole bunch of hearts.

2463
02:56:09,683 --> 02:56:13,926
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you beat it, you get better rewards, and the difficulty just skyrockets.

2464
02:56:14,026 --> 02:56:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost died on wagering to a 4.2 level difficulty.

2465
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:21,270
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2466
02:56:42,356 --> 02:56:57,604
[SPEAKER_04]: so she's like oh remember the eggplant wizard and the nurses and you know and it previously would heal you and he was like if it was like yeah you know I went there so often they named it after me and she's like what he's like hospital get it hospital

2467
02:56:59,702 --> 02:57:01,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that is terrible.

2468
02:57:01,964 --> 02:57:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it?

2469
02:57:02,585 --> 02:57:05,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just so funny when you're playing it.

2470
02:57:05,828 --> 02:57:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, are you kidding me?

2471
02:57:07,410 --> 02:57:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

2472
02:57:08,531 --> 02:57:09,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all voice acted, right?

2473
02:57:10,132 --> 02:57:12,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's not any text.

2474
02:57:12,795 --> 02:57:15,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's text, but I mean, it's all dialogue voice stuff.

2475
02:57:15,778 --> 02:57:16,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

2476
02:57:18,201 --> 02:57:32,402
[SPEAKER_04]: or when you are scaling a wall in one of the flying stages and there's like enemies pouring down on you and you beat them all and you get to the top it's like yeah take that wall I'm like that sounds like something I would say that is something you would say actually very much yes

2477
02:57:33,002 --> 02:57:34,883
[SPEAKER_06]: That also sounds like something Dan would say.

2478
02:57:35,463 --> 02:57:36,203
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, it does.

2479
02:57:37,344 --> 02:57:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Any online-ish components?

2480
02:57:38,924 --> 02:57:40,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Pass, Spot Pass, any of that?

2481
02:57:41,905 --> 02:57:46,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does have, I believe, an online multiplayer and a local multiplayer.

2482
02:57:46,727 --> 02:57:53,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done them yet because I'm only to world four or five because I fell asleep.

2483
02:57:55,511 --> 02:57:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then went back to playing Mass Effect.

2484
02:57:57,611 --> 02:57:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and then went back to playing Mass Effect.

2485
02:58:00,973 --> 02:58:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: it sounds like from everything I've read the multiplayer is really fun and a lot of the sort of high risk high reward stuff happens in that too because like if you take I guess one of your better weapons into multiplayer if you when you take a good weapon in there you take you have like a lower health bar so it expects if you have a good weapon you're going to be a better player

2486
02:58:24,625 --> 02:58:31,347
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that's really cool because if I'm going to have a god weapon I should only have a little bit of health because I earned that weapon.

2487
02:58:32,407 --> 02:58:32,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2488
02:58:33,027 --> 02:58:39,669
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to let you go to wrap up the show but quickly I know you said you weren't going to bring up Mass Effect but I just have to ask one Mass Effect related question.

2489
02:58:40,009 --> 02:58:40,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2490
02:58:40,969 --> 02:58:42,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack is the greatest character ever.

2491
02:58:42,950 --> 02:58:43,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or yes?

2492
02:58:44,750 --> 02:58:44,970
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2493
02:58:45,050 --> 02:58:45,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2494
02:58:45,470 --> 02:58:45,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it again.

2495
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:47,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack is the greatest character ever.

2496
02:58:47,651 --> 02:58:48,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or yes?

2497
02:58:48,471 --> 02:58:48,771
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2498
02:58:49,511 --> 02:58:51,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like Jack better in two.

2499
02:58:51,732 --> 02:58:52,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't like the listeners.

2500
02:58:52,532 --> 02:58:52,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean three.

2501
02:58:53,333 --> 02:58:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2502
02:58:54,574 --> 02:58:55,815
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, have a good one, Shane.

2503
02:58:55,915 --> 02:58:56,316
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2504
02:58:56,336 --> 02:58:56,877
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bye.

2505
02:58:57,377 --> 02:58:58,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2506
02:58:58,619 --> 02:58:59,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll do it for the Skype line tonight.

2507
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to those guys that got through.

2508
02:59:01,221 --> 02:59:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it was a little slow to begin, but then it started to fill up there at the end.

2509
02:59:05,006 --> 02:59:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be shy next week.

2510
02:59:06,788 --> 02:59:09,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard from some of my favorite people today.

2511
02:59:09,571 --> 02:59:09,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh?

2512
02:59:10,732 --> 02:59:11,573
[SPEAKER_06]: on the sky.

2513
02:59:11,633 --> 02:59:12,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, on the skyline, yeah.

2514
02:59:13,174 --> 02:59:24,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm especially, I'm pleased slash angry with Shane because of all of the music that I got in trouble for buying on Amazon after being in a turntable with him.

2515
02:59:25,082 --> 02:59:26,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, were you guys turntabling this week?

2516
02:59:26,803 --> 02:59:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We did two nights ago.

2517
02:59:29,465 --> 02:59:29,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2518
02:59:29,905 --> 02:59:30,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2519
02:59:30,345 --> 02:59:30,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Good time.

2520
02:59:31,666 --> 02:59:33,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Or last night, I don't remember because I can't remember anything.

2521
02:59:34,668 --> 02:59:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got in trouble for all the music I downloaded.

2522
02:59:37,270 --> 02:59:40,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have good music, yay, but I'm poor, boo.

2523
02:59:40,731 --> 02:59:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an unofficial official Turntable FM after party for Orange Lounge Radio that HitStun puts together.

2524
02:59:47,094 --> 02:59:48,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of one of those.

2525
02:59:48,654 --> 02:59:49,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We endorse it.

2526
02:59:50,075 --> 02:59:51,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not us doing it, but we endorse it.

2527
02:59:51,896 --> 02:59:53,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Turntable FM.

2528
02:59:53,656 --> 02:59:55,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great site.

2529
02:59:55,157 --> 02:59:59,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the greatest things to happen to music in a long time since iTunes.

2530
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:07,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I want to quickly say I never finished up the tweet from earlier that TigerClaw sent us, the whole scamming thing.

2531
03:00:08,062 --> 03:00:15,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The new scam is Mass Effect 3, and there is a spam email going out, and I can't believe people are falling for this, but unfortunately it's working.

2532
03:00:15,985 --> 03:00:26,748
[SPEAKER_02]: You download a zip file containing a password-protected downloader for the supposed new ending, and a text file in the zip tells you to go to a website where you do offers to get the ending.

2533
03:00:26,808 --> 03:00:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is shady as hell, right?

2534
03:00:28,949 --> 03:00:30,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So, don't fall for this stuff.

2535
03:00:30,510 --> 03:00:32,331
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm sure the executable is a virus.

2536
03:00:33,312 --> 03:00:36,573
[SPEAKER_02]: If something legit happens, it will be all over the internet.

2537
03:00:36,593 --> 03:00:41,856
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll not only report on it here on the show, but if you can't wait until Sunday, just, like, seriously.

2538
03:00:42,497 --> 03:00:44,138
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mass Effect 3 stuff has been so big.

2539
03:00:44,158 --> 03:00:44,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2540
03:00:44,478 --> 03:00:46,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds kind of legit to me.

2541
03:00:46,879 --> 03:00:49,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I see stories on my news.google.com.

2542
03:00:49,821 --> 03:00:56,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to kind of get the aggregate news a lot, and Mass Effect 3 is always in the technology stories.

2543
03:00:56,825 --> 03:00:56,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

2544
03:00:58,809 --> 03:01:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, that's it.

2545
03:01:01,791 --> 03:01:02,672
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for calls.

2546
03:01:02,692 --> 03:01:03,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for tweets.

2547
03:01:03,712 --> 03:01:05,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's it for another episode of OLR.

2548
03:01:06,554 --> 03:01:10,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly, though, before we wrap it up and say goodnight, I need to ask if there's any last-minute stories.

2549
03:01:10,937 --> 03:01:13,199
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, any last-minute stories you want to get out tonight?

2550
03:01:15,781 --> 03:01:15,861
No.

2551
03:01:16,877 --> 03:01:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing I want to get out.

2552
03:01:18,218 --> 03:01:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Geovidea in chat says it's happening for the Guild Wars 2 beta too.

2553
03:01:22,321 --> 03:01:23,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.

2554
03:01:23,281 --> 03:01:24,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish I was getting in that beta.

2555
03:01:25,683 --> 03:01:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll get your zip file executable and you can download the password from a website.

2556
03:01:31,106 --> 03:01:32,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

2557
03:01:33,348 --> 03:01:35,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2558
03:01:37,190 --> 03:01:39,031
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought for the listeners tonight?

2559
03:01:40,652 --> 03:01:41,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I want pizza.

2560
03:01:43,208 --> 03:01:44,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, we can't do final thoughts.

2561
03:01:44,269 --> 03:01:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2562
03:01:44,589 --> 03:01:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We skipped something.

2563
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:45,830
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2564
03:01:46,090 --> 03:01:47,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We never did the FUs of the week.

2565
03:01:48,152 --> 03:01:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.

2566
03:01:53,516 --> 03:01:54,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not angsty, Rob.

2567
03:01:56,839 --> 03:01:58,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can do a thank you.

2568
03:01:59,861 --> 03:02:00,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you or whatever it's called.

2569
03:02:04,571 --> 03:02:06,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I do have a fuck you.

2570
03:02:07,775 --> 03:02:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: To the guy who was setting up the booth outside of Walmart that said, get rid of Obama, vote Republican, with the very poorly handwritten sign, first of all, if you want to draw the right attention, you need a better designed sign, just saying.

2571
03:02:23,812 --> 03:02:25,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do feel great, except I'm hungry.

2572
03:02:26,033 --> 03:02:26,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2573
03:02:26,373 --> 03:02:26,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

2574
03:02:51,241 --> 03:03:19,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess FU to being tired I've had to work hard the last few days because I've had to watch Josh instead of going to work and giving at least a lunch break My FU of the week goes to internet drama because it's very very serious The internet's serious business It is serious business and our lives depend on internet drama

2575
03:03:23,835 --> 03:03:27,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Porkchop in our chat says Orange Launch Radio is linked to aggressive and violent hosts.

2576
03:03:28,437 --> 03:03:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

2577
03:03:29,317 --> 03:03:33,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, last minute, or excuse me, now our final thoughts.

2578
03:03:33,058 --> 03:03:34,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did last minute stories.

2579
03:03:34,199 --> 03:03:34,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

2580
03:03:34,619 --> 03:03:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, you get another go at it.

2581
03:03:35,979 --> 03:03:36,739
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your final thought?

2582
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:37,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Tea.

2583
03:03:39,100 --> 03:03:41,421
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought of the night is broccoli beef.

2584
03:03:42,742 --> 03:03:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2585
03:03:44,348 --> 03:04:10,755
[SPEAKER_10]: there are a lot of good projects on Kickstarter so be sure to check out Kickstarter but there are a lot that seem you just have to look at it and how professionally it's being approached and stuff and some of them are quite sickening to the amount of money that they raise for what they've raised it for and for how long those certain things were going for prior to putting a Kickstarter up if you know what I mean I think that's as vague as I can get

2586
03:04:12,754 --> 03:04:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and let's see.

2587
03:04:14,535 --> 03:04:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought tonight... Oh no, I did my final thought.

2588
03:04:17,357 --> 03:04:17,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

2589
03:04:18,498 --> 03:04:19,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I got distracted by chat.

2590
03:04:20,299 --> 03:04:21,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this.

2591
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:23,181
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the segment I always say at the end of every show.

2592
03:04:23,241 --> 03:04:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the final, final thought from all of us.

2593
03:04:25,403 --> 03:04:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.

2594

[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's birthday is in April.

2598
03:05:14,208 --> 03:05:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can I say?

2599
03:05:15,569 --> 03:05:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a crazy month.

2600
03:05:17,070 --> 03:05:20,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see you next week to do it all again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
