00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's your hosts?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, March 25th, 2012

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A classic arcade game will come to Xbox Live Arcade with Kinect controls

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Amazon stopped stocking one release from this month

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could games soon carry a warning similar to cigarettes?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we're live with the 451st episode of our show for this

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
March the 25th of 2012

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about games and gaming culture and all that good stuff

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With my co-hosts, first off, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Um, hungry

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hungry?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you about to participate in the Hunger Games? You're so hungry?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Shut up

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or the Hungry Hungry Hippo Games?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No I'm actually not hungry because I had broth but I will be fasting every Sunday now

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now is this a religious thing?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well you never know, it's worth the shot right?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's for my health

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, like a new, I don't want to say new craze but

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No it's not

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's something I've been debating doing for like the last year or so so now I'm actually doing it

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'm assuming you've done the appropriate research and all that good stuff

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Just letting the listeners know

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's not something you're doing on a whim

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In a month I will be discussing my results

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you incorporating any exergaming into this?

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Same stuff I'm always doing, I do yoga like every day

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mhm

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Alright, also say hello to definitely not fasting, Techmaster Loki

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Funny you used to say that actually

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My wife wants me to do that too starting after

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you think your wife may or may not have been influenced by a co-host on this show?

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No she did that because she had to not eat for a couple days for procedures she just had done so

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She's like well if I can keep doing that I can lose some weight

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well this is dangerous territory though

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No fasting actually isn't bad for you

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a gaming show we're getting way off topic but this is much different than you know some people don't eat

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I mean it seems like with this fasting thing you're still eating some and it's a scheduled thing

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're still eating some nutritional value things

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's just not a lot of the other stuff

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's basically just cutting out you know

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And part of it for me that I really like about it is that I have a full 24 hours where I don't think about food

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have been more productive I've gotten so much stuff done

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And honestly I felt super energized after I was done with my first one

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That was Wednesday from 3 o'clock p.m. to Thursday 3 o'clock p.m.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Went to yoga that night felt great

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And it really is kind of crazy it's just sort of like my energy level shot way up

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just trying to draw a clear line between what you're doing and what someone with a mental disorder who doesn't eat does

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I'm just trying to make that distinction clear

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A person with a mental disorder would just not eat

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know completely not

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or maybe do like what was her face on the Partridge family Susan Day

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who ate nothing but carrots and turned orange

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That happened to me when I was a baby

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well yeah it's beta-carotene

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's different when you're a baby

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah but I mean I'm saying that you know there's people that will just you know do all the stuff

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And this is really something that I've put research into and read a bunch of different stuff

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I'm doing what I do with anything

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I try it for a month

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I see how I feel

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Check my health

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And this is someone who used to get blood tested every six months so

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just want to make that clear for the listeners

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Especially if it's your first time listening

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Just want to make that clear

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's a clear difference here

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not stupid

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Loki sorry to cut you off but

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wanted to make sure the listeners understood that

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But you are you are clearly indulging in a feast tonight

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
With your bacon and garlic pizza

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I call that a meal but you know

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Alright you can join us live here

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We are of course live tonight Sunday night

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So we're always here Sundays at All Games Radio

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern

93

Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Although as he mentioned tonight he's going on a brief hiatus for the next two weeks

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you'll just have to tune in right at 6 o'clock for the next couple weeks

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because we'll be on there at All Games Radio

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Again www.allgames.com

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We also always have our chat room with us

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
www.chat.orangeloungeradio.com

100

If you want to join us and chat with us throughout the evening

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And some folks are coming up with cute little names

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Fitness Lounge Radio from ActDeaf

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And Diet Diet Revolution there from Hitstun

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There you go

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Alright

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're going to get into some gaming news

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And how our gaming weeks were and all that

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But usually we have a little kick off topic here at the start

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I want to talk about this tonight

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because this is what lots of people

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Lots of people are talking about

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Facebook is any indication

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's like everybody's freaking talking about this

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And that's that movie The Hunger Games

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Which is announced today

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Best non-sequel opening ever

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Best, it beat Twilight

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Which can't be bad news

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I personally have not seen the movie myself

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I haven't read the books or anything

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm interested in seeing the movie

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Mostly because all my friends are like

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's so good, it's so good

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I'm not going to hate something just because it's good

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Loki you're doing it, did you go see it?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not sure the wife took you to see it

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What did you think?

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No the wife didn't take me to see it

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I had tickets to see it

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh sorry, how dare I?

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It was free

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Free popcorn

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was alright

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My wife had described it as Battle Royale meets Twilight

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
As in there's boyfriend, girlfriend, garbage

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And people killing each other

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The best description I read on the internet was

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Battle Royale for soccer moms

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not really, no

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I mean they don't really touch on the whole relationship stuff that much

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's just kind of briefly there

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And it actually is part of a plot point

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not necessarily, without spoiling too much

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They try to work up the whole relationship thing

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
To get more sponsors, to get more perks

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In the actual games themselves

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so that's kind of why they're doing it that way

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But it's not even like that big a deal

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I wouldn't go as far as saying, oh my god it's Battle Royale

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Although I do have to say that the filmmaker

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Must have gone to the Michael Bay school of camera work

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because that shit was shaky all over the goddamn place

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I would rather you not mention that evil person's name

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh does this have to do with a certain Ninja Turtle?

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Shut up

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to make this clear too

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was not bad

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And Woody Harrelson's in it

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's always a pleasant surprise

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because Woody Harrelson's character is awesome

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Before the Battle Royale, or excuse me before, oh boy

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Before the Hunger Games fans shoot me down with a bow and arrow

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I want to talk about the Battle Royale thing

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Because I do think people are running a little far with this whole comparison thing

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because, hello, Battle Royale's like 12 years old

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's based, it's a completely different kind of book

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's very political in nature

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Of course they're going to time the re-release with what's going on here

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because of the distant similarity

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But my whole thing is that, you know, well for one

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There was what? There was Logan's run

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There was the Stephen King novel back in the 70's

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You know, there's been other stuff about this type of topic too

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And, how can you go Battle Royale and Hunger Games

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or like the same movie and Hollywood doesn't

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How can you say that?

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And turn your head away from the fact that we have this

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Julia Roberts Snow White movie

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And Chick from Twilight Snow White movie

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Coming out within literally three months of each other

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Going on over here

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
To which I hear the trailer for both were being played before the Hunger Games

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And I'm like, how can you fucking sit there and compare the Hunger Games to Battle Royale

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When this shit's going on?

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, they did not have the Mirror Mirror trailer

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But yeah, I'm well aware of Mirror Mirror

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
At first I thought they were the same movie

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm like, man, that first trailer was really dark

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But this one makes it look like a comedy

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm really confused with what's going on here

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right?

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But, uh, yeah, it's just, um, it's a little bit dark

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I mean, it's not as dark as Battle Royale

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I mean, there's killing and stuff

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And they have kind of the same stuff

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There's alliances and, you know, that kind of thing

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But I think Battle Royale is a lot darker

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean, it's a little bit similar where they, you know, pick people

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You know, fight to the death and stuff like that

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But at the same time, it's just, it's a little weird

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Gamer Girl in our chatroom says Logan's run is getting a re-release too

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And that's not really surprising

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Anything remotely resembling the Hunger Games is gonna come back

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because, again, it's the biggest non-sequel ever

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It has come to take Harry Potter's place for a few years in Hollywood as the young adult

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because ain't no one gonna admit they like Twilight

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Next year we'll see The Long Walk and then another Lord of the Flies

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's the Stephen King novel I was trying to think of

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They'll adapt that

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That shit is getting green-lit

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Then we'll get an American Battle Royale

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I hope not

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I hope not

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The next one's gonna be Andrew's Game

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's gonna be the next big one that's gonna be coming out in a year from now

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
By the way, you know, Logan's run came out the year I was born

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, really?

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wow, that's an old movie

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You set yourself up for that

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm telling you right there

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ready Player One?

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You finish that shit

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That is gonna be box office gold right there

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Here's what I really wanted to talk about

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I didn't want to be at Hunger Games podcast tonight

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What I really wanted to talk about was

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Again, biggest non-sequel ever

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And they kinda knew this was gonna happen, right?

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Where's the video game?

233
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now, before you write your emails and chatters

234
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, I'm aware of the iOS video game

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's the whole indie developer collaboration

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've played it

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's pretty sweet

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But it is a very simple game

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That is a light, tight

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I mean, it's fucking free

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And it's got a pretty cool soundtrack

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's worth looking at

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But it's not a video game based on the movie

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It wouldn't work

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How so?

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How so? Because there's not really anything you could do

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You play as a character and you go and kill other kids

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean, do they really want a killing kids video game?

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ten years ago on this show, we used to love Battle Royale

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Remember when we all first saw that movie?

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We had the paper play stuff

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And we said, there is no fucking way this movie is ever coming out in America

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They are not gonna do it

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And now they are

255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't put kids killing kids on the screen

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Not in this day and age, ten years ago

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In the wake of Columbine

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And the reason why Battle Royale is coming out

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Is because the mainstream studios wouldn't bring it out

260
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I think it's either Anchor Bay

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Or some Hong Kong movie distributor

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's actually putting it out over here

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not necessarily some mainstream

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not like Warner Brothers or Lionsgate

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or something like that

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's putting it out here

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But it wouldn't work

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's so much smaller scale

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It wouldn't really work as an action game

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Or a stealth action game

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or something like that

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Because there's only twelve

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Or twenty-four kids originally in that

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And it's just not

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Whereas Battle Royale is a little bit more free form

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's just hunting people down

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And stuff like that

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It just wouldn't really work

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now the later movies

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Or later books would work

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was just about to say

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Maybe, now without spoiling

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I understand the later books

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Are more of a

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Her against the government type of piece

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Put it very plainly like that

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So maybe that would translate better towards a video game

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah, that might work

289
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000

291
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Stan says

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I would love to see an American Battle Royale movie

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
With Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and all them assholes

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Shoot each other

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Except, wait a minute

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There wasn't a lot of shooting in Battle Royale

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There was some, but not a lot

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There was plenty of gunfire

299
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I thought most people died from explosives

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And there was some

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like I remember

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Meetsco got a hold of the thing

303
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then dude went all out with the automatic gun

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And

305
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Alright, so there were no guns in this movie

306
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Which was my complaint

307
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm like, okay

308
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Because spoiling

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, I don't know if I want to spoil

310
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't, let me read another comment from chat

311
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Derek Gage in chat says

312
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Titanic was a sequel?

313
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hold on, I said biggest opening weekend

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Remember, Titanic made all its money

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because it was number one at the box office for like

316
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What, four or five months?

317
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Because

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
A lot of people were going to see it multiple times

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll admit, I saw Titanic in the theater three times

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I didn't

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I saw it once on VHS and I wanted to kill myself

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's not that I loved Titanic

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But you have to

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I realized my dad was very into Titanic stuff

325
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Way before the movie

326
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I remember watching a National Geographic special

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I was like seven years old, way before the movie

328
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And I went to see it with him

329
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then I went to see it with some other friends in college

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because a bunch of them hadn't seen it and wanted to go

331
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then I ended up seeing it one other time

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really cheap for some reason

333
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And you know, it was

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was a good movie

335
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I won't see this 3D re-release

336
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I will not see the 3D re-release

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But it's James Cameron doing 3D

338
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That might not be bad

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't care

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So anyhow

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So you're saying the Hunger Games

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
video game didn't happen because it's not possible

343
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even though it wouldn't be good

344
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It would seem like there's all these

345
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
video game movie games that come out

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Although, not a lot lately

347
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Right? They never did a video game

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
for The Dark Knight

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Right?

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
One had been cancelled or something like that I think

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't think any had been announced for this

352
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
new Batman movie, which you think would be a perfect

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
tie-in

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Surely they've got to be doing an Avengers game, right?

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, at least not that I'm aware

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's a Facebook game

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The next movie game that they have coming out

358
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
is Madagascar 3

359
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Did the movie video game genre die?

360
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, see in the month of May

361
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You have Madagascar 3

362
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
from D3

363
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You have two from Activision

364
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Men in Black

365
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and Battleship

366
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The movie based off the board game

367
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The video game based off the movie

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
based off the board game

369
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And we will still not have our Liam Neeson

370
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
saying E5

371
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Liam Neeson's awesome

372
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My problem with the movie

373
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Spoiler!

374
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Even though it's not out yet

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He dies! And I don't fucking

376
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
care about the rest of the movie after he dies

377
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He needs to be there punching

378
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
aliens in the face

379
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Just get out of the fucking battleship

380
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He doesn't need the goddamn battleship

381
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can just punch him in the face with a goddamn broken bottle on his hand

382
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can't believe you would ruin Battleship the movie

383
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh yeah, that

384
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who cares? So what? He dies, big deal

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Honestly, Battleship the movie

386
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
is like Independence Day

387
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You look back at Independence Day

388
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I loved the movie, but it was fucking ridiculous

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It made no sense, it was just ridiculous

390
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is true

391
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But you know what? It's a fucking

392
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I saw Independence Day

393
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think the second, the third, and the fourth

394
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And maybe the fifth

395
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I saw it like four or five days in a row

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And it was great

397
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
every time

398
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Did they make a video game out of Independence Day? I don't remember

399
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, they did on the Playstation 1

400
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And it was fucking terrible

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It really was

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
AcidicVampire in chat says

403
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I hope the Battleship movie climaxes with a strategic battle

404
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
in the style of the board game

405
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Me too, that's the only way you could convince me to see it

406
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Liam Neeson and Rihanna

407
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
sit down and they go to town

408
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
on a game of Battleship

409
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't even care, I think it's gonna be awesome

410
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I mean, it's such a terrible

411
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a movie you go into and you know

412
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
what it is, it's just explosions

413
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and nonsense, that's Michael Bay for you

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Explosions and nonsense, if that's what you want

415
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
then you go see that movie

416
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And that's what I want, so I'm gonna go see that movie

417
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I'll see The Avengers because that looks awesome

418
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But I

419
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
do need to catch up on the Avenger

420
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
movies, you know, leading up

421
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
to it because I've only seen Iron Man 1

422
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have only seen, you and I are in the same boat

423
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh my gosh, you and I need to

424
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
get together and do this because

425
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I have only seen Iron Man 1, that's it

426
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I haven't seen any of the others

427
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
None of them, didn't see Thor, didn't see

428
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Captain America

429
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not that I, I'm not hating

430
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I just, seriously, last year

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I did not go to the movie, I didn't go to the movies at all

432
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
last year, you had a kid, I'm lazy

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I saw Thor, Thor was good

434
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't see the second Iron Man movie

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
because it's just pretty much

436
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr

437
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How's that a bad thing?

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Drunken asshole

439
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That Robert Downey Jr.

440
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No, that's fine, that's fine

441
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I own it, I just haven't bothered to see it yet

442
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's sort of like I wasn't excited

443
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I liked the first one

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I saw Hulk

445
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Even though it's, you know, not the same

446
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Dude, I think it's like, same universe-ish thing

447
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Which, honestly, I really wish they had had Edward Norton

448
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Really wish they had Edward Norton

449
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He was so good

450
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You met the other guy, right?

451
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, I have, he signed my Xbox

452
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But man, I, Hawkeye

453
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Black Wolf in Chat says

454
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You guys did notice in the first Battleship trailer

455
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that the bombs were in the shape of Battleship pins, right?

456
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yes, I did

457
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I didn't notice that

458
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So are there any other big movies this summer

459
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that I'm not thinking of

460
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that might have video games made out of them?

461
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Seems like there was a lot of stuff coming out this summer

462
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Um

463
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm trying to think

464
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No

465
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I honestly don't remember what the summer lineup is this year

466
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I mean, other than Batman

467
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and the new Snow White movie

468
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Which

469
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know, looks

470
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
alright, I'm gonna have to go see it though

471
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
My wife wants to see it

472
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Alright, look, we'll start to talk more about the summer stuff

473
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
when it gets closer to summer

474
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
For now, let's talk about right now

475
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
this week, the types of video games we've been

476
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
playing this week in a segment we call

477
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How Was Your Gaming Week? DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

478
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
My gaming week was

479
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
retro

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We bought Bust-A-Move 2

481
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
as in Puzzle Bobble

482
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Arcade Edition for the PlayStation

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And

484
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My husband and I actually

485
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
had a fairly even match in playing

486
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
even though I'm usually the

487
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
much better player

488
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Um

489
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We also picked up

490
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Taito Legends for PS2

491
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and so

492
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I have that on Xbox One

493
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And so a lot of this afternoon was spent with

494
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
my husband screaming at Rainbow Islands

495
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and screaming at Super Kicks

496
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and then playing the hell

497
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
out of Rastan

498
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And we also decided

499
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
that the biplane shooter

500
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Tokyo sucks

501
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And

502
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And while this wasn't

503
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
we have video games related

504
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to the series, but I have to say

505
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
that watching

506
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
the Evangelion 2.22

507
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
really is kind of depressing

508
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
but awesome

509
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Just saying

510
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Awesome, so it sounds like it was a bit of a retro day

511
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
with the Taito stuff

512
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There's a series that had its ending changed

513
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah

514
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you want to talk about

515
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
partially from fan complaint

516
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and partially from the creator wanting to

517
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
expand on it more

518
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And it made no fucking sense

519
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And guess what? They're redoing the whole thing now

520
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
in a series of movies

521
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Alright, before we get to Loki's gaming week

522
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
from the chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

523
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Some folks in the chat are naming

524
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
some other possible

525
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
titles. Tiger Claws says

526
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
maybe they should make a video game on Prometheus

527
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's supposed to be a pretty big one, right?

528
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well technically there's the

529
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
colonial marines which is coming out later

530
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
this year, so that could tie into

531
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Prometheus

532
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Infidel names one that I

533
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
particularly am looking forward to seeing

534
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter

535
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That would be pretty awesome

536
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm looking forward to that one

537
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Platinum Games putting it together, that'd be awesome

538
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Meanwhile, your gaming week, Loki

539
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So let's see, this week I didn't play a lot of games

540
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I played

541
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Call of Duty briefly

542
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
because I was only working for three days this week

543
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The rest of the time

544
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I've been just working

545
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
working in Excel

546
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why would I try to program something

547
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in Excel? Because I'm weird like that

548
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So, I like

549
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
programming it

550
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No, it's not a secret, it never was

551
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was, um, I'm making a map editor

552
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
for Grand Theft Auto IV

553
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It actually works, it's just fucking slow

554
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
because it's in Excel

555
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
In Excel

556
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How does a map editor in Excel work?

557
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Meaning you draw it out in the little cells?

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, no, no, it's like

559
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
basically it opens

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
a format, it's like a

561
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
WPL, it's a placement list or something like that

562
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You can

563
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
import stuff I make out of

564
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the Simple Native Trainer

565
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
which is a trainer in the game, you can spawn

566
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
objects, move them around, place them and stuff

567
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and you can export those to a file

568
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and dump them into this and then I can save them as

569
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the actual map files that are used by the games

570
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Huh

571
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can actually

572
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
paste the hex code in there

573
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
from, you know, you open up the file in the

574
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
hex editor and dump it in there and it'll actually

575
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
read everything and, you know, you can also save

576
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
it as that and it'll

577
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
do that fun stuff

578
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But it works, and it's weird because

579
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the editors that they have

580
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
out there now are broken, they don't really work

581
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
well, so the fact that I'm making something very

582
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
inefficiently, it works

583
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and that's all I care about, is the fact that it works

584
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Because I don't know how to program

585
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
in C Sharp or C++

586
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
or whatever, I could

587
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I could, you know

588
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
learn how to

589
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
do that, but it just, for some reason

590
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
my mind can't wrap around that, yet complex

591
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
stuff in Excel I can do that

592
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's weird, like

593
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Ridiculous formula, I mean

594
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let me put it this way, my Excel

595
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
file, I had to go, I had to convert it to

596
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the new format because I was gonna try to make it

597
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
compatible with everything else, it ended up being

598
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
75 megabytes

599
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's huge. Will it work in open office?

600
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Uh, no. Open office doesn't

601
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
really work that well for this

602
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, that was that

603
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then, kind of a weird

604
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's not weird

605
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Something I'm doing, as I mentioned before

606
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Mark Ruffalo's signed by Xbox before

607
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and a couple other people have as well

608
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, now I have this Xbox that I'm kinda

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
using, it's almost like an autograph book

610
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I get celebrities to sign it, you know

611
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know if people always consider these

612
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
people celebrities, but

613
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like, this week I had, we had a visit

614
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
from Duff Goldman

615
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
from, you know, Ace of Cakes

616
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Duff Beer? No, not Duff Beer

617
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
From Ace of Cakes, or, you know

618
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Charm City Cakes, you know, really cool guy

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So, I had him sign my Xbox

620
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He must have went like, I'm a cake maker

621
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why am I signing an Xbox?

622
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He thought it was cool. Of course, he could see the other people

623
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, he thought it was cool, I'm like

624
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh, cause he wasn't really doing

625
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
signing of stuff, and I'm like, well hey

626
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Can you sign my Xbox? He's like

627
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Sure, who else has signed this

628
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
so far? I'm like, here's Orlando Bloom

629
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Here's Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher

630
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Thornton. Christopher Thornton is kinda

631
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He's a

632
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
director, and he's not really a

633
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah, I mean, Orlando Bloom, that's

634
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
pretty awesome. That's almost like one of those like

635
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
you know, when they auction off the giant

636
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
like, you know, quilt

637
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that every celebrity under the sun has signed

638
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
for a charity, it's like you're building one of those

639
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
for like D-list celebrities

640
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, it's not even, I wouldn't consider

641
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Orlando Bloom or Mark Ruffalo, who's starring

642
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
as the Hulk in the Avengers

643
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
B-list. Whatever, fine

644
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But, I mean, it's just, I had

645
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I have signatures from a bunch of different celebrities

646
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
at my work, like a bunch of posters

647
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
but they're sitting in a pile on my desk

648
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and collecting dust, like I have

649
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
William H. Macy

650
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and I had

651
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, who the hell is

652
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Jeff Goldblum at one time

653
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
He's just, that guy is

654
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
fucking weird

655
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He is, like, you know how quirky he is

656
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and like everything, like movies and stuff

657
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He is like that in real life, he's just weird

658
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Just like this really

659
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
strange, off the wall

660
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
type guy, but you know, it's just like

661
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
stuff like that, I had

662
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Rob Schneider sign a copy of the animal

663
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I had on VHS

664
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
He was wearing a weird cowboy hat at the time

665
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
too, that was kind of funny

666
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But yeah, like, you know, we met before

667
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
he died, you know, we met

668
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Patrick Swayze

669
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So that was kind of cool

670
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I like to get pictures

671
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, yeah, I get pictures

672
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
too, but you know, I just

673
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I figured, because I like

674
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I keep my Xbox in better shape

675
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
than those posters, so the way I figured

676
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it's more of an honor to sign this

677
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Xbox than it is

678
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I can't, I mean

679
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
this guy is a big geek

680
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
He was talking about totally geeking out

681
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
at, like, LucasArts and

682
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Skywalker Ranch and stuff like that when they went

683
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and made the cake there, and, you know

684
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Did he also try to fling meatloaf at George Lucas?

685
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Hey!

686
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But, uh, you know, so

687
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I think that, I'm sure that

688
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
he plays video games, I'm sure that

689
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
he thought it was cool, so, whatever

690
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I like Derek H.'s counter about Mark

691
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Ruffalo's celebrity status, Derek H. says

692
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, Ruffalo is Bruce Banner

693
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
A few hundred computers are playing the Hulk

694
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That is true True facts

695
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
True facts, alright

696
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Fair enough

697
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Anything else you want to get out of there for your game?

698
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Ummmm

699
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I think that's all I've played

700
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No, I tried playing a little bit of the Mario

701
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Portal game, the Mario

702
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
game, and it's weird, I mean

703
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I can't play that on my laptop, because it's

704
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's an art piece Yeah, it's just

705
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It doesn't play very well with, like, a touchpad

706
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm just, I'm not

707
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
very keyboard mouse, so it's very

708
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
awkward for me to play that Oh, yeah, yeah

709
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So, it's just, um,

710
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
yeah, it's a little weird

711
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Alright, well, that's it

712
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then my gaming week, um

713
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
As I mentioned earlier, I tried that new Hunger Games

714
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
on the iPhone Sorry, sorry, sorry

715
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
One, uh, I'd like

716
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I did play one game

717
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
a lot this week, actually, I completely forgot

718
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Um, Super Stardust Delta

719
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh I love that game

720
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's actually really awesome That's right

721
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Our buddy, uh, Brad from Pod Culture

722
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yes, he hooked me up with the code, and I've

723
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
been playing the crap out of that, and it's actually

724
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
a really fun game Yeah? Because I'm thinking about

725
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
getting it It's definitely worth it

726
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's very fun I still never cashed

727
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
in my 3G thing I never

728
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
did either That feature on my Vita

729
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
has literally gone to waste, I think I have till the

730
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
31st to do something with it, or you lose it

731
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
or something like that, so I gotta make sure I get that taken care of

732
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You know, who cares

733
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I think, well, they have the GPS, though, with

734
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
the, um, 3G ones, so

735
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, that's kinda helpful, but

736
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah, I mean, I just can't use

737
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
3G, I don't know

738
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Alright, if you're finally done

739
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm done, sorry Alright, my gaming week

740
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Quickly, before I talk video games, I need to talk

741
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
board games, because I went to a board game

742
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
party yesterday, it was actually a lot of fun, and I got to

743
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
play some new board games, and one of them that I really

744
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
really really really liked was called

745
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Seven Wonders, so I'm sure some of you

746
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
board card game enthusiasts will know this game

747
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and, um, you know, not that I think

748
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
they should turn every game into an

749
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Xbox game, but some of them have worked rather

750
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
well, right? Like, um, you know, Ticket to Ride

751
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and Catan and all that, right? So,

752
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
um, I would like to see Seven Wonders

753
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
because that was, I had a lot of fun playing that game

754
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that was cool They have a game called Seven Wonders

755
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
it's just one of those, a match three games

756
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, that's not even the same thing

757
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
this is a more, it was kinda like

758
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
it actually, to me, felt, and

759
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Alan made this comment too, like, the stages

760
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
of the game are similar to, like, civilization

761
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
it's resource

762
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
collecting, and then you can kinda

763
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
head yourself into technology

764
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
or military, or

765
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
like, what I would call cultural

766
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
types of points, you know, you can kinda

767
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it's, it's either really inspired

768
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
by civilization or kinda right down that same line

769
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but you know I love Civ, so I like

770
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
this game too

771
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and, uh, some

772
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
other friends of ours came

773
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
over, we played Dominion again

774
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
which I think I've talked about that on the show, but that's a card game I really

775
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
enjoy, that would be really hard to pull

776
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
off on a console though, I think that's something you really have to play

777
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
in person because there's so many ways you can kinda mix and match

778
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the different cards and the expansions and all that

779
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
so yeah, I've been playing, like

780
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
tangible games this week

781
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
crazy, video games though

782
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
haven't been short on those

783
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
last week I talked about how I have

784
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
suddenly, just

785
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I wanna say out of the blue, but not really

786
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
like Shane from Hoard House

787
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
kinda, like, we'll just say

788
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
he berated me into playing these games

789
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
but it worked, the games are really good, Mass Effect, right?

790
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I

791
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
beat Mass Effect 1

792
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
now, I realize a lot of you might be going

793
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
yay, golf clap

794
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
for you, you beat a game that came out

795
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
five years ago, but really think about

796
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
that statement if you've been listening to Orange House Radio

797
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
for any length of time

798
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I had the attention span

799
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
to beat a game, playing it

800
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
start to finish, that is

801
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
a huge endorsement I think for the game

802
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
so yes, I beat Mass Effect, and what did I do

803
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
when I beat Mass Effect? I put in my

804
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Mass Effect 2 disc that I picked up last week for

805
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
twenty bucks, and I started on Mass Effect 2

806
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
so I'm about nine hours

807
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
into Mass Effect 2

808
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and now I'm going to go home and start

809
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Mass Effect tomorrow

810
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
yes, and now Jamie is taking my Mass Effect on Xbox

811
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and she said she's going to check it out

812
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
however, she understands

813
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
she hasn't until the time I beat

814
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Mass Effect 3 to finish

815
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it, because then I want to play Mass Effect 1

816
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
again as a renegade

817
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and as a woman, so I can have

818
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
lesbian romance

819
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm just going to start off as a woman, because I play every game as a woman

820
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
because, it's fun

821
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so

822
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
have you played Saints Row the Third yet?

823
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
me? tons

824
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
no, I haven't, because we don't have

825
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
a system that I can play it on right now

826
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
unless someone would like to lend me a copy of it

827
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
don't you have, I have the

828
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
361 from you still, right, so

829
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
you want to borrow the 361? sure

830
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
alright, I'm going to give it to her

831
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
alright, I forgot you even had it

832
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
well there you go, alright

833
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
so

834
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
yeah, I've been playing Mass Effect 2

835
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
again, I don't know

836
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
how constructive it is for me to review

837
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
a game that's about 2 or 3 years old

838
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
but, what? one question from AcidicVampire

839
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
who did you choose to bang?

840
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I did not bang anyone

841
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
in Mass Effect 1, because

842
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I am waiting for Mass Effect 3

843
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because I know who I want to bang

844
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and I know that they're not bangable until the third game

845
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so, let me put it

846
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
this way, I made a very

847
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
important choice, I'm keeping this

848
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
spoiler free, I made a very important choice

849
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
in the first game

850
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
that will set it up so that in the third game

851
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
this person will be around

852
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
for me to bang, and I will bang them

853
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
lots

854
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so that's, I'll just

855
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
leave it at that

856
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
let's see, what else

857
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
now I'm off track here, oh yeah, Mass Effect 2

858
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the game's a few years old, but

859
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it's, it's, it's really good

860
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
it's really, like the story, everything

861
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
is like, just a step up

862
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
in the storytelling and in the voice acting

863
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and everything, like it's not that the first game was bad

864
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
but the second game is just even more, I have like

865
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
laughed out loud at the game

866
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
there's a particular character I just got

867
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
into my little squad that, like, literally

868
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
made me laugh out loud with what they were saying

869
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
it was, it was, it's awesome

870
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the graphics

871
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
are a step up

872
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
they got rid of the Mako stuff

873
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
thank god, planet scanning's

874
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
a little derpy, that gets a little bit old

875
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
really fast, but whatever, the hacking's

876
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
better, the combat

877
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm still, I still have

878
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
mixed feelings on, like I know a lot of people

879
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
generally agree that combat in 2

880
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is better than combat in 1, but

881
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I will agree it's more fast paced

882
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
because you can kind of map skills to buttons

883
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
so you don't have to bring up the menu

884
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and you can kind of do things that way, but

885
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't know, like, I kind of find, I don't like the way

886
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
that, just, enemies keep coming out

887
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
in waves and waves and waves

888
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and you're kind of just, like, stuck in one spot

889
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
gunning them all down

890
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
at least that's the way I kind of find them doing it

891
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
just kind of gunning them all down until the way's finally over

892
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and you can kind of move into the next room

893
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
like, I feel like the first game kind of made you

894
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it was a little more Metal Gear in the way that

895
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the enemies didn't just run out until they actually

896
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
saw you, so I

897
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
kind of, like, it made the

898
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
conflicts a little more consistent

899
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
but don't take that

900
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
as a harsh gripe on the game, I mean, it's a

901
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
really minor bitch, it doesn't take away

902
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
from the experience of the story

903
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that I'm really, really, really enjoying

904
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
so

905
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
there you go

906
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
um, let's see

907
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
uh

908
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
what else have I been playing, what other game I want to mention

909
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
uh, on the Vita

910
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
ModNation Racers Road Trip

911
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I played on the Vita for a little bit

912
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
it's okay

913
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
you know, it is what it is, it's the

914
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
PlayStation 3 version condensed down for the Vita

915
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
the graphics and everything

916
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
are, you know, pretty good

917
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
they look like they do on the PlayStation 3

918
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
the track editor

919
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I was very impressed that it's pretty much all there

920
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you can import all the stuff

921
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
from the PlayStation, which is pretty impressive

922
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and, you know, you can, therefore

923
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
build up a pretty, pretty good library

924
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
of stuff, the only problem with

925
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
ModNation Racers is

926
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
they stripped out everything

927
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
online about the game

928
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
the only thing you can do online on the Vita

929
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
version is, like, have ghost racers

930
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and you can download other people's tracks

931
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
but you can't do races online

932
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
which is kind of an

933
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
important element of custom

934
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it's because a lot of these games

935
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
are just not able to do

936
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that's why you get a lot of this asynchronous

937
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
multiplayer garbage

938
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I mean, you can do ad hoc

939
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
in the same room, and do it that way

940
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but it just, I don't know

941
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
it really feels lacking

942
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and I'm kind of sitting here going

943
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
this racing game gets kind of basic

944
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
after you play it for a while

945
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
like, yeah, there's some interesting

946
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
power-ups and things they do, but

947
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, at the end of the day, I'm just like

948
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
this game gets kind of old

949
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
so, I mean, at least

950
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it's only 30 bucks, I rented it through

951
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I have an account with a game rental

952
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
company, and so I got it through a rental

953
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
but I think it's a worthy

954
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
rental, I don't know if I would pay 30 bucks

955
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
for it, if you really like racers

956
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm sure you're getting a lot of objects for it

957
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
through the, you know, passing

958
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I need some, check into Nier while you're here

959
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
because I need some of those objects

960
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
so, you know

961
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we're going to talk about this later, because there's a story

962
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
coming up about LittleBigPlanet

963
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Kart or whatever

964
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I kind of, you know, everyone

965
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
the trailer looks cool, but it kind of

966
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
made my heart sink when I heard

967
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
by the creators of ModNation Racism

968
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
like, ugh

969
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because their load time is fucking terrible

970
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, the load time's really bad

971
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
but see, I

972
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I was really surprised

973
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
at how much the online

974
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
piece being missing really hurt

975
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
the game, because I wouldn't call

976
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
the one on the Playstation 3 a basic bitch

977
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
tracer, because the community

978
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
element kind of saves it

979
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
because there really is just a

980
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
stronger sense of community in the Playstation

981
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
3 one, and you can really get these random

982
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
organic experiences

983
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
in the Playstation 3 one that just feel

984
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
very forced and very

985
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
vanilla on the Vita one, and that's

986
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the problem with it. I mean, it's

987
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
impressive that they otherwise got

988
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
most of the Playstation 3 one

989
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
in there, I hope

990
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
LittleBigPlanet didn't get neutered this way

991
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
but then again, LittleBigPlanet, you could

992
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
play LittleBigPlanet online, but it wasn't as

993
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
key to that game

994
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
you know, I think LittleBigPlanet Vita will be alright

995
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
See, here's my question though, is if they

996
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
if they did that, though

997
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you know, if it's really neutered, I guess

998
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
on the Vita version, do you

999
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
have the PSP version? Because I think

1000
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I got that as a PSP version

1001
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm wondering if it was neutered on there too

1002
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
or if they had

1003
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
online gameplay on the PSP one, but they're just

1004
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
like, ehhh, the Vita

1005
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
we're not gonna worry about writing netcode

1006
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
God, that's work, so let's just

1007
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
forget about it. Nah, I haven't played the

1008
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
PSP one, or if I did, it was a long time ago

1009
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
so I don't remember. Maybe they have some sort of

1010
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
weird like, stipulation where you

1011
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
can only have

1012
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
multiplayer like, um, in your

1013
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
game if you can play it over the 3G

1014
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
or something, because I know only

1015
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
right now there's two games that

1016
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
have actual, well, three games

1017
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
that actually have online multiplayer

1018
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and those are all the ones that have online passes

1019
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
the Hotshots, Golf, Wipeout

1020
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and MLB 12

1021
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
are the only games

1022
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I don't know if Unit 13 does

1023
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't think that did though

1024
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
but those are the three

1025
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and possibly four games that I know of

1026
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
right now that actually have, you know,

1027
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
multiplayer. Um, now

1028
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'll say this, I don't want to

1029
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
totally bash out Monday's Racers because I don't think

1030
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
it's a bad game necessarily, and

1031
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
we have to remember it's a launch title

1032
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and for a launch title, it's surprisingly

1033
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
decent

1034
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
you know, I say that, you know, it's a

1035
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
strong launch title for

1036
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
the Vita, but it's not as

1037
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
strong as say, Luminous

1038
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
there's some of the other choices that are out there

1039
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
um, or what also kind of

1040
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
shoots this game in the foot a little bit is that

1041
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I have to say that free MotorStorm

1042
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
game they put out last week

1043
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
it's kind of a

1044
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
better racing experience for me

1045
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I mean, maybe because it was free, but

1046
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and it was more like Ironman

1047
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
off-road racing

1048
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
which I really enjoy that style, but

1049
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
well, see, the thing is, like, I'm kind of

1050
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
embracing a little bit more of the

1051
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
online, or not even online, some of the

1052
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
digital stuff now

1053
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
um, thanks to some of these offerings

1054
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the fact that, well, the fact that the Michael Jackson

1055
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
game was free was kind of fun, but um,

1056
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
you know, the, the

1057
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
MotorStorm game is pretty awesome, and

1058
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm actually thinking of thinning out

1059
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
my collection, because I have four games right now

1060
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
in cart form, and I'm probably

1061
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
gonna, well, Lil Deviance is gone

1062
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean, that game looked like terrible, terrible shit

1063
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
um, and actually

1064
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Rayman, um, Origins

1065
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm probably gonna get rid of, because

1066
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm just not playing it, not that it's

1067
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
a terrible game, it's not a terrible game at all

1068
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
it's an awesome game, but it's just

1069
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm not finding myself playing, or

1070
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
wanting to play that game, so, I don't know

1071
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
uh, go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaundry.com

1072
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm just now catching up

1073
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
on some of the, uh, comments from chat

1074
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
AcidicVampire says, the characters

1075
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
in Mass Effect 2 are some of the best

1076
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
characters in any video game

1077
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you know what, I gotta say

1078
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
although I haven't played enough of

1079
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Mass Effect 2 to really say

1080
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that's true or that's false, I

1081
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
can see so far where that is

1082
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
probably a true statement

1083
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
because there is some strong characters in

1084
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
part 2, like even, and it's

1085
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
it's so funny I'm sitting here saying that, because

1086
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
as I keep saying this about 2, I feel like I'm

1087
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
bashing 1, but I'm

1088
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
not, it's just that 1 set the bar

1089
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
pretty high, and 2 actually

1090
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
exceeds it, in almost

1091
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
every area, so

1092
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
pretty neat

1093
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and Shane says, picks

1094
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
of Kaiden put him over to actually trying

1095
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the series out, that may or may not

1096
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
be true, just saying

1097
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I deny these allegations

1098
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
alright, that's enough about our

1099
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
gaming weeks, let's get into some gaming news

1100
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000

1120
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
let's get into gaming news, Loki

1121
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
well, there's rumors that Sony is

1122
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
shutting down one of their first party

1123
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
developers, Zipper Interactive

1124
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
who just put out the

1125
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Evita game, Unit 13

1126
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
um, they may be

1127
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
gone, um, apparently

1128
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
there's been some chatter for several days

1129
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
about an impending closure

1130
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and the possibility of cancellations

1131
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
of a current project

1132
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
of course Sony hasn't made a comment on it

1133
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and besides, you know, Unit 13

1134
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
they're of course the ones behind

1135
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SOCOM, US Navy Seals, and

1136
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
MAG, so they

1137
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
kind of know they're shooters

1138
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
but, I don't know

1139
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
maybe is this because they can't really compete

1140
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with, say, Call of Duty

1141
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
or Battlefield, maybe this is why they're

1142
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
kind of letting them go, and I don't know, restructuring

1143
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
who knows

1144
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
hmm, well

1145
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
it's never good to hear about Studios

1146
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Closing, but

1147
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I mean, wasn't SOCOM still a pretty

1148
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
strong series, or did I miss something?

1149
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Um, I don't know how well SOCOM

1150
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
4 did, um

1151
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I would have thought that they would have

1152
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
you know, tried to, well maybe

1153
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
they tried with MAG, maybe that was the whole thing

1154
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is, um, you know, they were trying to

1155
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
you know, do something with that, but

1156
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
maybe it just didn't really

1157
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
work out, also

1158
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
also, but it also is a rumor

1159
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
also, the other thing

1160
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
might have kind of hurt SOCOM 4

1161
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
was the fact that SOCOM 4 launched right

1162
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
before the whole Playstation Network

1163
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
black out there. Oh, that's right

1164
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I thought I remembered there was something

1165
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that kind of like about SOCOM 4

1166
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
that was like, iffy in the community

1167
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that's right, that's what it was

1168
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
the fact that it came out the week they took

1169
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the network down for like a month

1170
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
yeah, that probably didn't help

1171
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
no, but interesting

1172
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that all this time later, something

1173
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
happens. I'm also surprised

1174
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
if that, in spite of that, they didn't try to

1175
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
relaunch SOCOM for the holidays

1176
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
or maybe they did, and I just, you know, that's not usually

1177
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
a series I follow, so, but I

1178
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm surprised there wouldn't be like a SOCOM 4

1179
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
game of the year edition

1180
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
since that's what they're all called

1181
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
or SOCOM 4 Platinum Guns edition

1182
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
or something, that comes out at the end of the year

1183
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
to try and relaunch it. I'm surprised

1184
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
too, I mean, um

1185
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I don't know, I didn't think SOCOM 4

1186
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is a bad game, it, I think it got

1187
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
pretty good reviews, it's just

1188
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
um, I don't know

1189
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
maybe it's just not enough room right now

1190
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
maybe they're focusing on something else

1191
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
maybe, maybe, maybe they're just getting rid

1192
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
of these guys because they're going to have someone else working on SOCOM

1193
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
who knows, maybe, um

1194
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you know, I don't know who, um

1195
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you know, the team behind resistance, what

1196
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
they're working on right now, maybe they're going to be working

1197
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
on a new SOCOM game or something like that

1198
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
or kill, the team behind Killzone

1199
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
you know, maybe they're free now, because Killzone

1200
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't know, well actually

1201
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Killzone might do alright

1202
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I think that if they went the route

1203
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
of, with SOCOM that they

1204
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
did with, just recently with Killzone 3

1205
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
where they released a multiplayer

1206
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
kind of, as free and then had people play

1207
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
it and then you can, you know, kind of

1208
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
free to play almost, with uh

1209
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
you know, where you pay 15 bucks if you want to play the full

1210
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
um, or level up fully

1211
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I think that might be a way to go with SOCOM

1212
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
because, you know, actually free to

1213
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
play would be perfect for a lot of games

1214
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
but, it might help it out

1215
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
especially since people like military first person shooters

1216
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and free is an awesome

1217
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
amount of money for something

1218
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
alright, well we'll see

1219
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
what develops with that over the next

1220
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
few months, I'm sure by E3 we'll see

1221
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
what they're up to or not

1222
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
um, meanwhile over in

1223
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Xbox territory there is yet another

1224
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
arcade promotion going on

1225
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
so it seems like Xbox

1226
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Microsoft and all of them have found success

1227
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
in these, you know, summer of arcade

1228
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
what's the winner one called? Block Party

1229
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
right, so

1230
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
since it's so successful, let's do it quarterly

1231
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
let's do another one, alright, so now we have

1232
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Arcade Next starts

1233
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
on April 18th

1234
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
gotta say though, there are some pretty big

1235
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
you know, titles here, Trials Evolution

1236
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is the first one, that is actually really big

1237
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I mean, you saw what their, Trials is a big

1238
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
deal right, well yeah, but the level editor

1239
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
in this thing is like little big planet-esque

1240
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I mean, it's like, you can make all

1241
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
sorts of things, people made first person shooters

1242
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
using that level editor

1243
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Bloodforge on April 25th

1244
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Fable Heroes on

1245
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
May 2nd, now that is not the

1246
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
it's not on Rails Fable, that's the

1247
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Mario Party Fable, right? That looks alright

1248
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
it's kind of like a little bit Mario Party

1249
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
crossed with Castle

1250
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Crashers, I guess, alright

1251
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
interesting, and then

1252
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
obviously this is the huge one

1253
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the big one, May 9th, Minecraft

1254
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
is gonna be 1600

1255
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Microsoft points and

1256
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it should be noted too that because

1257
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
of the recent change in the gamerscore

1258
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
for Arcade, all of these games

1259
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
will now offer the 400 gamerscore

1260
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
it's not gonna be, cause April's the month

1261
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
they're starting that, right? So all these

1262
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
games will now have, you know, 400

1263
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
gamerscore instead of 200 available

1264
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
to you. I mean, I'd like to try

1265
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Minecraft out, you know, again

1266
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, I kinda wanna give

1267
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Minecraft a second chance, I don't really wanna

1268
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
pay 1600 points for it, only to be

1269
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
as, if I'm disappointed

1270
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
in it, but all the Xbox

1271
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
yeah, they come with demos, so I'll

1272
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
let everybody cross your fingers

1273
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that the Minecraft one's really good

1274
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
cause I wanna give it another chance

1275
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I do, so we'll see

1276
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I am kinda curious about Trials, I kinda skipped the first

1277
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
one, but it sounds interesting

1278
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
they showed another one, there was a picture I saw

1279
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
where, I think it was the devs that did

1280
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Limbo, did a level that looks

1281
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
like Limbo in Trials

1282
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That's awesome

1283
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I do wanna point out the price of the

1284
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
other games, Fable Heroes will be 800

1285
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
points, that's about 10 bucks, all the others

1286
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Evolution Bloodforge, 15 bucks

1287
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So that's the pricing for those games

1288
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Now what we haven't heard about, I have

1289
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
not heard anything about what you get

1290
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
if you buy all four games, because remember

1291
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
that was an important part of the promotion

1292
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
for Block Party and Summer of Arcade

1293
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
is like, buy all four, get

1294
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
400 points in the mail or something

1295
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
like that, right, or get 1200 points

1296
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
or get a game for free, you know

1297
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
depending on what promotion it is, but yet

1298
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm not hearing anything with this

1299
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So this is just straight up a

1300
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
send out

1301
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
a press release to all the gaming sites and get

1302
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
the games or exposure, right

1303
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Get an ad in the magazines

1304
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's still a while away, I mean they could always

1305
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
announce something, that's true, there may be something coming out

1306
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
later, even if

1307
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
it's something derpy like

1308
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
something for your, I keep wanting to say

1309
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
your me, but for your

1310
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
avatar, like a little next shirt

1311
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
or something, I mean even if they throw something

1312
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
like that in there, there'll be people that

1313
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
give it a shot just to have that

1314
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
you know, so we'll see

1315
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Not very many people, but

1316
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
there will be people

1317
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Never know, Derek H in chat

1318
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
says, does that mean Minecraft is the highest

1319
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
price Xbox Live arcade game

1320
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
ever? No, the penny arcade

1321
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
game was also $1600

1322
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I think there's a couple of those too

1323
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Well, some of them you may consider

1324
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Xbox Live Arcade and some you may not

1325
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Remember, some games are released not as

1326
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Xbox Live Arcade, but as actually

1327
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
those games on demand because they don't fit

1328
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
within the

1329
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
you know, constraints of the file size

1330
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
True, and one could argue that

1331
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
you know, a game that didn't get

1332
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
released here, like wasn't there that Japanese

1333
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
import shooter that you could

1334
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
only get through on demand

1335
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Right? Well, there was

1336
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
original Crysis, two Crysis I think

1337
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
it was HD or something like that, they had

1338
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
come out, I don't remember if that was

1339
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
20 bucks, I think it was at least 20 bucks

1340
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, but I mean

1341
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
if you wanna count just strictly what's

1342
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
in the category of XBLA

1343
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
then it ties for most

1344
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
expensive game ever, yes

1345
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Don't get me wrong, they're probably gonna try to

1346
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
inch that up a little bit, but

1347
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, there might be DLC that'll bump it

1348
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
up a little, especially in a game like Minecraft

1349
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
it's possible

1350
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the question is, will they go there?

1351
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So, alright, let's move on

1352
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Dark Sakura

1353
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, we've discussed this till we

1354
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
were blue in the face, but

1355
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Effect 3

1356
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We don't like the ending

1357
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well

1358
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
BioWare's listening

1359
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I don't know why, but they're listening

1360
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and

1361
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the co-founder Ray

1362
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
and I always mispronounce his name, Musica

1363
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
has said that they are

1364
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
actually going to work to

1365
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
answer those open-ended questions and give

1366
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
closure to the fans

1367
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and describe

1368
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the fan feedback as

1369
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
incredibly painful

1370
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So basically everyone

1371
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
bitched and they're putting out some DLC

1372
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
to

1373
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I guess expand more on

1374
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
the ending, but he's saying

1375
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and this is a quote, our first instinct is to defend

1376
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
the work and point out the high ratings offered

1377
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
by critics, let you critics know

1378
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
but out of respect to our

1379
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
fans, we need to accept the criticism

1380
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and feedback with humility

1381
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So they're basically

1382
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
they're like, uh, well

1383
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
sorry you didn't like it, we're not gonna

1384
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
change that much about it, but maybe you'll like this

1385
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's

1386
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
what I can tell

1387
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I guess the only thing

1388
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
to do is wait and see

1389
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I think it's a terrible idea

1390
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I've calmed down

1391
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
a little bit on the idea

1392
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I still don't think this excuses

1393
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
certain behaviors of certain people

1394
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
on the internet, namely those that are

1395
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
harassing the employees of BioWare

1396
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
that's totally fucking unacceptable

1397
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I don't give a fuck how much you've spent

1398
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
or invested in the Mass Effect series

1399
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
some of the vile shit I've read on the

1400
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
internet about the creators of the

1401
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
games, like seriously

1402
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
fuck off

1403
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
those people need to

1404
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and I mean this

1405
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
they need to get a life

1406
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
like, they literally need a life

1407
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and the guy

1408
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
who took it to the government and all this

1409
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
stuff, that was ridiculous

1410
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
the whole, I don't think this is on the show

1411
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
roll later, so the whole using

1412
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Child's Play

1413
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I think went a little bit far

1414
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I think maybe somebody was good intentioned

1415
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
with that whole thing, but at the end

1416
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
of the day, people were calling Child's Play

1417
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
saying, how much do I have to donate

1418
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
to get the ending changed?

1419
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And Child's Play's like, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

1420
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
whoa

1421
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
What are we here?

1422
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Are we an organization that's supposed to

1423
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
help you get

1424
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
your beef with game publishers

1425
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
resolved? Or are we an organization

1426
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
trying to bring joy into sick children's

1427
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
lives? And so they

1428
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
came out with a clarification that if you do a

1429
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
fundraiser for Child's Play, Child's Play

1430
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
is the cause, there is to be no

1431
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
other cause, Child's Play is the cause, and I say

1432
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
bravo to that

1433
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Now

1434
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'm not as harsh on that because I realize there might

1435
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
have been good intentions there

1436
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
but unfortunately some people

1437
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
aren't smart

1438
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I don't know how else to put it

1439
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But like what you just said

1440
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and this is why I'm

1441
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
just scared of what this kind of

1442
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
precedent says. How much money do I

1443
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
have to pay for them to change the ending?

1444
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And that right there

1445
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
How much money do I have to pay for them to

1446
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
change the ending? Really? Are people

1447
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
actually asking that question? Funny enough

1448
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Go ahead, Jamie. I was gonna say

1449
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
that right there is America

1450
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And I was gonna say, funny enough,

1451
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Loki, that's the part where

1452
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I become okay with this because although I've been

1453
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
bashing all these things, I realize the vast

1454
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
majority of people out there

1455
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that, you know, probably went to go

1456
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
click like on the page or have said a nasty

1457
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
tweet about, God that ending sucked or whatever

1458
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I realize the vast majority of those people

1459
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
aren't, like, insane, like some of the

1460
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
other people I just mentioned

1461
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
But, you know, if they're gonna

1462
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
put it out there, like, if BioWare does

1463
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
a DLC ending, I will buy it and I will

1464
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
support it, I'm kinda like

1465
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
alright, then fine

1466
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
At least you'll have the choice

1467
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
if you want to invest that money or not

1468
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And it's like, if people want to buy it

1469
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
then fine. It's a weird

1470
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
weird precedent, and we were just

1471
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
talking about this a little bit with Bobby before us

1472
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
here tonight, and I was mentioning

1473
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
about Final Fantasy 7

1474
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
A lot of people hated that ending

1475
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
too, and if that game came out today

1476
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
a lot of people were probably doing the same thing

1477
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Like, wow, two of the characters were just fucking

1478
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
missing in the ending. But, once again

1479
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
though, it's so what that ending had

1480
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So what if it was a terrible ending for Final Fantasy 7?

1481
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
People bought Final Fantasy 8

1482
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
People bought Final Fantasy 9

1483
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
People bought Final Fantasy 10, they bought 10 too

1484
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
They probably bought 11

1485
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
They bought 12, they bought 13

1486
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Did it really hurt

1487
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
the sales of those because they didn't like the game?

1488
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Now, Loki, nobody bought Final Fantasy 11

1489
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, don't send the hate mail

1490
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But there were a lot of Final Fantasy

1491
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
fans that did

1492
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
reject 11, but there were enough that embraced

1493
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
it that gave us 14

1494
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
When that shit goes free to play

1495
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
When that shit goes free to play, watch how many

1496
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
fans reject that

1497
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Anyway, back to the topic here

1498
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
DLC is something

1499
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
that is in the industry now

1500
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
that we didn't have so many years ago

1501
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and in a way, EA being

1502
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
one of the biggest DLC whores

1503
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
in this industry, kinda

1504
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
has themselves to blame for this mindset

1505
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that they can fix the ending

1506
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
through a patch, or they can fix the ending through

1507
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
DLC. EA kind of

1508
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
invented that mess

1509
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Well, maybe they didn't invent it, but they perfected

1510
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
it, let's say. They did start the

1511
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
online pass, did they not?

1512
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So they've figured out how to milk all the extra

1513
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
dollars for a video game, so in that capacity

1514
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
EA kinda has

1515
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
themselves to blame for the fan backlash

1516
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
because if this were 10 years ago

1517
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
fans wouldn't be saying

1518
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
this because there wouldn't really be anything they could do

1519
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
about it. They would have to just, you know,

1520
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
write on their live journals

1521
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I don't like the ending. What they should do is just fucking

1522
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
shut the hell up, and

1523
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
get over it, because you know why?

1524
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They're like, oh, well I spent

1525
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
how many hours playing this

1526
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
series, and I'm so

1527
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
disappointed at the ending. Fuck you!

1528
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
The developers spent how many fucking years

1529
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
putting these games together for you?

1530
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You know, what about

1531
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
their time? Well,

1532
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
devil's advocate, I'm not

1533
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
agreeing or disagreeing with you, but just to give you another perspective

1534
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
that's on the internet, there's a lot of talk on the

1535
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
internet that the ending was changed at the last

1536
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
minute, and that the writers of

1537
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
the original ending were basically shafted

1538
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
because I guess there was a leak

1539
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
that had ruined it, or I mean

1540
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I wasn't following the Mass Effect series then, so I don't know

1541
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
much about this, I'm just hearing it second hand,

1542
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
but I guess there was a leak that spoiled the first ending

1543
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
so the creator kind of

1544
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
made this new ending

1545
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
if the

1546
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
internet is to be believed, literally pulled it

1547
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
out of his ass, and that's the ending

1548
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
we have, because they wanted

1549
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to get back at the spoiled leak, I

1550
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
guess.

1551
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1552
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Just saying.

1553
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And also, like, I take, you know,

1554
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I have a problem with the fact that

1555
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
all these people hate it, and

1556
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
like, you know, the game reviews and stuff, and granted, everyone

1557
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
is, you know,

1558
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
open to their own opinion, but

1559
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
a lot of the game reviews have been really positive

1560
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
for it. I didn't hear anyone

1561
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
saying- Why's there not letting a 15 minute ending, or

1562
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
even if it's an hour ending, ruin

1563
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
what is otherwise- Exactly!

1564
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's how everybody should take it, instead of just

1565
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
being so god damn focused on

1566
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
the last 15 minutes of the game.

1567
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Sg100Matt has some pretty strong words in our chatroom

1568
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
at chat.orangelandraday.com

1569
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Let the artist paint the picture and write the

1570
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
image they want. Gamers aren't

1571
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
entitled to nothing. Just sit back and enjoy

1572
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
the ride. If you don't like the ride, get the fuck

1573
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
off it. Exactly! And you don't have to

1574
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
purchase the next game, but see, I think that's why they did it.

1575
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Two reasons. One, so they could possibly

1576
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
sell more DLC, because, you know,

1577
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the publisher's like, yeah, yeah, you

1578
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
should make a new ending. We'll give you a little

1579
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
bit of money, and we're gonna make a lot of money in

1580
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
return. And it, you know, appeases

1581
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
the fans so that when Mass Effect 4

1582
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
comes out, because you know there will be a Mass Effect 4,

1583
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that they will buy it.

1584
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I just think this whole sense of entitlement

1585
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
thing that's going on in this country

1586
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
is probably the most ridiculous thing

1587
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
to ever happen. It's a truly

1588
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
modern phenomenon, and

1589
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
people really need to get over themselves

1590
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and realize that, you know,

1591
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
it not being what you want

1592
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
or not getting what you want doesn't mean

1593
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
that it's a complete affront to you

1594
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
in particular. You know, that it's

1595
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
they're doing this on purpose!

1596
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You know.

1597
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Stop being a baby.

1598
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
If people are suggesting that they would

1599
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
troll the fans because

1600
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
one of the endings leaked, that doesn't

1601
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
make any sense at all, because

1602
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
if there's a leak coming from your company,

1603
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
it's from within your company. Why would

1604
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
you, well damn those fans, they

1605
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
know my ending, I'm gonna make a terrible ending

1606
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
instead! That'll show them, they'll

1607
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
see that it's completely different and that

1608
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
there's no possible way that it was a leak.

1609
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean, that makes no sense.

1610
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
That sounds like fanboy speculation.

1611
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It's going to be interesting very

1612
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
much to see the impact that this has

1613
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
on an inevitable Mass Effect 4.

1614
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And yes, fans, I realize

1615
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
that apparently they have

1616
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
said there's not gonna be any more Mass Effect,

1617
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
but seriously, you

1618
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
can fucking believe that, seriously.

1619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah, there wasn't gonna be any

1620
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
more Halo after Halo 3 either.

1621
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You know, they'll

1622
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
find a way to do Mass Effect 4.

1623
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It may not be called Mass Effect 4.

1624
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The series will

1625
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
continue. It's too fucking big

1626
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
to not.

1627
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It might not be Bioware, so you

1628
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
may really not want it to happen, but it'll happen.

1629
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Somebody will do it.

1630
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So, anyhow,

1631
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
why don't we move on?

1632
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
We can probably talk about this all night, and I'm sure we'll

1633
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
get some emails and calls on it later.

1634
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Mailbag at orangeonshady.com if you want to send your

1635
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
thoughts, or we'll open up the phones later in the show.

1636
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But for now, how about some more stories? Loki.

1637
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, so, Disney

1638
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Interactive announced Disney's epic Mickey 2.

1639
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The Power of 2.

1640
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Um...

1641
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I was really hoping for The Power of Love, but

1642
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
you know, that's...

1643
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It sounds like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.

1644
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The Power of 2.

1645
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The Power of 2.

1646
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Um, you know, as all the

1647
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
kind of, um,

1648
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
rumors were, uh, it actually

1649
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
is gonna feature both Mickey Mouse

1650
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

1651
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And, um, Oswald's

1652
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
gonna be AI controlled. Um,

1653
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
of course,

1654
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
when other people are not around. Otherwise, it's, you

1655
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
know, I guess it's jump-in

1656
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
co-op, so that's kinda cool.

1657
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And then it will also be on PlayStation

1658
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
3 and Xbox 360

1659
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
on top of the Wii version, and the

1660
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
PS3 version is supposed to support the move, which makes sense

1661
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I mean, because they're just gonna port the controls over from the Wii

1662
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
onto the PS3 version.

1663
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Um, it looks neat.

1664
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I watched the trailer for it. I mean, I didn't play the

1665
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
original game, which is kind of, you know, a fault

1666
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
on my part, because it looked

1667
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
like a pretty awesome game. Um, maybe

1668
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I'll check it out, you know, on the 360

1669
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
when it comes out. Um, I'm just glad

1670
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Disney Interactive is making something, because

1671
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
for a while there, they didn't have anything since

1672
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
like, Disney Universe, and I was like,

1673
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
damn, did they just go away or something?

1674
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I mean, I was getting worried,

1675
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
but, um, well,

1676
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
yeah, they had, uh, the split second

1677
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
was, uh, is that?

1678
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah, the split second was the Disney game.

1679
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And that studio got

1680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
obliterated, didn't it?

1681
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yeah, that's unfortunate. There's another movie

1682
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
tie-in game, Brave, has a movie coming up.

1683
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay, but you know,

1684
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I expect the kiddie games

1685
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
to all get tie-ins. Those are usually the first

1686
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
ones to have, like, the movie tie-in.

1687
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Well, there wasn't really anything for Twilight, unless you count

1688
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
the scene at Twilight. Konami, way

1689
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
to go, Konami. What in the fuck

1690
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
would a Twilight video game be? Seriously,

1691
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I f- I can't believe

1692
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I'm about to admit this on the radio, but I

1693
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
saw Breaking Dawn Part 1, it's the only

1694
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Twilight movie I've seen. In my

1695
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
defense, in my

1696
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
defense, put the hate mail down, in my

1697
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
defense, it was with Rift

1698
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Tracks, which I think is the only- It was a party we hosted.

1699
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It was the only tolerable way to see. It is the

1700
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
only way to see those movies. But my

1701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
God.

1702
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Where was the plot in that movie?

1703
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It was literally, like, 30

1704
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
minutes of them fucking and

1705
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
being on the beach, and like,

1706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I love you, and I love-

1707
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
we're gonna be together, and

1708
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm like, oh my God,

1709
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
people paid a lot of money to see this in the

1710
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
theater. You would pay $50

1711
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for a video game for Breaking

1712
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Dawn Part 1? The fuck

1713
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
would you do? I would love

1714
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
to see a game that was controlled

1715
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
very much like Dragon's Lair.

1716
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It was just, like, left to right.

1717
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Be emo

1718
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
to the left. Be emo to the right.

1719
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Sulk

1720
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
to the right. Sulk to

1721
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
the left.

1722
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Sparkle. Prevent

1723
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
this wedding from becoming her hallucination

1724
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
by pressing A repeatedly

1725
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
to stop them from turning into vampires. I think it would

1726
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
be kind of funny. I mean,

1727
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
someone has to have the sense of humor to do that.

1728
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Ugh.

1729
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Anyhow.

1730
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Oh, and the 3DS

1731
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is getting the version as well.

1732
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Power of Illusion, which made me think of

1733
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Castle of Illusion, so maybe

1734
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that's a good sign?

1735
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Um, that is interesting.

1736
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Epic Mickey. We've known about

1737
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
this for a while from some of the leaks. I know we've

1738
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
talked about it on the show before, but putting

1739
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
all that aside, are we

1740
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
surprised it's actually happening?

1741
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Or no? Because Epic Mickey-

1742
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It sold well. Yeah? Yeah.

1743
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I guess maybe for those of us that

1744
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
focus more on our 360s. It had a lot of neat

1745
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
stuff in it. It did. I'm not saying it was

1746
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
a bad game, but the Wii

1747
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
only thing really kept it away from the hardcore.

1748
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah, and see, that's kind of

1749
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
that I think was the reason why

1750
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I didn't play the game, was remember the original

1751
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
concept art for, you know,

1752
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Epic Mickey, where it's gonna be

1753
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
really fucking twisted and dark. It was like

1754
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
if, you know, not necessarily

1755
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Tim Burton, but like, you know,

1756
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Guillermo del Toro, like,

1757
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
put out a version of Mickey Mouse that was

1758
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
like fucking

1759
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
the game, right there. It was just

1760
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
really crazy and steampunk and all

1761
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
this stuff. And then we got the version that

1762
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
came out in the Wii, and they just kind of like

1763
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
you know, kind of washed all that-

1764
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I mean, there was still a lot of dark stuff in there,

1765
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
but it wasn't anywhere near like this

1766
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
adult Mickey game that was supposed

1767
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
to be coming out. It was kind of like, oh, it's

1768
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Mickey saving the land. Well, you can't

1769
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
have a truly adult

1770
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Mickey game. Well, why

1771
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
can't you have a- okay, let's put it

1772
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
this way. Not an adult game, but a very

1773
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
very dark, dark, dark,

1774
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
dark, dark Mickey game. I think Epic

1775
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Mickey's about as dark as you're gonna get.

1776
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But, you know, it's the Disney image.

1777
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You don't want to associate Disney

1778
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
with dark things. And I'm

1779
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
talking the company and Mickey Mouse as a whole.

1780
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Disney does some

1781
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
dark-ish- I mean, you could call

1782
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Alice in Wonderland a little bit dark.

1783
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Tron even is a little bit dark. Well, Kingdom

1784
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Hearts kind of goes a little bit dark with stuff.

1785
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But even Kingdom Hearts is a little bit kitty.

1786
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And I don't- I love Kingdom Hearts.

1787
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But I'm just saying, like,

1788
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
touching on more of, like, you know, just having

1789
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
the stuff be all really twisted.

1790
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Anything that's dark that comes out of Disney

1791
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
really comes from Touchstone or

1792
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
whatever their movie arm is. You know, they-

1793
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Fine. Buena Vista or whatever it's called.

1794
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
We'll just have it produced by Touchstone Interactive

1795
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
or whatever. Make up a company.

1796
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Who knows? Who knows?

1797
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Alright, um, I-

1798
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'm glad they're doing PlayStation 3

1799
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
and Xbox as well.

1800
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I think it'll be- you know, because the Wii-

1801
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
The Wii's on its way out, especially with

1802
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Wii U coming out this year. I'm glad they're

1803
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
stepping it up to the other systems. It really is

1804
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
on its way out. I mean, there's literally

1805
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
hardly any games coming out at all

1806
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
for the Wii. Oh god, worse.

1807
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
A page right out of the

1808
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
23rd Magus Jokes book. You ready for this one?

1809
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Brad from Pod Culture in chat

1810
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
says, adult Mickey?

1811
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Are you fucking goofy?

1812
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
At least they got his main laugh.

1813
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

1814
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
If you want to, uh-

1815
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Uh, Ray Genator

1816
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
in our chatroom says, Sky, please tell us

1817
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
you were either drunk and or high

1818
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
when you saw Twilight. No, I was- I was

1819
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
neither drunk nor high. I was

1820
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
fat. I was eating pizza

1821
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
at the time, so I was fat.

1822
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
But I was not drunk or high.

1823
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Do you think pizza

1824
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
contains things that'll get you wasted?

1825
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I don't know. Alright.

1826
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Twilight, even

1827
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Riff Trax couldn't make that movie

1828
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
good.

1829
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I have friends

1830
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
that love it. They swear

1831
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
it's only for the guilty pleasure. You should really question your friendship

1832
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
with them. No, no, because they're close

1833
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
friends of mine, but it's like, oh my god.

1834
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Alright, you know what? I have my things

1835
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
too. Not everybody understands Rocky Horror

1836
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Picture Shows, so whatever. Rob, I like

1837
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Xanadu. Yeah, you are

1838
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
a little weird. Shut up!

1839
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Just being honest.

1840
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Alright. I'd like

1841
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
to- speaking of Xanadu,

1842
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
you know, some of the animation in Xanadu was done

1843
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
by the guy who made this game. Yep, Don Bluth.

1844
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Dragon's Lair.

1845
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Dragon's Lair's coming to Xbox Live Arcade!

1846
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And I think a lot of us, when we

1847
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
hear that, stop for a minute and say,

1848
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
oh, it isn't on Xbox Live

1849
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Arcade. It's like the one fucking platform

1850
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Dragon's Lair isn't on. Because I could

1851
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
get it on- oh god, I could

1852
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
get it on DVD,

1853
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Blu-ray,

1854
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I could get it on my iPhone,

1855
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I could get it on the PlayStation. Sega CD.

1856
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
This game has

1857
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
been on everything CD-based.

1858
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
However, when the early versions were out,

1859
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
the best version was on the CD-i.

1860
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Why is that? Because it was the full version.

1861
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I didn't realize the other ones were cut down.

1862
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah, the Sega CD one

1863
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
especially was missing scenes and everything.

1864
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh wow, I guess they maybe couldn't fit it.

1865
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, I doubt this one will be missing scenes or

1866
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
whatever, but the Xbox Live Arcade

1867
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
is getting a version, and there was kind of a

1868
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
leak that let people know that

1869
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Dragon's Lair was on its way out.

1870
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But Digital Leisure, who

1871
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
is publishing the game,

1872
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
kind of gave away a

1873
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
little surprise about this.

1874
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This isn't just Dragon's Lair

1875
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
as you would normally play Dragon's

1876
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Lair, but you can also

1877
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
play with Kinect.

1878
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Think about that for a minute.

1879
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Dragon's Lair came out

1880
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
in what, 84, 83?

1881
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It was definitely the early 80s when this game came out, right?

1882
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
They've gone back to this

1883
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
game that's damn near 30 years old

1884
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and put Kinect in it.

1885
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
There's

1886
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
several ways you can look at this. You can go

1887
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
well, I mean, they've put it out

1888
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
so many other times they had to do

1889
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
something new to it. Or you

1890
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
could look at it and go, they're

1891
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
ruining my childhood in

1892
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
front of my eyes.

1893
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
How do you feel about this?

1894
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I especially want to know Dark Soccer

1895
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
because you like Dragon's Lair. What do you think about

1896
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Kinect support? I'm indifferent

1897
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
about it because I'm not going to buy it.

1898
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Seriously, how many other versions

1899
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
of Dragon's Lair do I own?

1900
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You know,

1901
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
it kind of would be like

1902
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
for all the people who like...

1903
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Actually, I can't

1904
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
think of a

1905
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
benefit on this.

1906
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You know, people who may not

1907
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
be able to use a controller

1908
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
or

1909
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
maybe people with no arms.

1910
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
They can use their feet.

1911
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Well, to be fair, you would have

1912
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to, like some of the motions they're talking about are

1913
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
raising your hand up to grab the rope.

1914
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So unless you can trick the Kinect to think your foot

1915
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
is your hand, which maybe is possible,

1916
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
or use something else.

1917
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I don't know. You're right. There could be somebody with

1918
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
a disability where they can't use a controller.

1919
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But

1920
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I don't know how many

1921
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
people would fit into the category of

1922
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
can't use a controller can use these Kinect commands.

1923
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Maybe they have no hands.

1924
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Maybe they're

1925
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
missing fingers. Now you're stretching.

1926
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Well, I'm just saying that

1927
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
they put it out there for a reason.

1928
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Someone's gonna probably like it

1929
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and pay for it. Not me.

1930
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I just don't care.

1931
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Let them do whatever they want

1932
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
to with it. It's not costing me any money.

1933
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com.

1934
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Stan in our chat room says, oh no, does that mean you can put

1935
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
your face on that guy's face?

1936
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Dirk the Daring, you mean?

1937
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Let's hope not.

1938
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Let's really hope not.

1939
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Hackdeft says,

1940
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Dragon's Lair plus

1941
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Kinect. Why did they think this was a good

1942
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
idea? I don't know.

1943
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I guess they're...

1944
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Props to them trying to do something new.

1945
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That's about the nicest thing I can say.

1946
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
They're trying to make it a party game, a social

1947
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
game. I mean, cause it's

1948
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Dragon's Lair. You gotta do something

1949
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
to... Oh yeah, when I think party, I think

1950
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
bust out Dragon's Lair.

1951
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Well, depends on what kind of friend you have.

1952
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I guess that's true. I mean, it's just, they're

1953
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
just trying to mix it up. You don't have

1954
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
to play it that way. They're not forcing

1955
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
you to use Kinect in this game, so

1956
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
who cares? It's an additional feature.

1957
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Why are you complaining about additional features?

1958
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
If you think it's stupid, you don't have to use it.

1959
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Alright, let's move

1960
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
on with some more gaming news. So, release dates

1961
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and Classic Game of the Week are still coming up, but first,

1962
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Dark Sakura.

1963
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I got your news. I got your news

1964
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
right here. Um,

1965
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
apparently exposure to Violet video games

1966
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
has been linked to aggressive behavior.

1967
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Warning. Shut up!

1968
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Well, it's not true, but still.

1969
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, there is

1970
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
another bill

1971
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
that wants to

1972
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
label any game

1973
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
that's E or

1974
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
higher than exposure

1975
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
to Violet video games has been linked to aggressive

1976
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
behavior. E or higher?

1977
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That would be all games.

1978
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
That would be almost, like, I can

1979
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
think of maybe, like,

1980
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
two games that

1981
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
had the Y, the youth rating on it.

1982
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, that's old. It's EC nowadays.

1983
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Whatever. Whatever it is,

1984
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I can think of maybe two games.

1985
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Well, this

1986
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
was sponsored by, uh,

1987
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Frank Wolf, who is

1988
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
the, uh, Republican representative for Virginia.

1989
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So, people in Virginia remember

1990
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
who not to vote for.

1991
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And Joe Baca,

1992
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
who is a California

1993
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Democrat, people in California,

1994
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
don't vote for this guy.

1995
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Um, who basically

1996
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
wants, they call it the Violence

1997
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and Video Games Labeling Act.

1998
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And, I mean, basically,

1999
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
they've done this before. They did it in 2009,

2000
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
which was for T and up.

2001
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
They're just not giving up.

2002
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And it's already been proven to be unconstitutional.

2003
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So, I don't know what they're

2004
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
thinking. You know, there's a

2005
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
saying that doing

2006
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
the same thing multiple times

2007
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
in a row and expecting different results

2008
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
is insanity.

2009
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Well,

2010
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
they're insane.

2011
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
People, don't vote for them.

2012
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I just, it's

2013
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
kind of insulting in a way.

2014
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Because it's like, have these guys ever played a

2015
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
video game in their life? Because

2016
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
really, like, you're talking E-rated

2017
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
video games. So, like,

2018
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I don't know. I'm trying to look at some of

2019
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the games I have over there that are rated E.

2020
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Bloom Blocks

2021
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
is gonna lead to aggressive behavior. Fucking

2022
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
blocks! You know, I will say this

2023
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Mass Effect 2 led to some aggressive behavior last night.

2024
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You should have seen me playing some Bust-A-Move earlier.

2025
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Super Mario Brothers Wii

2026
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
will lead to aggressive behavior.

2027
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Imagine

2028
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
babies. Forza. Sing Star Abba

2029
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
will lean to aggressive behavior.

2030
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Forza. Well, here, basically,

2031
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
this is what they said about the last

2032
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
time they tried to do this.

2033
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Is that, basically,

2034
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
that the Supreme Court

2035
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
found all of the data lacking

2036
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and unpersuasive.

2037
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And really, even these own studies,

2038
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
if you go and read them, they contradict themselves

2039
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
because they also bring up

2040
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
that violent movies,

2041
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
or any movie,

2042
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
causes the same reaction in a child

2043
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
already predisposed

2044
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
towards it. It has just as much

2045
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
influence as a movie, as a

2046
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
book, as songs, as anything

2047
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
audio-visual.

2048
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So, this guy's just, these

2049
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
men are, they're clearly insane.

2050
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That's the only thing that can say it.

2051
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Again, doing the same thing over and over

2052
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and expecting different results is insanity.

2053
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
On a tangent here for a minute,

2054
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
speaking of politicians who don't understand

2055
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
video games, did you hear the latest in the

2056
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Lee Lin Yi saga? Oh, what?

2057
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
He,

2058
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
well, this is, this is actually, this is the interesting

2059
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
thing, is that this is a bill that you look at and go,

2060
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
yes, we do need this.

2061
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Remember, Lee Lin Yi was the guy in California,

2062
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I want to say Democrat out of

2063
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
San Francisco, who was trying to pass

2064
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the bill on violent video

2065
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
games not being able to be

2066
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
sold at the store,

2067
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
but it was

2068
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
very vague as to what made a violent video game

2069
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
because it didn't tie into ESRB or whatever,

2070
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and, you know, blah, blah, blah. They lost

2071
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
at the Supreme Court level. State spent like a

2072
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
million bucks defending this law that the dude wrote.

2073
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
We're all sitting here saying, vote his ass out,

2074
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
right? Because that's, he didn't win

2075
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
mayor of San Francisco, so they didn't get

2076
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
elected for that, but

2077
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
he wrote a bill this week that

2078
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
actually you look at and go, okay, now that

2079
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
makes sense. That's technology he does

2080
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
understand. He authored a bill in California

2081
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
which will make it illegal

2082
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
for employers to ask you for your

2083
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Facebook password, because you might

2084
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
have been hearing the stories this week, the

2085
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
nightmare stories about people that went into job interviews,

2086
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and the interviewees were like, okay,

2087
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
log into Facebook for me

2088
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
so I can check out what you're really like.

2089
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And everybody's like, wow, that's an

2090
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
invasion of privacy. Employers shouldn't be

2091
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
able to do that. And so, yeah,

2092
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
you know, Facebook has come out and said, don't do it.

2093
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And now Lee Lin is going to make it illegal

2094
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
in California. And I was kind of like, well, that's

2095
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
a smart man. Oh, wait, no,

2096
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
it's him. He's,

2097
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
he's all right. Gotta read the fine text

2098
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and I'm sure he's got violent video games

2099
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
stuff. It might be getting in there. You're gonna look for it.

2100
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
You know, I actually posted

2101
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
a comic on my Tumblr

2102
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
yesterday that was

2103
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
a woman that in interviews is like, okay,

2104
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
well, you've passed all of this. Now,

2105
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
let me see your Facebook. She's like, let me see

2106
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
yours.

2107
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh, yeah. That's what I would say, too. I probably wouldn't

2108
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
get the job, but would you want to work for a company

2109
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
that does that? I don't know. It's tough because

2110
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
in this day and age, people really, really

2111
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
need jobs. And it's kind of

2112
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
gross. It's just gross that

2113
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
employers are exploiting that. It's

2114
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
gross. I think employers

2115
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
that do that should be called out. I think

2116
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
we should have a list of employers that are

2117
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
violating the privacy of their employees.

2118
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And create two Facebook pages.

2119
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I know.

2120
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I know, right? Or just say, I don't have one.

2121
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
They won't believe you.

2122
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
They won't believe you. They'll search for you, but

2123
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
if you use a fake name on the internet,

2124
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
it'll be hard to find.

2125
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And honestly, anyone can read my

2126
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Facebook page. I don't care. Don't post anything

2127
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
private on there anyways. I don't care. I mean,

2128
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
my mother and my rabbi are on my

2129
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Facebook. So, really.

2130
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But you can see where not everybody would want

2131
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
their employers on their Facebook. You know what I mean?

2132
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It's just, for me, it's a private

2133
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, I have co-workers on

2134
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Facebook, but it's, you know, my choice.

2135
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I don't want him on my Facebook either

2136
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
because I just don't want him

2137
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't want to talk to him on Facebook.

2138
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't really care.

2139
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Alright, anyhow.

2140
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Let's move on with some release dates. We're going to travel

2141
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
around the world and check out what is coming out

2142
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
in a gaming store near you. We'll start with the

2143
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
US. Ah, slowing down a bit.

2144
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Go, go crazy bones on the

2145
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Nintendo DS. I'm sure that was delayed to this

2146
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
week. Melee to aggressive

2147
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
behavior. Those crazy bones.

2148
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Damn them. Supremacy

2149
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
MMA for the Playstation Vita.

2150
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That's coming out this week

2151
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
as well. Myst

2152
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
on the 3DS. It's in 3D

2153
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
and it's Myst.

2154
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Yay. That game's awesome

2155
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
fifteen years ago. You know, I have a

2156
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
parody of that game called Pissed. I remember

2157
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
that, actually. Yeah.

2158
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I never played it. I just thought it was funny. And I

2159
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
can guarantee that there's a hundred percent more

2160
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Myst in that game than there is in the

2161
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Silent Hill HD collection.

2162
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I

2163
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
see what you did there. Country Dance

2164
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
All Stars for Kinect.

2165
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Dance

2166
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
to country music.

2167
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Warriors Orochi 3 on

2168
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Xbox 360.

2169
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And then Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13

2170
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
on Playstation 3 and Xbox

2171
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
360 this week, including collector's

2172
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
editions if you really need a collector's

2173
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
edition for a golf game.

2174
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Sure, why not. The Capcom

2175
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Digital Collection on Xbox 360, which is a

2176
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
collection of Xbox Live Arcade games that are already

2177
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
out there.

2178
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And maybe

2179
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
or maybe not this week because

2180
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
no one seems to have the answer for it. Ridge

2181
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Racer Unbounded possibly coming

2182
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
out this week. Possibly delayed to who knows

2183
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
when. Because even Namco doesn't

2184
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
know. So

2185
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
possibly this week.

2186
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Alright. Going to

2187
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Japan. Are we good to go to Japan now?

2188
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Alright. So going to Japan. Yay! We're going to Japan.

2189
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
On the Nintendo 3DS

2190
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Japan this week. Probably a

2191
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
big release some of you might care about.

2192
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
This might be worth importing to some of you.

2193
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop

2194
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Distance gets released on the

2195
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan on the 29th.

2196
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Remember you can't import

2197
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
from the 3DS unless you

2198
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
have a Japanese region 3DS.

2199
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Right. It is not region free like the original

2200
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
DS was, right? Yes. So

2201
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
well if you want to get a Japanese 3DS

2202
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
there is specifically a Kingdom Hearts

2203
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
3DS that you

2204
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
can get. It's like a black one

2205
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that kind of looks nice. Like a little

2206
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
like inscription of Disney. I don't know if that's like

2207
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
a sticker they put on it. But it looks

2208
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
like a picture. It looks like an inscription.

2209
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Oh okay. So it's

2210
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
a little more permanent so that's good.

2211
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So that's kind of your big release

2212
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
and that's on the 3DS this week. But there are some

2213
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
other games coming out of Japan this week.

2214
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
On the Playstation Vita

2215
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
there's Pro Yakyuu Spirits

2216
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
2012. O Tumao

2217
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
To Sevanen no Himigimitachi

2218
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Shin Osamamonogatari.

2219
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
That is coming out from

2220
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Konami this week. I don't know

2221
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
if this is a series I recognize

2222
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
on the Vita.

2223
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It's like a chibi

2224
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
character role playing game.

2225
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
When I saw the people at first I was

2226
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
like oh it's like Suikoden but it's definitely

2227
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
not. It's too cartoony to be that.

2228
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Something a little different

2229
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
there. But that's from Konami which is a pretty big

2230
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
publisher in Japan.

2231
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Going to the

2232
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
consoles real quick. Let me take a look at the

2233
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Xbox 360. Japan

2234
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
gets Duke Nukem Forever.

2235
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Stay away

2236
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
from it. It's horrible.

2237
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Root Double Before Crime After

2238
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Days. Mahjong Dream Club

2239
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
on the 360. And lastly

2240
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
on the Playstation 3 this week. Grand Theft

2241
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Auto. Episodes from Liberty

2242
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
City. Gets like a price reduction.

2243
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Duke Nukem Forever is out there as well.

2244
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
The Silent Hill HD Collection makes its way

2245
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
to Japan. Idol Master

2246
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Gravure For You

2247
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Volume 6

2248
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
comes out this week on the Playstation 3.

2249
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So there you go. Your Japanese releases.

2250
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
How about

2251
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
UK? We do have a few.

2252
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
For the UK releases

2253
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
we have on the 28th

2254
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
we have Wrecked Revenge

2255
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
on the 29th

2256
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Silent Hill HD Collection. On the

2257
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
30th Silent Hill Downpour

2258
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Naruto Shippuden

2259
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations

2260
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Ridge Racer Unbound

2261
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Warriors Orochi 3

2262
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Awesome.

2263
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Alright.

2264
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Let's do a couple more stories and then the classic

2265
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
game of the week. Loki?

2266
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Alright.

2267
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Apparently

2268
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Ubisoft is hoping that

2269
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
they can get rid of their DRM

2270
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
that they have on PC.

2271
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
According to a recent interview

2272
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
with Eurogamer

2273
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Chris Early, who is the

2274
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Vice President of Digital Publishing at

2275
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Ubisoft, talked about

2276
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
some of their anti-piracy

2277
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
measures and how

2278
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
it's a tricky balancing act.

2279
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Basically

2280
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
they were talking a little bit about

2281
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
how

2282
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
it's kind of

2283
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
leniencing some of their customers

2284
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and that at the same time

2285
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
they don't want to put

2286
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
they're having

2287
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
a hard time convincing

2288
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
themselves to not

2289
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
put DRM on their PC tiles because they know

2290
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
they're going to get pirated so they're trying to find

2291
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
kind of a balance where

2292
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
they can offer enough value in a game where

2293
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
people will want to

2294
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
buy it legitimately without having to

2295
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
worry about DRM.

2296
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Kind of the same thing I think was at

2297
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
CD Projekt Red was going through with

2298
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The Witcher 2 and stuff like that where that game was

2299
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
really pirated and they're like

2300
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
listen we're not doing DRM anymore.

2301
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I think that's mainly because it kept

2302
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
failing in their pain to put DRM in there

2303
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and so you might as well recoup some money.

2304
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
But

2305
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
right now they're saying

2306
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
the question is with enough ongoing

2307
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
content development, content release,

2308
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
engagement at the community level, we can

2309
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
create that kind of MMO value system.

2310
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I think we can.

2311
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
As the rest of the

2312
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
game industry continues to evolve the more

2313
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
you hear about cloud gaming

2314
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
the more you hear about companion gaming

2315
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
the less pirated game

2316
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
the less

2317
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
pirated games should work in all of that

2318
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
environment. So basically they're

2319
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
trying to

2320
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
make it work here. Well cloud

2321
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
gaming I mean they're basically making it where you don't

2322
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
have any of the content you just kind of access it

2323
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and then the MMO stuff

2324
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
just kind of more it sounds like

2325
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
a lot of pay to

2326
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
purchase, pay to play stuff.

2327
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Right. It's kind of like

2328
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
they're trying to enrich it

2329
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
by giving it more

2330
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
to download. It's almost

2331
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
like the Mass Effect 2 thing I'm going through

2332
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
right now. I got a copy of Mass Effect 2 for

2333
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
20 bucks, brand new. I'm like, fuck yeah

2334
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
sweet, a copy of Mass Effect 2.

2335
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Almost got pissed as hell when I saw it

2336
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
came with a free code for the Cerberus network.

2337
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Expires January 1,

2338
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
2012. And I just bought it

2339
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
off the shelf at Fry's, brand new.

2340
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But I tried using it anyway

2341
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
it still worked. So crisis averted

2342
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
right. So by the way

2343
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
pro tip, those codes might not

2344
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
actually expire when they say they do. Just throwing it

2345
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
out there.

2346
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
But the other thing I wanted to say is that

2347
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I find that now I'm being

2348
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
told, oh I have to buy the $7

2349
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
DLC because it

2350
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
will change some things in 3 and then there's other

2351
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
DLC. I might have to drop another 20

2352
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
bucks in DLC to get the full experience.

2353
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So they're still going to get

2354
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
40 bucks out of me for the whole game even though

2355
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I thought I was getting it on sale. What they

2356
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
really should do, and like I was saying before

2357
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
with the whole Killzone 3 online

2358
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
thing, how that was free.

2359
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That's how you get people interested in

2360
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
your game. You put that shit out there digitally

2361
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
for free. Just, you can

2362
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
even do it like a demo. And then

2363
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
you add content and you're basically free

2364
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
to play. You're free to start playing it but then

2365
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
you pay for additional content. Or you

2366
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
can get everything boxed together. And then

2367
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
is that like the whole idea that Ridge Racer

2368
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
on the Vita would be awesome if it was

2369
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
free?

2370
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I wouldn't go as far as saying it would be awesome

2371
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
but it would be a lot easier to

2372
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
swallow that, okay yes there's only 3

2373
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
tracks and 5 cars because this is the free version

2374
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
of the game. Versus the $30

2375
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
version of the game. Well there's the Motorstorm.

2376
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The Motorstorm game is free and they have

2377
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
a lot of DLC for it. Exactly.

2378
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That's kind of a perfect example there. Although that

2379
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
DLC you don't really need any of it. I mean

2380
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
because it's just cars that change the appearance

2381
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
of your cars. Which since you're not really

2382
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
racing anybody

2383
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
anyways, um

2384
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't really see the point of making your

2385
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
car look different. Considering that I don't think

2386
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
they handle any different. But whatever.

2387
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You know you can do that. And that

2388
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
DLC though is anywhere from like a quarter

2389
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
a pop to like a buck.

2390
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I mean which is something like

2391
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
a quarter. I'm not even going to blink at that.

2392
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I mean that's nothing if I really felt like

2393
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I should buy it. But I mean

2394
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
you know like do that with like the next

2395
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Call of Duty game or something like that. Imagine

2396
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
a free to play Call of Duty game where you can

2397
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
level up to say like

2398
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
rank you know 20 or something like that

2399
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
then oh you gotta pay

2400
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
to you know rank up even further.

2401
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I think people would be all over that

2402
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
shit. It would be

2403
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
it would be immensely successful.

2404
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Um and I knew this comment

2405
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
was coming in the chat room. AcidicVampire says

2406
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Sky just drop the money for it.

2407
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Mass Effect 2's DLC is worth it.

2408
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
All the Mass Effect fans are joining in.

2409
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Infinel says you don't really need the weapon armor

2410
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
DLC and Shane says yeah forget it

2411
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
just get the story stuff. I'm like alright

2412
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
yeah yeah you guys made your point but

2413
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
you know and Mass Effect 2

2414
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
is kind of one game out of

2415
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
a lot that I would be willing to do that for.

2416
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I mean again I actually

2417
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
it held my attention long enough to beat it.

2418
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
That says a lot right there. So

2419
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
alright.

2420
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
When you get around to it I may have DLC

2421
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
codes for you for Mass Effect 3.

2422
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Nice! For some

2423
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
of the pre-order stuff. I think I still

2424
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
have some left over. Send those my way!

2425
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Save one for when I borrow Rob's.

2426
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I love that Jamie

2427
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
is already resigned to the fact that she's gonna

2428
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
have to play the whole damn series. Oh and hey if anybody

2429
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
needs any of the ganky codes

2430
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
for Saints Row the Third I think I have like

2431
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
200 of them still so

2432
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
send me a direct message

2433
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
on Twitter. By the way

2434
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Mass Effect fans in chat especially

2435
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Shane. Do I get like a big

2436
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
old high five or a big old cookie for

2437
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
paying it forward to Jamie where

2438
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
now she's taking my copy and she's gonna

2439
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
get sucked into this? Of course

2440
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
she might come on the show next week

2441
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
and go I hated it.

2442
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You guys are stupid. You know what? I think

2443
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
right there that's a perfect example of how they

2444
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
should be treating games instead of saying oh

2445
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
well we want each person to play an online pass.

2446
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
They should be fucking encouraging people to get

2447
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
people to loan that game out so that people try.

2448
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Not necessarily the full version of the game but

2449
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
like say hey this person played a demo

2450
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
that's owned by this person like you can

2451
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
send it to them and if they play it and they

2452
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
like it or something like that you get a kickback

2453
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
or something like that. That is the fucking way

2454
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
That's a good point because if I loan her

2455
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Mass Effect 2 she might have to go buy the

2456
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
DLC for herself.

2457
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Maybe. I mean we're making a lot of assumptions

2458
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
here but. Well I think they just need to

2459
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
rethink how they're you know

2460
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
doing this. How they're approaching everything

2461
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
and if they could just grasp

2462
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
these wonderful ideas you know they could make a lot of money.

2463
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Alright.

2464
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Hitstone wants to know if any of those codes are for PC.

2465
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
No. Oh.

2466
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Sorry. PS3 and 360 only.

2467
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Wah wah wah wah. Sorry.

2468
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Alright. One more

2469
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
story for you guys. Look it's a slow news week

2470
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
so I'm gonna let this story through.

2471
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
In a more busy news week it would have been cut but

2472
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
we needed something so I'm gonna

2473
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
go ahead and address these rumors about Grand Theft

2474
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Auto 5. Supposedly

2475
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
from an ex-Rockstar employee

2476
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
on the GameSpot

2477
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
forums so

2478
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
big fat grain of salt

2479
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
and I'm doing this instead of Loki

2480
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
so that Loki can sit here and go

2481
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
it's bullshit or oh it sounds like it's

2482
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
legit.

2483
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Number one. There will be

2484
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
one protagonist character. One

2485
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
character alone. Albert Da Silva

2486
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
is the name. Half Hispanic

2487
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
man who was once a part of a crime city.

2488
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Crime family in Vice City.

2489
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
True or false? I don't know.

2490
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You're not very fun to play with.

2491
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Sorry. Multiplayer will hold

2492
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
32 people on the Xbox and

2493
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
PlayStation 3. Unknown

2494
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
about PC. Just like

2495
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Red Dead Redemption you'll be able to form

2496
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
gangs. They're not ranked through XP

2497
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
but through reputation.

2498
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Well we know that to be true

2499
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
already but I think a lot of that is

2500
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
just speculation. I think all this is

2501
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
speculation. They don't know.

2502
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Alright.

2503
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Yeah I think a lot of this seems like educated

2504
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
speculation to me when I read it too and I don't

2505
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
know a dick about Grand Theft Auto. I don't know if it's educated

2506
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
speculation but. Number

2507
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
three. The map is about five times as large

2508
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
as the Grand Theft Auto 4 map and the

2509
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
city of Los Santos takes up just

2510
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
under half of this area. So it's bigger than

2511
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
two Grand Theft Auto 4 Liberty Cities.

2512
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Again, safe bet.

2513
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Um.

2514
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I don't know if they can do it like that.

2515
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I mean it could be bigger because

2516
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I think the Red Dead Redemption map was pretty big

2517
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
but I mean it's a lot of it's just

2518
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
fitting in textures and fitting in

2519
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
the maps themselves. I mean

2520
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
the object placement formats and stuff like

2521
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
that it's pretty small

2522
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
but it's when you get all the different textures in the

2523
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
game. So I don't know if it's going to be five

2524
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
times as large. I mean it's going to be pretty big.

2525
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
But I

2526
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
don't know. I just assume it's going to be larger.

2527
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Cars and guns are customizable

2528
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
to an extent. For an example you

2529
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
can customize a gun to have a suppressor on it

2530
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and you can install nitrous into cars.

2531
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I thought you could already do that in Grand Theft Auto.

2532
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Uh.

2533
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
They used to have that in San Andreas.

2534
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Not necessarily the

2535
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
suppressors but I mean that would be a nice feature.

2536
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I don't know if that's going to be

2537
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
legit or not.

2538
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Alright let me get to some of the other

2539
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
good stuff because this is getting

2540
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
boring already. Radio stations

2541
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
now do traffic reports that are actually

2542
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
correct. So if you don't know what route to take

2543
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
you can check the traffic reports on your phone or on the

2544
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Radio 7. The in-game TV

2545
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
has more channels. Again that seems like a safe bet.

2546
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
But once again though

2547
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
those in-game TV channels are

2548
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
fucking huge as far as the files go.

2549
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
They're Bic encoded

2550
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
or Bink encoded videos

2551
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
that take up hundreds of

2552
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
megs. I mean if they're going to fit

2553
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
that shit on a disc they're going to have to do some sort of

2554
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
compression or something because as of

2555
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
right now on 4 in episodes

2556
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
from Liberty City they're not

2557
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
compressed at all besides

2558
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
you know what the actual

2559
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
encoder does but

2560
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
that's why there's not that many stations

2561
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
on like episodes from Liberty City

2562
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
because they can't fit it on the disc.

2563
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
The protagonist

2564
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
can take drugs which will have

2565
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
some effects but smoking weed

2566
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
on the streetwalk will lead to getting a one

2567
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
star wanted level.

2568
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
That's like Saintsboro

2569
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
one shit. I mean I don't even

2570
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
know if I can go with that. I'm bored

2571
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
of this story already so here's the biggest one.

2572
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
The game is due in May 2013.

2573
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
A more specific date has not been

2574
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
decided because the game is still needing six

2575
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
months to be fully developed. They

2576
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
will have a playable demo at E3.

2577
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
That's again speculation

2578
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
because we already know with their

2579
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
we already know the next quarter game is going to be

2580
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Max Payne 3. We already know what the

2581
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
fourth quarter game is going to be which is going to be

2582
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
well it's not necessarily the Rockstar but Take 2

2583
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
which is going to be NBA 2K

2584
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
NHL 2K if they actually put one out

2585
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
this year and of course you know the big

2586
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
big big one is

2587
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
you know Bioshock Infinite

2588
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
so of course that stuff is going to be

2589
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
coming out and so you got to figure

2590
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
you know it's going to be

2591
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
first or second quarter and you know

2592
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
estimating they've got

2593
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
maybe they've got some other 2K stuff

2594
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
oh shit I completely forgot

2595
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
of like you know

2596
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
XCOM is still in there somewhere

2597
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
and

2598
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
then I want to say like the

2599
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Summer Games probably

2600
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Spec Ops they've

2601
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
still got in there somewhere in June I

2602
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
believe

2603
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I don't know a lot of it just sounds like

2604
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
speculation and you know

2605
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
unfortunately because I do follow

2606
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
a lot of Grand Theft Auto

2607
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
communities and stuff there is like one person

2608
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
each week saying oh I've heard something

2609
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
from a random you know

2610
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Rockstar employee yeah and they're going to make

2611
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
these educated guesses so that if they're close

2612
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
then yeah people say hey I said it first

2613
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
and then if they're wrong then no one will

2614
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
remember. People have a need to be first

2615
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
sometimes. Exactly.

2616
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I love some of the comments in our chat room

2617
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
chat.orangessantria.com Porkchop

2618
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
what a delicious handle in the

2619
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
chat room says why would anyone

2620
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
waste time watching TV in Grand Theft Auto

2621
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
when you can go out and stomp hookers? We actually

2622
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
did watch a lot of the TV when

2623
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Dan was playing it. It was funny.

2624
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You're boring. You should be killing more hookers.

2625
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
SHJ100Matt

2626
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
says what Grand Theft Auto 5 really

2627
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
needs is the SimCity Action News

2628
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
reporter just saying

2629
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
God I love your topical sense of humor

2630
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I really do because it gives me an excuse

2631
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
to play a clip from SimCity Action

2632
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
News

2633
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
is

2634
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
picking up cars and buses

2635
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and throwing them hundreds of yards

2636
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
as he moves closer to the SimCity Action

2637
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Studios which means

2638
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
that this is Carol Davenport signing off

2639
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
and getting the hell out of here.

2640
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Give her an Emmy. Give her a goddamn Emmy.

2641
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Lifetime Achievement

2642
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Award.

2643
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You see...

2644
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Let's give her a series on Bravo.

2645
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Jurassic Park had just come

2646
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
out that same year. So that's funny.

2647
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Let's go back to a time

2648
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
when

2649
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
video games were less complicated

2650
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and didn't require full screen

2651
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
videos and all that stuff

2652
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
in a segment we call the classic

2653
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
game of the week. Yay!

2654
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into

2655
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks

2656
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
is great. You kids

2657
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
need to stop playing

2658
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
your Grand Theft Auto 5s and your SimCity

2659
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Action Newses

2660
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and you need to check out this

2661
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
awesomely classic game. What is the classic

2662
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
game of the week? Today's classic game is

2663
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Star Fox.

2664
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yay. Fucking great choice.

2665
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Which came out of Starwing

2666
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
in Europe and Australia because there was

2667
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
a trademarked game that came out

2668
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
like in

2669
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
when the hell... 1983.

2670
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Can I just say I'm really hating the ads

2671
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
on YouTube these days. Sorry. It's alright.

2672
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Not your fault. I didn't want

2673
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
to hear emo bands singing first while I'm trying

2674
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
to get some Star Fox action going on here

2675
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
in the studio. We're the emo band

2676
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
singing about Star Fox.

2677
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Our lives suck

2678
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
cause we don't have Star Fox.

2679
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Anyway.

2680
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Star Fox

2681
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
is a

2682
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
rail shooter that used

2683
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
3D polygon graphics. It's the first Nintendo

2684
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
game to use full on polygons.

2685
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And it was powered by the

2686
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Super FX chip which was basically

2687
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
a co-processor so that it could handle it.

2688
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So uh

2689
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
the characters were all designed

2690
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
by Takaya Imamura

2691
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
based off of Kemono

2692
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
characters basically

2693
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
from old I believe 16th

2694
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
century Japanese art.

2695
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
This is pretty cool. You know basically

2696
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
anthropomorphic characters.

2697
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
What? Somebody in chat asked

2698
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
if they could do a barrel roll so I slapped him with a fish.

2699
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Okay cool.

2700
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
At any rate

2701
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
God this music is so epic. I love the first

2702
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
level music. The soundtrack was so

2703
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
fucking good. Turn this up a little bit. Sure.

2704
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
This is like seriously my favorite music in the game.

2705
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
What the

2706
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
planet music? The very first

2707
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
level. Oh yeah the music

2708
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
here. The canaria level. The whole

2709
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
take off sequence and all that is awesome. Let's

2710
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
listen here for a minute here.

2711
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Thanks. Emergency.

2712
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
This brings me so much

2713
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
worries.

2714
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Seriously the most epic

2715
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:13,000
music ever right here.

2716
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Shut up Falco.

2717
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Shut up Slippy.

2718
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I swear I spent the whole game going

2719
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
freaking hate Slippy die

2720
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
and shut up Falco. That was me

2721
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
the entire time I was playing this game. Seriously

2722
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
this music just invokes the

2723
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
world.

2724
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Fuck yeah.

2725
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
For a Japanese game sure.

2726
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Anyway it

2727
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
involves Fox McCloud

2728
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
who is the leader of the Star Fox team

2729
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
and they

2730
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
have these ships called

2731
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Arwings which

2732
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
are really floating polygon

2733
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
things and they're pretty cool.

2734
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And you've got thrusters and

2735
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
retrorockets that let you speed up

2736
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
slow down and you've got

2737
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
bombs and

2738
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
pew pew laser things.

2739
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
You hear the pew pew noises?

2740
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Pew pew pew pew.

2741
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So anyway

2742
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
you've got

2743
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
a little bit different thing

2744
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
with your

2745
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
in the damage on here. You've actually got

2746
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
an energy shield that controls how much

2747
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
damage you can absorb before the craft

2748
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
destroys. So you can bump

2749
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
into stuff and you take some damage

2750
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
and don't just immediately explode.

2751
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Sometimes if your

2752
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
wings clip against certain obstacles

2753
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
they'll break off and it will affect

2754
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
the handling of your Arwing.

2755
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Which was pretty innovative I thought

2756
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
for a game of it's time.

2757
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
The other thing that was interesting

2758
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
about this is that it didn't have a difficulty

2759
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
selection after you

2760
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
finished the first stage you actually

2761
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
would pick a path

2762
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
that you could go on.

2763
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And so you could pick the easy

2764
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
option, the normal option, or the hard option

2765
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
depending on which path you took.

2766
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So you could mix and match your game

2767
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
anyway and it had multiple

2768
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
patterns. You know kind of like

2769
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
an outrun.

2770
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
You know how you can pick your different

2771
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
paths and outrun. Oh yeah an outrun

2772
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
you can pick your path but kind of once you

2773
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
start going one way it's like you can't

2774
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
really change it too much.

2775
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You can kind of slip back into something.

2776
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
If you go left the first time you'll

2777
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
never do the stage all the way at the bottom of the map.

2778
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Right you know that kind of thing.

2779
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
The same thing was done in After Burner.

2780
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Yay Sega. Anyway.

2781
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So you also have

2782
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
your wingmen. You have Peppy Hare, Slippy

2783
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Toad. Sucker.

2784
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
And Falco Lombardi who I hated

2785
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Falco so much.

2786
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And it was kind of

2787
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
cool because if you accidentally shot one of

2788
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
your guys you wouldn't hurt them

2789
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
but they would say hey

2790
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
what are you doing shooting at me?

2791
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I'm Falco and I suck.

2792
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Hey I suck at these things off my toes.

2793
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Yeah you actually have to um

2794
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
save your wingmen from being attacked by

2795
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
other enemies too which was

2796
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
almost always slippy.

2797
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So yeah

2798
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
so you have to help them so that they'll always

2799
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
be there with you and you even have the

2800
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
little flying formation thing which is pretty cool.

2801
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So anyway

2802
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
um

2803
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
there were a few

2804
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
really neat things with this too. Like I said

2805
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
it was using the um

2806
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Super FX chip. It actually was

2807
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
based off on

2808
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
there was a prototype on the NES that was called

2809
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
NES Glider that was

2810
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
inspired by a game called Star Glider

2811
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
and then they brought the prototype to the SNES

2812
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
and once they uh

2813
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
they actually uh hired

2814
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
um a company to create

2815
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
the Super FX chip so that they could have

2816
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
the 3D graphics in there.

2817
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It was actually a lot

2818
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
harder um a lot more

2819
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
powerful than the SNES

2820
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
uh processor. There was a joke going

2821
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
around that the um

2822
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
SNES was basically just a box to hold the chip.

2823
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Pretty cool.

2824
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So um the main game

2825
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
uh was designed by Miyamoto

2826
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
and um Eguchi

2827
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
and uh like I said the characters were designed

2828
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
by um Imamura

2829
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and that awesome music was by

2830
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
um Hajime Hirasawa so

2831
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
awesome music. We've got so many different

2832
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
good versions of that song too.

2833
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Um

2834
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
It was also stated

2835
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
by Miyamoto that he wanted to use animal

2836
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
characters since he didn't want to

2837
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
do conventional sci-fi with

2838
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
robots, monsters, and superheroes.

2839
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
And uh so that's how

2840
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
it came about.

2841
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
So um moving

2842
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
a little bit uh forward

2843
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
there's secret levels in the game.

2844
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Did you ever do any of the secret levels Rob?

2845
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I did. Wasn't it the thing where you had to shoot the little

2846
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
planet and the little planet that would pop out

2847
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
for like a half second? You had to do something?

2848
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
And then you had to shoot it in the eye?

2849
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
There were, okay. If I remember this

2850
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
correctly cause keep in mind it's been a while since

2851
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I've done it. To get to the um the black hole

2852
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
level you have to shoot

2853
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
these um like

2854
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
rings that there's a little central

2855
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
part. Is this the slot machine level?

2856
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That's the slot machine. I think that's the slot machine.

2857
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yeah

2858
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
is that going from the easy one to the

2859
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
This video is somebody actually doing it. So

2860
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
we'll uh. No that's the first one.

2861
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
The slot machines

2862
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
later on. Let me fast forward

2863
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the video a little bit then. Where's the slot machine?

2864
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Oh no that's the one.

2865
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
That's the slot machine one.

2866
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Yeah I think somebody

2867
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
accesses it here cause here's the

2868
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Yeah that's the slot machine.

2869
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Okay anyway let me

2870
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
There was one where um

2871
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
where you uh

2872
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
have to shoot these certain rings a certain

2873
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
way and then fly through the center of the explosion

2874
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
and then this ugly ass planet

2875
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
pops up that looks like um

2876
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
you know it kind of looks like the moon from

2877
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Majora's Mask. It looks like a troll

2878
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
face to me. To me it looks like

2879
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
the moon from Majora's Mask.

2880
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And um you have to

2881
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
shoot it or fly into it or something.

2882
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And so you get to go to the first

2883
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
um black hole and the

2884
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
black hole basically if you

2885
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
whatever different ring pops up in the black

2886
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
hole if you fly through it it warps you

2887
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
to that level. Shut up Slippy.

2888
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Anyway.

2889
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
The other one which is one that we were talking about

2890
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
a moment ago is you get there from

2891
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
asteroid field course three.

2892
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Is um

2893
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
called out of this dimension.

2894
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And it plays um

2895
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
different music as you go

2896
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
through it um you actually have to shoot down

2897
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
paper planes.

2898
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
At first. And then the boss plays um

2899
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
different parts. One is from a

2900
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Japanese folk song called Yuki.

2901
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Um the chorus from when the saints go marching

2902
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
in and lightly row.

2903
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And uh you shoot parts of the machine

2904
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
like the arm to cause

2905
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
the spinners on the slot machine

2906
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
to go. And basically um

2907
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
when you land

2908
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
on three sevens

2909
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
um then you defeat the machine

2910
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
and it explodes. And then you

2911
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
actually fly through the ending credits

2912
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
of the game and then the end shows up

2913
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
but all the letters are flipped around. So you have to keep shooting

2914
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
the letters and when it finally lines up the different way

2915
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
it um basically just

2916
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I think starts you over.

2917
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It ends the game. Imagine that.

2918
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
It's not just a clever title.

2919
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
No this

2920
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
crazy mode seven.

2921
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Ooh mode seven. And FX FX.

2922
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And FX exactly.

2923
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Wasn't there only like one other game that had the FX chip in it?

2924
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
That would be Stunt Race FX.

2925
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I think there was one more.

2926
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
There was a robot game.

2927
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Oh yeah there was. You're right. And keep in mind there's the

2928
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Star Fox 2 prototype.

2929
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
That of course

2930
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
we never saw.

2931
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Now the one I'm going to talk about next is actually

2932
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
one that our friend Melody

2933
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
used to have a copy of.

2934
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And that was the competition version.

2935
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Which is the Super Star Fox weekend competition one.

2936
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Where uh they had

2937
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
a limited time play

2938
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and there were two thousand copies made

2939
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
and she said she sold hers.

2940
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
There was um you know we had

2941
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
a number of Star Fox games come out since then.

2942
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Star Fox 2 was in the works for Super Nintendo.

2943
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Um

2944
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
though um the head programmer said

2945
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
that they actually finished the game.

2946
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Um there was

2947
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
uh Star Fox 64.

2948
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
There were

2949
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
um there's actually ROM dumps of

2950
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Star Fox 2 that were from different stages

2951
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
of development. And someone

2952
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
actually translated it and made um

2953
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
a patch for it.

2954
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
There is Star Fox

2955
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
on the GameCube that was Star Fox Adventures by

2956
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Rare. We had

2957
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Star Fox Assault for the GameCube

2958
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
that was done by Namco.

2959
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
And it was a third person shooter.

2960
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
There was Star Fox Command that was on the DS.

2961
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And now there's um Star Fox makes

2962
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
appearances in a micro game in Warrior

2963
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
where Smooth moves.

2964
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
And um you fight

2965
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
basically the Nintendo robot

2966
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
who has a huge munga zapper.

2967
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And

2968
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
that's it.

2969
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Alright. A true classic.

2970
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Star Fox. Again

2971
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
one of those games I had to go

2972
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
she's never done Star Fox before? I know.

2973
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I had to go really? I've never done Star Fox before?

2974
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So yeah. So yeah

2975
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
200 episodes into this or what?

2976
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Also funny.

2977
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
The Starwing logo uses a completely different font

2978
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
than Star Fox. Just saying.

2979
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Now some folks in chat were like

2980
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
boy Nintendo really ruined this franchise.

2981
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
You know some of the Star Fox Adventures of course

2982
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
was not very well received and

2983
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
you know I think people liked Star Fox 64

2984
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
enough. Um and a lot of

2985
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Star Fox 2 kind of went into that but uh

2986
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
yeah Star Fox Adventures wasn't really

2987
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
pretty. So that's too bad.

2988
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Anyhow we are going

2989
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
to take a quick break but don't go anywhere. We got

2990
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
more Orange Lounge Radio to come. Things that might

2991
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
actually be better than Star Fox.

2992
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Alright maybe not but they're still

2993
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
pretty good so stick around. We'll be right back after this

2994
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2995
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

2996
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We are live with episode number

2997
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
451 for this.

2998
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
March the 25th of

2999
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
2012. Um I know we

3000
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
can't play these live break songs that we do

3001
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
um on the podcast but we were playing some

3002
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
music from the DDR days and

3003
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
by coincidence I happened to pick

3004
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
songs that were both from Dance Dance Revolution

3005
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
third mix Korean.

3006
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Um and man I miss

3007
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
those games. I miss DDR back when it was

3008
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
so good and like that

3009
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
that community and everything we had and the songs

3010
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
were like legit. Like not everybody

3011
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
ever understood the songs. I'm sure some of you

3012
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
listening to the show now probably go

3013
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
really you guys kind of like that music but

3014
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
like there is just something about DDR music. I can't

3015
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
explain it. I can't put my finger on it but man

3016
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I miss those days. But

3017
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
oh well. It was

3018
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
actually asked um by

3019
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Technus who was played at a third mix

3020
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
machine that was not a Korean version.

3021
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Me. Um they had one here

3022
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
locally somewhere didn't they? Well they did.

3023
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
The one that I played at I think it was

3024
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
AX2000. Mhm. Was

3025
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
um a Japanese third mix from

3026
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
uh Arcade Infinity. Ah.

3027
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Nice.

3028
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I did hear I think

3029
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
that they're trying to restart Arcade Infinity

3030
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
in another location. Or like something

3031
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
like it. So that's cool. I hope it

3032
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
happens. We'll see.

3033
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Alright anyhow let's get back into some gaming news

3034
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
with some rapid fire news.

3035
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Uh some quick stories for you guys. Loki.

3036
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
So uh we've

3037
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
heard about LittleBigPlanet Karting

3038
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
um which was you know

3039
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
leaked out of the

3040
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
uh what was it

3041
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
uh PlayStation

3042
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
event. PlayStation event. PlayStation event.

3043
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
What the hell was it called? Uh

3044
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
uh

3045
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
uh I can't remember. Anyways.

3046
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Uh you know

3047
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Loki uh PlayStation event

3048
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
basically uh is gonna be coming out on

3049
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
the Vita and PlayStation 3.

3050
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Uh not surprisingly enough though it's

3051
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
actually being done by

3052
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
um United Front Games

3053
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
who are the developers behind

3054
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
ModNation Racers.

3055
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So they kinda have a little bit of experience

3056
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
in you know

3057
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
play, share, create racing games.

3058
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Although

3059
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
at the same time that makes me

3060
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
a little worried because

3061
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Well maybe they'll take some of the feedback from the last

3062
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
one and make it better.

3063
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
You know. Maybe.

3064
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Hopefully. Um

3065
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I mean the trailer looks neat. They have

3066
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
a trailer out for it now. Um

3067
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
So it has potential. I'm just really

3068
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
sad that Media Molecule is not

3069
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
having a

3070
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
like you know really

3071
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
a lot of

3072
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
feedback on it. At least I hope that

3073
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
they do. I don't know. It didn't really say.

3074
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So.

3075
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Um

3076
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Destination PlayStation. That's

3077
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
what it was. Destination PlayStation.

3078
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Um

3079
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So yeah. They're gonna be doing an Adventure Time

3080
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
game for Nintendo DS.

3081
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And it's being done by

3082
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
WayForward. Um. Who have

3083
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I guess they were behind

3084
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Uh

3085
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Some new. Oh what was it?

3086
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I'm trying to remember games they put out.

3087
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
The Henry Hatsworth game.

3088
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Um. They had that come out.

3089
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Um. So that was not a bad

3090
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
game. And I haven't really said

3091
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
too much about what the game is.

3092
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Although the creator of the show

3093
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
um

3094
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
actually posted some really funny

3095
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
like animated gifs. So

3096
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Neat.

3097
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I'm sure the game will be pretty

3098
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
awesome. The show is pretty cool.

3099
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
It's a great cartoon.

3100
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
And last but not least

3101
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
they announced that Max Payne 3

3102
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
is gonna have kind of a

3103
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
new feature for the multiplayer. They're

3104
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
gonna have what they're calling crews

3105
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
and now what the Max

3106
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Payne 3 crews are are kind of like these

3107
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
multiplayer clans that you have

3108
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
that you can um play

3109
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
through the game and

3110
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
uh kind of um create these

3111
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
uh crews or clans

3112
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
through the social club. The Rockstar Social

3113
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Club page. And what's

3114
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
kind of neat though is when you create

3115
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
your clan in Max Payne

3116
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
3 you'll actually be able to transfer it to

3117
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

3118
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
when that comes in to play the actual multiplayer

3119
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and that. So it's kind of like a cross game

3120
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
clan

3121
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
crew or whatever you want to call it.

3122
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Um. Which I think is kind of cool.

3123
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Cause they're definitely doing a lot of social club

3124
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
um interaction with the game

3125
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and I know like in the past when I used

3126
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
to play a lot of Grand Theft Auto 4

3127
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
and I really am sad I don't play a lot of

3128
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 now but

3129
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
you know last week or so

3130
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
actually this is kind of one thing that we

3131
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
didn't talk about but on the

3132
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
hacking scene for Grand Theft Auto 4

3133
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
they released online scripts for

3134
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

3135
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
um for multiplayer.

3136
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
So you're gonna see a lot more hacking

3137
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
shenanigans on Grand Theft Auto 4

3138
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
um if you're playing that online

3139
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
which is kind of sad cause I

3140
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
legitimately had a really high rank on

3141
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
that game um but unfortunately

3142
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
you know now anyone can game it to

3143
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
you get the top of the

3144
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
leaderboard so it's kind of

3145
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
over and done for now.

3146
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Um but 5 man I am looking

3147
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
forward to playing 5 multiplayer

3148
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
for sure from day 1 but uh

3149
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Max Payne 3

3150
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
not much interest in that game.

3151
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Cause it's not Grand Theft Auto.

3152
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Alright

3153
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
well moving on to some other games

3154
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
uh kind of in the same

3155
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
category as Grand Theft Auto another Rockstar game

3156
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
uh L.A. Noire

3157
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
is getting a touch controlled

3158
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
version um

3159
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
OnLive of course put out some

3160
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
various tablet apps

3161
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
um and Rockstar is doing

3162
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
a touch version of L.A. Noire

3163
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
making this kind of more of a

3164
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
touch screen friendly game or an iOS

3165
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
or whatever phone it is game.

3166
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Um OnLive says those controls are now

3167
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
available so you can play L.A. Noire

3168
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
with OnLive Mobile

3169
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
and uh yeah you can uh

3170
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
swipe across the screen to do

3171
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
some motions I guess you don't need to use

3172
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
virtual buttons or a wireless controller

3173
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
or any of that. Uh you do need to

3174
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
buy L.A. Noire if you want to play it

3175
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
uh or you know and have an OnLive

3176
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
account and all that but it is interesting that they actually

3177
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
kind of adapted it. However, however

3178
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
there are free trials for all the games and the Online

3179
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
client is free. So you can check it out

3180
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
for free. Okay that's good to know.

3181
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So if you want to see if this is up your alley.

3182
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I don't know if L.A. Noire would work in touch

3183
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
motion for me but okay.

3184
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
The problem is it's L.A. Noire.

3185
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
The interrogation parts will be fine but it's

3186
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
the rest of the movie. I got bored

3187
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
with that game really fast.

3188
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Alright moving on Final Fantasy 13

3189
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
2 um you know what's funny

3190
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
is that I didn't finish 13

3191
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
2 and part of the reason I wasn't able to do it is because

3192
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I got sucked into Mass Effect. Well

3193
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
worlds can now collide on March

3194
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
27th. They've announced that there will be

3195
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Mass Effect 3 DLC

3196
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
for Final Fantasy 13 2.

3197
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
What? Yes it's

3198
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
true. It's not as big as you think

3199
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
though. It's just that now Sarah and Noel

3200
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
who are of course the big two uh characters

3201
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
in the game are going to get

3202
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
N7 armor

3203
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
that they can dress up in to make them look like Mass Effect

3204
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
characters and although there's a part of me that

3205
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
goes that's stupid. There's another part of me that goes

3206
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
but that's really awesome.

3207
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
By the way Mass Effect is not the only

3208
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
kind of you know game hopping

3209
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
that's going on. Assassin's Creed

3210
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Revelations outfits are supposed to be on their way.

3211
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
And that's I believe only in Japan right now.

3212
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Right I don't think a date has been announced

3213
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
for the US. It'll eventually

3214
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
happen though. Yeah. Uh

3215
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
what else is interesting I think this is

3216
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
really interesting

3217
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
um Final Fantasy 13 2 got some other

3218
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
DLCers getting some that

3219
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
throws the game back to Final Fantasy

3220
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
6. Don't get too

3221
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
excited it's just a couple of the characters

3222
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
but if you played 6 you'll remember

3223
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Ultros right

3224
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Ultros was the octopus and the annoying

3225
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
little bastard. He has the

3226
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
little jokes and everything. Uh

3227
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Typhon is the other one. Is it Typhoon or

3228
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Typhon is the other one. I'll say Typhoon.

3229
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
But uh is the other

3230
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I only see 1-0 so whatever.

3231
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Uh but is the other character that will be available

3232
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
as well. Uh this is

3233
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
more of one of those arena fights and if you beat

3234
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
them in the arena then you can use them as your monsters

3235
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
cause you know your third person can always be a monster.

3236
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
So I thought it was kind of funny that

3237
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
they kind of went back to the

3238
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
past with that so that's pretty cool.

3239
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
So there you go. Uh

3240
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
no announcement when that is out in the US

3241
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
March 27th in Japan however.

3242
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
So probably soon thereafter.

3243
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Um

3244
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
this is just you know kind of unfortunate

3245
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
but um some of the promotion

3246
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
for Street Fighter X Tekken caused

3247
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Yoshinori Ono to need medical

3248
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
treatment which is um unfortunate.

3249
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Uh the producer of course

3250
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
he's the producer of the Street Fighter series

3251
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
and you know this new direction they're

3252
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
going in here. He was at a

3253
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Street Fighter X Tekken event in South Korea and he

3254
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
just collapsed. He had to go to the hospital.

3255
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Uh they did post Capcom on

3256
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
their Street Fighter blog. Immediately after

3257
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
a Street Fighter X Tekken event in Asia

3258
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
the physical condition of Street Fighter X Tekken producer

3259
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Ono-Chin, that's the nickname

3260
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
he goes by, rapidly deteriorated

3261
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
and he collapsed. He was taken to the hospital and he

3262
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
is currently not coming into work.

3263
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Luckily it sounds like something that's

3264
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
easily treatable.

3265
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Luckily it also sounds like he didn't suffer

3266
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
from exhaustion the same way that that one

3267
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
guy did that's all over THC. I was just

3268
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
gonna make that joke.

3269
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But uh

3270
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
yeah it's not something to really joke

3271
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
about in this guy's case so too bad.

3272
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Hope he feels better.

3273
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Yeah that's sad. However you might feel

3274
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
about the game aside um

3275
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Well both did suffer exhaustion

3276
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
while handling their fight sticks.

3277
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So for a game

3278
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
coming out in Japan called

3279
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
well actually I think it's coming out here too. It's by

3280
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Platinum Games

3281
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Anarchy Reigns.

3282
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Famitsu put out images that Bayonetta

3283
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
is gonna be in the game.

3284
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
No other news about it

3285
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
just hi Bayonetta.

3286
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
What else do you need besides

3287
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I don't know a sequel to Bayonetta? I know right.

3288
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And also amongst the

3289
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
30 some odd games that were removed

3290
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
from the Japanese Wii Virtual

3291
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Console uh

3292
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
basically 4 Sonic games are gone.

3293
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Sonic 1 to Sonic and Knuckles is gone

3294
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
as well as the uh Master System

3295
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
version of Sonic 1.

3296
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Which is too bad cause you know it's impossible

3297
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
to get Sonic 1 on any other platform.

3298
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Well there's

3299
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
no I mean the Master System.

3300
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I know what you mean but you know what I mean.

3301
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
But there's

3302
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
no word about it in the US or Europe yet

3303
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
but I'm sure it's gonna follow.

3304
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And then fans of ThinkGeek

3305
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
who have I'm sure seen more and more

3306
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
and more Portal stuff pop up there

3307
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I sure have including an inflatable

3308
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Sentry and a little uh talking

3309
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Sentry uh plushie that I totally want.

3310
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Um the Portal gun

3311
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
is for sale for 140 bucks.

3312
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
5,000 replicas have been made.

3313
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And somebody better buy me one for my birthday.

3314
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
That's all I'm saying.

3315
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
No secret what you want huh?

3316
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Just saying.

3317
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Birthdays next month.

3318
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Let's go to the FUGL Question

3319
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
of the Week. We missed it last week but it's back tonight.

3320
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
The FUGL Question of the Week.

3321
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Uh Facebook and

3322
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Google Plus get a question every week

3323
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
and we read some of our favorite answers

3324
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
here on the program for you

3325
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
guys and if uh those in studio want to

3326
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
answer. I don't know if they repeat the question

3327
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
in advance. It's kind of a toughie. This is one that

3328
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
takes a little bit of thought tonight.

3329
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Uh so we'll start at Google Plus

3330
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
with Orange Lounge Radio.

3331
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
FUGL Question of the Week. If you could go back and change

3332
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
a classic games ending since

3333
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
you know it's all the rage right now talking about changing

3334
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
the ending of games. What ending would you change

3335
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
and what would the new ending be?

3336
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
And I said let's stick to classics because

3337
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
we don't want to spoil any new games. So I

3338
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
did force people to think classics. It's interesting

3339
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
though. We got a lot of varied responses that

3340
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
weren't, that kind of took the question in a different

3341
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
direction. And uh Derek H.

3342
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
starts us off on Google in that direction.

3343
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I want to go back to the days when

3344
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
games didn't have endings.

3345
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
The only time it ended was because the

3346
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
machine broke or you ran out of quarters.

3347
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I bet there's some guy in Ohio that's

3348
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
still playing River Raid after 25

3349
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
years and he's only on his

3350
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
second man.

3351
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Imagine some kid complaining after the planet

3352
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
exploded in Stargate or when Pauline

3353
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
kept getting kidnapped by Donkey Kong

3354
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
or that the ambulance always passed you in

3355
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Turbo. That would never happen because

3356
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
in those days, gamers

3357
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
weren't spoiled little punks who need

3358
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
closure after having pretend sex with an

3359
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
alien.

3360
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
So some pretty strong words

3361
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
there about uh

3362
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
back in my day, back in the old day.

3363
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
That's true though. A lot of Atari

3364
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
2600 games never ended.

3365
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Very few had an ending. You know the ending

3366
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
the only game I can think of

3367
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
a couple of them that actually

3368
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
had endings. Oops

3369
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
no. No Holik during the uh

3370
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
question. Thank you. Um

3371
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Pitfall and Pitfall 2.

3372
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And at the end of Pitfall

3373
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
it just stops. It freezes.

3374
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I don't think there's anything to do it. And the ending of

3375
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Pitfall 2, he jumps up

3376
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
and down a lot. And you won.

3377
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It's because games back then

3378
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
were trying to recreate the arcade experience

3379
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
games today are

3380
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
about touching you emotionally.

3381
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Alright uh going to Facebook

3382
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
some of the answers there.

3383
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Blue 2 says that's a tough one. I can't

3384
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
think of any ending I would change. However like

3385
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
thousands of gamers out there

3386
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
finished Half Life already Gabe.

3387
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So uh he kind of ignored the question

3388
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
of the week and just said finish Half Life. But actually

3389
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Alan was telling me about how

3390
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Half Life 2

3391
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Episode 1 did kind of

3392
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
go back and

3393
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
patch a few things up from what was originally

3394
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
out there for Half Life so

3395
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
they've kind of tinkered with those

3396
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
endings before. Um

3397
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Let's see

3398
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Jim H answers on Facebook

3399
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
saying since I just beat it again yesterday

3400
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I would change the ending of Super Mario Brothers 2

3401
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
so it isn't a dream

3402
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
at the end. I know it

3403
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I know it was a different

3404
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
game they just plugged in Mario

3405
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
characters into but since they did end up

3406
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
using enemies from the game in later sequels

3407
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
it would be nice if it fit into the

3408
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
continuity better. Oh yeah the

3409
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
original it was all a dream ending

3410
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Mario 2 right?

3411
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Yeah. But it

3412
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
doesn't fit well into the continuity when it's all a

3413
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
dream. I like that idea. That's good.

3414
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Uh let's see Stan H

3415
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
on Facebook says I'd

3416
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
change the ending of the

3417
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I Said No Holic

3418
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Thank you

3419
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'd change the ending of the original

3420
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Super Mario Brothers. I'd make it so that when

3421
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Mario saves Peach from Bowser

3422
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
she tells her that he

3423
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I think he tells her that he is enrolling her in some

3424
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Taekwondo lessons with Chun-Li

3425
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
so that when Bowser tries to kidnap her

3426
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
at least she'd be able to put up a fight and she

3427
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
wouldn't get kidnapped so damn frequently.

3428
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Nintendo wouldn't have to whore the Mario

3429
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
series out so much. Remember

3430
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
she doesn't fight with Kung Fu she fights

3431
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
with emotions. That's right

3432
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Super Princess Peach. That's what we learned.

3433
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Lastly Robert C

3434
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
on Facebook says I'd change the ending to

3435
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Mortal Kombat. The mandatory

3436
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
final fight would be between Katana and

3437
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Sonia. They'd suddenly both swap

3438
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
fighting styles to Brazilian Jutsu

3439
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
in a big pool of mud

3440
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
or jelly. The final scene would

3441
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
obviously be a slow motion montage

3442
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
of them moving from fighting to kissing.

3443
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Cue the 70's porn music.

3444
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Oh

3445
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
you.

3446
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I see what you did

3447
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
there. It'd be kinda hot.

3448
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Any classic

3449
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
games you guys here in studio would want to change?

3450
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I know you haven't had a lot of time

3451
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
to think about the answer. I

3452
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
would say let's go back to Ghosts and

3453
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Goblins and give them proper grammar.

3454
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
How's that sound?

3455
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
That was part of the fun.

3456
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I guess that's true.

3457
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Um

3458
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I can't

3459
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
really think of anything because you know what

3460
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I'm not a little bitch with

3461
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
a sense of entitlement.

3462
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
We're just having fun.

3463
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I will tell you which

3464
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
game needs another

3465
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
different ending. The Legend of Zelda

3466
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
it needs a third quest.

3467
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Actually

3468
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I would give a better ending to Zelda

3469
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
to the past after how fucking hard that game

3470
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
is. Kinda get a shitty ending.

3471
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
That game was epic.

3472
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I mean yeah don't get me wrong it's a fucking tremendous

3473
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
game but kind of a crab ending.

3474
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Dude.

3475
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
They really, you know what would be awesome

3476
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
totally on tangent here.

3477
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Is they should totally go with the

3478
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Little Big Planet style to

3479
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
the Legend of Zelda games. You know how they have

3480
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
a ton of ROM hacks and stuff like that with custom levels

3481
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
for the Legend of Zelda. Why not have

3482
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
a Legend of Zelda game that was like Link to the Past

3483
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
but with a ton of fucking custom games

3484
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
in there. Oh I know because no one would ever

3485
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
play your new Zelda games because they'd be

3486
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
too busy enthralled with

3487
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
the custom made stuff.

3488
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
You want the Legend of Little Big Planet?

3489
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I want the Legend

3490
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
of Zelda with a really kick ass

3491
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
editor

3492
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
that's officially sanctioned. I'm trying to

3493
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
think of just the endings of different games

3494
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
and really I keep thinking back

3495
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
to how epic many of them were.

3496
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
You know like Hitler's head blowing up

3497
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
at the end of Bionic Commando

3498
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
or

3499
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
you know

3500
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
how you felt bad

3501
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
for the baby Metroid when you know

3502
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
it got killed

3503
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
and

3504
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
it's all kinds of sad-facedness.

3505
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I would go back and make sure

3506
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
that every Silent Hill game had a dog

3507
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
ending. Yes. I would

3508
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
you know what actually I would change the ending

3509
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
to Shattered Memories because I

3510
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
wanted to like that game a whole lot.

3511
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
In fact

3512
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I think that the next Silent

3513
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Hill game should be directed by Peter Molyneaux

3514
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
and you should play as the dog.

3515
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Should be

3516
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
called Silent Dog. Alright now you guys are getting

3517
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
crazy. Let's move on with some more game news.

3518
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Yeah but wait wait wait Silent Dog

3519
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
has a cat

3520
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
let me finish let me finish has a cat ending.

3521
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I love the idea of a game called

3522
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Silent Dog.

3523
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Where the

3524
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
This might be a dream game.

3525
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Hold on. Hold on. Alright dream game.

3526
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Silent Dog. The dog must confront

3527
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
you know the

3528
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
demons of its past you know like

3529
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
all the legs they've peed on

3530
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
chasing its tail and

3531
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
yeah being chased by a

3532
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
faceless postman with claw

3533
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
hands. Tires that they can

3534
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
just never catch.

3535
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Frisbees of doom with razor blades

3536
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
on them. And mandatory

3537
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Kiryamoka is forced

3538
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
to do all the music.

3539
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Cause it's

3540
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
just not a Silent Hill game. Really it should just be

3541
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
the dog song throughout the whole game.

3542
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof

3543
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
That you know we need we need

3544
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
to we need to play that Rob. I don't think I have

3545
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
the dog getting music readily accessible.

3546
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Yes you do. You have

3547
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
YouTube. Yes you do.

3548
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
You know

3549
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I would love to see like the

3550
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
saga of the UFO ending Silent Hill

3551
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
as a UFO.

3552
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
That would just be great.

3553
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Uh hold on I'm

3554
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
finding it for you guys.

3555
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
It was you the whole time?

3556
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Praying there's no uh

3557
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
There it is.

3558
02:02:41,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It would be awesome.

3559
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
But we can't forget about the most important

3560
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
part of Silent Dog.

3561
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Which I think is at the very end of the song.

3562
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I like that he growls

3563
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
at that one horrible guy.

3564
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Ugh this is so great.

3565
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Listen to Vampire wants to know this is the canon ending to Silent Hill 2 right?

3566
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Yes. Yes absolutely.

3567
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Was it Silent Hill 3 that had like the um

3568
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Here's the most important scene in the entire game.

3569
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Hold on.

3570
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Oh.

3571
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Does it do the chorus one more time?

3572
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Yes. Oh god.

3573
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I was wondering if the voice actor has been changed for the dog in the HD collection.

3574
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Here it is.

3575
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
That's right the all important sex scene.

3576
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Where the adults are having sex and the dog is just forced to watch with that blank expression on their face.

3577
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Like what are my owners doing?

3578
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:35,000
You know actually one of my live journal icons is the dog and it says game over.

3579
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
You know as much as I love the dog ending I still like the um the Silent Hill theme.

3580
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Silent Hill. Silent Hill.

3581
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
From one of the UFO endings.

3582
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Anyhow I don't know how we got on this topic but Silent Dog make it happen.

3583
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Woof woof woof.

3584
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So we were going to get into news at some point right?

3585
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
News?

3586
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yeah we were talking about Silent Dog though so that is very important.

3587
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Um.

3588
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Oh our dream game.

3589
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Silent Dog.

3590
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:13,000
So someone needs to explain to me once again why we have these online passes because I swear it's just like I never hear anything going smoothly with them.

3591
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I mean I don't understand but whatever.

3592
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:24,000
So Ninja Gaiden 3 came out this week and um yeah apparently no one could redeem the online passes for that game.

3593
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Not even the reviewers could redeem the online passes because they had forgot to flip the switch to allow those passes to be redeemed.

3594
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Ha ha.

3595
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Um so yes none of the codes worked at all at launch.

3596
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I think they work now. They may be working soon but as of you know earlier this week they were not working at all.

3597
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So fun.

3598
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Um.

3599
02:05:51,000 --> 02:06:02,000
And then on top of that MLB 12 the show another game with an online pass also had its issues.

3600
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Apparently the Playstation 3 and Vita versions had a problem if the Vita players tried to redeem the online pass they couldn't do it via the Vita.

3601
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
They could only do it if they had a Playstation 3.

3602
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:24,000
But here's the funny thing if they did it via the PS3 it unlocked online play for the PS3 version that they don't own.

3603
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So uh yeah apparently they were working out problems with that.

3604
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
But I don't know.

3605
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
It's interesting I guess.

3606
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
And then last but not least there is one more game that had an online pass.

3607
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
EA Sports MMA.

3608
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
It had an online pass and it had online play.

3609
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
It wasn't a very popular game.

3610
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And on April 13th they will be shutting down the server for it.

3611
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
So it just.

3612
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
It was on the failure board. Sorry.

3613
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
It seemed appropriate.

3614
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Other games that are going to be shut are getting their servers shut down as well.

3615
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:10,000
EA Create game which was supposed to take on LittleBigPlanet and that sucked.

3616
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,000
And EA Sports Active 2 which I didn't even know that had online.

3617
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:23,000
And the Xbox Live Arcade game Spare Parts is also going to be getting its servers shut down.

3618
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
On top of that Boom Blocks for the Wii.

3619
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Burnout Revenge for Xbox 360.

3620
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Damn it I own Boom Blocks.

3621
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,000
EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp for the Wii.

3622
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
FIFA 10 for the PSP and the Wii.

3623
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Godfather 2 for the PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

3624
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Need for Speed Pro Street on PS3 and 360.

3625
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And the Saboteur for PS3 and 360 is going to lose the access to the Midnight Club.

3626
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Which is some exclusive club but that was in the game if you preordered.

3627
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:01,000
And then on the 31st they're shutting down Battlefield 3 Aftershock for the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch.

3628
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
You know that game they just released.

3629
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
And a few other iPad games.

3630
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
But you know that $10 that funds that online pass.

3631
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
It costs a lot to shut a server down.

3632
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Yeah must be nice I hope they're refunding money.

3633
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Oh of course they're not refunding money because you got your online play.

3634
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
But just remember when you're paying for $10 for online for some of these games.

3635
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
If it's not popular they're just going to shut the server down.

3636
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
At least it wasn't as quickly as like say you know.

3637
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Oh what was that one MMO that was like Grand Theft Auto?

3638
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
That they just re-released for free.

3639
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
APB?

3640
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Yeah at least it wasn't that quick.

3641
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Dart Tetsuya in our chatroom says I called that section the online pass blooper reel.

3642
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I have to admit when I was reading all this news all I could hear in my head was.

3643
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Music

3644
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I mean those poor bastards that are buying some of those games used.

3645
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And now they're just going to be offline.

3646
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I mean shutting down the servers is nothing new.

3647
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,000
But now we have a game that people paid $10 to play online and it's not forever.

3648
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And I understand that these games may not have been popular or whatever.

3649
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And I'm sorry that's nice that it might not have been popular.

3650
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:33,000
But I don't know I mean I guess eventually it has to happen.

3651
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Figure out a way to consolidate then.

3652
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I mean I realize I'm talking out my ass here.

3653
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
But shouldn't there be a way where maybe you could consolidate some of the servers.

3654
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
And just have a computer that runs for whatever occasional game.

3655
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
You know like combine servers.

3656
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Yeah I mean I can't imagine that like you know EA Sports MMA.

3657
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
And the reason they shut them down is because not many people are playing them right now.

3658
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
But there's still a few people playing them.

3659
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Just drop them out of servers that you have.

3660
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Drop of the one.

3661
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
You can only have one person play online at a time.

3662
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Well I mean still that's better than none at all.

3663
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
And especially for people that paid.

3664
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Just unfortunate.

3665
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Alright well anyhow here's something else that's unfortunate.

3666
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
And kind of along the same topic of something we were just talking about.

3667
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
You know the Silent Hill HD collection just recently came out.

3668
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And apparently it's getting very very mixed polarized reviews.

3669
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I haven't played it myself yet.

3670
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
So I can't say one way or the other.

3671
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But you've got some people that are like yay it's Silent Hill it's in HD it looks great.

3672
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
And some people are like the game is fucking missing fog.

3673
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
The frame rate is hideous.

3674
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
The voice acting is terrible.

3675
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And it's gotten to the point.

3676
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I don't know if you want to call this entitlement or what.

3677
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Amazon.com is no longer stocking the game.

3678
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
That just came out two weeks ago.

3679
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Because there are too many user reports that there is a problem with the item.

3680
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So Amazon.com is doing an investigation to see if it's problematic.

3681
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
It didn't even come out two weeks ago. It came out last week.

3682
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Oh my gosh.

3683
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And you know what though?

3684
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I have to agree with them as far as the fog thing goes.

3685
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Because even the art director or whatever said hey we use a lot of transparent textures for fog.

3686
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
And you can even see there's a lot of objects that don't quite go all the way.

3687
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
They're not complete objects because the fog would normally be obscuring them.

3688
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And so without the fog it looks like oh hey look I've got these telephone wires that just disappear.

3689
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
What the hell? That doesn't make any sense.

3690
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
But what's interesting I tried to go to like I wanted to see what the user feedback was.

3691
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
So I went to Amazon.com to read some of the reviews and it's still kind of divided.

3692
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And like I don't know if that's like fanboys versus you know or what it is but it's very divided.

3693
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Because for like let me go to Metacritic real fast and do Silent Hill.

3694
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Now it should be noted the PS3 one is getting more flack than the Xbox 360 one seems to be.

3695
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So just to kind of put that out there.

3696
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Yeah the user score 5.1.

3697
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Six positive reviews. Five negative reviews.

3698
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
So you have some people that are giving it tens going I don't understand why people are hating on this.

3699
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Konami says relive the two best horror games of all time, strong graphics.

3700
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And then you get some people that are bombing it putting the game has far too many bugs to recommend to first timers or veterans alike.

3701
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And it's interesting you look at the scores.

3702
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Okay eleven people have reviewed the game.

3703
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Here are the scores.

3704
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Zero. Zero. Ten. Ten. Zero. Ten. Nine. Zero.

3705
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
And it's funny is that you have.

3706
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Nobody's in the middle. They're either all the way here or all the way there.

3707
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,000
You have to. That's a perfect example right there of what's wrong with review scores.

3708
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
And what's wrong with review scores by just average people sometimes.

3709
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Because those people are obviously fanboys.

3710
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Because a game. Trust me that game doesn't warrant a ten and it doesn't warrant a zero either.

3711
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
It's just. It's ridiculous.

3712
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Now to be fair the critics.

3713
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
The you know legitimate whatever you want to call it.

3714
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Critics. Although I think that's a shitty name.

3715
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Have given it. There's only three reviews up so far which is strange.

3716
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I thought more outlets have reviewed it.

3717
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
But you have a ninety, an eighty, and a seventy.

3718
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
So two good and one average.

3719
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I think it's been more average for sure.

3720
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I think that's what I've been reading out on the internet too.

3721
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
It's kind of like if you've never played Silent Hill.

3722
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
And the old games are too hard to get now then go ahead and play this.

3723
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
But otherwise get your PS2 and go hook up the old games because they were better.

3724
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I don't know.

3725
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Rama in chat says how the hell they fucked this game up I'll never know.

3726
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Well not putting fog in there.

3727
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
And I think was that only on the PS3 version or something like that?

3728
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Like they were saying oh well we had trouble rendering the fog.

3729
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Why would you have trouble rendering the fog on the Playstation 3?

3730
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Here's my other concern. Why did they feel the need then to put this game out now?

3731
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
It's not like we have a shortage of Silent Hill in the world right now.

3732
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
We just had Downpour. We're gonna have the Vita game coming out.

3733
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Why does this need to be out right now?

3734
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And okay let's just say that...

3735
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Go back and make it right.

3736
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Let's just say for whatever reason okay we can't do the fog.

3737
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Did anybody that was QA'ing that game realize hey it looks a little fucking weird that something that's supposed to not be there.

3738
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Or something that's supposed to be obscured by fog is just stopping in the middle of the air.

3739
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
That doesn't make any sense.

3740
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Maybe we should I don't know recreate the object or something like that instead of porting all the assets over and going.

3741
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Eh whatever close enough.

3742
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I mean seriously come on.

3743
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Just like spend the two seconds it would take to recreate the object or I don't know go back and fix it.

3744
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Was the Metal Gear collection this bad?

3745
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
It was fuzzy looking. I didn't like the look of it.

3746
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
But I don't think it was this bad.

3747
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I honestly haven't seen because Dan keeps playing the MSX versions.

3748
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Does it really have the MSX games in there?

3749
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Yes.

3750
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
In English?

3751
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Yes.

3752
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Nice.

3753
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I think it got the Metal Gear Solid collection got good reviews.

3754
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Sg100Matt in our chatroom says it's a fucking Playstation 3 how can it not render fog?

3755
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
That's a great question.

3756
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Why is fog on the PS3 difficult?

3757
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Fog in the same way they did it on the PS2 is probably difficult but ok.

3758
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Well take the time to redo it if you're gonna do this.

3759
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
That's exactly my problem.

3760
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Just like those fucking people at Capcom.

3761
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
They're complaining well we didn't know how to do local team play.

3762
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
In Street Fighter X2 we didn't want to bother to learn that.

3763
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Boo fucking hoo that you couldn't spend the time to figure out how to program your game.

3764
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,000
If you can't do any god damn programming then quit.

3765
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Because seriously you're of no use to us if you can't make a game.

3766
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Oh we had to make new assets for this game.

3767
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,000
You mean I couldn't just straight port the shit over and up the res the textures?

3768
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Yeah you may have to do a little bit of work.

3769
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Porkchop in our chatroom says maybe we'll have a DLC bundle.

3770
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
We'll call it the Fog and Dog Pack.

3771
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Maybe.

3772
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:03,000
AcidicVampire says maybe someone should file an issue with the Better Business Bureau and get the fog eventually implemented.

3773
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Don't give people ideas.

3774
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
But it's important to say this though.

3775
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Again the reviews were half and half.

3776
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
So not everybody's hating on it.

3777
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And Konami they've had issues with the Silent Hill series.

3778
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
They really have.

3779
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I mean.

3780
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Well Akira Yomoka going somewhere else didn't help.

3781
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Yes that's true.

3782
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I mean and it's not our show role but you know and as I mentioned weeks ago.

3783
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
The Vita version has been delayed.

3784
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
That's right again right to May or something?

3785
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Well the rumor is May right now but I don't think there's actually a date yet for it.

3786
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Wow.

3787
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
But yeah the Vita version's been delayed.

3788
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
They have one more chance.

3789
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Konami has one more chance at this HD collection thing.

3790
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,000
They've got the Zone of Enders collection coming out in the fall.

3791
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
So cross fingers.

3792
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Well if the Metal Gear 1 was pretty good and the Silent Hill 1 was not so good then maybe ZOE will be in the middle.

3793
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
And we're talking like porting different engines over.

3794
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
So maybe that has some issues.

3795
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
But come on.

3796
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Try a little harder.

3797
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:16,000
When did you think I mean come on you don't see any problem with hey you know that telephone pole just disappears.

3798
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:23,000
You know like or hey that part of the fence is missing it just goes nowhere because you had fog obscuring it before.

3799
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,000
It does also make me worry like if they can't render fucking fog like granted it's another company we're talking about here.

3800
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But is that Final Fantasy 10 HD remake gonna blow?

3801
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
And it's not that they couldn't render fog they couldn't render enough fog.

3802
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Like certain textures they couldn't render.

3803
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Needs more fog.

3804
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Seriously it's like how did you fuck this up?

3805
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Transparent textures the PS3 just can't do that.

3806
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Or Konami doesn't know how to do that.

3807
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Alright let's move into the mailbag.

3808
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Speaking of strong opinions and so forth.

3809
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

3810
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and picks.

3811
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Oh she got a little sticky tonight.

3812
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Picks a few of her favorite mails to read to us here in studio.

3813
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
All two of them.

3814
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com email us.

3815
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Greetings OLR it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

3816
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Last year when I bought my beast video card for my PC it came with Civ 5.

3817
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Rob I'm sorry but as much as I tried I was always so bored by it.

3818
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Get out.

3819
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
But last week I found the answer.

3820
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Quick pace.

3821
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Ever since I found that little option I can't stop playing the game.

3822
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Alright you can stay.

3823
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I used to be a huge German board game player and this is a very involved board game to

3824
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
me.

3825
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
And it was because you always talk about how great the game is.

3826
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Thank you very much for that.

3827
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Also I have a request for OLR.

3828
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
My wife of seven years just had her birthday and I was hoping that at the end of reading

3829
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
this email you could wish a very happy birthday to french fry.

3830
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
As always you are an integral part of my week your loyal turtle and filly series turtle.

3831
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Happy birthday french fry.

3832
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
What if I'm more of a fan of onion rings?

3833
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Can we give a shout out to onion rings?

3834
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Don't be a hoe.

3835
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Alright happy birthday french fry.

3836
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Happy birthday french fry.

3837
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
I like the sea salted french fries a lot at Wendy's just saying.

3838
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Last email.

3839
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Is there any relation to french toast?

3840
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
This is me staring at Rob with a, you didn't just say that face.

3841
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
This is me recycling the happy music.

3842
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Hearts.

3843
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I'm making hearts at Rob now.

3844
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Boy not eating makes you a bitch.

3845
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Does it?

3846
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I have lots of energy.

3847
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I've been drinking so much.

3848
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I'm just fucking with you.

3849
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
All the times by the way that I have been quiet I've been in the bathroom.

3850
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I'm doing nothing but drinking broth.

3851
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Okay.

3852
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Robert HM here.

3853
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm peeing nothing but broth.

3854
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I said drinking nothing but broth.

3855
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Never mind.

3856
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Next email yes.

3857
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I never heard your thoughts on the Muppets DLC pack for LittleBigPlanet 2.

3858
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Myself I enjoyed it but haven't gotten to sit down to get everything yet.

3859
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Relatedly, is that a word relatedly?

3860
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Sure.

3861
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:16,000
How do you feel about the level pack DLC for the game and possibly others staying hosted on the server?

3862
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Such as that the levels out at the time were inaccessible during the PSN outage.

3863
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I guess the only positive is that one doesn't have to wait for hundreds of megabytes at PSN speeds to download.

3864
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
It does update the game itself though.

3865
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Or is the content now being loaded in and I have no idea what I'm writing about.

3866
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:43,000
The LittleBigPlanet stuff is generally fun but frustrating content especially trying to get all the prize items.

3867
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I actually had no idea.

3868
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Okay confession time.

3869
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I loved LittleBigPlanet 1.

3870
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
I still haven't bought LittleBigPlanet 2.

3871
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:57,000
I'm waiting for it to go on sale and every time I check it's like still like 50, 60 bucks.

3872
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Granted it's the game of the year edition that comes with all the extra stuff but I'm kind of waiting for it to get a little cheaper before I buy it.

3873
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I just totally missed it.

3874
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
It came out at a time when a ton of other games came out so I never got around to getting it.

3875
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:17,000
And I want to get it so I can check out this Muppets DLC and all that so I'm not going to sit here and make up an opinion on something I haven't played.

3876
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
But I'm still interested in checking it out. I'll put it that way.

3877
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
As far as the server end stuff, I had no idea that was going on.

3878
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:32,000
That's weird though. Why would you not...

3879
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I don't get it because you either have to download it to your drive or you have to download it to play it server side even.

3880
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
It's not like it's doing an on live thing where it's streaming.

3881
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
It's like...

3882
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I don't think it could handle it.

3883
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
That's weird.

3884
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That sounds very like Final Fight Magic Sword locks you out when PSN is down type of thing to maybe prevent hacking and cracking like what we're seeing happen with Street Fighter X Tekken.

3885
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
And that's...

3886
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
You got something about that too coming up.

3887
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Sony needs to stop assuming that PSN is always going to be up because it's not.

3888
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Anyhow.

3889
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Very strange.

3890
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,000
So anyway. That's the last email.

3891
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Alrighty.

3892
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com to send us emails in the future.

3893
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Meanwhile, Loki.

3894
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Alright. Let's talk a little bit about hacking.

3895
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Not necessarily hacking of things that some people might find controversial but fan translated stuff for example.

3896
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:49,000
For example, there's two games that recently have been kind of hacked to translate them into English because no English versions were made available.

3897
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:55,000
One of those being Tales of Vesperia on the PS3.

3898
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Tales of Vesperia of course came out on Xbox 360 in the US but never on the PS3.

3899
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:10,000
The PS3 version, which I believe was superior to the Xbox 360 version and had a lot more content to that, was available in Japan.

3900
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:25,000
So what people are doing of course is hacking the game to actually use the Xbox 360 translation to translate the text in the PS3 version and of course doing their own translation for the new content.

3901
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And it's funny enough they said that actually the Xbox 360 translated version text was actually hidden in the PS3 code because you know you don't clean up your code.

3902
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
So they're working on translating that.

3903
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:45,000
They were originally doing the Tales of Graces but since that actually did get localized over here they stopped working on that when that announcement was made.

3904
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:59,000
And I guess of course they're saying that this will have a patch to the game and of course it will require you to have a jailbroken PS3 with a firmware of 3.55 or lower.

3905
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,000
And they're going to release documentation on how to patch your game if you wish to do so.

3906
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:20,000
And then on top of that there of course is another fan translated thing that actually finished and that is Fatal Frame 4 Mask of the Lunar Eclipse has been translated into English for the Nintendo Wii.

3907
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:41,000
And there's a big ol' effort with that. Of course you have to patch a version of the game that you have dumped to an ISO or you can always download a pre-patch version and run it from your hard drive because they made it so freaking easy to do that.

3908
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
But very interesting.

3909
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I don't usually endorse the piracy of games but if they're not going to release it here, they're not going to give you the opportunity, what other choice do you have?

3910
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Exactly. And if you had it before then you might as well translate it into English so you can actually understand it. Also it should be noted that they have fully translated it into Spanish and German and French translations are about halfway done as well.

3911
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,000
So it's pretty interesting.

3912
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Alright. Well Microsoft has put out an interesting patent. You know we sometimes get what's coming in the gaming industry from what's going on with patents.

3913
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:40,000
And Microsoft has patented this weird helmet device. It's a laser scanning virtual image display and it will display an image very close to your eyes.

3914
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Apparently by doing this the two displays could be in a helmet and you'd be able to see stereoscopic 3D. It's kind of a similar trick to what the 3DS uses except it's putting those images right in front of your freaking face.

3915
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It doesn't necessarily mean that this is limited to video games. Remember Microsoft is a PC company as well so it could be something that's used with general PC games.

3916
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:08,000
But it could be used in aviation as stated in the patent. Maybe this is going to be like a bitchin' flight simulator add-on or what do they call it now? They changed the name.

3917
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Microsoft Flight.

3918
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:12,000
You know what? It's the Lawnmower Man.

3919
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Actually I remember like 20 years ago renting from the local store. Don't ask why we did this but we rented a headset VR display.

3920
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,000
And all it was you put this headset on it fucking looked like something on Lawnmower Man. It was just a TV right in front of your eyes.

3921
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:34,000
And it was the amazing VR display you could play Super Nintendo games on.

3922
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:43,000
They had a VR type thing over at the boardwalk in Santa Cruz and you could play versions of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake.

3923
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:54,000
And I actually played Quake on that and it was terrible. It was like I had my eyes straight up to my PC screen and that was it.

3924
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Oh go ahead.

3925
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I was going to say yeah it's so immersive with the 640x480 graphics.

3926
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:05,000
And there's a 100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrady.com brings up the Virtual Boy. It was kind of a similar gag too.

3927
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:11,000
This image may be partially transparent so you can see the world around you.

3928
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So that way you can play your game and this sounds like something out of a giant picture.

3929
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
It's the game from Star Trek.

3930
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
So you can see the people laughing at you.

3931
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:20,000
No seriously from Next Generation where they had the little thing that shot lasers in their eyes. Oh.

3932
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
So you can see the people laughing at you for wearing a giant helmet.

3933
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Oh my god Chiggers at the exact same time you said that Chiggers in chat said it's like that Star Trek Next Generation episode and everybody will be zombies.

3934
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
You guys are both really big nerds.

3935
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:38,000
So.

3936
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Alright so there you go.

3937
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Before you even say oh this is the next Xbox.

3938
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
No.

3939
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Sit down. It's not.

3940
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
No we've been down that territory.

3941
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
OMG Microsoft Portable.

3942
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
No.

3943
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Sit down.

3944
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
You know that Wii prototype or the one that was fake would have been pretty fucking awesome.

3945
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Mm hmm.

3946
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
VR.

3947
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
DarkSakura what do you have for us.

3948
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Well as mentioned earlier Capcom is cracking down.

3949
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Basically a statement and I actually did read this on the Capcom Unity forums.

3950
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:18,000
But they're talking about people using the download character.

3951
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,000
The downloadable characters on disk using hacked Xboxes.

3952
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And one of the big guys at Capcom Unity said quite ballsy for folks to be taking hacked Xbox 360s on live where they are detectable.

3953
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:38,000
And they're also saying in any event we have open channels of communication with Microsoft on these issues Friday night.

3954
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And then they started asking people to take screenshots and record videos of the offenders.

3955
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:46,000
But they closed the video and said oh we'll catch them ourselves.

3956
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:51,000
They do realize that you can't take screenshots of a fucking Xbox 360 right?

3957
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Yes you can.

3958
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Well you can if you're a developer.

3959
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
But what if you have one of those capture cards?

3960
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Okay well that's a capture card but I'm talking about like you can't just.

3961
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:06,000
It's not like the Vita where I can push two buttons and take a screenshot.

3962
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
And it wouldn't.

3963
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
And there's iPhones and cameras.

3964
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
And we wouldn't have this problem if they didn't put the DLC on the fucking disk.

3965
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I agree.

3966
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:21,000
And this smells a lot like CD Projekt Red a few months ago.

3967
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
We're gonna catch those hackers.

3968
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And we're gonna let the hackers go.

3969
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
They're gonna be Batman. I'm Batman.

3970
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Well I mean I do agree with the point that you gotta be pretty bold to play this shit online.

3971
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Again it's kinda that gamer mentality you see sometimes.

3972
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And some gamers where it's like I gotta be the first and I gotta I'm gonna show these guys online that my penis is the biggest.

3973
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
And I'm using characters you're not supposed to have.

3974
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
You know it's a little bit silly.

3975
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Look at my E-Pain.

3976
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Exactly.

3977
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
But it's kind of a dumb thing to take it online where you know they're watching.

3978
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I like what Chigurh says. I will hit you with a coelacanth.

3979
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I'm moving on.

3980
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Logie.

3981
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So this is I'm sure a disappointment to some of the people who are actually playing.

3982
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:15,000
But Zynga has purchased the company OMG Pop. The makers of the game Draw Something.

3983
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:19,000
And of course they purchased them for quite a bit of money.

3984
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Including approximately $200 million between I guess a cash deal and $30 million or so for employee retention payments.

3985
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And of course you know they're gonna be working with them to create some new games I guess.

3986
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,000
In related news I deleted Draw Something this week.

3987
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I was playing it pretty hardcore for a little bit. I had like 15 games going at once. It was crazy.

3988
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,000
And I said nope I'm done.

3989
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:53,000
By the way there's another iPhone app you might want to check out if you are in the same boat I am.

3990
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
It's called Sharadium.

3991
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,000
C-H-A-R-A-D-I-U-M.

3992
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
It was free at least for a little bit. I don't know if it still is but you can check it out.

3993
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Now before you go saying well Rob if you don't like Zynga because they rip games off.

3994
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Why are you recommending another game that's a rip off of Draw Something?

3995
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Because it is a little bit different. It's not like a direct rip off.

3996
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Unfortunately one of the best parts of the game which is the whole Wheel of Fortune round isn't really in there.

3997
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,000
It's more of a chat type guessing thing.

3998
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But there's more paint styles and it's more of a robust paint program than Draw Something was.

3999
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
You don't have to pay for extra colors and shit.

4000
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
You have to pay for extra colors?

4001
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Oh yeah and Draw Something if you wanted more than just red. What was it? Red, blue, yellow and black were the only colors you could use.

4002
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:44,000
If you wanted green and purple you either saved up enough tokens from winning games or you had to pay 99 cents to get them.

4003
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
That's hilarious.

4004
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Oh yeah and I knew people that had tons of colors.

4005
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Well it's sad.

4006
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
You know what? Your money spent by which you won.

4007
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
And you know what though?

4008
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Until Zynga knew I spent 99 cents buying the legit add free Draw Something.

4009
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Because I'm like this is a great new game I want to support this.

4010
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
And then this happened.

4011
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Honestly I can't fault some of the employees at Zynga because they're just working but it's obviously the higher ups.

4012
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
It's the ones that are making the decisions.

4013
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
The executives.

4014
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I actually have some friends that work at Zynga and there's some really talented people which I'm like what are you doing working at Zynga but hey whatever.

4015
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Well it's just like how we talk about GameStop.

4016
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I know lots of people that work at GameStop that are great people and they're just people trying to get by and make a living.

4017
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I don't have a problem in the world with people that work at GameStop.

4018
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:41,000
You know and I even will go so far as to say they have some of the toughest jobs in the world and I respect that.

4019
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:46,000
It's some of the decisions that are made at a corporate level at GameStop that I have a huge problem with.

4020
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Yeah.

4021
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
That's the issue.

4022
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,000
So you know I imagine it's a similar situation.

4023
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Why else do you think that Dan keeps getting class action lawsuit checks after he hasn't been working there for six years?

4024
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Wow.

4025
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Just saying.

4026
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Very interesting.

4027
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
I want some class action lawsuit checks.

4028
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
How do I get in on that?

4029
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Work for GameStop.

4030
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Well they might try to go the other way around and sue me.

4031
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Alright.

4032
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Anyhow one more story for you guys tonight and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but not just yet.

4033
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:26,000
We have one more story for you guys tonight and it's another fucking Kickstarter.

4034
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
This is a trend.

4035
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I'm not liking this trend.

4036
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I'm just going to say it's just too much.

4037
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Everybody in the world wants a piece of this Kickstarter thing and it's like I'm sorry.

4038
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:40,000
It's kind of like those that got in on it early like the double fine and stuff.

4039
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Good for them but now it's just getting old.

4040
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:47,000
However there may be some folks that are really into this so good for you guys.

4041
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Tex Murphy may make a comeback.

4042
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Big Finish Games is going to start up a Kickstarter page on May 15th.

4043
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,000
That seems weird to me that you'd announce like six weeks in advance.

4044
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:05,000
We're going to start a Kickstarter but alright they're going to round up funding for a sixth game in this Full Motion Video Adventure series.

4045
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Oh God I remember these games.

4046
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Wow.

4047
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:15,000
On May 15th they're going to go live and you can donate to all this and the guy who plays Tex Murphy is on board.

4048
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And you can actually see him in a YouTube video where they're actually trying to kind of hawk the whole Kickstarter event.

4049
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:32,000
So I don't know it's like I don't want to hate Kickstarter but I just hate the trend thing is what it is.

4050
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:38,000
And I don't hate every campaign on Kickstarter but there's some that are pretty gross.

4051
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
But I've already talked about that on a previous episode.

4052
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:47,000
There's one in particular I saw that was downright offensive and I think people who contributed to it.

4053
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I think in some ways got suckered and swindled but that's your choice, your money.

4054
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Anyhow let's move on to happier topics or maybe worse topics.

4055
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:04,000
It's all up to you guys in the hands of the listeners because the Skype line is open now at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

4056
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4057
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Alright and going to our chatroom ddrdollarbill says I like the Tex Murphy games.

4058
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I'm not saying they were bad games.

4059
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:19,000
It's just this trend is a little strange and I'm not a big fan of this.

4060
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Alright so going to our Twitter while we wait for some calls.

4061
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Again it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

4062
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4063
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Going to the Twitter we have gamergirl who tweeted us and says I need to get a new TV.

4064
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Anyone got any recommendations as far as price and model goes?

4065
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I miss my games, cries.

4066
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I'm pretty happy with our Panasonic.

4067
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Toshiba makes good ones too.

4068
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
If you've got fries in town go to fries.

4069
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I have specials all the damn time.

4070
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Yeah don't buy anything on impulse.

4071
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
It's so hard for me to recommend you a specific TV gamergirl.

4072
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Do not get a plasma.

4073
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Get an LCD.

4074
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
It's so hard for me to recommend a TV gamergirl because I don't know what type of setup you have.

4075
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Do you have a gigantic living room that you want a gigantic TV to fill?

4076
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Or do you want something for your bedroom that maybe you're not going to be able to use the living room an awful lot.

4077
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Like if you want a bedroom TV and it's specifically for gaming because you said I miss my games.

4078
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Maybe you should look into that Playstation monitor that's out.

4079
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I hear it's not terrible and you could do the whole 3D games if you have the consoles to support it.

4080
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:29,000
But if you don't really have a Playstation 3 then that TV is kind of a waste.

4081
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:36,000
So something to think about. Again if you're going for a bedroom TV why not go for a computer monitor?

4082
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
You can get a cable that will hook an Xbox 360 up to the computer monitor.

4083
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
As well as a Playstation 3 can hook up to a computer monitor right?

4084
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
With a particular cable. Am I correct in that?

4085
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
In Japan.

4086
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
HDMI?

4087
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
HDMI yes it can hook up to a monitor.

4088
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Well HDMI you can hook it up through an HDMI to DVI adapter.

4089
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Otherwise they sell a device or they sell an actual cable in Japan that will do it.

4090
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
That I'm sure will work with the USPS3s.

4091
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room suggests Vizio. Best bang for the buck.

4092
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
That's actually what we have. I'm happy with the Vizio. That's the way to do it.

4093
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Rama says Samsung. Best TVs ever. Chigurh says Sony Bravia all the way.

4094
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:29,000
So gamer girl it's really hard when we don't know your circumstance and your budget to pinpoint one correct TV.

4095
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
But do your research. Do your research online. Read reader reviews.

4096
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Don't go to the store on a whim and let the sales guy know.

4097
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Yeah I need to get a new TV because I can't play games anymore.

4098
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Because they are going to try to take it to the cleaners.

4099
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Because they're going to know you need a new TV.

4100
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
And they're going to be like oh this chick's not going to leave for that one.

4101
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,000
It's like shopping for a car.

4102
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Yeah exactly. So...

4103
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Don't be afraid to say no and don't let them know you want it.

4104
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Exactly.

4105
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And don't buy a plasma.

4106
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Well now some folks in the chat room disagree with you.

4107
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Legend of Zaku says get a plasma. Very little lag.

4108
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Chigurh agrees though saying plasma hurts my eyes.

4109
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Niche or niche I don't know how to say that.

4110
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:14,000
It says plasma is better than LCD. WTF.

4111
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Disagree because with plasma you can also deal with more burn in in some cases.

4112
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I would say also Gamer Girl go to the store and kind of look at the TVs.

4113
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Especially a place where you're less likely to get hounded like Best Buy or even like Target.

4114
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Good with a furniture store.

4115
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Or Walmart even.

4116
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Oh furniture? I never thought to get TVs at a furniture store.

4117
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
RC Willy.

4118
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
So yeah go to a place where you're less likely to get hounded and just kind of look.

4119
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
And go oh I like the look of this.

4120
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Because then you can make your own decision on plasma versus LCD.

4121
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Maybe you'll look at a plasma and go I want this.

4122
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
And then you know you can.

4123
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
So I would do that.

4124
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I think a Target or a Walmart is a great place to look.

4125
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Because you're not going to get hounded by salesmen.

4126
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
You don't have to buy. Just look.

4127
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
In fact the TVs at Walmart are probably not.

4128
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I mean they're cheap for a reason. Remember that.

4129
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I actually super agree with Technus.

4130
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
If you have a membership to Costco, Sam's Club or BJ's.

4131
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
I recommend them because of the return policies.

4132
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Agree agree agree.

4133
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I think the best place in the world actually.

4134
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
And here we go with advertisements.

4135
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
But I'm saying it because I believe it.

4136
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I think the best place in the world to get a TV is Costco.

4137
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Because their return policy.

4138
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
It used to be a lot more generous than it is now.

4139
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Oh my God I had a TV break like two years after I bought it.

4140
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
And Costco took it back. I was astounded.

4141
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
They did that with us. They didn't have our model anymore.

4142
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,000
So we traded it in from a 58 inch to a 52 inch.

4143
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
And paid just another hundred bucks.

4144
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Me too. I was astounded.

4145
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,000
So I don't think their policy is as generous anymore.

4146
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
You have to have a receipt now.

4147
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Yeah. But yeah.

4148
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Just the price and the fact you don't get hounded.

4149
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And the selection I think is a great place to try it.

4150
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Alright anyhow.

4151
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Wow the phone's not ringing.

4152
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I hope it's working. 1877 game OLR.

4153
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Our username on Skype is orangeontradio.

4154
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Or the listeners are just being shy tonight.

4155
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
That's okay. That happens sometimes.

4156
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.

4157
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
It might have also just been a little bit of a slow news week.

4158
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
You know what I mean? Sometimes that happens.

4159
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Yeah. Why don't you just call and ask me a question people.

4160
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Dar Sakura wants attention.

4161
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I'm just checking.

4162
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
No. I'm just trying to get some life into the phone line.

4163
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I'm checking to make sure the 800 number is actually working.

4164
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Because it's been having some problems lately.

4165
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Yeah it's working.

4166
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
There it is.

4167
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
People who've got problems.

4168
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Alright. Anyhow.

4169
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Let's move on to a couple more tweets.

4170
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:44,000
We have Tiger Claw links us to a story about NASA helped with Angry Birds Space.

4171
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Oh yeah. That came out.

4172
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I forgot.

4173
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
But Angry Birds Space did come out.

4174
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:56,000
And apparently NASA collaborated in this with what's called a Space Act Agreement.

4175
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Why does NASA team up with this?

4176
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:03,000
It saw an opportunity to teach kids about space, science, and the laws of physics.

4177
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:08,000
And considering that NASA's kind of taken some hits lately with funding and all that,

4178
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I can see why they'd want to get on board with this.

4179
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:16,000
And you know, if I was a kid, I'd be really into this I think.

4180
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
So I think this is actually a good thing.

4181
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
I can't hate on this.

4182
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
A comment from, what is this?

4183
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Space Station Trajectory Operations Officer.

4184
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,000
It's a great way to demonstrate how we can use trajectories to get from one place to another.

4185
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,000
It's a really good example of how interplanetary probes can take gravity assets from other,

4186
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,000
or gravity assists, excuse me, from other planets.

4187
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Alright, hey, our phone line's lighting up now.

4188
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I think your hemming and hawing worked, Dark Soccer.

4189
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
We got a call.

4190
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

4191
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Hi, this is Zach Deff.

4192
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Hey, Zach Deff. What's up, buddy?

4193
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Just checking if Skype works.

4194
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Yes, thank you. It does work. We're good.

4195
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Well, what's on your mind? What have you been playing lately?

4196
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Not much, really. I have been playing mostly Team Fortress 2 on Steam and Forza 4.

4197
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Forza 4?

4198
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Yeah.

4199
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Forza, that's a series I never really got into because it's a little too pro for me,

4200
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,000
but what do you like about Forza 4?

4201
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Forza, pretty much, it's pretty much like Gran Turismo in the simulation sense.

4202
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:32,000
It's very precise, and when you have to accelerate turns and all that, it's like driving a real car.

4203
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:42,000
But the thing that Forza has as a series is that it has an arcade feel rather than a simulation feel.

4204
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Are you a car guy in real life? Do you like to mod cars and kind of pimp your ride and all that?

4205
02:42:49,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Somewhat. I do like cars, though I don't know that much to mod or modify cars like that,

4206
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:06,000
but I am a car aficionado in real life, so I do know some stuff.

4207
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Okay, so yeah, I just kind of notice usually the people that get into these games are car aficionados,

4208
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
and there's nothing wrong with that. Cars can be very sexy machines, even I recognize that.

4209
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:20,000
I don't necessarily drive a state-of-the-art car, but I even parked next to a guy today.

4210
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:26,000
I'm like, that's a sexy car. If I had more money, I'd want that car.

4211
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:35,000
But yeah, something that Forza has, it doesn't feel like a simulation at all.

4212
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:41,000
You have all the customization, you can paint your car, you can tune it out,

4213
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:47,000
and you can pretty much do everything with your car, and it also drives like a real car.

4214
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:53,000
But like I said, the moment you're playing the game, it doesn't feel like a simulation.

4215
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:02,000
It doesn't feel like Gran Turismo, where the races are hard because you have to make very precise turns and all that.

4216
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:11,000
And even though you have, but like I said, you have a lot of options that make it feel like an arcade racer rather than a simulation.

4217
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:18,000
I was going to say, are you a fan of arcade racers, like the split seconds, the blurs, the burnouts of the world?

4218
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Yeah, I'm a fan of both types of games, really, though I do mostly play arcade racers like Ridge Racer, the Dirt series, and all that.

4219
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Then tell me, am I right or am I right? F-Zero needs to be a Wii U launch title.

4220
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Oh yeah, it does.

4221
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Thank you very much. That's another series I need Nintendo to bring back from the dead.

4222
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Although, speaking of series coming back from the dead, don't forget Kid Icarus came out this week,

4223
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:50,000
and I've got it sitting in a box in my room, I haven't been able to play it yet, I've been kind of busy this weekend.

4224
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Yeah, I've been hearing that, that's pretty good.

4225
02:44:53,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I'm hearing, I was talking to Shane earlier about it, and he says the game's got a great sense of humor, he says he's reminded of Earthbound in the sense of humor,

4226
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:05,000
and I'm like, ooh, that's a big name to invoke around Nintendo.

4227
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,000
But that's pretty cool if it's got that sense of humor to it.

4228
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

4229
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
No, that will be all.

4230
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Alright, well take care buddy, have a good one.

4231
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
You too, thanks.

4232
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Bye.

4233
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I should have asked if he was into Mario Kart too, because Mario Kart's kind of a racer that's a little bit toned down so everybody can get into it.

4234
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:37,000
You know what I played randomly not that long ago was Mario Kart on the Wii again, I hadn't played that in forever, but it's still alright.

4235
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:43,000
One other tweet here from Tigerclaw at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, where you guys can send us tweets every week.

4236
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Scammers attempt to trick fans with promise of new Mass Effect 3 endings.

4237
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Oh, this is terrible. God, there's always scammers that read the gaming sites and seem to figure out what's going on.

4238
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Like, you see this with Blizzard all the time.

4239
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Like, how Mists of Pandaria Beta just came out this week, which, funny enough, I can't believe I didn't bring it up on the show.

4240
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Maybe because there's, you know, Horde House, the whole other show I have for that stuff.

4241
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:09,000
But yeah, the Mists of Pandaria Beta just started out of the fucking blue this week, which is a pretty big deal.

4242
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:13,000
But of course, scammers want to get in on that and try to rip off, you know,

4243
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Congratulations, you're in the Mists of Pandaria Beta. Click here to give us all your information so you can download the client, like your credit card number.

4244
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
And some people, unfortunately, fall for it.

4245
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Well, it's happening with the Mass Effect 3 ending stuff.

4246
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I'll come back to the story in a minute, but we have another call coming in.

4247
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

4248
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

4249
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Hey, Ranma, what's up?

4250
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Not too much, not too much. How about you, good friend?

4251
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Same old, same old. Just working, sleeping, playing Mass Effect.

4252
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Uh-huh, Mass Effect, I see that.

4253
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Yeah, what's on your mind?

4254
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Not too much, I was pondering to call and see if you have played Kid Icarus yet,

4255
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Because I'm more or less waiting on your review of the game before I go out and buy it,

4256
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:00,000
But from the last call, you haven't popped it open yet, so I'm kind of anxious about it.

4257
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Oh, god, I will have a review next week, I promise.

4258
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
I did buy it, I took a leap of faith and bought it.

4259
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I got it on Amazon, which is kind of funny, because I ended up getting, like, it was $39.99, right?

4260
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:19,000
They refunded me ten bucks, because I guess Best Buy or somebody else put it out cheaper,

4261
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:23,000
So they have that whole, if it comes out cheaper somewhere else, we'll refund your money.

4262
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

4263
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:30,000
That would kind of explain why I could not find it in Best Buy the last couple of days,

4264
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Because I just decided to walk in and check, just out of idle curiosity, nope, didn't have it.

4265
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Well, that means it's selling, which I guess is a good sign.

4266
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I would like for the series to come back.

4267
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I'm hoping the game doesn't suck, but the general consensus I'm reading on the internet is that the game is pretty damn good,

4268
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:54,000
But the controls are so bad, it ruins it for some people.

4269
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Like, there's a reason the game came with the little stand.

4270
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:03,000
That's kind of the general consensus I'm hearing, which is a little bit alarming.

4271
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:07,000
If the controls are that bad, it's going to ruin the game.

4272
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:12,000
But it's good enough to further explore the concept, is kind of what I'm getting.

4273
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Ah, okay, I get it. I get it now.

4274
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
There's also the 3D re-release of the original Kid Icarus.

4275
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Apparently, it's not just the ROM.

4276
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,000
I mean, this isn't a huge deal, but they went and added backgrounds, I guess, into it.

4277
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:30,000
So they did kind of give it a little something, something they didn't have before.

4278
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:36,000
That sounds interesting, because I'm kind of reminded of the times I used to sit there and play the Kid Icarus game for Game Boy.

4279
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Oh yeah, the kind of overlooked sequel that really did come out, yeah.

4280
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:48,000
You know, I was reading some people hating on Kid Icarus this week, because they were saying it wasn't that good of a game.

4281
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:52,000
And, oh god, that makes my heart hurt every time I read it, because I loved it.

4282
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:55,000
But it was a hard-as-nails game.

4283
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:00,000
It was a really hard game, and it did have some weird, quirky stuff in it.

4284
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:03,000
But, and it tried to do a lot.

4285
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Like, I think they kind of stretched themselves thin with, suddenly, it's a vertical scroller.

4286
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Now, it's a side scroller. Now, it's a dungeon crawler. Now, it's a shooter.

4287
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
You know what I mean?

4288
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
That's a bit of a mindfuck if you think about it.

4289
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:23,000
It is, but, I mean, for a child who was, you know, 8 years old with mild ADD, it was great.

4290
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Pretty much.

4291
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Maybe that's why it holds my attention so well.

4292
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Since we're on the topic of 3DS games, I'll make this quick before I bounce off.

4293
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I finally got around to playing Super Mario 3D Land.

4294
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Ooh, what'd you think?

4295
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Okay, I kept saying that I want a 3D version of Super Mario 3.

4296
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:43,000
That's what I've been screaming for.

4297
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:49,000
And this game pretty much comes close to my inner Super Mario 3 fandom.

4298
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
It comes close.

4299
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
It's really good.

4300
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I really think people don't give it enough credit for what it's doing to the franchise as a whole.

4301
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I think it's really good.

4302
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I mean, one of my main issues with the game is that all the levels are straightforward.

4303
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I thought maybe you'd be able to go to 1-1 and 1-2.

4304
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,000
You could just go down another direction, go to 1-4, this and that.

4305
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Oh, like in Mario 64, kind of?

4306
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
No, more like for the way it was in the original Mario 3.

4307
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Oh, I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4308
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Have you finished the game yet or no?

4309
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:26,000
I've fake finished it.

4310
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I don't want to say too much for spoiler reasons.

4311
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Okay.

4312
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Let me put it this way. It's got a Symphony of the Night-esque thing going on.

4313
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Yeah, I know.

4314
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I'm playing through the game.

4315
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:41,000
In the back of my mind, I'm like, I can't believe I'm going through the levels the way I am.

4316
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:45,000
It's like the difficulty kind of jumps around.

4317
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:52,000
And then at that last section, I thought it was done and then this whole more of it pops up.

4318
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
I'm like, Nintendo, what the fuck?

4319
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Exactly.

4320
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
What the fuck?

4321
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Yeah, right.

4322
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
But that's great.

4323
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
That's great.

4324
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,000
It's not often that games kind of invoke that feeling that you got when you realized,

4325
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,000
oh my God, Symphony of the Night, I'm not even halfway done.

4326
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:13,000
That's awesome.

4327
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:16,000
That's all I got to say is just...

4328
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Well, good luck.

4329
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:23,000
And you know, if you do well enough, you might get to be Black Luigi playing Luigi.

4330
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I've already gotten to that part.

4331
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Okay.

4332
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I like how they redid Luigi. I like that.

4333
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
It's more playable.

4334
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:38,000
All right. Anything else before we let you go tonight?

4335
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
No, that's it.

4336
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
All right. Take care, buddy.

4337
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,000
You too.

4338
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Bye.

4339
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Agdeft in our chat room says, Rob, it's a Mario game.

4340
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Do we really need spoiler alerts for it?

4341
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Well, look, I'm just trying to be nice.

4342
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
All right.

4343
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,000
We have another call coming in.

4344
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

4345
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Who's this?

4346
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
This is Shane.

4347
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Hey, you've been calling a lot lately.

4348
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:56,000
What's up?

4349
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I know, because I stay up later for some reason, which is probably why I fail at work more

4350
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:02,000
often than not.

4351
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
It's all good.

4352
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
This show's important, damn it.

4353
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Totally.

4354
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
What's on your mind?

4355
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:12,080
Well, I will say, first of all, this week I won't talk about Mass Effect, because I'm

4356
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:18,920
pretty sick of both fanatics on each side, and it's just disgusting me at this point.

4357
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:22,400
But I will call and talk about Kid Icarus.

4358
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:25,160
Ah, that's what our last caller wanted to know about.

4359
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:27,520
What do you think about Kid Icarus?

4360
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:28,520
It's fantastic.

4361
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:33,320
The way they pace the game with the terrible control scheme, because let's just be honest,

4362
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:40,380
if a game makes you hurt your hands while playing on purpose, it's got a terrible control

4363
02:52:40,380 --> 02:52:42,680
scheme.

4364
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:48,820
But the writing is so good, and I think the Earthbound comparison that I gave to you earlier

4365
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:56,100
is spot on, because it's witty, it's stupidly cheesy, it makes terrible puns, and it breaks

4366
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:59,120
the fourth wall constantly.

4367
02:52:59,120 --> 02:53:00,120
That's pretty cool.

4368
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:06,240
Maybe that's because Nintendo is, for whatever reason, and this makes me hurt to say, please

4369
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:11,400
don't be mad at me, fanboys, but maybe since Nintendo's kind of abandoned the Mother franchise,

4370
02:53:11,400 --> 02:53:17,280
maybe they're bringing Kid Icarus in as kind of their, you know, silly.

4371
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:19,200
Or do you think it's just because it's for four year olds?

4372
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:22,000
I think it's because it's made by Sakurai, is why.

4373
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Anything?

4374
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Yeah.

4375
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Alright.

4376
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,680
Well, he's got a great sense of humor, then, because...

4377
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:32,680
To be fair, in the interest of full disclosure, you're a big fan of Power Rangers and Pokemon.

4378
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:33,680
Yes.

4379
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:37,440
So, maybe the game's aimed at children.

4380
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:41,720
I don't know, when one of the lines is, it's like a birthday party where everybody's trying

4381
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:44,720
to kill me, I don't feel like that's really Pokemon.

4382
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:46,360
Hey, Shane.

4383
02:53:46,360 --> 02:53:47,360
Yes.

4384
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:51,720
Quick spoiler, because I forgot to talk about this last week during the segment that doesn't

4385
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:52,720
exist.

4386
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:53,720
Which game are you spoiling?

4387
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:56,840
Oh, real quick, I was just gonna say, hey, I bet you don't know that there's a Kinect

4388
02:53:56,840 --> 02:54:01,400
version of Power Rangers Samurai coming out later this year.

4389
02:54:01,400 --> 02:54:04,720
You mean the game I feel the urge to pre-order now?

4390
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:05,720
Yes.

4391
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:10,960
Because I will totally morph and punch things in the air.

4392
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:11,960
That's awesome.

4393
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:16,960
You know, I played the crap out of the Super Nintendo one.

4394
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:18,360
Oh yeah, that was great.

4395
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:19,360
That one was awesome.

4396
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:20,760
That was a really good beat-em-up.

4397
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:25,600
And there was a Die Ranger game that came out in Japan that I had the ROM for that I

4398
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:27,360
played the hell out of.

4399
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:28,360
I bet that was pretty good too.

4400
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:29,360
It was really good.

4401
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:33,200
The only one I was kind of disappointed in when I played it besides, you know, the newer

4402
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:36,600
stuff they put out was the fighting game on Genesis.

4403
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,840
Oh, that was painful.

4404
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:42,240
Have you already pre-ordered Black and White 2?

4405
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:45,680
I almost did from Playasia for the Japanese copies.

4406
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:47,880
Our chat room flailed at the mention of Pokemon.

4407
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:48,880
Pokemon!

4408
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:52,400
Well yeah, because everybody should be excited about that.

4409
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:58,220
And not to cross-promote shows or whatever, but I'm sure on Horthouse we'll talk about

4410
02:54:58,220 --> 02:55:05,440
this week, they datamined some of the pet battle stuff and it shows what's weak to what,

4411
02:55:05,440 --> 02:55:08,280
what's strong against what in some of the new attacks.

4412
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:13,080
So Pokemon in World of Warcraft is just going to make my day.

4413
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:15,440
That is pretty awesome, I gotta say.

4414
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:18,960
It's both the dumbest thing I've ever heard and the most awesome thing I've ever heard.

4415
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:22,720
It's like a movie that's so bad it's good.

4416
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:26,280
Yeah pretty much, and I will be doing that all the time.

4417
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:30,600
It's going to take away from leveling, which is kind of sad.

4418
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:32,040
So gosh, what else do I ask you about?

4419
02:55:32,040 --> 02:55:35,560
So thank you for the plug for Horthouse, that's good, we always try to cross-promote the shows.

4420
02:55:35,560 --> 02:55:40,440
And Kid Icarus, so you think Kid Icarus, because Rama said he's waiting for my review to check

4421
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:44,920
it out, but you're saying don't bother, just go get it, and you can play the game in ten

4422
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:48,720
minute bursts, so that way when your hand starts wanting to die, you can take a break

4423
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:49,720
and it's okay.

4424
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:55,840
Yeah, and I really like the way they scale the difficulty for you.

4425
02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:02,640
There's no hard easy mode, there's this bar and you wager hearts, and by wagering hearts

4426
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:07,720
you get better rewards, and the more hearts you wager, the harder the game gets.

4427
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:11,640
So if you lose, you lose a whole bunch of hearts, but if you beat it, you get better

4428
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:13,880
rewards, and the difficulty just skyrockets.

4429
02:56:13,880 --> 02:56:21,240
I almost died wagering to a 4.2 level difficulty, it was pretty hard.

4430
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:23,120
Is the eggplant wizard in the game?

4431
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:28,320
Yes, and that was one of my favorite puns in the entire game so far, and I'm gonna ruin

4432
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:30,520
it because I don't care, because it was so good.

4433
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:36,160
So there's lots of back and forth dialogue in the game, and it constantly happens, there's

4434
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:41,220
no cutscene for it, it's just you're fighting and oh, Palutena and Pit have to talk the

4435
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:42,400
entire time.

4436
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:48,320
So she's like, oh, remember the eggplant wizard and the nurses, and it previously would heal

4437
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:49,320
you?

4438
02:56:49,320 --> 02:56:53,160
And he was like, or Pit was like, yeah, I went there so often they named it after me,

4439
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:54,160
and she's like, what?

4440
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:56,840
And he's like, hospital, get it?

4441
02:56:56,840 --> 02:56:57,840
Hospital.

4442
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:01,600
Oh my god, that is terrible.

4443
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:02,720
Isn't it?

4444
02:57:02,720 --> 02:57:07,460
But it's just so funny when you're playing it, it's like, are you kidding me?

4445
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:08,460
This is great.

4446
02:57:08,460 --> 02:57:10,160
And it's all voice acted, right?

4447
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:12,440
Yeah, there's not any text.

4448
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:15,520
Oh, there's text, but I mean, it's all dialogue voice stuff.

4449
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:18,240
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

4450
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:22,840
Or when you are scaling a wall in one of the flying stages, and there's enemies pouring

4451
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:26,800
down on you, and you beat them all and you get to the top, Pit's like, yeah, take that

4452
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:27,800
wall.

4453
02:57:27,800 --> 02:57:29,880
I'm like, that sounds like something I would say.

4454
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:32,320
That is something you would say, actually, very much.

4455
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:35,480
That also sounds like something Dan would say.

4456
02:57:35,480 --> 02:57:37,400
It does, it does.

4457
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:41,720
Any online-ish components, StreetPass, SpotPass, any of that?

4458
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:46,640
Yeah, it does have, I believe, an online multiplayer, a local multiplayer.

4459
02:57:46,640 --> 02:57:55,560
I haven't done them yet, because I'm only to world four or five, because I fell asleep.

4460
02:57:55,560 --> 02:57:56,960
And then went back to playing Mass Effect.

4461
02:57:56,960 --> 02:58:00,960
Yes, and then I went back to playing Mass Effect.

4462
02:58:00,960 --> 02:58:05,320
It sounds like, from everything I've read, the multiplayer is really fun, and a lot of

4463
02:58:05,320 --> 02:58:11,320
the sort of high-risk, high-reward stuff happens in that too, because if you take, I guess,

4464
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:16,800
one of your better weapons into multiplayer, if you, when you take a good weapon in there,

4465
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:22,480
you take, you have a lower health bar, so it expects, if you have a good weapon, you're

4466
02:58:22,480 --> 02:58:27,640
going to be a better player, and I think that's really cool, because if I'm going to have

4467
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:31,440
a god weapon, I should only have a little bit of health, because I earned that weapon.

4468
02:58:31,440 --> 02:58:32,440
All right.

4469
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:35,960
Well, we've got to let you go to wrap up the show, but quickly, I know you said you weren't

4470
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:39,680
going to bring up Mass Effect, but I just have to ask one Mass Effect-related question.

4471
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:40,680
Yes, game's hot.

4472
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:41,680
Jack is the greatest character ever.

4473
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:42,680
There you go, answer.

4474
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,680
Yes or yes?

4475
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:44,680
What?

4476
02:58:44,680 --> 02:58:46,280
Sorry, say it again.

4477
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:47,720
Jack is the greatest character ever.

4478
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:48,720
Yes or yes?

4479
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:49,720
No.

4480
02:58:49,720 --> 02:58:50,720
Don't lie to listeners.

4481
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:51,720
But I do like Jack better in two.

4482
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:52,720
I mean, three.

4483
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:53,720
Don't lie to listeners.

4484
02:58:53,720 --> 02:58:54,720
All right.

4485
02:58:54,720 --> 02:58:55,720
All right, have a good one.

4486
02:58:55,720 --> 02:58:56,720
Shane.

4487
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:57,720
You too.

4488
02:58:57,720 --> 02:58:58,720
All right, bye.

4489
02:58:58,720 --> 02:58:59,720
Bye.

4490
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:00,720
That'll do it for the Skype line tonight.

4491
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,720
Thanks to those guys that got through.

4492
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:05,680
It was a little slow to begin, but then it started to fill up there at the end, so don't

4493
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:06,680
be shy next week.

4494
02:59:06,680 --> 02:59:07,680
You guys can get through.

4495
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:09,520
I've heard from some of my favorite people today.

4496
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:10,760
Oh?

4497
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:11,760
On the Skype.

4498
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:12,760
Oh, on the Skype line, yeah.

4499
02:59:12,760 --> 02:59:13,760
Oh, I thought you were-

4500
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:14,760
I'm especially...

4501
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:20,120
I'm pleased slash angry with Shane, because of all of the music that I got in trouble

4502
02:59:20,120 --> 02:59:24,680
for buying on Amazon after being in a turntable with him.

4503
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:26,840
Oh, you guys turntabling this week?

4504
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:29,320
We did two nights ago.

4505
02:59:29,320 --> 02:59:30,320
Nice.

4506
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:31,320
Yeah.

4507
02:59:31,320 --> 02:59:36,200
I don't remember because I can't remember anything, but I got in trouble for all those

4508
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:37,600
music I downloaded.

4509
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:40,840
I have good music, yay, but I'm poor boo.

4510
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:45,920
There is an unofficial official turntable FM after party for Orange Launch Radio that

4511
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:48,720
Hitstun puts together, so it's kind of one of those.

4512
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,160
We endorse it.

4513
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:52,400
It's not us doing it, but we endorse it.

4514
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:53,560
I love turntable FM.

4515
02:59:53,560 --> 02:59:54,560
It's a great site.

4516
02:59:54,560 --> 03:00:00,240
It's one of the greatest things to happen to music in a long time since iTunes.

4517
03:00:00,240 --> 03:00:05,720
All right, anyhow, I want to quickly say I never finished up the tweet from earlier that

4518
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:08,040
TigerClaw sent us, the whole scamming thing.

4519
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:13,240
The new scam is Mass Effect 3, and there is a spam email going out, and I can't believe

4520
03:00:13,240 --> 03:00:16,000
people are falling for this, but unfortunately it's working.

4521
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:21,440
You download a zip file containing a password-protected downloader for the supposed new ending, and

4522
03:00:21,440 --> 03:00:26,720
a text file in the zip tells you to go to a website where you do offers to get the ending.

4523
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:28,960
I mean, this is shady as hell, right?

4524
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:30,440
So don't fall for this stuff.

4525
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:33,280
And then I'm sure the executable is a virus.

4526
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:36,560
If something legit happens, it will be all over the internet.

4527
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:42,440
We'll not only report on it here on the show, but if you can't wait until Sunday, just seriously.

4528
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:44,080
The Mass Effect 3 stuff has been so big.

4529
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:45,080
I don't know.

4530
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:46,560
That sounds kind of legit to me.

4531
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:49,720
I see stories on my news.google.com.

4532
03:00:49,720 --> 03:00:55,440
I used to kind of get the aggregate news a lot, and Mass Effect 3 is always in the technology

4533
03:00:55,440 --> 03:00:57,440
stories.

4534
03:00:57,440 --> 03:01:01,960
Anyhow, that's it.

4535
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:02,960
That's it for calls.

4536
03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:06,080
That's it for tweets, and I think that's it for another episode of OLR.

4537
03:01:06,080 --> 03:01:09,920
Quickly, though, before we wrap it up and say good night, I need to ask if there's any

4538
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:10,920
last-minute stories.

4539
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:13,480
Dark Soccer, Loki, any last-minute stories you want to get out tonight?

4540
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:14,480
No.

4541
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:17,760
Nothing I want to get out.

4542
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:22,440
Do you have a day on chat that says it's happening for the Guild Wars 2 beta, too?

4543
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:23,440
That's unfortunate.

4544
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:25,080
I really wish I was getting in that beta.

4545
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:30,320
Well, maybe you'll get your zip file executable, and then you can download the password from

4546
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:31,320
a website.

4547
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:32,320
Stop.

4548
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:33,320
Stop.

4549
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,320
All right.

4550
03:01:34,320 --> 03:01:37,240
Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

4551
03:01:37,240 --> 03:01:40,560
Dark Soccer, what's your final thought for the listeners tonight?

4552
03:01:40,560 --> 03:01:42,280
I want pizza.

4553
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:44,320
Wait, we can't do final thoughts.

4554
03:01:44,320 --> 03:01:45,320
You know what?

4555
03:01:45,320 --> 03:01:46,320
We skipped something.

4556
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:47,320
What?

4557
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:48,320
We never did the FUs of the Week.

4558
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:49,320
Fuck.

4559
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:56,880
I'm just not angsty, Rob.

4560
03:01:56,880 --> 03:02:04,800
Well you can do a thank you, or bless you, or whatever you call it.

4561
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:07,800
Actually, I do have a fuck you.

4562
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:14,120
To the guy who is setting up the booth outside of Walmart that said get rid of Obama, vote

4563
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:19,280
Republican, with a very poorly handwritten sign, first of all.

4564
03:02:19,280 --> 03:02:24,160
If you want to draw the right attention, you need a better designed sign, just saying.

4565
03:02:24,160 --> 03:02:30,000
Two, don't vote in Satan to get rid of a guy who's doing good, just saying, even if you

4566
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,000
don't like him.

4567
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:38,560
Don't vote in the devil, because, seriously, they're all evil, evil, evil, evil.

4568
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:42,280
And a fuck you to my stomach for rumbling, I'm going to have to put some more tea in

4569
03:02:42,280 --> 03:02:44,520
you when I get home.

4570
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:45,520
I like fasting.

4571
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:48,040
I really do feel great, except I'm hungry.

4572
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:49,040
That's it.

4573
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:50,040
Logie?

4574
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:59,400
Um, I guess, uh, I have to be tired, because I've had to work hard the last few days because

4575
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:07,520
I've had to watch Josh instead of going to work and give me at least a lunch break.

4576
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:14,240
My a few of the week goes to internet drama, because it's very, very serious.

4577
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:15,240
The internet's serious business.

4578
03:03:15,240 --> 03:03:23,960
It is serious business, and our lives depend on internet drama.

4579
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:27,840
Porkchop in our chat says orange launch radio is linked to aggressive and violent hosts.

4580
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:28,840
Possibly.

4581
03:03:28,840 --> 03:03:33,680
All right, uh, last minute, or excuse me, now our final thoughts, because we did last

4582
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:34,680
minute stories.

4583
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:35,680
Final thoughts.

4584
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:36,680
So Darkstalker, you get another go at it.

4585
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:37,680
What's your final thought?

4586
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:38,680
Tea.

4587
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:42,080
Uh, my final thought of the night is broccoli beef.

4588
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:43,960
Logie, your final thought tonight?

4589
03:03:43,960 --> 03:03:48,440
Uh, there are a lot of good projects on Kickstarter, so be sure to check out Kickstarter, but there

4590
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:53,800
are a lot that seem, you just have to look at it and how professionally it's being approached

4591
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:58,680
and stuff, and some of them are quite sickening to the amount of money that they raised for

4592
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:04,700
what they've raised it for and for how long those certain things were going for prior

4593
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:09,360
to putting a Kickstarter up, if you know what I mean.

4594
03:04:09,360 --> 03:04:12,760
I think that's as vague as I can get.

4595
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:17,720
All right, and, uh, let's see, my final thought tonight, oh no, I did my final thought.

4596
03:04:17,720 --> 03:04:18,720
Hello.

4597
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:20,360
Sorry, I got distracted by chat.

4598
03:04:20,360 --> 03:04:23,360
But I will say this, this is the segment I always say at the end of every show, it's

4599
03:04:23,360 --> 03:04:25,400
the final final thought from all of us.

4600
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:30,220
If you like Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show, leave

4601
03:04:30,220 --> 03:04:33,280
us a nice review somewhere, spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

4602
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:36,880
You know, we do this show commercial free because we love the community, that's what

4603
03:04:36,880 --> 03:04:40,600
it's all about, so all we ask in exchange, help our community grow.

4604
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:45,800
I've seen a lot of you guys give us links on your blogs, that's awesome, I've seen little

4605
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:50,840
signatures on sites, somebody inevitably on every forum ever starts a what podcast do

4606
03:04:50,840 --> 03:04:55,240
you listen to thread, and people kind of say, I listen to OLR, and that's awesome, we appreciate

4607
03:04:55,240 --> 03:04:56,240
all of that.

4608
03:04:56,240 --> 03:04:59,800
So please, please help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

4609
03:04:59,800 --> 03:05:04,120
That's it for tonight, guys, we'll be back to do it all again next week, right?

4610
03:05:04,120 --> 03:05:08,600
It's a new month, it's going to be April next week, so crazy, crazy.

4611
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:12,240
And remember, portal gun for me for my birthday, just saying.

4612
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:13,240
Yeah, that's right.

4613
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:17,100
Dark Stalker's birthday is in April, so what can I say, it's going to be a crazy month,

4614
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:20,800
so we'll see you next week to do it all again here at Orange Launch Radio, have a great

4615
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:21,800
week, be safe.
