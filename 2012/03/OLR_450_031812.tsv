10148	12309	Sky, and Loki.
14130	20133	Tonight, March 18, 2012, a new handheld will let you experience an old system all over again.
20474	26697	Diablo III finally gets a release date, and one fan goes to the feds over a controversial video game ending.
31707	36932	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37172	38773	Orange Lounge Radio.
38914	42096	We are live with episode number 450.
42557	45920	A nice round number of our show on this March the 18th of 2012.
48442	56469	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
56509	59332	A big thank you to them for letting us steal their bandwidth.
59792	60813	My name is Rob Roberts.
60913	65477	It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but I'll be guiding you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
65817	68740	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
69140	69341	Buh.
69721	70141	How are you?
70422	70602	Buh.
70862	71563	Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
71843	72023	Buh.
72263	72523	All right.
72764	73144	Hi, Rob.
73464	73624	What?
74065	74185	Hi.
75706	77167	I see you're wearing a red shirt tonight.
77487	77968	Yes, I am.
78008	79088	With a Star Trek logo.
79208	80389	So you're just waiting to get shot.
80729	81710	No, it's engineering.
81910	82230	I see.
82530	83131	So you're safe.
83711	84312	Yeah.
84852	85152	All right.
85292	86833	No falling objects on Jamie tonight.
86993	93157	No, usually just, you know, the core will overheat and they'll have to close down engineering and someone will fall into the antimatter.
93457	94138	But that won't be me.
94218	95779	But you can't mix the matter with antimatter.
97009	98830	No, you can't do that.
99571	103353	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki, joining us every week.
103493	103913	Hello.
104053	104613	How are you, Loki?
104934	105774	I'm fine.
105794	106815	You've got your Vita out.
107435	107755	Yes.
107995	108636	Playing Vita.
108936	110357	He's taking his Vitamins.
110377	116520	I'm trying to have my Vita see my phone so it can tether to it so I can download something.
116560	119362	Actually, no, downloading over 3G would be really fucking slow.
119382	120303	Maybe I shouldn't do that.
120623	121723	Yeah, it would be very slow.
121743	122464	Yep, never mind.
122524	122924	Skip that.
123224	124005	Yeah, that's what I thought.
124025	124325	All right.
124705	125786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
146445	149148	But, he's a name that should be familiar to all you guys.
149449	152793	It's our webmaster, VXJasonXV is here tonight.
152853	153373	Hi Jason.
153413	154114	Hi OL Army.
154374	154995	How are you?
155596	156957	Um, exhausted.
157078	160882	Buses are, doing nothing for upwards of a day is very tiring, go figure.
161002	163025	You're not much of a flyer, you're a busser.
163185	166749	Not anymore, unfortunately, so I get to deal with day or multi-day trips.
166929	170390	Well, now that they take nudies of you at the airport, I can understand.
171091	174112	Another very good reason why I decided to stop going to airports.
174152	176833	Where your hesitation comes from.
177593	178854	Some people want to charge for those.
180314	180894	So, let's see.
180934	181895	It's been about eight years.
181975	182455	How have you been?
184616	187277	I've been older, I guess, since you put it in those wonderful terms.
189797	193100	I've lived in three different states since the last time I was on the show.
193140	200286	I moved out of New Mexico to Arizona around the middle of 2000 and then a couple years later moved out to Colorado where I've been for about the last five.
200946	205350	Bought a house and things are progressing in the life kind of way.
205890	213857	When Dark Tetsuya interviewed me, I mentioned that in the last year I've actually been a part of a podcast of my own called the Ask Different Podcast.
213877	216119	Plenty of Apple nerdiness and whatnot.
216799	217960	Are you still doing it or did that stop you?
243553	251158	We've been off for the past couple of weeks, primarily because I've been on this trip, and one of the other co-hosts has been sick, so it hasn't been working out so well.
251178	256722	But the last episode was just posted, should have either been the first week of the month or just before that.
257082	260564	It's been regular since the start of winter, at least.
260624	263166	We had a little winter hiatus, but it's been regular since.
263386	264187	It's been taking its fiber.
265359	266380	I'm not on a spending money trip unfortunately
280859	281299	I refuse to conform.
281459	284641	This is also temporary housing, too, so we don't plan to stay here forever, but anyway.
305029	309211	Let's see, so let's talk a little bit about your history here on OLR.
309291	319995	So the last time you were on this show, just put it in perspective, we were still a show primarily about music video games and DDR, Beatmania, Parappa, all that stuff.
320475	322316	So you still playing music games?
323176	325177	Um, occasionally, every once in a while.
325297	342925	It's usually one of those things where if somebody we know is over that has never heard of them before, we like to... I have a homemade poppin' music controller, full-size, you know, 2 ratio and whatnot, and so we throw in one of the versions and play some hard songs, and they get a kick out of this loud, clacky game with an oversized controller.
344586	366161	I try to keep up on the 2DX console releases unfortunately the arcade that did have a machine nearby went to Utah in the past couple of months so some of the arcade avenues have disappeared for me but I try not so much DDR as much as other things and it's you know it's still interesting because I still adore the music I still listen to it any chance I get
367482	372565	Even in the new 2DXs, you forgive the music, because I'm kind of not a big fan of where Bomani music went.
372665	374206	It's not as good as it used to be, in my opinion.
374366	377848	Video game music, music in general follows a flow with me.
378088	384652	I have to have an association with it, and as of Empress, I don't have an association with it anymore, so no, it's not as interesting to me.
384952	390515	There's a couple of gems here and there, but if you ask me to pick a favorite, I would probably go back to 6th, 8th style.
392182	420093	Back when it was the classics You were a moderator on DDR Freak I was, I think technically I might still be listed as one DDR Freak closed, I don't know if you heard I was still listed as one and I hadn't looked at the site in years I'm a highly active moderator as well I told them, I think it was about three years ago When I was kind of saying that I'm not going to be around the site as much anymore Because I just don't feel relevant anymore I don't feel that I'm relevant with it anymore
421213	430779	And I guess I heard that that was happening, and maybe I did hear that it closed down, but not going to the site anymore and seeing the page means that it doesn't really, you know, it's not any different to me.
430819	432019	I wasn't going to be there to look at it anyways.
432039	436822	I think it's still there, but the forums are all, it's, and the forums were the last great hurrah.
436842	442385	I think that and the machine locations, which I think kind of got dusty, so I don't think, you know, they're really doing...
442705	448308	Pretty much all the hardcore Bimani nerds, as far as I know, unless there's other sites I'm not aware of, are on Bimani style at this point.
448448	451010	Bimani style, Aaron in Japan is still very prominent.
451030	451370	Oh, is it?
451470	454592	And Zenis I, Vanisher is the trendy name of the week.
454612	454952	I know that.
455212	455633	No, I know that.
455773	456953	But they've been around a couple of years.
456973	457614	I know them.
457734	457954	Yeah.
458554	459075	So, okay.
460175	463616	Um, gosh, what else do I ask a man who hasn't been on the show in eight years?
464016	465357	Let's talk about eight years ago.
465417	466597	You and I went to E3 together.
466857	467477	And Dear Friends.
467697	468097	That's right.
468278	469478	Oh, gosh, yes.
469558	470798	That first Dear Friends concert.
470818	473339	Last time I was on the show, Nobu was still part of Square.
475720	481321	That was the night, and I know I've told this story on the show many times, but that was the night where we were surprised.
481361	482342	Remember this case?
482442	486723	I don't even... Like, you and I got tickets, or I think I bought tickets and you bought one or something.
486743	489644	I don't even remember how we did it, but you and I ended up going to this thing together.
490034	490955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
509929	510870	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
539909	540950	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
558172	560776	So he can get to his seat that's blocked off.
561496	565001	And so that was like our brush with greatness right there.
565021	571129	Because obviously the man, Final Fantasy was the music for so long.
571209	576536	So just kind of being able to have that as part of the experience of going to a concert all about the music was amazing.
576696	580963	Believe me, I've told that story my fair share of times to nerds that would appreciate it as well too.
581283	584288	And it's funny because that wasn't even the section that you wanted to buy tickets for in the first place.
584308	585550	You wanted to be one more section up.
585610	586011	It wasn't.
586051	587213	And they were completely sold out.
587233	590698	So you're like, okay, let's upgrade then and not downgrade an orchestra section.
590738	591560	Yeah, let's do it.
592816	597979	I was like, well, yeah, because at that time, A, I was a 20-year-old with no responsibility whatsoever.
598439	601340	B, it was kind of like, you know, why not?
601981	603641	How many times are they going to do a concert like this?
603661	605442	We didn't know a tour or anything like that.
606083	607703	Now, you and I didn't go to More Friends.
608524	610505	More Friends was not as good, sadly.
610805	612126	They had a lot of problems with that venue.
612166	615128	But anyway, we won't dwell on the negative, just the positive.
615588	617489	But was that the only E3 you ended up going to?
617529	619051	Yeah, I've only ever been to 04.
619851	622213	I don't think I've even been back in the state since 2004.
623213	627716	And again, to put it in perspective, the big thing they showed off that year was the Nintendo DS.
628016	629417	Not the DSi, not the DS.
629577	630838	And Pokemon XD.
631999	633960	They had a very big corner of that, I remember.
634181	634781	And how was E3?
634821	634861	Uh...
637805	640045	Oh god, I don't even remember E3 to be completely honest.
640306	649327	I mean, that was one of those things where I came out and it was, you know, finally putting faces to names of so many people because it was the big, the four of us in the room here now were a part of it.
649407	657689	Obviously I flew out with DDR Freak so there was a whole bunch of people whose names I know and talked with frequently, I can finally be in person with.
659470	665991	E3 was, for a gamer, it was fun because there was plenty of things to look at and get your hands on and
666851	693274	G4 was still prominent back then they had the orange booth last that that year if you remember and all the college kids running around interning for him and whatnot I'm trying to think of one specific thing about the show that was exciting and minus the Konami booth which is kind of a given and the fact that Square had a humongous Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 11 was prominent back then WoW wasn't even the MMO of the year WoW did not exist at that point
694314	696035	They might have been showing the early stuff about it.
696075	696515	I don't remember.
696535	697336	It was too long ago.
697376	698996	You even PVP'd at E3.
700337	702198	Oh, that was the year I won the computer.
702418	702658	Yeah.
703198	706440	The old show computer was won in a Final Fantasy XI event.
706520	707620	Yes, I did.
707800	709821	I won the... Thank you, Square, for the old computer.
710341	711262	Although we don't use it anymore.
711502	711822	Let's see.
711882	712442	What was in there?
712522	715384	The Gizmondo, I think, was still being... The Phantom.
716124	717144	Yeah, the Phantom.
717405	722727	They hadn't relegated themselves to a keyboard yet, but the Phantom was still very prominent there, right behind Konami, as a matter of fact.
723880	733380	I will never forget the experience of walking in there the first time and the very first thing I saw at E3 was Konami's booth and the big game they were doing that year was Silent Hill 4 The Room
734707	737408	That was the coolest setup I'd ever seen.
737428	738468	That was not awesome.
738488	741029	And it was just kind of like, wow, it's like I'm at the state fair.
741930	743150	But it's all about video games.
743170	746211	It was Silent Hill 4 and Metal Gear Solid 3, wasn't it?
746311	747992	Yeah, they kind of had both going on.
748032	754674	Yeah, but I just remember the big setup with all the little like... The inner room with the eight or so systems and close proximity.
754754	755874	It's a room!
758035	758876	And you're in it!
760643	790227	and you're playing The Room which I still I started and speaking of this since we're talking about that game specifically I had a little Silent Hill Marathon week a while ago I replayed through the first three I replayed the first one I've done that before I played two and three started to get to four and I guess it worked that time because it kind of creeped me out I wasn't I couldn't actually make it through that game just the pace and the ambience and what not got to me for some reason and I actually didn't wind up making it through that one I'll have to try again someday
790680	791100	Thanks for watching!
806774	808877	Oh shit, they released a new Silent Hill game!
809437	810859	I totally fucking forgot about this!
811099	815623	Yeah, Silent Hill Downpour came out, and Shane is sending me private messages here.
815744	820168	Apparently, and this is like a tiny spoiler, but not really, it's not a story spoiler, don't worry.
820508	828577	He says that you totally get to visit Henry's room from Silent Hill 4 as an Easter egg, and it's still locked from the inside, so I guess they're...
828857	829478	Thanks for watching!
846371	848031	Yeah, because that would have sucked.
848412	851992	No, I'm confused with the fact that... So, was his room supposed to be in Silent Hill?
852333	855493	Like, the actual room part?
855533	857614	I mean, because... I don't get it.
857814	861015	I mean, I remember there was the portals to Silent Hill, but was his room supposed to be in Silent Hill?
861035	864136	Do you know how many years it's been since I've played Silent Hill in the room?
865036	866356	Would it be eight, by chance?
866376	868197	And I would have thought that this would have stuck with you?
868337	869737	I mean... No.
870537	870817	Anyhow.
871778	872578	I'm just trying to figure it out.
872598	873338	It was all a dream.
873478	873899	It was all a dream.
873939	874179	All right.
876000	878501	Let's talk about the video games you've been playing this week.
878541	884463	We always talk a little bit about how is your gaming week and what video games you've been playing, whether it be new or whether it be eight years old.
885704	887504	DarkSakura, hi, how are you?
887544	888225	How was your gaming week?
890666	891166	I have another 85.
891206	895588	And she's a Hobag dealer.
898302	899102	She's a ho-bag.
899662	901263	I'm dressing her as slutty as possible.
901383	902143	So you're a blood elf.
902543	903463	Yeah, and well.
906984	911745	Of course, I honestly thought we were talking about Saints Row or something like that at first.
912205	913725	I kind of fell off that train of thought.
913765	916226	I should have known better, but I fell off somewhere.
916246	921587	You know, there's a big reveal coming tonight about Mists of Pandaria, which is the next expansion.
921647	922707	Panda people, I don't know if you've heard.
922987	923667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
941295	943397	But, there have been some early leaks.
945038	949382	When you have an NDA for a week, inevitably somebody's gonna, it's too hot for their hands, they gotta let it out.
949723	951624	So we've seen what the female pandas look like now.
951724	956068	They look like red pandas, although some are saying that could just be one coloring.
956308	957449	I think it's just a coloring.
957629	963695	And then some of the videos that show off some of the dungeons, I gotta say, that temple of the Jade Serpent looks amazing.
964275	966237	So, can't wait to get in some of those new instances.
966337	966898	I looked at it.
967078	967798	I thought it was pretty cool.
968179	968319	Mm-hmm.
972024	974225	I tried to play some more Star Mine, but I'm actually stuck on a puzzle.
974785	977167	So, that's really about it.
978127	981849	And I watched Scott Pilgrim again for the 50 millionth time on St.
981869	982389	Patrick's Day.
982449	983149	What possessed that?
983450	984010	We were bored.
985691	988012	I also learned a new game.
988352	990393	It's called How Not to Blow Up the House with a Pressure Cooker.
991233	991674	Good idea.
991694	992914	My first time using a pressure cooker.
993575	994055	Made corned beef.
994955	995676	It was epic!
995956	996716	Under pressure.
997977	998917	Loki, how was your gaming week?
999917	1001018	I played a few things.
1002218	1003079	Actually, it's kind of funny.
1003119	1016144	I'm thinking of going to just dedicating a month to playing PlayStation games because I realize I have all these games on my PS3 that I'm just not playing.
1016344	1017405	And not enough trophies.
1018305	1018945	That is true.
1020466	1022827	The trophy level is quite small at this point.
1023527	1027608	But no, it's like LittleBigPlanet 2, I have to play through that still.
1027768	1033730	I have Infamous that I got from the whole fallout from the network being down that I had to play through.
1035891	1037052	and I'm sure there's some other games.
1037472	1043914	I want to go back and play through Resistance 1, 2, and 3 actually because I played through 1 all the way and I loved Resistance.
1043974	1048776	Resistance was, to me, when you compare Resistance and Halo 3, Resistance by far, way better game.
1050377	1055339	But I kind of want to go through 2 and 3 and play through those before I get the Vita 1.
1056099	1081015	So anyways, so stuff I actually did play, I played Journey, I bought that game, it's an amazing game, very short, but who cares, you can play through it a bunch of times, and it's just, it's a beautiful game, it's one of those games that, like, I had people over, I'm like, hey, you gotta see this game, because it's really beautiful, so And the big spoiler last week, I was trying to hide, but it was brought to my attention from Bobby, that it's revealed in the trailer, so oops, my bad, but it's a multiplayer game
1081736	1102936	and you don't I knew nothing about Journey going into it but when I say it's a multiplayer game you can't talk it doesn't work like other online games you have one emote and that's the little chirp that you do you can't type, you can't talk you don't even know who it is that you're playing with and you might think, god that sounds basic as hell you don't know until the end
1103576	1109681	Well, yeah, yeah, I will show you their little, I keep wanting to say gamer tags, but PSN IDs or whatever they're called at the very, very, very end of the game.
1110261	1113384	But until that point, you have no idea who it is and you can't really communicate.
1113444	1115285	And you might think, God, that seems so basic.
1115325	1118627	But at the same time, it's brilliant in its simplicity, isn't it?
1119148	1122971	Because even, like, why do we hate to play games online these days?
1124520	1126903	Fag, fag, fag, stop being such a fag.
1126943	1128625	You play with a fag, you noob fag.
1129025	1130667	That's why I can't play games online.
1130727	1132509	I have to mute everybody.
1132909	1143401	But the fact that Journey kind of scales it back and you have this experience or whatever with somebody else where you communicate through this new method of communication, the little chirping, is neat.
1143881	1147084	I didn't mean to dominate your conversation, but I had to get that out since last week.
1160713	1161413	I played some stuff on the Vita
1180278	1204126	mainly just I went back and played a little bit more Motorstorm RC still kind of frustrated the controls and that because like I'll be doing like a perfect lap and then like I'll run into the AI character or run into a wall because I can't see it well enough because of the camera of sucking so that's a little annoying but I did manage to top out all my friends on leaderboards there and
1204806	1232224	at least for all the tracks I've played I saw and played through the whole game and I do like how it's like oh this track's not unlocked yet and you can hit it and it says buy and you can buy the unlock to unlock all I'm like why would I waste my time doing that you know seriously um there I one thing I'm noticing about the Vita is that it is moving closer and closer to Facebook games I in some of the games I played I'd say I don't like that one bit like it's like really like press this button to buy it right now you don't have to get your recharge
1232404	1232824	Right now!
1260124	1277277	and now this is kind of funny I played the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita except the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita is their E3 2011 demo that they had which isn't really a demo at all it's just a demo of a
1278437	1283399	The engine, the concept, I'm not really sure what the fuck it's supposed to be.
1283499	1288401	It's basically, it's just shots of the car, like it's panning around the car.
1288782	1295104	And if you touch the screen and drag your finger across, it sort of tweaks the music a little bit.
1295124	1299766	And if you hold the L or R buttons, it'll kind of remix the music a bit.
1300226	1300806	And that's it.
1300947	1303247	And then I was like, oh, okay, this is kind of neat.
1303267	1304408	While they're talking about the game...
1304708	1307769	It's all, you know, the end of demo.
1307789	1309909	I'm like, where's the racing?
1310149	1311590	Where the fuck is the racing?
1311770	1313530	Ridge Racer 10, showroom.
1314090	1318611	It's just, there is no fucking... Press X to unlock the racing for only 100% of the credits.
1318631	1320592	No, seriously, they're like, buy the full game.
1320612	1323552	I'm like, I'm not even sure what the full game is.
1323673	1324613	There's nothing here.
1324913	1327273	Oh, that's funny because there's nothing in the real game either.
1327373	1327894	Hold on, though.
1327934	1329254	To be devil's advocate, Loki...
1330114	1331635	It's Ridge Racer 7 from the Playstation 3
1354802	1358484	All of them, all three of them that are included with the game.
1358864	1364588	Oh, and you get another three if you purchase the game right away, you know, because you need to have Ridge Racer.
1365008	1370611	You get another three tracks or you can pay another like $7 to unlock some more tracks and cars.
1372296	1383725	Now, I've heard the argument that, well, you know, really a lot of the cars that are in these games are just kind of reskins of other cars and stuff like that with different stats and, you know, whatever.
1383845	1389569	It's not really, you know, these three cars you can upgrade and keep unlocking stuff or whatever.
1391290	1396314	Once again, you know, we kind of talked about this last week with OnDiscDLC and stuff like that.
1396874	1398295	It's the illusion of it, okay?
1398315	1398396	Yeah.
1399276	1399917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1418835	1423181	Yeah, it's a stupid way to say you have double the amount of tracks that you do.
1423581	1430230	But since you can't really have one and a half tracks in the game, they're going to have to count three full tracks.
1430350	1433654	Have you ever heard of a game that sounds so perfect for the rental market?
1434884	1436684	It's not perfect for the rental market.
1437305	1438845	It's perfect for a demo.
1439485	1440105	That's it.
1440806	1442386	That is a demo right there.
1442846	1450528	If they wanted to put that game out for free and then have the extra cars, I don't think anyone would be really complaining about it.
1450808	1454189	That it has only three cars, but it's free and you get to play Ridge Racer.
1454549	1458190	And then if you want to buy additional cars, no one would balk at that.
1458250	1459710	I'd probably buy it.
1459730	1462411	Well, I wouldn't buy it because it would be free, but...
1462811	1469559	I would pay the extra money to maybe download some extra tracks and stuff like that if it was free.
1469999	1470620	But it's not.
1470740	1473243	It costs $25, which they consider a discount.
1473563	1476086	It's not a fucking discount because there's plenty of games that are out there for $29.99.
1477908	1494028	and considering that a full game is only $10 more or even you know kind of a not so full game but it's Touch My Katamari was the same price and I consider that a better experience although not by much but at least there's actual content in there um
1495149	1496069	It's just, I don't understand.
1496229	1497830	And why was the game delayed?
1498490	1499751	It still sucks.
1499871	1504012	It still has frame rate problems.
1504072	1506753	They were supposedly doing graphic updates and stuff like that.
1506773	1509234	It was supposed to run better, and it still sucks.
1509334	1510935	It's like, what were you doing?
1510955	1514776	You don't even have to... I don't even know.
1514836	1519278	They have all the geometry still for the tracks because they were in Ridge Racer 7.
1519718	1521019	You didn't do anything.
1522116	1524378	Fuck, just upgrade the graphics from the PSP version.
1524398	1525439	It would have been way better.
1527080	1529121	Alright, anything else you want to bitch about for your gaming week?
1530242	1531283	I play Call of Duty 4.
1532384	1534626	We're playing with some GPD mods now, which is fun.
1534686	1541931	So we have what we call Ninja Mode, or the Ninja games that I host because I have the mod in my system.
1542712	1545874	So when I host it, it allows us to run really fast and jump really high.
1546414	1547735	It's actually kind of fun with a few people.
1548356	1550518	But then we still play legit games and I still own all those.
1551438	1556442	Catching up on some of our comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com The chat is talking about Journey a little bit.
1557022	1560825	TigerClaw says, the only thing that would make Journey better would be music from Journey.
1562166	1563287	Honestly, I don't think it would.
1563367	1569311	Well, hold on, because Randy piggybacks on that and says, if you play Journey while listening to Don't Stop Believin' on loop, it totally syncs up.
1569952	1575776	Now, as much as I love Journey, and all Journey jokes aside, it should be noted that the soundtrack for the game is pretty frickin' sweet.
1576257	1578999	It's a great ambience soundtrack.
1579679	1585663	But if you want to rock out while you play an ambient artsy game, okay, sure, pick Journey.
1587944	1589145	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1589985	1590286	That's it.
1590466	1592227	Then let me go to Jason since you're here tonight.
1592867	1594468	Jason, what kind of games have you been playing?
1596349	1602033	The ones where you serve customers and get money for it, by which I mean not really.
1602355	1612421	No, I've kind of been in a slump for the past month, gearing up for this trip and just kind of working a lot.
1612581	1618824	Well, now, I know you brought your 3DS with you because our 3DSs mated when we weren't looking and did the whole street pass thing.
1618844	1619825	What kind of DS game?
1620345	1622046	I don't know if you played any on the bus on the way here.
1622706	1627789	I surprisingly didn't do anything on the bus the way here except for sleep and occasional music.
1628589	1634391	For what it's worth, when I picked up my 3DS, I have the same set of games then as I do now.
1634851	1639172	Those would be Bust a Move Universe, I think is the 3DS version.
1640913	1651456	Bust a Move, Star Fox 3D, Ocarina of Time 3D, and two more that I probably have never touched because I don't... Oh, Mario Land 3D, can't forget that one.
1652216	1652376	And...
1653737	1655859	at this point, probably a fifth game that I've... Mario Kart?
1656139	1657640	No, I haven't picked up Kart.
1657680	1660862	I really wanted to, but that was right after I lost my job, so I didn't.
1664312	1665212	That's alright, don't worry about it.
1665873	1667894	Are you excited about the Kid Icarus game?
1669274	1670675	Let's say economy wasn't a factor.
1670975	1673477	I've never played the original Kid Icarus meaningfully.
1673717	1674897	Okay, here's the thing though.
1675017	1677459	When did the original Kid Icarus come out?
1677479	1677459	1984?
1677559	1680360	So it's been about 20-something years since that game came out?
1680760	1681621	A damn near 30?
1682101	1688224	So, you know, they're having to market this new Kid Icarus game at people who have never played Kid Icarus.
1688264	1688804	It's okay.
1689344	1690685	So, does it look interesting?
1691105	1691225	Um...
1692606	1694967	I've not been looking at the news yet.
1720278	1728569	I guess there are three things that I can say I've been playing On the road to 200.6%ing Castlevania Symphony of the Night Nice
1731198	1745829	Whenever I get completely frustrated with grinding out those stupid little blocks that are underwater, above water in the Upside Down Castle, whenever I get frustrated with that, I go to Serious Sam 2 and then get frustrated with that in about 10 minutes, if that.
1746289	1751173	Because all of my saves exist in the rooms where you have to survive for as long as possible.
1751753	1752774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1771750	1773012	watching, watching.
1773332	1776296	30 minutes later, shit, I need to go to the grocery store.
1776316	1779820	That's how Dan puts himself to sleep is watching long playthroughs.
1779880	1782883	There's a ton of long playthrough videos out there.
1782984	1783684	My God.
1783704	1785867	And that's exactly why he has a new one for every night.
1785907	1787449	Yeah, and there's like a huge community out there.
1787469	1789672	He and I will just watch those instead of movies.
1791133	1791653	I'm serious.
1791914	1792994	No, that's awesome.
1793594	1796216	I want to see the long playthroughs for Ridge Racer Vita.
1796296	1799717	I'm sure after that 30 seconds I'll be ready for some more.
1799777	1800738	TigerClaw corrects me.
1800758	1800938	It was 1986.
1801879	1802699	Sorry.
1802879	1803459	My bad.
1803880	1805040	So 26 years then.
1805500	1805861	It's been.
1805881	1805861	86.
1806841	1807081	Alright.
1808562	1813004	Well, if that's all you want to share about your gaming week, then I will talk about mine.
1813124	1817106	Although, I gotta admit, mine isn't... I don't have a variety of games like I usually do.
1817486	1818787	I've been playing two games this week.
1819067	1819307	Two.
1819748	1820548	Mass Effect and Journey?
1821359	1822199	You're pretty close.
1822700	1824000	I even put Journey aside.
1824160	1826220	I meant to play it more, but I can't stop playing Journey.
1826281	1830762	I play WoW, of course, because I have a rating group, so I have to kind of play that at a set time every week.
1831262	1833583	But when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, I'm playing Mass Effect.
1834303	1835603	Not Mass Effect 3, mind you.
1835643	1836083	Mass Effect 1.
1836643	1837884	Hopefully you heard last week's show.
1838004	1841685	I'm five years late to the party, and I said I'm going to start from the very beginning.
1841845	1841985	And I...
1843786	1850270	Just want to say, because I can do this on a podcast and we don't make any money off this show or whatever.
1850330	1853172	We don't answer to anybody but the listeners and ourselves, right?
1854112	1856474	I totally misjudged this game five years ago.
1857254	1858815	And it's something I'm sure we have all done.
1859375	1864118	You see a little bit – you hear a snippet of a song and, oh, that album sucks.
1864678	1867620	Or you go to a restaurant one time and the food's bad.
1867660	1868541	Oh, this place sucks.
1868561	1869121	Right?
1869281	1870602	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1891380	1898049	which is, like, the two parts of the game that I hear are fixed in two, especially the car parts and all that.
1898550	1903757	And, you know, now that I play Mass Effect 1 and I'm not afraid to play it on casual mode, it doesn't bother me at all.
1903797	1908804	Like, I actually really enjoy the combat and, like, flinging things around like they're, you know...
1909184	1910585	I thought you were going to say Flinging Poo.
1937927	1939708	So there's so much I want to explore.
1939728	1945991	I have to admit, you know who I think would love Mass Effect that hasn't been playing it?
1947311	1947671	Jamie.
1948932	1950553	I really think you need to give this game a chance.
1950733	1950893	I do.
1950933	1952373	I'll borrow it when you're done.
1953214	1953774	All right.
1953814	1956215	Well, because the whole like, you know, I know you're not big on controllers.
1956375	1961597	I would urge you to check out the PC one because I just think the depth of the story, because you like science fiction and all that stuff.
1961617	1961898	Is it cheap?
1961918	1962038	Yeah.
1963158	1967821	It's $19.99, but I got it for $12 used at Dimple.
1968201	1969581	I'm thinking PC, though.
1970342	1971963	Just wait for Steam sales, I'm sure.
1972603	1975484	If anybody still has any Steam coupons or anything.
1977365	1978046	Yeah, you never know.
1978086	1983829	But anyway, I just gotta say, I think you would be really into this, because I know you like a good story.
1984749	1989812	Just the whole fact that I think you would try to romance certain characters and see what happens.
1989832	1990192	Like who?
1990752	1991133	I don't know.
1991153	1996258	I could just see you like... I like my minor Meryl obsession for Dragon Age 2.
1996358	1998500	Well, yeah, I could see you... Because it was Eve Miles.
1998620	1998920	Hi.
1999061	2004386	I could see you talking to the guy and kind of romancing the guy, but then you'd be like, I like this cool Darth Vader chick.
2004406	2005547	I want to romance her.
2006628	2008410	I don't care as long as I don't hurt myself playing.
2021542	2036470	so but anyway yeah so I gotta say that I'm really enjoying it I've already bought Mass Effect 2 because I'm waiting for when I finish Mass Effect 1 because I'm apparently not super super super far from the end I probably have about five more hours to go my character's level 33 or 34 so
2039744	2044306	How can you be in that close of proximity to someone and not have an ending spoiled?
2057892	2058432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2082700	2084641	Alright, so yeah, that was my gaming week.
2084681	2085341	Lots of Mass Effect.
2087481	2089882	Let's talk about housekeeping.
2090722	2091743	Visit our websites.
2092043	2099425	www.orangelaunchradio.com, of course, is our main website, which is graciously hosted by Jason, and I should also say designed by Dekeman.
2099465	2100445	He deserves a shout-out, too.
2100465	2101406	He does some great work.
2102166	2106627	And in the upper right-hand corner is the extended play box.
2106647	2107687	I almost said now playing.
2107988	2109148	Extended play box.
2109488	2110808	Flashback to PHP Nuke.
2110848	2111169	Right?
2111589	2111789	Right?
2111849	2113469	Hey, also what we were doing eight years ago.
2114890	2116470	And you can find the Facebook there.
2116510	2117791	You can find Google Plus there.
2117811	2123452	You can find just the Steam community if you are playing Mass Effect on PC and want to talk to others through Steam, you can do that.
2123592	2124733	And so good times.
2124913	2126733	All that stuff at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2127053	2128294	All right, let's get into gaming news.
2128314	2131755	There's been quite a bit of gaming news this week, so Loki's going to start us off tonight.
2132915	2135477	So, good news if you're an achievement whore.
2135897	2139839	They're going to raise the gamer score allotments for Xbox Live Arcade titles.
2139959	2147323	Now, right now it's currently 200, but that's going to double to 400 with a maximum of 30 achievements possible instead of 20.
2148323	2176450	also downloadable content they're going to allow I guess more gamer score to be added with 100 or I guess 100 with up to 8 achievements allowed per quarter with maximum of 4 packs allowed over time so they're going to allow you to add a lot more gamer score to all that stuff and this will take a place I guess it's going to start with titles coming out between April 1st and May 31st
2178615	2181718	I'm kind of surprised this is such a problem.
2181738	2183800	There's so many restrictions for Microsoft.
2184641	2190426	They're not retail partners, but they're still going through the entire Microsoft process.
2190726	2193789	It's not like indie games can throw in achievements or anything like that.
2193809	2196431	Just wait until indie games are allowed to throw in achievements.
2197392	2199014	I think that will always be off limits.
2199074	2199294	I think
2199818	2200418	and DarkSakura.
2223334	2223694	Really?
2224055	2234642	So some of it seems to kind of slip by, but otherwise, you know, Microsoft's been very much about, like, they don't, you know, they've bombed people's scores to zero when they suspect that they're, like, cheating and all this stuff.
2234662	2235723	Like, they're very protective of it.
2235743	2238044	It's real easy to cheat if you want to, but it's...
2239165	2240125	I mean, they're going to notice.
2240706	2242966	So you just don't do that.
2243507	2246688	Hey, look, I achieved all of my achievements in about five minutes.
2247288	2248808	And if it's not by Avatar, then whoo!
2249209	2261053	Well, I mean, you can just mod your actual user account on your system, and then you can add games that you've never played and just give yourself 1,000 achievement points.
2261373	2262633	But, I mean, they're going to notice it.
2262753	2264574	Oh, your gamer score jumped by 100,000.
2264614	2265034	That's a little odd.
2267635	2280258	I will never forget... Speaking of getting banned from Xbox Live because of achievements and all this stuff, I will never forget the time I was playing Dance Dance Revolution Universe on Xbox 360 for the first time, and I got the message from Strip Club DJ.
2280418	2282438	Does anybody remember that name on Xbox 360?
2282478	2288220	He was the guy that had the most points ever, and he sent me a message like, are the achievements in that game hard to get?
2288320	2288860	Apparently...
2289520	2290841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2307279	2310581	Well, what do you think, though, about the arcade games going up to 400 points?
2310741	2314704	In some ways, it's achievements, whatever.
2314784	2322850	But in other ways, since the downloadable games are getting more expensive, they are becoming more richer experiences.
2323030	2325612	It's not ports of Time Pilot anymore.
2325652	2327093	We're getting games like Limbo.
2327373	2329795	We're getting HD remixes of Time Pilot.
2330735	2332176	Not that Time Pilot's a bad game.
2332497	2337541	But yeah, now we're getting other stuff and a lot of the greatest games to come out are download.
2337781	2342364	Braid, Portal was a standalone game for download and stuff.
2342685	2347168	There's so much good stuff that it kind of deserves to be bumped up a little bit, I think.
2349550	2350431	Alright, so there you go.
2351351	2352953	The achievement points are going to be going up.
2355111	2361954	What might be going up or down, I don't know, is Capcom's stock, depending on Street Fighter X Tekken and how this has been received on the 360.
2362774	2363795	Not so well.
2364395	2374719	As we mentioned last week on the show, four-player co-op mode is not on the 360 version, even though it's there in the instruction manual, and it's there in the PlayStation 3 version.
2375239	2381342	Just so you know, that's when you and a friend go online, or you and a friend are local, you go online and take on another co-op.
2383163	2409745	and it was addressed by Tomoaki Ayano the assistant producer of the game in a Capcom Unity blog statement throughout the development process there are times when new features are added and we added a lot of them and there are also times where we have to make tough decisions regarding things to cut this was one of those times this mode is supported in the Playstation 3 version however since we tackled that earlier and found the architecture of their system to be more conducive to implementing it
2410686	2412588	Sony paid us a lot of money.
2428886	2429887	I don't know if it's that.
2429947	2430887	Well, you never know.
2430987	2431728	Strange things happen.
2431748	2441133	Well, that may be true, but then you should create a second manual for the Xbox 360 version still is saying, you know, hey, this mode's available.
2441353	2441974	Oh, but it's not.
2442874	2444995	It really seems like to me it was a deadline thing.
2446236	2448257	But it's still very poor taste.
2448277	2449298	It's false advertising.
2449818	2454241	I understand that, you know, that you had to work on all that DLC that was going to be on disc.
2454361	2456362	So, you know, that might have taken some extra time.
2457136	2458717	I would have traded kick for comp mode.
2484119	2484920	That's ridiculous.
2485241	2486882	Oh, well, we didn't know how to do it.
2486982	2490626	Well, I'm sure if you asked Microsoft, hey, how do you do this?
2490747	2493650	They would have probably told you how to do it.
2493890	2501518	Speaking of Microsoft allowing and not allowing things, frankly, I thought that was pretty much a required feature for any co-op game to be certified and released for the 360.
2503159	2504680	No, I don't think it was.
2505661	2507701	Obviously not, because it happened.
2507741	2517646	I've seen plenty of games where you don't have to have... Because sometimes doing split screen... There's not enough screen space after you split it in half.
2519466	2527630	Well, what I want to know is, since this is not on the show roll... So what's everybody think about their whole DLC plan?
2529028	2530429	Oh, I thought I was supposed to do that here, too.
2530469	2530869	That's all right.
2530889	2535652	All right, yeah, the DLC plan, what, $20 for all 12 characters this fall, right?
2535852	2544736	Yeah, $20 for all 12 characters this fall, and they're going to have costume packs as well, which I think was another $13.
2544776	2547838	I want to say it's 13 different packs for a dollar or something like that.
2548018	2555704	Well, the release about it really felt like it was trying to butter up the community, like they knew that there was this big backlash about it.
2555744	2560968	And it really read to me like, hey, guys, it's not going to be as bad as y'all were thinking.
2561428	2564690	LOL at you, thinking it was going to be five bucks each character.
2564730	2565751	We're not doing that, guys.
2565811	2568133	Oh, no, we're not complete assholes this time.
2568173	2570355	We're just pretty big assholes.
2571616	2577060	There's still a percentage of us that we're not completely assholes about this stuff.
2577860	2584561	And, you know, that's great and all that, you know, they're saying that's going to be $20 for, you know, all the characters.
2585282	2586822	Except there's a problem.
2586922	2602425	It's not all of the characters because you do remember that even though they are PlayStation exclusive, you know, Pac-Man and Bad Box Art or Troll Mega Man is still on the disc for Xbox 360.
2602665	2605846	So that means there's still going to be one more piece of download content that they're
2607546	2607886	Joy
2627225	2629947	So, yeah, anyways, here's what it's going to end up being.
2630688	2633590	April 3rd, they're going to have alternate costumes go on sale.
2633630	2638634	Those are going to set you back a dollar each, or you can buy all of them for $13.
2638774	2642457	Then they're going to release some free colors.
2642557	2643097	Oh, thank you.
2643278	2643638	Thank you.
2643678	2644098	Free colors.
2644138	2648121	There were some free things they were trying to – look at all this shit you're going to get for free.
2648542	2653485	Costumes and gem slots, and then this is the pay stuff, you know, characters.
2654306	2655006	Free stuff, yeah.
2655046	2658708	And then I guess in April they're also going to do a free tournament support update.
2659569	2663651	And they're going to be adding some three new assist gem packs.
2664471	2667533	So I guess they're going to be selling those or something.
2667573	2668553	I don't know.
2669634	2672676	Which a total of 60 gems to a selection pool, I guess.
2673476	2677738	But yeah, those 12 characters already on disc will not be unlocked until the fall.
2678439	2681620	Meanwhile, hackers have already been playing with them online.
2682361	2682561	So...
2683359	2688805	Wait, can I go online on 316 and suddenly I'm playing against somebody who is Blanka or one of the locked characters?
2688845	2700657	Yeah, basically what they do is they swap all the assets and art and stuff like that and character data for the DLC characters and they move it to one of the regular characters in the game.
2700677	2703320	They kind of flip-flop on the stuff.
2703400	2703640	But yeah.
2704241	2706423	$20 I fucking called it making this an $80 game
2732941	2734402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2756420	2757220	Here's the thing, too.
2757601	2763264	Remember how they said they're not going to do a special arcade edition, gold edition, or whatever?
2763764	2767146	Let's just assume that they've sold quite a few copies.
2767526	2774090	We're going to say that they're going to sell a million copies probably on each system, let's just say.
2774110	2776631	I mean, that's a pretty safe bet considering now.
2777612	2779133	So the Greatest Hits edition will come out.
2779173	2784676	They won't really say anything, but it'll include the DLC characters on disc or something like that, and it'll drop the price.
2785694	2813367	because they've done that with like what Call of Duty just had a re-release for Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2 with the DLC or at least the first DLC pack included with it now I don't think it's on disc but it's still code with it and I mean Midnight Club LA has done that I mean there's plenty of other games that have done that I think Mass Effect had DLC on the disc for or included at least a voucher or something like that when it was re-released so I could see them doing this I'm probably just gonna get the Vita version to be honest
2814688	2815289	If I get it.
2815509	2815870	I don't know.
2815970	2818152	At this point, do I need another fighting game that badly?
2818873	2819834	Eh, maybe not.
2819934	2824500	So do you think they got it out in this state in order to allow people to prep for EVO?
2826282	2832710	Give enough people to get it set so that it can be played as a part of EVO and people to get their strategies down and actually learn the game to participate in it.
2833001	2833802	Resident Evil 3DS Game
2856992	2857833	and so on.
2872621	2873761	Last year.
2873861	2875302	Was the Gold Edition last year?
2875642	2878142	What system?
2879282	2881583	It was Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.
2881643	2882883	I don't know if that was last year.
2882923	2885244	That may have been last March, but that was still a re-release.
2887524	2888604	I guess they had Street Fighter.
2889004	2892405	Oh, Marvel was at Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2892445	2893445	They had that.
2894045	2896046	But still, I don't think that did that.
2896446	2899627	I mean, it did all right, but it wasn't like big, big, big numbers.
2900387	2900727	I don't know.
2901187	2901307	Hmm.
2902640	2903860	Alright, well, we'll see.
2904601	2906901	It'll be interesting when the sales numbers come out at the end of the month.
2907021	2908241	I'm looking forward to seeing those.
2908602	2910182	Meanwhile, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2910202	2910702	DarkSakura?
2911642	2914463	Well, this is hopefully something a little bit happier.
2915243	2917264	In fact, I want this more than I want a Vita.
2917604	2921845	I want it more than a 3DS because I love everything Neo Geo.
2922645	2925726	And there's a new Neo Geo portable coming out, the Neo Geo X.
2927326	2944261	and it is going to come with 20 games already built into it and it's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with SD card expansion AV output and like I said 20 games already included which I probably own most of them
2945041	2963788	including Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars, Cyber Lip, Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury Special, Football Frenzy, King of Monsters, Last Resort, League Bowling, Magician Lord, Awesome Game, Metal Slug, even more awesome, Mutation Nation, NAMM 1975, Samurai Showdown, Sengoku, Super Sidekicks, King of Fighters 94, which was the best, Ultimate 11, Top Players, Golf, and World Heroes.
2964449	2966791	But when is Windjammer going to be available for it?
2968173	2968433	Really?
2968453	2970455	Oh man, I adore that game.
2970855	2974058	Baseball Stars is the saving grace in that list for me personally.
2974619	2977061	Whenever I came across a multicab with that in it, I was pretty happy.
2977081	2978483	You know, I have that game.
2979404	2979864	The cartridge.
2981265	2981686	I heard that.
2982627	2982747	Yeah.
2983348	2985089	It's fun.
2985829	2994053	They don't have a price up on it yet but it's going to be distributed by Tomo in North America and that's for the limited edition.
2994514	2997135	In Europe it will be released by Blaze.
2998539	3003862	It better be cheap, because I can tell you right now, that looks just like a reskinned Dingu.
3005303	3007864	Because the Dingu... The Dingu ate my baby!
3008064	3010065	Not that, not a Dingo, a Dingu.
3010465	3018249	A Dingu is basically, it was like an emulation device, and it had all the same features, and looked exactly the same as that.
3018529	3021671	And it played Neo Geo games, of course you had to have the ROMs for them.
3022111	3026654	But it played Neo Geo games, and I swear to God, the thing is just a Dingu.
3026714	3028355	It looks exactly the same.
3030036	3032117	And the Dingu's, I think they're under $100.
3032217	3035399	So if that thing is over $100, eh, not worth it.
3035759	3038040	You can make the same argument for the FC Ultras, right?
3038681	3043023	The portable, what was it, SNES, NES, and I think maybe even Genesis in a more recent version?
3043443	3046045	If you could put a BlackBerry phone on it, would it be a DinguBerry?
3048885	3050846	No one wants to put a BlackBerry phone on anything.
3050926	3052067	Cue sad trombone.
3071656	3074217	Oh, that's interesting that it's doing so much better on PlayStation 3.
3074757	3076138	I guess the word got out about the modes.
3076178	3083700	Well, considering that the PS3 seems to be the better version with more characters in there, and it works, and it has all these features.
3083780	3084521	Okay, all right.
3085081	3087061	I also found out something really weird just now.
3087201	3088262	Those sound like good numbers, though.
3088342	3088642	Yes, DarkSakura.
3088662	3089382	That I hadn't realized.
3090042	3091763	Ragnarok Online is hitting their 10th anniversary.
3092202	3092582	Wow.
3093903	3094063	Old.
3094623	3095303	And it's still going.
3096624	3097024	Just saying.
3097084	3099545	And to celebrate the 10 year anniversary, they're banning everybody.
3099565	3103747	It's older than wow.
3103867	3109049	I apologize because I left the room for a quick minute, but are you going to get one of these little Neo Geos?
3109549	3109889	I don't know.
3110109	3110449	DarkSakura?
3110489	3110950	I want one.
3111450	3111810	I don't know.
3112924	3114427	Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket Color, or a Neo Geo.
3124369	3126130	3.5 inches is the same size as an iPhone.
3126470	3129611	And iPhone isn't fun to play certain games on.
3129691	3130372	Certain games.
3130872	3132092	But this won't just be a touchscreen.
3132112	3132732	Big difference.
3132833	3136434	Games that are designed for the iPhone are great on the iPhone.
3136514	3141696	Games that they try to port from freaking PlayStation to the iPhone are not so great.
3141716	3143397	I did okay with some of the arcade games.
3143437	3144677	Like X-Men played just fine.
3145177	3147258	And Espagabaluda 2.
3150960	3154343	Robot Unicorn Attack plays really, really well on the iPhone.
3154704	3155745	See, that was made for the iPhone.
3155885	3156726	No, it wasn't.
3156746	3157686	It was made for Flash.
3159048	3163892	It almost looks like it could be an upgraded Dingo because the Dingo doesn't have a 3.5-inch screen.
3163912	3170318	It's only 2.8 inches LCD, but it has the video out and everything.
3170398	3172420	It looks goddamn the same.
3172440	3173621	It's a super Dingo.
3174142	3175383	It could be a super Dingo.
3177705	3178105	All right.
3178425	3179466	More gaming news, Loki.
3180266	3180586	All right.
3180626	3182246	Let's not talk about the dingo anymore.
3182967	3184287	Quick, before I make another bad joke.
3184987	3186748	God, we don't want to do that.
3187028	3191249	Baldur's Gate is coming back, and they're doing an enhanced edition.
3191329	3193090	It's going to be coming out this summer.
3194191	3217968	and of course Baldur's Gate was produced by Wizards of the Coast or I should say Atari is publishing it but it's based off the D&D stuff and the Enhanced Edition is going to be kind of like an HD remake they're also talking that they may be doing Baldur's Gate 2 as well which is kind of neat um
3221051	3224516	Not much more, I guess, is kind of out about it right now.
3227732	3253426	just to put it in perspective these are some legendary PC games and funny enough I believe the original was done by Bioware to kind of bring things full circle I don't think they own the rights anymore I think that's why they're getting this now but yeah I'm interested I remember vaguely playing the old ones briefly but I didn't play them start to finish so I'm definitely interested in this take a second look what about you Loki?
3253466	3256188	I never played the original so yeah
3257756	3258477	May 15, 2012 is the date.
3279895	3284098	Let me tell you some other things maybe you may not have caught, you know, besides just the date news.
3284778	3286860	It is an international launch.
3287560	3292463	So the game is going to be available in many different countries all at the exact same time.
3292964	3295626	You can digitally pre-order the game now.
3296026	3299008	Meaning, I guess you download the whole darn thing to your computer.
3299108	3303131	You can pre-purchase it now and you'll be ready to play when the game goes live.
3303151	3303831	I'm just asking for some...
3303871	3304451	Who knows, who knows, uh
3334451	3335952	I don't think that's a very fair comparison.
3336433	3337473	Blizzard and Ubisoft.
3337694	3339075	They're not... Well, see, here's the thing.
3339115	3341897	Blizzard's claiming anyway they're not doing it for DRM.
3342157	3345880	They're doing it for the... They don't want people cloning the items and all that.
3345940	3348362	Like, all the item distribution is going through the servers and all that.
3348822	3349923	I'm just saying.
3350343	3350664	All right.
3350864	3351204	We'll see.
3351244	3351644	We'll see.
3352425	3353266	I know what they're saying.
3353326	3354126	Hacker's gonna hack.
3354166	3356328	So we'll see if people get into this before May 15th.
3356388	3357869	But it didn't happen with StarCraft 2.
3358270	3359450	So, I don't know.
3360411	3361372	Is that rule 35?
3361492	3362633	If it exists, it's hacked?
3362653	3362733	Yeah.
3362990	3364715	Yeah, well, you know the old saying, haters gonna hate.
3364775	3366058	It's just like, hackers gonna hack.
3366098	3366820	It's the same thing.
3367923	3371351	We always talk about, this company says, this device is unhackable.
3371572	3372354	Hackers gonna hack.
3374411	3375212	Master's gonna bait?
3375992	3377113	Yes, Master's gonna bait.
3377553	3379395	Dingu's gonna bait.
3381736	3401349	By the way, if you want to get your free copy of Diablo 3 for signing up for the World of Warcraft Blood Pact, actually they call it something else, Annual Pass or something, but basically you're signing your life away to Blizzard saying, yes, Blizzard, I will pay you penance for a full year and you will give me a flying horse, you will give me beta access to panda people.
3401549	3402530	I want to sign up.
3403130	3405331	and you get your free copy of Diablo.
3405371	3413135	Well, DarkSakura, if you want to sign up, you got to do it before May 1st because that's the day the deal is done and you will not be able to do that anymore.
3414616	3416877	Also, if you feel like it, you can get the collector's edition, $99.99.
3419358	3420819	for Diablo 3 Collector's Edition.
3420879	3422580	That would only be in stores, though, just so you know.
3423020	3426262	Because it's kind of hard to do an online Collector's Edition.
3426362	3430724	Yeah, you can't download a specially crafted USB drive through your computer.
3430784	3431825	That would be a little difficult.
3431925	3437168	But you could get fairy wings for your character, which apparently is part of the deluxe pack-in Collector's Edition.
3437528	3437968	There you go.
3438969	3441330	All right, DarkSakura, what do you got for us next in gaming news?
3442265	3447751	Well, in other news, there is very happy news for all of us Portal 2 fans.
3447891	3451014	They won the BAFTA for the British Academy.
3452175	3454418	My God, it's been a year and it's still winning awards.
3454658	3456239	Well, they beat out Skyrim.
3456279	3457160	Skyrim got nothing.
3458882	3459403	Wow.
3459983	3460244	Yeah.
3461245	3465269	Or for you, Portal 2, you go, Portal 2, and none for Elder Scrolls.
3465289	3465429	Bye.
3467436	3476241	Well, basically, the big rivals that it had was Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and Deus Ex.
3477301	3485205	And it won, I believe, three awards for design, for story, and the...
3487441	3500014	It looks like a game of the year, so as far as others that won, Battlefield 3 won the public vote, so it had the Game Award of 2011, and the BAFTA for online multiplayer and audio.
3500274	3504298	But that's like the People's Choice Award, and you know, who watches that?
3504478	3506160	But it's still, it's pretty, well...
3506560	3507120	I'm kidding.
3507180	3507860	It is a big deal.
3507980	3511441	But Portal 2, you know, I just think it's funny that Skyrim got nothing.
3512441	3515282	And Deus Ex also got nothing, which was supposed to be a pretty good game.
3515402	3515722	Oh, yeah.
3515742	3515982	Oh, yeah.
3516122	3518303	And, oh, it only took about five seconds.
3518363	3519063	And there's your joke.
3519123	3522384	Sterlok says, Skyrim took an arrow to the knee.
3526545	3526925	No, no, no.
3527165	3527625	It deserves more.
3527645	3530785	You're going to take an arrow to the dingo in about a minute if you make that joke again.
3530865	3532066	It deserves more than the...
3535774	3536695	and Acidic Vampire.
3536735	3537996	Now, this is a great joke.
3538036	3540839	Acidic Vampire asks, was the award a potato?
3542941	3543602	A potato.
3544263	3545644	So, here's what won.
3547226	3548627	Batman Arkham City won for action.
3549028	3550930	Artistic Achievement was Rayman Origins.
3553612	3555814	Debut game, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
3555935	3557917	I heard a scoff over there on Rayman Origins.
3558137	3558617	All I have to say...
3559358	3560638	Play that on a Vita.
3560879	3561439	My god.
3561899	3562599	It is gorgeous.
3564900	3566000	Portal 2 and best game.
3567141	3568201	Design was Portal 2.
3568361	3569621	Family was LittleBigPlanet 2.

3571782	3573463	Mobile and handheld was Peggle HD.
3575023	3575543	Go Fig.
3576324	3579645	Online was Monster Mind, Online Multiplayer, Battlefield 3.

3581506	3582487	Original Music, L.A.

3596674	3599755	BAFTA Wants to Watch Award, TikTok Toys.
3600416	3602777	And Game Award of 2011 was Battlefield 3.
3603652	3606634	It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal You get nothing, you lose Good day, sir
3628929	3630731	That's very unsportsmanlike of them.
3630771	3632212	That was a pretty rude speech.
3632432	3633693	I love Gene Wilder.
3635114	3636155	We're not hating on them.
3636195	3638637	Before you send in the angry, Skyrim is a good game.
3638677	3639357	You should not make fun of it.
3639578	3640999	I know Skyrim is a good game.
3641179	3642019	It's a great game.
3642060	3642980	It's a phenomenal game.
3643220	3644622	It's a buggy as fuck game.
3646403	3646903	But it's good.
3647123	3650126	It's just, for me, Portal 2, oh my god, was like perfect.
3651447	3653949	So I'm happy to hear it's winning all these awards even overseas.
3656002	3660912	Alrighty, let's travel around the world and check out some games that might win awards next year.
3661834	3662335	Or maybe not.
3662395	3665863	Let's see what releases are coming out this week around the world.
3665883	3666885	We'll start with the US, Loki.
3667293	3692724	absolutely nothing I was kidding there's actually stuff coming out this week uh Ninja Gaiden 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 including there's even a fancy version that's not necessarily made by uh Tecmo Koei but it's uh from was it uh man I can't remember the publisher for it uh anyways it just comes with this really cheesy move sword attachment that you can
3694229	3696672	Because we haven't had enough projectiles breaking TVs.
3696792	3699255	Now we have a mock sword to do it with.
3713652	3714253	Exactly.
3714273	3714673	Recipe.
3715814	3723578	And then, of course, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week as well.
3723598	3725879	A game called GoGo's Crazy Bones.
3726920	3728941	I'm guessing based off of a toy.
3728961	3729741	I'm not really sure.
3732123	3732743	Let's see.
3732863	3738486	We also have Dirt 3, the Complete Edition, which is going to be re-released with Dirt 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3739967	3751356	Armored Core 5 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Silent Hill HD Collection on PS3 and 360 Pampered Pets Resort for the 3DS Got it pre-ordered?
3756733	3757854	No, I don't have that one pre-ordered.
3758875	3761036	Please tell me more about Pampered Pets.
3762277	3764099	Polly picked a pack of pickled pepper.
3764119	3766280	Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort.
3766701	3770203	It's where you put sunglasses and bows on animals.
3771084	3773066	Wasn't that a really bad episode of Pokemon?
3774315	3776216	What the fuck is wrong with this country?
3776236	3778818	It's this country, and that's what the fuck wrong with it.
3778838	3779639	But that's not all.
3803351	3806952	In case, paws and claws, Pampered Pets Resort is not for you.
3807573	3811354	Let's Ride, Best of Breed 3D for the 3DS.
3811694	3813055	That's right, it is a horse racing.
3813075	3815115	Does that come with a move attachment in your butt?
3816296	3816936	It is not.
3817016	3817636	Let's Ride.
3819697	3820537	For the Kinect.
3820677	3822498	Instead of friending your butt, it'll ride your butt.
3822638	3826219	Kinect Rush, a Disney Pixar adventure on the Xbox 360.
3826639	3826980	Okay.
3828880	3830661	And then, of course, let's see.
3832403	3839901	Rounding things out, Total War Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai for the PC and Kid Icarus Uprising for the 3DS.
3840703	3841024	That's it.
3842941	3846424	Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.
3846584	3848845	On the 3DS, there's a brand new 3DS.
3849086	3850547	Okay, it's not a reskin or anything like that.
3850567	3851347	It's just a new color.
3851648	3855510	But Cobalt Blue will be available from March the 22nd in Japan.
3855610	3857172	So if you want Cobalt Blue, there you go.
3857972	3863176	Shin Hikari Shinwa Palutena no Kagami comes out on March 22nd in Japan.
3863236	3864037	Anyone know what that is?
3864617	3864817	Huh?
3864837	3865237	Huh?
3865757	3866858	That's Kid Icarus.
3866898	3867258	That is.
3867278	3868418	That's their version of Kid Icarus.
3868438	3868978	So there you go.
3869939	3873019	Apparently there's also some 3DSs coming out in pink and white.
3873139	3877301	I think those colors already exist, but now they will have Mario 3D Land as a pack-in game.
3877701	3881122	So those will be out very soon on the 24th in Japan as well.
3881882	3884583	Let's go over to the Vita and see what the Vita's getting this week.
3885003	3887103	Little Busters Converted Edition.
3887704	3888864	Is that like Little Deviants?
3890316	3892077	No, that's definitely not Little Deviants.
3892978	3894979	These girls look like Deviants of a different sort.
3896180	3899062	But Little Busters is, you know, another one of those anime.
3899162	3900023	Dating sim.
3900043	3900803	Yeah, probably.
3902924	3905947	And let's see, what else is coming out?
3906047	3909609	Checking quickly on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
3910229	3912151	PlayStation 3, quite a bit.
3912191	3913772	Devil May Cry HD Collection.
3914392	3916133	Fallout New Vegas, the Ultimate Edition.
3916193	3918355	Ninja Gaiden 3, Regular and Collector's Edition.
3920476	3925417	and Atuteki Yugi Mugen Souls comes out this week from Compile.
3926037	3926437	Wait a minute.
3926457	3927397	Compile.
3927417	3928298	Compile's back?
3929178	3930098	Compile never went away.
3932639	3934079	Who made Guardian Legend?
3935079	3935639	Compile?
3937039	3942361	I thought they were not around anymore because that was the reason we weren't getting a new Guardian Legend game.
3943601	3944601	Compile made other games.
3945638	3947060	I thought they broke up years ago.
3947420	3948682	Hold on, let me do some research.
3948702	3962720	Okay, I need to know if Compile is back and making this game, which actually looks kind of cute because it's like anime babes, but there's definitely like these action-y sequences and then there's this whole little like, uh-oh, you might see my...
3964198	3982929	Compile Publisher They were famed for developing shooters and puzzle games such as Aleste and Puyo Puyo following the bankruptcy of Compile in 2002 Sight was up until 2007 were redirected to Compile Station and by D4 Enterprise Inc.
3984170	3998409	and a company spun off Milestone that had arcade shoot-em-ups and Compile Heart hopes to revive the Compile brand name with the assistance of former Compile employees like Puyo Puyo creator Mu Nittani.
3998909	4001710	Okay, so apparently Compile... And they made this friggin' game.
4002071	4003351	I've heard of Compile Heart.
4003391	4004832	So Compile has been to the moon and back.
4005512	4009234	So bankruptcy wasn't necessarily the end of the company.
4009314	4014397	Well, can I just for a moment say, I'd like to please, Compile, if you're listening, consider...
4015377	4019098	You know, it's been, what, 26 years and we're getting a new Kid Icarus game?
4019178	4021839	I think the time has come for us to get a new Guardian Legend.
4022199	4022579	Guardic?
4022839	4023119	Guardic 3.
4023159	4024260	You know what they need to do?
4024400	4024600	What?
4024860	4029461	They need to release Guardic and Guardic 2 because we didn't get Guardic over here.
4029621	4031202	We got the second one as the Guardian Legend.
4031242	4032362	It was an MSX game, right?
4032522	4037263	So they need to do, like, the Guardic Special Edition and then give us Guardic 3.
4038524	4039004	Amen to that.
4040743	4066094	I need to bust out that MSX emulator I will drop the President Cat thing right now for that I would give a square inch of my flesh probably from my left arm in exchange for Guardic 3 I'm telling you, I know we talk about it a lot on this show for those of you that haven't heard a lot of OLR in the past The Guardian Legend is like the greatest 8-bit game you probably missed
4066887	4068288	Here's like the other big games that they did.
4068308	4079734	They did Zanuck, Aleste, which I have Robo Aleste, Gunhead, Spriggan, and there's also the big Spriggan anime too, you remember?
4080334	4088578	But they did that for PC Engine, and then there was like, they did a few dungeon crawlers, like I said, Pio Pio, and Golvalius.
4089499	4090079	Do you remember that?
4091120	4094701	They also did two pinball games for the TurboGrafx-16.
4094741	4095602	Can you guess what they were?
4098462	4109610	Alien Crush, and Devil's Crush Blazing Lasers, Choplifter, Ghostbusters, Lode Runner,
4115310	4116051	Shadowrun
4130023	4130923	Compile's great.
4131123	4135505	Anyway, so Compile, now that you're back together, we have a new project you need to get on.
4136565	4140606	All right, 360 also gets the Devil May Cry HD collection.
4140666	4142046	Again, this is Japan, don't forget.
4142166	4146628	The Kinect Rush Disney Pixar Adventure, Ninja Gaiden 3 Collectors and Regulars Edition.
4146748	4147928	There you go, let's go to the UK.
4149873	4150894	Send me a ticket, I wish.
4151935	4159699	As far as stuff that's out in the UK, on the 21st is Rayman 3 HD.
4161160	4169825	On the 22nd, we have Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Wing Commander Saga, The Darkest Dawn, and yesterday, all of the last two being on PC.
4170485	4182802	On the 23rd, Armored Core 5, Kid Icarus Uprising, Ninja Gaiden 3, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond, Resident Evil, Operation Raccoon City, and Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai.
4184364	4184765	Bleh.
4186487	4186868	That's it.
4187631	4187932	DarkSakura.com
4203492	4208876	Double Fine's Kickstarter just finished with $3.3 million.
4210116	4215140	That's a lot of money for Kickstarter and for them.
4215500	4219423	Way more than they were hoping to get with $400,000 being the goal.
4220764	4226128	Of course, they're going to be doing a lot of extra content because of that.
4227708	4252496	and of course Tim Schafer was quoted saying I don't want to say this is the end of the whole game industry as we know it it's not, it's not but it's nice that they don't necessarily need publishers to make games like this because honestly who would green light an adventure game an old school adventure game nowadays it's something that they don't think would sell
4252976	4259797	But, I think also maybe success of these types of games might convince publishers that these types of games still do alright.
4260878	4261398	Just kidding.
4261958	4271920	And if you're looking, if you maybe missed out on the whole funding of the Double Fine Adventure and you're still wondering, hey, where can I throw my money for an extended pre-order on something?
4272760	4276341	Wasteland 2 has a Kickstarter going for it now.
4276761	4281722	Now, Wasteland is kind of, I would say, like the inspiration for the Fallout games.
4283263	4297813	They were hoping to raise $900,000 for their game and of course already have hit that goal and then beyond that and they still have almost a month left to go.
4298893	4317667	and now of course they're looking to see if they can reach 1.5 million dollars and they're going to add more content to the game and that kind of stuff also porting it to other platforms like OSX and that kind of stuff.
4317967	4321448	So you can check out Kickstarter for that and some other projects.
4321948	4332790	Hopefully, though, not contributing to the very vague, poorly misspelled MMO project from some strange millionaire who seriously looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt and a rapist.
4332970	4335570	So maybe avoid that one.
4338130	4338531	All right.
4340931	4342951	Kickstarter, Kickstarter, Kickstarter.
4345352	4347112	Is this a trend we like seeing in gaming?
4348935	4355021	Um, I mean, I don't see why we wouldn't like it.
4355701	4357283	I don't really see what the downside is.
4357944	4362668	Other than, I mean, it's one of those things like if you don't want to support it, then you don't support it.
4363549	4366651	No one's forcing you to put down money for it.
4366852	4368053	However, I see a couple...
4368413	4368733	and many more.
4385092	4388055	and that's what people want to do with it.
4388155	4403948	I know I've only contributed to one thing so far which is a video project done by Freddie Wong because I love all of his videos but I get with that a Blu-ray copy of the movie, a signed poster by the cast and that kind of stuff.
4403988	4407171	So there are little things that are kind of neat from it but
4407791	4408572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4427936	4428957	A couple hundred dollars.
4428977	4438165	There's one I saw for a third edition for a book called High Score, which is talking about classic games and stuff like that.
4438185	4438766	I have that book.
4439206	4441288	And they're trying to put out a third edition of it.
4441508	4448035	And for the $250 level, you can have dinner with a bunch of these classic game people.
4448155	4450337	Everyone from Peter Molyneux to...
4453039	4453499	What's his name?
4453539	4455420	The guy behind the Sims series.
4455920	4456401	Will Wright.
4456481	4457161	Will Wright, yes.
4457201	4458782	You can have dinner with him.
4460002	4463144	Just a bunch of really classic developers.
4463164	4465005	Shit, I'd do that just for the experience maybe.
4465105	4467226	I'm a little eh on Kickstarter.
4468266	4475755	The only things that bug me about it is A, people need to realize Kickstarter gets 5%, which I... They gotta run the site.
4476576	4478419	Hey, America's about the capitalism.
4478859	4481282	They came up with a great idea and they're taking their share.
4481703	4484026	You can't fault them for that.
4484266	4485968	I personally would not like to use Kickstarter.
4486889	4487489	for that reason.
4487609	4496972	But the other thing that really bugs me is that some of the projects and I'm not going to name names, but one in particular that I saw in there felt really exploitative to me.
4497232	4503934	Like it was just exploiting for money for things that I would argue you don't need that kind of money for.
4504434	4512556	And this type of record was being broken like 10 times over, which props to them for having that kind of audience that would just give and give and give and give that kind of money.
4512596	4513676	That's wonderful.
4514697	4516297	But I just think
4517406	4519687	The money would be better spent on charity.
4519727	4520867	But that's me.
4522667	4526248	I just think you have to be very careful about what you're donating to and think really hard about it.
4526268	4527369	Think really hard about it.
4527529	4533290	But Rob, I just always thought, you know, how much better would this show be if we had a swanky office?
4533310	4533750	I'm not.
4534250	4535411	Don't go there.
4535791	4536111	Don't.
4536771	4537811	Don't start stuff.
4538311	4540872	I mean, I could just throw one of those up and say, who wants to support me?
4543128	4543788	See, here's the thing.
4543948	4547590	As much as you could do that, that's when Kickstarter starts to get a little ridiculous.
4548050	4548471	You know what I mean?
4548571	4549431	See, that's the point.
4549551	4556095	It's the online equivalent of standing out on the street corner with a tin can begging for change.
4556636	4559017	I mean, I don't think any of us want to see it turn into that.
4560831	4562431	I mean, here's what I would think.
4562952	4569693	Granted, I think it would be kind of cool to do a Kickstarter just for funding merchandise.
4569713	4578215	Because a lot of times, if you're merchandising for even, say, our show or something like that, it costs money to make t-shirts and stuff.
4578255	4580776	That way, it's almost like a pre-sale for merchandise.
4582056	4584717	I mean, that would be the only intent for it.
4584797	4584977	But...
4586997	4588657	I don't know, that'd be the only thing I could see.
4589578	4591918	If you want to donate the proceeds, you could do that.
4594579	4601020	I mean, that's the only... Because, I mean, you're basically using... That's what people use it for anyways, is merchandise for a lot of it.
4601420	4606361	And some of which I really wish I'd gotten in on, you know, like Cards Against Humanity.
4606481	4611882	Fuck, I love that game, but I really wish I had gotten in on that Kickstarter so I can get a full set of the cards.
4613402	4614723	Have you seen Ryan's custom pack?
4614803	4616223	Have you seen the pack that we play with at home?
4617149	4617910	The custom pack?
4617970	4618791	No.
4620092	4624895	You know the fact that they release the PDF of all of the cards on the set.
4625396	4639507	And the whole reason why they do that is because if you missed what amounts to limited scale printing and you are particularly savvy, Ryan printed up a pack of her own and we have a bunch of custom ones that we made for our own purposes, a couple custom blacks, and then...
4640888	4646231	Everybody that we know, like everybody that we could really throw in a good joke about has their name on a card as well.
4646911	4651314	And she's happy to, you know, pay materials and then we'll get a deck out to you.
4651814	4653535	Well, no, I've printed my own.
4653875	4654576	We've been playing with it.
4654596	4656717	But it's weird, though, because they're like little cracker-sized.
4656737	4657397	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4657877	4659638	The PDF is in a really nasty square.
4659678	4665282	We made them general, like actually apples-to-appleside cards because she knows how to put it together to be able to do that kind of thing.
4665302	4665922	Yeah, I would have done that.
4665942	4667423	But, you know, at the time, I was under a time.
4667623	4669524	I had to print them out and cut them up.
4669898	4671078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4692063	4696985	But yeah, there's a lot of game projects on there that are worth supporting if that's your thing.
4697305	4701987	But also, like I said, crazy guy that looks like Jabba the Hutt and a rapist.
4702127	4707189	There's a bunch of people on there that maybe I shouldn't support them.
4707509	4709130	You also said that on Bobby's show.
4709670	4710970	I just want to nail it home.
4711070	4713451	He looks like Jabba the Hutt crossed with a rapist.
4713471	4717613	The OLR podcasters have no idea what you're talking about if they didn't listen to Bobby's show this week.
4718113	4719014	I think I mentioned it earlier.
4719034	4721656	There's a guy who won the lottery.
4721936	4728042	He won $43 million, and he wants to create an MMO created by gamers for gamers.
4728342	4728882	Blah, blah, blah.
4729042	4731444	But the thing is, creating an MMO is really fucking hard.
4731685	4739731	This guy thinks that he can do it because he's played games for like 30 years, and I hate to use the cliche of like, oh, he looks like a gamer.
4739871	4743154	No, but seriously, the guy looks like he just crawled out of his mom's basement.
4743615	4744996	I mean, just... So kind.
4745016	4745096	Yeah.
4746096	4754461	But seriously though, the thing about it though is if you look at it, there's no real details to this.
4754501	4756401	He just keeps throwing out stuff.
4756442	4762304	Well, you will get a special mount at level one and blah, blah, blah.
4762685	4764986	It's like, dude, you're talking about garbage.
4765066	4768568	I had a guy I used to deal with that had big ideas like this.
4768588	4769288	Yeah.
4771272	4775357	It was just like, dude, you don't have the smarts or the means to do any of this stuff.
4775377	4777399	So I think that people are just pissing away money.
4779201	4785568	I know a lot of people were donating a dollar so that they can make fun of him on his like...
4787330	4789871	Actual page and stuff, so I don't know.
4790171	4791451	Let me read some of the comments from chat room.
4791471	4794992	There's a lot of talk on this topic at chat.orangenautradio.com.
4795773	4797733	Tiger Claw says, See, Loki even agrees.
4797893	4799054	OLR needs a Kickstarter.
4799114	4799594	Think about it.
4799634	4802635	Better recording equipment, better mics, and maybe a TriCaster?
4803475	4808376	Rageinator says, do a kickstart project so we can experience OLR and 7.1 surround sound.
4810117	4813897	As nice as that is to think about, I'm going to be honest.
4814097	4824120	I would feel guilty taking your money if I couldn't guarantee that 100% of it went into improving the show directly for you guys somehow.
4824860	4825440	And I don't know.
4826640	4828441	We'll think of ideas, I guess.
4829061	4829181	Okay.
4829201	4829321	Okay.
4829981	4830321	I'm sorry.
4830922	4836084	Actually, one idea I didn't think about before is the idea about funding the t-shirts or something in advance.
4836104	4838145	It would be a good idea, I have to admit.
4838606	4839506	So let me put it this way.
4839546	4840507	This is the one I was talking about.
4840587	4841667	It's called Your World.
4842268	4848731	It's a video game project by Elwood Bartlett, and he's got...
4850452	4853114	$20,000!
4850672	4853114	People are funding this already.
4853314	4857877	Of course, he's never going to hit the goal of $1.1 million, but it's fun.
4857897	4859578	People are going to throw it in.
4859718	4862900	It's horribly misspelled, too.
4864401	4865481	Pledge $100 or more.
4865841	4867703	Reward number one, two, and three.
4867923	4873506	Access to special VDOR selling items for those who donated via Kickstarter.
4873626	4876148	Special authenticator to protect your account.
4876568	4877028	Vidor.
4877329	4879250	Spell check your goddamn shit.
4879310	4880290	I mean, seriously.
4882011	4882772	Other comments from chat.
4883092	4886154	Bochikawa says, Kickstarter really is just a way to funnel donations.
4886314	4888235	OLR wouldn't need one because of the listeners.
4888615	4891617	We are the ones that would support OLR and we would be the ones to donate.
4891857	4894979	But there's a lot of Kickstarter projects that nobody has the slightest clue about.
4895279	4898901	And someone a couple thousand miles away would appreciate some money going to a thing they like.
4899601	4918130	which Actdeft also kind of follows up with we have already helped OLR before without Kickstarter and that is very true you have to remember remember my diva fit a few years ago when the computer broke the Orange Ones Radio listeners sent a fucking new computer to us and that is like the best one of the best things if not the best thing that has ever happened
4918650	4919371	from doing this show.
4919411	4926477	I can't tell you how that felt to just be like, oh my god, they sent a computer so we could continue to do the show.
4927057	4929399	It was just an amazing feeling.
4930700	4931000	Anyhow.
4933923	4938426	Really, all that we would have to do if anyone wanted to donate anything is just set up a PayPal.
4939147	4940168	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4940949	4942069	And they take 4%.
4944091	4945112	Last word on Kickstarter.
4945392	4945712	Anything?
4947154	4947414	I mean...
4948945	4950026	I want to post a picture of the guy.
4950086	4950806	I'm just saying.
4950846	4951286	All right.
4952767	4954148	Jet Set Radio HD.
4954448	4955809	It didn't need anything to fund this.
4955849	4957650	Sega just finally decided to bring it out.
4957690	4958411	What a good idea.
4958511	4961392	So Jet Set Radio, everybody's been asking, what about the soundtrack?
4961492	4962953	Are we going to get to keep Rob Zombie?
4962973	4964634	Are we going to get to keep Chibamato?
4964995	4966575	And the answer is no.
4966976	4967656	Dun, dun, dun.
4967736	4969397	But there's – okay, hold on.
4969557	4976141	It's not that bad because there will be about half of the tracks from the North American version will stay in the game.
4976201	4977322	Same with the European version.
4978203	4987811	They did try to re-license the music, but of course, cost, availability, some of these labels that the music was originally on aren't even around anymore, so it just couldn't happen.
4988251	4995738	Now, all the Hideki Nagunuma songs that were in the original, those stay, because those were created for Sega, so of course those are staying.
4996118	4998320	There are a few licensed tracks that will return.
4998660	5000942	The Guitar Vader songs have been re-licensed.
5001742	5004164	Electric Toothbrush, Reps, B.B.
5004204	5006866	Wrights, those songs are coming back, and a few more.
5007186	5016253	So there will be some songs that are going to return in the Jet Set Radio HD, but Rob Zombie, Chibamato, those songs will not be coming back.
5016293	5020696	But I still think that's pretty cool they got to salvage some of it, and at least it will retain that same feel.
5021657	5024259	Also, don't forget, higher resolution, widescreen to play,
5025139	5028961	60 frames a second, and two analog sticks.
5031742	5033243	Jet Set Radio HD.
5033303	5034103	I know I'm excited.
5034323	5035104	How about you, DarkSakura?
5035124	5035744	Are you going to get this?
5036845	5037185	We might.
5037565	5043207	But I'm also thinking about starting a Kickstarter for when I have a kid to see who contributes the most money and wants to pay for the baby's name.
5045316	5046257	Oh my gosh!
5046817	5048358	You can't sell that on Kickstarter.
5048779	5049279	Yes, I can.
5050220	5051000	I can put it on eBay.
5051100	5051561	No.
5052181	5052521	Alright.
5054183	5057185	Let's take a time back to when games were a lot simpler.
5057225	5058566	There was no Kickstarter.
5058726	5060247	Just blowing on the cartridge a lot.
5061144	5063025	This game sure involves blowing and sucking.
5064987	5067728	It's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
5067909	5069350	It also involves farting stars.
5070430	5083219	And that is Kirby's Adventure, also known as, let's see, Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi no Monogatari, which was Kirby of the Stars, the Story of the Fountain of Dreams.
5083279	5089383	Wait, if you listen really carefully, you can hear Actdeft squeeing all the way from Mexico, because he loves Kirby, I know that.
5089483	5090344	I love the music, though.
5094185	5095486	This game just makes you happy.
5096346	5097766	It's a pink little puffball.
5098206	5102088	I'm so pissed off at Nintendo of America for what they do to poor Kirby.
5102828	5106629	They make him look angry in every... You get the Japanese version.
5106689	5107530	Kirby's happy.
5107630	5108530	Hi, I'm happy Kirby.
5109050	5111371	Anything in America comes out that's got Kirby's face on it.
5112151	5112852	Mean Kirby.
5114132	5114792	It's angsty.
5116053	5116633	It's hipster.
5118633	5119914	He was happy before he was angry.
5121627	5121807	Hey boy.
5145549	5146710	So yeah, this was a platformer.
5146770	5153993	It came out on March 26, 1993 in Japan and came out in America on May 1, 1993 and in Europe on December 1, 1993.
5154573	5157535	This came out when I was a junior in high school.
5158575	5162137	Actually, no, I was a senior.
5162377	5162697	Never mind.
5163618	5169861	Anyway, so it was super, super cute and it's actually out on what?
5171101	5172022	Comments from chat.
5173423	5174224	Just move on.
5174704	5175845	It's not appropriate for me to repeat.
5178533	5178993	Badge.
5179053	5179613	Again.
5180294	5181194	Address to the chatroom, not you.
5183095	5192838	So it came out on the Virtual Console on February 12, 2007, and in Europe on February 16, 2007, and in Japan on February 27, 2007, so we actually got it ahead of Japan.
5193778	5200001	And, of course, it was one of the 12-inch masterpieces that was given in Super Smash Bros.
5200041	5200301	Brawl.
5200681	5203262	There's also a 3D Classics version on the eShop.
5204262	5210866	So basically, the story, Kirby wakes up from his after-lunch nap, and he didn't have any dreams.
5211086	5211386	What?
5211426	5212707	God, it's awesome to be Kirby.
5212747	5213447	I'm just thinking.
5214548	5216069	He gets to take a siesta after lunch.
5216149	5216489	It's great.
5217372	5220693	Paint Roller, Mr. Shine, Mr. Bright, Cracko, Heavy Mole, and Meta Knight
5243627	5246150	and one for himself, King Dedede had.
5247491	5253358	So basically you have to go through seven worlds, battle enemies, mini-bosses, bosses, and you have to get the Star Rod put back together.
5253959	5255440	Now here's where it gets fun.
5256565	5258226	as we all know, what?
5258467	5277041	nothing, just, this game makes me laugh, it's cute, it's adorable you're sitting over there saying names like King Dedede, he took the star rod and he broke it up it's like I'm listening to a 4 year old describe something, it's great should I do my 12 year old girl voice?
5277161	5282566	oh my god, yes please so anyway, the game's a platformer shut up
5284625	5289069	So you've got regular levels, a boss fight, and a warp star door!
5289209	5290030	You guys!
5290590	5294013	King DDD took the star rod and broke it!
5294133	5295054	Oh no!
5296035	5297656	You sound extra gay.
5297916	5298497	Just letting you know.
5300999	5301680	Not like a 12-year-old girl.
5301700	5304943	Sorry, that was my impression of the Kony guy in the videos that are on TMZ.
5304963	5306985	Ugh, I'm so sick of that.
5307986	5323301	Anyway, he can run and jump, and he can attack and dodge enemies by side-tackling, and he can fly by inflating himself, meaning he holds his breath until he floats into the air, and then he can basically get as high as he can.
5323422	5324222	He gets high, y'all.
5325183	5327065	You gotta be high to enjoy this game.
5327145	5327665	Shut up.
5327705	5328666	This game's awesome.
5328986	5329326	Oh, it is.
5329406	5329687	It is.
5329727	5330007	I'm on TV.
5330027	5331008	I need to STFU right now.
5331068	5331628	Let me finish.
5332729	5334670	But when he's flying, he can't use his other abilities.
5334891	5338613	But he can exhale and this puff of air after he exhales.
5338894	5340074	Apparently he has death breath.
5340094	5344598	Because when he goes... Enemies die.
5347604	5352187	and anyway, his big ability is that he can inhale.
5352587	5359171	So he sucks enemies and objects into his mouth and then it stays into his mouth until he spits them out.
5364353	5365154	I quit, bye.
5367455	5368816	No, let me finish.
5368856	5369836	God, you people are dirty.
5370337	5374259	It's a game for six, look, UFO Catcher Kirby.
5377777	5378778	He's fucking fat.
5380159	5381020	He's a fat bitch.
5382041	5382561	But fluffy.
5383962	5388306	So anyway, he can spit them right back out and do damage.
5388726	5389507	Or he can swallow them.
5390247	5391108	He swallows or spits.
5391448	5392109	There, I said it.
5392810	5393310	Are you happy?
5393330	5393991	Yes.
5395905	5397266	Rob is red in the face.
5397666	5399327	He is as red as my shirt, y'all.
5400948	5403790	But he can swallow them too, and he copies their abilities.
5404570	5407392	He can spit fire if he swallows something that spits fire.
5407432	5409553	So he swallows them and absorbs their DNA a little bit?
5411529	5416493	He can also use his drop ability, but he can't inhale anything while he has a special ability.
5417354	5420996	So when he uses up the special ability, he farts a star.
5423278	5424239	Or he poops a star.
5425519	5428602	So I like the flying bouncy star, the special power-up.
5430083	5436469	Kirby's Adventure was one of those late generation games and probably the best of them.
5451596	5454438	Wario Woods I have this game in the box, by the way.
5477521	5479643	So yeah, there were different remakes.
5479804	5482126	Don't bring box into this or I'm only going to laugh harder.
5484969	5487552	Do not make me re-download the Vuvuzela app, okay?
5489145	5494608	So, um, now this was re-released on the Game Boy Advance and it was called Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland.
5495929	5503173	And, um, the, uh, name that it came out, um, as in Japan was Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi Deluxe.
5504254	5506736	Which was Kirby of the Stars, the Fountain of Dreams Deluxe.
5506796	5507456	Blah, there you go.
5508477	5512999	Um, the, uh, Nightmare in Dreamland had cooperative, uh, two to four players.
5513379	5514760	So you could play as different colored Kirpys.
5516361	5518042	Um, it had really good reviews.
5518982	5524205	It was given a 9.5 out of 10 by EGM.
5525085	5527006	GameSpot gave it 7.3 out of 10.
5527906	5530107	So, it's been... Fuck GameSpot!
5530347	5530928	I know, right?
5532168	5534409	Also, this is a little bit interesting.
5534869	5542513	There's a French version of the game in Canada, which makes this the only French-only NES released in North America.
5544699	5545240	La Kirby.
5545580	5546080	La Kirby.
5547942	5555609	Also, the soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21st, 1994, and had vocals by Mako Miata.
5556791	5557271	End of story.
5559473	5562716	This is the first game that I know of that actually has a pinball spinoff.
5563357	5566440	And it was actually my first Kirby game was Kirby's Pinball for the Game Boy.
5567645	5569266	Was that on Game Boy Basic?
5569546	5569806	Yes.
5570466	5571907	What about the Pokemon pinball game?
5572087	5574128	That wasn't before Color.
5574849	5585414	The first pinball game that I ever played on a handheld was, or on a console, and I'm including handhelds, was Gator's Revenge on the old Game Boy.
5585454	5587895	Yeah, I was going to say, that was my first pinball game too.
5588756	5593198	Although I think I rented Pinball Quest before that, but anyway.
5593678	5595119	Pinbot was also great.
5595259	5599423	Well, one thing that was funny is that when we had a pinball party at the house, we had a jackpot in the house.
5599523	5602765	No, we had Bride of Pinbot dancing up the nest with Pinbot right next to it.
5603146	5603406	Nice.
5603626	5604327	Yeah, that was pretty funny.
5604687	5605087	Okay.
5605888	5614556	We need a new, like, not to distract from Kirby and the cute music that's in the background, but we could use, like, a great new pinball game from Nintendo, because they gave us some awesome ones.
5614596	5615937	I mean, there was the Kirby one, you know...
5616477	5618258	Outstanding, I love that game.
5618278	5618979	Yeah, it was great.
5619039	5620359	So we need a new one.
5620400	5625122	You know what, I want that new, well it's not new new anymore, but the Kirby game that came out on DS.
5635934	5637715	It's like 10 Kirby's.
5637755	5638976	You can borrow it if you want.
5639096	5640297	I would love to borrow it.
5640337	5641537	It's the Kirby draw one.
5641697	5641978	Yeah.
5642098	5642518	I have it.
5642598	5643839	I really wanted to play that.
5643859	5644079	Sure.
5644299	5644779	You can borrow it.
5645119	5645580	I ain't playing it.
5646480	5646960	Thank you.
5647140	5647721	You're welcome.
5647761	5649502	See, something good came of all that laughter.
5650022	5651163	See, laughter brings healing.
5651563	5652784	Rob's no longer bright red.
5653004	5653264	All right.
5653364	5654445	Well, I've calmed down a little bit.
5654765	5655005	All right.
5656462	5657602	Plenty more OLR to come.
5657642	5658543	We're not done yet.
5658603	5660423	We've got more news coming at you.
5660823	5663964	We're going to talk about some really controversial things in the next half.
5664004	5667665	So you want to stick with this and get your say in in our chat room if you're listening live.
5667725	5672086	Chat, excuse me, dot OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

5676147	5678808	And the first ever OLR, Pants Off, Dance Off.
5679788	5680188	Okay.
5680208	5680588	Just kidding.
5680828	5682369	I was going to say, that's news to me.
5683730	5685471	It was a surprise for $4.50, Rob.
5686112	5688214	Who knows what other surprises DarkSakura has in store?
5688254	5691497	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5697734	5706259	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Saturday evening, March the 18th of 2012, with the 450th episode of our show.
5706860	5709341	And we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in just a little bit.
5709661	5710482	Hope you all had a good St.
5710502	5713183	Patrick's Day, those of you that, you know, decided to do something.
5713524	5717726	I don't know if it's just because, like, I'm getting old now or whatever, but I didn't really do anything yesterday.
5717766	5719547	Did you guys do anything to kind of celebrate?
5719627	5725811	Like, you know, going out to the bars and getting blitzed was awesome when I was 21, but now, like, last night, I was like, I'm too tired to do anything.
5725970	5727852	The only instrument that sounds like cattle being beaten to death?
5753829	5754971	Hey now, don't hate.
5756293	5757054	I like bagpipes.
5757094	5758496	But anyway, let's talk Metreon.
5758576	5760298	Because you reminded me you were right by there.
5760378	5763463	Remember when the Metreon used to be like nerd heaven?
5763755	5768319	Remember when the Metreon actually had something more than just a movie theater in 5 or 6?
5768919	5771021	Did you know that the Metreon had gone through some changes?
5771321	5771481	No.
5772042	5782771	It was very surprising coming out here because I heard of all of these classic video gaming staples that I was in the immediate vicinity of that aren't there anymore.
5782931	5786794	Pier 39 doesn't have... Mel told me what the place was called.
5786814	5788095	I completely forgot what it was all of a sudden.
5788115	5788676	I forgot what it was called.
5788716	5790797	I just remember the DDR tournament we did live from there.
5790897	5791458	That was a good time.
5791478	5791958	Yeah, the Pier 39...
5793059	5795260	B3 was a tournament, but I don't remember the name of the arcade.
5797561	5799142	Pier 39 had a nice place.
5799302	5804964	Metreon was, as best as I understand, the original DDR tournament location.
5806605	5811667	Whether it did or didn't have the first US DDR arcade, it was kind of the staple of everything.
5811807	5813728	My first DDR tournament was at the Metreon, yeah.
5813928	5815228	Yeah.
5815248	5822511	So tell me about, and Metron, you know, this isn't just about music games, but Metron was the home of the Sony store, the official Sony store for a long, long time.
5823031	5829193	So tell me about not knowing any of this and what you felt when you walked into the Metron for the first time in eight years.
5829213	5829253	Uh...
5830513	5831574	for the first time ever in my case.
5831594	5832574	Oh, we didn't go there.
5832654	5833094	Oh, okay.
5833214	5842519	No, the Metreon, I kind of expected it as soon as I looked outside, walked down the street towards it and saw what was going on.
5842779	5847081	There's a huge chunk of the Metreon that's just closed off because apparently they're renovating well over half of it.
5847341	5848462	I saw Nightmare Before Christmas there twice
5865745	5867846	Get a thing of candy, a winner every time, something ridiculously basic
5886424	5888885	Rumor is that Target is going into Metreon.
5888945	5892467	Well, that actually would be a big deal because in San Francisco proper, there's no Target.
5892567	5896009	The closest Target is in Daly City, which is a little bit south.
5896089	5899150	Anyway, go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5899190	5900751	We have Porkchop is in our chatroom tonight.
5900791	5906173	Porkchop is Irish, as in Ireland, as in staying up until 3 in the morning to listen to this show.
5906213	5908154	And Porkchop says, I'm Irish and I did nothing.
5908514	5909575	It's a gigantic mess.
5911090	5912051	I can't say I blame you.
5912091	5912672	I did the same thing.
5913333	5916957	Technus in our chatroom says, isn't Pier 39 a tourist trap now in San Francisco?
5917278	5917959	It always was.
5917979	5918780	It always was.
5919340	5920943	Or am I thinking of something totally different?
5920983	5922464	No, it hasn't changed.
5922505	5923926	It always has been a giant tourist trap.
5923946	5924627	But I will say this.
5925328	5926269	The fresh donuts.
5926329	5927351	I hope those are still there.
5927371	5929013	There's a little stand that sells the donuts.
5929153	5929734	Donut Bag Stand
5944671	5945672	Oh, and the chocolate place.
5945752	5947012	It's like all kinds of chocolate.
5947032	5947953	It has the boost chocolate.
5948293	5950034	Did you go to the Saltwater Taffy store?
5950054	5950674	No, I did not.
5951915	5956597	I passed through a whole bunch of stuff and stepped inside and looked at a couple of places, but no, I didn't get in there.
5956677	5963221	My two favorite places actually is Treasure Isle, the big Celtic store, and the Sock store.
5964341	5969124	Alright, well we could reminisce about San Francisco and memories and when the Metron was cool and all that.
5969204	5971606	Although, it is still a good place to see movies, I'll give it that.
5972787	5979291	I know you didn't end up doing that, but... The little nature in Martin Luther King Memorial Outdoors was actually a really nice walk.
5979351	5980352	Really cool park in the back.
5980392	5987877	The weather held up enough that walking around town was not miserable, being rained on, being blown over, anything like that.
5988037	5991419	It's a really nice little property in the middle there, Moscone, Yerba Buena, and all those.
5991639	5992080	Yeah, yeah.
5992782	5996265	Alright, well let's move on, back to some games, as much as we can talk about the outdoors.
5997326	6002731	Let's get back to some video games with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories that don't fit in anywhere else.
6003432	6007316	Alright, let's talk about Ridiculous Bundles.
6007536	6015844	Steel Battalion, known for, you know, it's not exactly cheap prices in the past, but they have a brand new...
6018166	6028858	I guess it's available in Japan right now for 35,000 yen or 420 US dollars via Capcom's online shop.
6028878	6038428	You can get a Steel Battalion bundle that includes a backpack, a helmet, a jacket, a
6039469	6045010	Patches, soundtrack to the game, and I believe an art book.
6045750	6046170	That's right.
6046230	6055172	You can dress up like the character in the game with an actual helmet and looks like bomber jacket for $400.
6055472	6057693	It's a little ridiculous.
6058373	6060313	But then again, they used to have a $200 controller.
6061213	6063954	I bought Dan the full controller when it was $300 for the old one.
6067464	6069505	I mean, that's something that was kind of unnecessary.
6070465	6071805	It has the huge red button.
6073106	6074246	I love the eject button.
6074286	6075026	That was pretty fun.
6075106	6076687	Now, could you play the game without that controller?
6079207	6079507	I don't know.
6079527	6080368	You're looking for the wrong guy.
6080628	6082328	Actually, I think that you could.
6082568	6085029	If you could, it was a very stripped-down experience, needless to say.
6085229	6085489	Yeah.
6086089	6090410	Did you know they also made mods for the full unit to make it a more compact unit?
6092271	6092431	Yeah.
6092731	6103851	but did they make any mods to make the compact unit as it was a huge unit like a Battletech booth we're talking about units by the way you know who has two of those controllers now you yep yeah
6105738	6123702	Skyrim is going to be getting another update pretty soon, a 1.5 patch that's going to add a bunch of kill cams for things that don't have kill cams right now, including ranged attacks, also magic spells, and they're going to be adding some new melee combat moves and animations as well.
6124202	6126683	So it's kind of enhancing a bunch of stuff.
6127003	6127884	Thanks for watching!
6147598	6152341	And props to Bethesda's blog for allowing me to put in my age.
6152481	6154642	You know how you hit the age gate or whatever?
6154783	6156864	Happy 130th birthday, Loki!
6157064	6157544	I know!
6157945	6159506	Let's just select the 1800s.
6159566	6160466	It's like, awesome.
6163849	6168892	But yeah, so they're going to be fixing some other bug stuff as well on top of the added features.
6169298	6171399	But hey, all that's for free!
6172140	6173640	So suck it, Capcom!
6174501	6175982	Free shit, awesome.
6177643	6183746	And then, last but not least, God of War has a demake that's available on PC if you want to check it out.
6184606	6189649	It is the Bit of War, and it looks almost like Rygar or something.
6191410	6197513	But yeah, 8-bit demake, and it's available on the website armlessoctopus.com
6198834	6199254	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6222102	6223063	All right, that never happens.
6247680	6249081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6270822	6274343	However, EA does not officially or unofficially endorse the game.
6274383	6275864	They had to clarify that.
6276844	6281966	They did get the lawyers and everything to sign off of them, so that's kind of shocking.
6282166	6285947	So unfortunately that means you're not going to get a Wing Commander remake anytime soon.
6285987	6289068	Yeah, that doesn't bode well for official Wing Commander stuff.
6289108	6291349	But hey, this fan thing sounds like it's going to be awesome.
6291489	6292669	It's free, first off.
6292749	6294210	Yay!
6294230	6296771	50 missions, 2 campaigns, 60 voice actors.
6297011	6297951	I want to be a voice actor.
6298751	6315763	Dozens of Terran and Kilrathi spaceships, 70 cutscenes It takes place after Wing Commander 3 I'm assuming it's going to pretend that that movie never existed Because if you're a true fan, you're just going to ignore that movie Who has actually seen that movie in full here?
6316424	6319106	I've seen parts, and all I remember is Freddie Prinze Jr.
6319126	6322388	and Matthew Lillard of Scream fame I...
6323659	6330543	I'm very ashamed to admit this, but long ago and far away, I've never spent a dime on it.
6331163	6334625	Long ago and far away, it was like the weekend Fox movie or whatever.
6334965	6340588	I was having an absolutely lazy day, and I can honestly say I watched the thing from start to finish, and I really wish I couldn't.
6342245	6346286	I prefer to think of Matthew Litter from Hacker's Fame.
6347687	6348747	That upgrades his status.
6348827	6352369	Just like Johnny Lee Miller, who would next be seen in Dark Shadows.
6352809	6353869	It's going to be awesome.
6354369	6357410	Anyhow, which by the way, internet, stop hating on the Dark Shadows trailer.
6357511	6357891	Stop it.
6359011	6359391	Weird.
6359692	6363014	It's weird, but it's supposed... Okay, if you look at it as like... Is it Tim Burton?
6363034	6364014	Oh yeah, it's Tim Burton.
6364074	6365355	Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
6365635	6368397	And the old show was a little bit cheesy.
6368637	6371519	And it's all 70s and stuff because it's supposed to be like the old show.
6371899	6378664	And in the context of the fact that right now everybody's all about Twilight and shit, it's actually really funny.
6378884	6380625	Like, I just... I don't know.
6380965	6382006	People need to let it go.
6382086	6382566	All right, anyhow.
6383567	6386370	Rhythm Party, fun game on the Xbox 360.
6386490	6392215	If you're a Bomani fan, you probably haven't heard of this, which is strange to me because it's right up a Bomani fan's alley.
6392295	6393936	It's a great Kinect game for Bomani.
6394417	6397980	I liked it way more than I thought I would, as I said previously on the show.
6398360	6399561	And there's some more DLC.
6400002	6405807	If you are sick of the song list being too tiny, you can get three new songs this week in Rhythm Party Song Pack 4.
6406627	6408249	The Sunbeam by Dez Roe.
6409250	6410914	is one song.
6411215	6413741	Inside Your Mind by Limahl.
6414983	6416828	Wasn't that the band that did The NeverEnding Story?
6418464	6419144	Yes, it was.
6419784	6425046	That was the band that did The NeverEnding Story is now in Rhythm Party with Inside Your Mind.
6425226	6429147	I don't know if that's a new song or an old song or what because I only thought they ever did one song.
6429687	6430787	But here's the third song.
6431127	6435188	If you've ever played Bomani Games ever, you know this song.
6435868	6441510	Bag by Revenge is the third song that you can now play in Rhythm Party.
6442590	6443170	Yeah, Bag.
6443210	6443390	What?
6443410	6444731	You hating on Bag over there?
6445411	6446231	It's just weird.
6447992	6448733	I think it's great.
6450135	6454340	I was actually trying to see if I had a clip of bag.
6454980	6456242	Just for the people that don't know.
6458116	6460597	Where is my old music folder?
6460617	6462497	Speaking of being woken up by bagpipes.
6463237	6463537	Right?
6463677	6465738	It's kind of appropriate for the time of year, isn't it?
6467658	6469718	Perhaps that's exactly why they chose to release it this week.
6469838	6470919	Perhaps, perhaps.
6471719	6473119	What 2DX game was back in?
6473199	6473539	Eight.
6473959	6474479	Or nine.
6474539	6474939	Wrong.
6474959	6475239	Here it is.
6475259	6476840	Imagine flailing your arms and legs to this.
6491778	6492739	Now, when did this come out?
6492759	6495121	Because this would be totally appropriate for, like, yesterday.
6495721	6496101	Tuesday.
6496121	6496722	It came out Tuesday.
6496942	6497703	Ah, well then, perfect.
6497963	6499184	Totally appropriate for yesterday.
6499504	6500325	Yep, so there you go.
6500705	6502266	Actually, you have to see this, though, quickly.
6502546	6505669	I know this is terrible radio, but let me show the YouTube here real quick.
6506409	6514415	Because somebody actually puts together the... It's not Konami, but some fan puts together all the DLC stuff into these videos on YouTube.
6514896	6517358	And you have to see the animations for Bag.
6517418	6518658	They will blow your mind.
6518699	6519059	Hold on.
6519439	6519679	Here's...
6520780	6521541	Wait, that's inside your mind.
6521561	6522062	Here's Bag.
6524224	6530512	Like, look at all the little dancing sheep in the background, and then as you're dancing, little bagpipes get attached to you.
6530912	6537961	I feel like an entire Beatles album just invaded my brain.
6540931	6545296	Complete with LSD and George Harrison's obsession with the sitar.
6545677	6546658	I had no... Look at this.
6546818	6550423	I have just been schooled on my 80s pop music by Xenacore in our chat room.
6550563	6552445	I seriously had no idea ever of this.
6552846	6555709	Xenacore says, Rob, Limahl is the singer.
6556149	6558833	The band was nameless as far as anyone cares.
6560427	6561187	DarkSakura, RapidFireNews
6590185	6591966	But maybe Volume 2 will be better.
6592066	6593206	So next thing.
6593706	6594086	Rumor.
6594487	6600129	Shenmue 1 and 2 HD finished going to Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.
6600409	6608631	An anonymous source reported it to Gamerzine saying that it's been completed for over a year and it's pending release.
6608872	6610332	But that doesn't say it's true.
6611553	6611813	Rumor.
6612713	6613253	Rumor.
6613993	6614894	Which is a really good album.
6615074	6615334	Rumors.
6616214	6618896	So how about some Rock Band 3 tracks that are coming out?
6618996	6619537	How about it?
6620217	6626702	There will be two tracks from Men at Work that will be in the Rock Band Music Store, Overkill and Down Under.
6627603	6629164	And Carlos Santana's Smooth.
6631306	6633387	That should make some people need new pants.
6634328	6636690	Not really, that song got played out.
6637270	6639872	Well yeah, for people who like playing pro guitar mode.
6641013	6642434	Alright, I'll give you that, I'll give you that.
6643514	6644975	Imagine that would be kind of hot.
6646195	6653338	And so anyway, the tracks are going to be $1.99 and there is, of course, like I said, pro upgrade available for smooth for $0.99 or 80 Microsoft points.
6658510	6665515	which is funny because actually on the way up here I was listening to Lonely Island and the Santana DVX song came up and that song's funny.
6666296	6669378	Alright, we're going to transition back into some longer news here.
6669458	6670759	The mailbag is coming up in a minute.
6670859	6674781	A mailbag at orangeentree.com FUs of the week and your calls soon.
6675402	6676603	No Fugle question this week.
6676663	6679285	Sorry, I'm going to be totally honest with an out-of-town guest.
6679305	6680185	I forgot to do it today.
6680586	6682147	So we'll bring it back next week.
6682187	6682647	Sorry about that.
6682867	6683127	Loki.
6684288	6685609	Alright.
6686390	6687530	Let's talk a little bit about
6688451	6692172	Mass Effect, and... I mean, come on.
6692392	6696352	Seriously, people that are fans of Mass Effect, this is a little ridiculous.
6696772	6706634	Apparently, a Mass Effect 3 fan has complained about the ending of the game, but didn't necessarily complain to BioWare or EA.
6707114	6709795	They complained to the Federal Trade Commission.
6710815	6716216	And, yes, apparently, a BioWare forum user named ElSpico...
6718076	6726279	went to the FTC to file a false advertising complaint at EA and also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
6727379	6732701	And, you know, his reasons for it.
6732841	6741984	After reading through the list of promises about the ending of the game that they made in their advertising campaign and PR interviews, it was clear that the product we got did not live up to those claims.
6742424	6743505	This is not something...
6744745	6759673	I was happy to do, but after the terrible ending that there was no way that the product had been advertised to me and the lack of any kind of response from Bioware EA to address this, I felt this is my only recourse.
6761333	6768657	And he'll be returning his copy before the end of the 30-day return policy if the ending has not been addressed by then.
6771098	6771919	Fucking really?
6772079	6772539	Yeah.
6773874	6775936	I know, people are stupid.
6776516	6778698	There was more recourse for him.
6779058	6794910	I didn't like any of the prequel movies for Star Wars, but did I go up to George Lucas when I was in the same room as him and demand my money back while I was eating meatloaf prepared by his staff?
6796111	6796271	No.
6796291	6796331	No.
6797031	6797651	Link and Zelda Kissing
6827717	6829418	or Embracing or whatever it is they're doing.
6829519	6829879	Boning.
6830079	6830700	Yeah, boning.
6830820	6831560	So, yeah.
6832021	6832921	But, okay, look, look.
6833102	6837225	I'm not trying to compare, like, Mass Effect to Zelda The Adventures of Link, although both are great games.
6837926	6839687	And I don't know the ending of Mass Effect 3.
6839807	6843730	I am really trying to save myself because I am experiencing the games for the first time.
6843810	6844011	But...
6844571	6862996	I'm kind of thinking, okay, from what I've heard about it, the thing I've heard, or the way it's been explained to me without spoiling it, is that Mass Effect is very much about the story decisions you make along the way, and if you choose to go Paragon or Renegade or somewhere down the middle, and it really seems like the ending kind of doesn't fucking care about how you played the game for the past three games.
6863036	6866877	And so it sounds like kind of that disregard there really kind of irritated people.
6867297	6869138	So that I can kind of see where it's irritating, but...
6870558	6875019	Are people really letting the last 15 minutes just totally ruin the entire franchise for them?
6875079	6889724	Because even if the ending at this point is just fucking Goatse Man comes out and shows me his asshole, I'm still going to be like, the rest of the game up until that point was so fucking rad, I would still recommend this game to other people.
6889744	6895346	Well, you know what happens is he ends up on a roof, he calls tech support, and they tell him to jump off the building in order to wake up.
6897748	6898832	What if that was the ending?
6898872	6900418	Then you'd be really pissed.
6900458	6903208	As long as it's got some cigaros in there, I am all good.
6906707	6914330	But you know, how many movies and how many TV shows, or especially TV shows, and one I mentioned on Bobby's show before was The Sopranos, right?
6914630	6917411	The Sopranos was a hugely popular show on HBO.
6917691	6921813	Lots of people loved this for seven seasons, and then the ending was really bad.
6922233	6924694	Like, I don't know if you guys know about the ending, but it was just fade to black.
6925414	6927075	It had a really bad ending.
6927295	6928435	But it didn't ruin the series.
6928575	6932337	At least the ending isn't Commander Shepard's son driving off with a tranny.
6934659	6936622	I'm Sure A Lot Of People Don't Catch That Reference
6948047	6973528	so I mean sometimes and some people would say that Battlestar Galactica had a terrible ending too I like the ending of Battlestar Galactica I mean there's only so many ways you get into a show like that I thought it was a great ending but you know some people don't agree with that so the nice thing about Mass Effect is that they can release something for DLC later or you know I know Bioware swears up and down it'll be the last game but you guys like fucking really you're gonna buy that
6974349	6977170	Right, Halo 3 was going to be the last Halo game, remember that?
6977630	6997897	You know, there's ways they could do... And, you know, again, even if it ended with the entire universe imploding, like God came down and smited everybody, whatever it is that's so terrible, even if that happened, there's no reason they can't do prequels, side stories, you know, the characters before they joined up with Shepard, or just in another part of the galaxy, or...
6998477	7022752	from the enemy's perspective there's a million things they could do with Mass Effect still even if they chose to go to another developer granted it probably won't be as good if it's not a Bioware game but you never know once again though they can't give in to this kind of bullshit this is the ending that you guys decided on obviously there is much thought to the ending of a trilogy of a game series that's been just this massive game um yeah pun intended I guess um
7023252	7028538	But you can't just give in because some people complain about the ending to something.
7029278	7030660	You can't please everybody.
7030980	7031781	And so what?
7032041	7033663	So you hated the ending of the game.
7035185	7035865	Well, that's that.
7036226	7045852	But if you give in to this, then any game that you put out, both BioWare, EA, any publisher, you're going to have people that are like, I don't like the ending.
7046012	7047893	I'm going to complain to the FTC.
7047953	7052416	I'm going to complain to the Better Business Bureau because I need you guys to change the ending to how I want it.
7052456	7054238	Well, no, I want the ending to be like this.
7054498	7054978	Fuck that.
7055458	7055899	You know what?
7055979	7060241	If you're so bent over the ending, just write some fan fiction or something.
7060261	7062043	That's what we used to do back in the day.
7062083	7063964	If we didn't like something, we fan ficked it.
7065930	7067712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7084514	7085275	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7104073	7121961	and you know I think the reason why people are really mad to kind of get here you know is something I said earlier they could fix the ending through DLC just like they did with Fallout and I think people feel like ah you had me by the balls here with a shitty ending and you're gonna make me pay 10 bucks to get the real ending although y'all know you're gonna YouTube it
7125039	7128120	Half of all of this outcry, everybody already has anyways.
7128220	7132621	And that part of it, I can sympathize a little bit with that.
7132661	7135622	That is kind of shitty to force me to get more DLC.
7135762	7137742	They also change endings all the time and stuff.
7137782	7140963	I mean, look at, for example, I Am Legend.
7140983	7141543	Star Wars.
7141743	7146184	They're changing the end of that movie because they're going to make a sequel.
7147424	7152791	So, let's just assume that they kill off Shepard or something like that at the end of Mass Effect 3.
7153111	7154573	I have to say something about I Am Legend.
7155073	7156816	They changed it from the original ending anyway.
7158499	7164804	Well, I can't believe that they changed Titanic where now the boat's not going to sink so that way they can make a Titanic.
7165404	7166245	I'm joking.
7166465	7171689	And it transforms into a 50-foot robot.
7171709	7172710	50-foot robot.
7173671	7188142	For the record, I don't care who the spoils work is, how the movie's been out forever, but in I Am Legend, it turned out that all the vampire things, which I believe was in the book, were all sentient and trying to rescue the one that he was keeping in captivity.
7188482	7190303	Yes, they addressed that.
7191084	7192205	But they didn't end it that way.
7192565	7194066	Well, they did in the director's cut.
7194546	7195427	Okay, the director's cut.
7195687	7197829	See, it would make sense to take that to go with.
7198189	7199710	Great point from TigerClaw in the chat room.
7199890	7201331	Portal had its ending changed.
7201651	7201911	Portal 1.
7202152	7203593	It didn't have its ending changed.
7203733	7205494	It had its ending extended.
7205554	7206054	Enhanced.
7206294	7208416	Well, but it was an important scene.
7208456	7209777	It was just straight up new content.
7209857	7212979	And console gamers, well, you heard the news.
7213039	7213559	What am I thinking?
7214864	7218745	Yeah, that wasn't like, oh, GLaDOS didn't actually blow up.
7219745	7221545	For the record, actually... I'm sorry to everybody.
7221585	7222725	I just spoiled that, too.
7222845	7228846	For the record, it was actually texted as the original ending.
7229527	7236608	Because you can find a bit of programming code for party retrieval bot.
7237368	7240548	And the little model that they used for it was actually already in the game.
7240568	7243929	Because if you go into third-person mode, you can actually see whatever it is that's dragging her off.
7244609	7247511	and they had all the data was programmed in.
7247832	7249052	They just didn't use it.
7249553	7254436	So going back in with DLC they were able to use the original ending that they had mined.
7255477	7255877	Just saying.
7257258	7257959	A lot of stuff like that.
7257979	7265804	This is why I don't ever look at any ending as canon until they've said that's it.
7267406	7267686	You know.
7268366	7269827	Or until the studio goes out of business.
7270448	7271509	Or until they have no choice.
7271969	7273310	That's why I have no more cube movies.
7275396	7283703	Alright, well, anyhow, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this situation because my thing would be all like, well, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but too late, you already bought it.
7284203	7291529	And I'd like to pitch, or I should say recommend a title based on your joke there, Titanic 2.
7292870	7297834	There is a game coming out very soon, actually, that is...
7299495	7299695	We, NDS
7323800	7325001	Alright, anyhow.
7325881	7334164	I think we need to move on with more stories, but seriously, going to the feds to complain about the ending, like, look at your life, look at your choices.
7335505	7336725	There's other things to be mad about.
7336745	7342248	There's some people that call the SWAT team on somebody if they're beating them in Call of Duty, so I mean, eh.
7343408	7343828	Thanks for watching!
7362354	7364875	is going to be chirp, chirp, chirp.
7364996	7366636	Yeah, we fucking hated the ending too.
7368017	7369738	All right, look, moving on.
7370278	7379743	Hopefully this game won't have a shitty ending, but I will say the TV series, from what I understand, loves to do twists and turns and has been causing some fan controversy.
7379903	7381424	I have sadly not watched any.
7381804	7384486	I have not watched this show either, but I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7384867	7393114	I'm not big on the whole zombie stuff, but then again, apparently I misjudged Mass Effect all these years ago, so someday I'm going to have to sit down and watch The Walking Dead.
7393755	7400100	It's a show that a lot of people are really into right now, and of course, when something gets big, there's the inevitable game that comes out.
7400180	7402923	You may or may not remember, Telltale is the ones doing the game.
7403223	7408648	Of course, Telltale does a lot of the adventure games, the Jurassic Park, the Monkey Island reboot and all that.
7409308	7413751	The Walking Dead will be out in great Telltale fashion on every fucking platform you can think of.
7414291	7416752	Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, PC, Mac, iOS.
7417193	7419014	First episodes coming out in April.
7419094	7420935	There will be five episodes in total.
7421335	7425697	They will each be regularly released after the first one comes out.
7425738	7428359	So I don't know if that's one a month, one every three months, whatever that's going to be.
7429159	7429560	There you go.
7430560	7435403	Telltale, the only company that understands episodic content and does it right.
7435643	7437064	Yeah, thanks Gabe Newell.
7439478	7443420	because he harped on episodic content is the way of the future.
7443640	7444540	I see what you did there.
7445441	7447882	Although Steam is a great place to get these games.
7448382	7448742	Very true.
7448782	7449903	That's where I have Back to the Future.
7450163	7453224	Walking Dead will also be available on Facebook.
7454249	7454870	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7470190	7472452	You're going to set up and maintain base camps.
7472512	7474634	You send out scouts to scavenge for supplies.
7474994	7476635	And there's also some combat, naturally.
7476936	7477956	Now, you know what would be cool?
7478016	7481199	I will say, in theory, this would be a great game.
7481399	7485823	If I could have a little zombie camp, and I could send zombies to destroy DarkSakura's people.
7486083	7486763	That would be fun.
7486843	7487504	No, you couldn't do that.
7487544	7487964	You know why?
7488104	7488324	Why?
7488705	7489525	I don't play Facebook games.
7492581	7493722	Click on it when you're not home.
7493742	7495643	When you're not watching and logged in.
7495743	7496243	No way.
7496443	7496643	Fine.
7496663	7499605	Then who plays like every Facebook game that's out there?
7499705	7500245	Somebody I know.
7500285	7501186	People who aren't me.
7502647	7503207	Somebody I know.
7503767	7504848	Somebody I know on Facebook.
7504968	7505348	X-Link.
7505448	7506449	X-Link will be playing it.
7508130	7509551	I'll kill X-Link's zombie camp.
7510251	7510551	All right.
7511952	7512312	Shane.
7512352	7513513	Shane likes The Walking Dead.
7513533	7516254	He'll be curious enough to try the game and I will destroy his people.
7516314	7516815	It will be fun.
7518962	7529267	Yes, Porkchop, there was a Dexter game that was mostly a point-and-click adventure and kind of a 3D version of an old point-and-click adventure game.
7529307	7531108	Dexter the TV show?
7531268	7531448	Yeah.
7531568	7533109	It was okay.
7534210	7534950	It could have been longer.
7535690	7536191	How about that?
7536211	7536851	You know what?
7537011	7538312	Telltale did a CSI game.
7538972	7540953	That was another thing that they did based on the show.
7541533	7544415	I hear, and I don't even watch the show.
7544475	7548157	I just didn't have a real big interest in the CSI game, but I hear it wasn't bad.
7549297	7549998	How old was it?
7550198	7551298	Wasn't that like six?
7551338	7552259	Probably about five years ago.
7552279	7554660	I mean, the show's been on for, what, nine years now?
7554740	7563786	I seem to remember that X-Play, or perhaps even Extended Play at the time, reviewed it and said that it was not quite as polished as it should have been for such an investigative game.
7563866	7565187	I think I'm thinking about the same thing.
7565227	7565867	I might be wrong.
7565967	7569429	Yes, but we can't always trust reviews, as we're going to learn later in the show, that's for sure.
7569509	7569809	All right.
7570410	7573872	One thing we can trust is your emails, I think.
7574472	7575754	Every week you guys send us emails.
7575854	7581480	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And DarkSakura dives in or sends her zombie squad in to pull out the emails.
7582281	7582761	Sticky.
7583142	7584703	And read them here on the show.
7584723	7585604	It's a little sticky.
7585885	7589088	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com That's not email.
7590149	7592832	Well, it would help if it would actually let me read it.
7597659	7599200	Well, we'll just listen to the happy pulpy music.
7625362	7632789	I'll start, I have a big love you to people who are genuinely friendly during disc golf games and want to help you become a better player.
7633270	7642439	Another example from Loki would sound something like, a big love you to Nintendo for always going out on a limb to create new and exciting IPs without rehashing anything prior.
7642979	7643880	This one he has for me.
7644741	7648204	A big love you to World of Warcraft for rainbow unicorns that make me feel shiny.
7649205	7650186	If If If
7674231	7680098	But I do say a genuine love you or thank you to everybody that leaves us nice reviews on iTunes.
7680438	7685864	When I'm truly not in a pissy mood, I do nice things, you know, but I'm female.
7687686	7688226	I don't care.
7688287	7689187	I didn't even have to say it.
7689948	7690429	Girl, please.
7693462	7697103	We are full of love and stuff for the two and a half hours.
7698603	7699424	Okay.
7699444	7705505	This is from... The fabled Art of Video Game exhibit at the Smithsonian is now open.
7705866	7710307	I haven't gone yet because all of the opening day talks were booked before I checked.
7710607	7710827	Wow.
7711287	7714968	It is running during Otakon if people want to make the drive from Baltimore to D.C.
7715348	7721490	From Baltimore, I like to take the Metro from I-95 in Greenbelt, Maryland rather than try and park downtown.
7722890	7724230	If I lived there, I knew what that meant.
7725931	7727211	I think he's just giving people directions.
7727251	7730892	They have all these funny terms for roads out there, like the green belt.
7731532	7731992	What's that?
7733852	7735832	He attached the letter from the Smithsonian.
7736293	7736573	Nice.
7736973	7738453	It says, open now through September 30th.
7738813	7743414	It felt like this day would never come, but it finally did, and the Art of Video Games exhibition is open to the public.
7743854	7748975	I hope you can make it to see the show in person, but if not, check out the photos of the final installation on Flickr.
7749827	7750548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7771184	7771464	DarkSakura.com
7789645	7799192	Well, to finish on here, it says one of the best parts of the exhibition, in my opinion, is the interviews with video game artists, designers, developers, musicians, writers, and scholars.
7800333	7801274	Yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it.
7801334	7802014	So yeah, pretty cool.
7803956	7809099	I don't have the link to the Flickr on here, so I would suggest seeing if you can find it.
7810260	7811461	And last email, if you're ready.
7812762	7814083	Well, I'm not into sports games.
7814103	7816444	I'm not interested in the cancelled Ubisoft game.
7816744	7821926	For some reason, the pronunciation of Adidas... You said Adidas.
7823807	7825008	The rest of the world says Adidas.
7825388	7825848	Adidas.
7826889	7827869	I've said Adidas before.
7828329	7828649	Okay.
7829190	7830170	Well, he said it sounded odd.
7830510	7832071	I'm more used to Adidas myself.
7832551	7834092	Where does the other pronunciation come from?
7834152	7835713	I'm sure I've heard it that way before.
7835733	7839534	That comes from Robert M. Adidas was what the Korn song was called.
7843941	7869806	yes all day I got it dream about all right forget it like that's the one like rage metal song I'm going to admit to liking here on the show but yes I used to have a college radio show back in the day and we'd play stuff like that so we and the song was called Adidas like that's how you pronounced it so now whenever I see that like I can't help but say it that way even though I know everybody says the company is Adidas but consider it a funny pun I don't know
7871482	7872062	Blink, blink.
7873163	7874304	That's audible blinking.
7874344	7875445	You've never heard the corn song?
7876185	7876906	I don't like corn.
7878907	7879928	Not even in a tortilla?
7881388	7882529	Actually, I'm allergic to corn.
7882549	7883070	Did you know that?
7883710	7884290	Are you really?
7884370	7884811	No, I didn't.
7885011	7885891	I am allergic to corn.
7885991	7888853	I can have it the more processed it is, the easier I have a time having it.
7888873	7891295	But pure corn will make my lips swell and my throat itch.
7892636	7892936	All right.
7893156	7893897	Is that it for emails?
7894397	7894657	Yes.
7895077	7896258	Little known fact, everybody.
7896318	7897259	Now you know something about me.
7898146	7922720	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I might say this name wrong here since I love pronouncing things wrong here on the show Delighter, Delitter, Delighter in our chatroom says All day I dream about sex, song of my life You and every man And a lot of women too, so there you go And sometimes, nothing Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week
7926178	7928947	or if you want, the thank yous of the week.
7938442	7939283	My F.U.
7939503	7945948	goes towards... I'm still going to include Daylight Savings Time as being involved with this F.U.
7946389	7949631	But it goes for this crazy ass insomnia I've been having.
7950212	7953434	And then when I do fall asleep, of course, I can't wake up in the morning.
7953735	7956277	I have been sleeping on average until noon.
7957785	7958286	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7976644	7987312	However, I would like to give a thank you to the SF Market on Florin Road in South Sac, which is usually a very scary part of town, but I found something wonderful and delightful there.
7987792	7993436	Apart from mochi and chocolate salt pocky.
7994397	7996739	They had Café du Monde Chicory Coffee.
7997539	8001682	The only other place I've purchased this before was in New Orleans at the Café du Monde.
8001703	8002363	Fucked up.
8002583	8005124	So, it just made me really homesick.
8005204	8009545	And the weather here today, the weird-ass weather we've been having, reminds me of Alabama.
8009585	8010626	So I've been doubly homesick.
8010746	8017968	I really, really, really want to get back to Alabama and visit everybody before, you know, everything blooms and the humid hits.
8019588	8020109	Very sad.
8020669	8020929	Loki.
8023381	8041429	Uh, I guess, uh, fuck you to the people, or I should say, I think it's the California Transportation Department or something like that, for not painting lines on the freeway and scratching out, there's like four sets of scratched out lines, I don't know where the fuck the lanes are.
8041749	8042429	50 on the way here, huh?
8042449	8042589	Yes.
8042649	8044190	Oh my god, I drive through that every day.
8044210	8047031	In the rain, it makes all the other lines transparent, it's just like...
8047691	8048291	and I'll see you next time
8064722	8071166	Coming from South Sac all the way from 99 to 80 was just torture.
8071267	8072587	So, yeah, I get you.
8072707	8074809	It's just like, I'm like, am I in the lane?
8075069	8076730	Which lines do I follow?
8076850	8077851	It's just ridiculous.
8078791	8079632	So, fuck that.
8080472	8082994	Jason, our guest, do you have anything you want to give angst to?
8083574	8086096	F you to California weather this weekend.
8087410	8088831	This is a shitty weekend to visit.
8088871	8089772	I'm so sorry.
8091153	8091913	It's been rainy.
8091953	8093955	We drove through hail on the way up here.
8094035	8095416	It's been windy as all hell.
8095516	8098038	It's not fucking sunshine and beaches.
8098538	8100560	This is Alabama weather.
8100800	8102761	I left nice Colorado weather.
8102881	8109066	It was literally just cleaning up the day that I got on a bus and it's kind of been miserable since we got here including the actual bus trip out here.
8109474	8116077	Other than that, F you to the screams and God only knows what other sounds at all hours of the night in downtown San Francisco.
8116938	8120120	Probably never going to get used to that, but you know, that's pretty much it.
8121140	8125783	Alright, I will indulge the email from earlier and I will start off tonight with a thank you.
8126143	8133006	I would like to say thank you to the Tortilla Lady at Denio's Farmers Market because the pumpkin tortillas are amazing.
8133647	8135388	So thank you Tortilla Lady.
8136588	8139812	F you to the pistachio, dude, because your pistachios kind of taste like vinegar.
8140032	8140573	I'm just saying.
8142475	8143496	Serious stuff, guys.
8143536	8144037	Serious stuff.
8144077	8144317	All right.
8145138	8145979	More gaming news.
8146320	8148642	Your calls are just a little bit away.
8148662	8149864	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8149884	8150264	But not yet.
8150304	8150965	We still have some news.
8151005	8151506	Some big news.
8151586	8151786	Loki.
8154413	8160476	Let's talk a little bit about... This kind of ties in a little bit with the whole Kickstarter thing, but we'll get to that.
8160996	8166539	Obsidian, man, they cannot catch a break this week, or even like it looks like the past year.
8166679	8168700	But let's start off with Obsidian.
8168740	8170220	They've been hit with some layoffs.
8170440	8175963	And of course, Obsidian's working on the South Park RPG that's going to be coming out later this year.
8176283	8178884	They also worked on Fallout New Vegas.
8179504	8192134	So, um, and apparently they have had to let go and they've, um, lost approximately 20 to 30 people and, um, they also have another project canceled.
8192495	8197419	This time is supposed to be for a future next gen system, uh, which I believe is a new Xbox system.
8198380	8203946	and also I guess there are some people that let go.
8204106	8209512	One that started the day before and one that started the week before.
8212536	8213897	So yeah, that kind of sucks.
8216160	8228941	Also, they've had an Xbox Live Arcade title that they were working on, a new original IP that has been put on hold as well, and that kind of sucks.
8230918	8242246	The other thing too, which I didn't see, well I think we'll get to it a little bit later, but they may be going to Kickstarter actually.
8242306	8242926	It's kind of cool.
8243327	8249671	There was this opinion piece that was written on Kotaku and it was kind of interesting talking about...
8250311	8251091	Thanks for watching!
8268579	8270119	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
8286884	8288046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8301921	8304002	This is kind of interesting.
8306142	8308563	So I wonder if we will see a lot of people turning to Kickstarter.
8309043	8321007	Especially some of these companies that are like... Can you imagine if Grin, for example, started some Kickstarters for different projects that they were working on that would have been...
8322027	8324809	Oh, that new Strider game we talked about a couple weeks ago.
8324829	8330293	Not necessarily Strider, but they could go to Kickstarter to get some of the stuff.
8330853	8336217	Well, I don't know if they'd be able to pull out a Strider, but make some really awesome games.
8337438	8339479	Maybe they would have been able to do some of that stuff.
8340180	8341941	It kind of sucks that they're working on a lot of good stuff.
8342461	8342621	But...
8344002	8352391	So yeah, that's one good thing I guess that Kickstarter can provide is an avenue for some of these game genres that publishers think are dead.
8353733	8355655	I love SSJ100Matt's idea in the chat room.
8355675	8358798	We should do a list list of what Kickstarter game funds we would give money to.
8359198	8361060	We will do that in a future episode.
8363138	8365600	So, kind of two different directions there.
8365960	8367081	Obsidian, I want to start there.
8367901	8369762	Good news or bad news for the South Park game?
8370543	8372664	I was looking forward to it, and now I'm kind of like, uh-oh.
8372944	8376307	I mean, hopefully it's far along in development where these won't matter.
8376367	8379428	I would think that they have a bigger team than 20 or 30 people working on it.
8379609	8381210	It's not just programmers or developers.
8382490	8384812	It's not just programmers, but it's just kind of across the board.
8384832	8386213	They're just making cuts at the company.
8387013	8396880	Um, and I think we may touch on why they might be making cuts on that stuff in a little bit, but, uh, it's just, you know, they have to trim the fat, I guess.
8397921	8406767	Um, Kickstarter, um, again, kind of like we were saying earlier, there's just, there's a lot I worry about with Kickstarter where it's just going to be too much.
8406847	8413051	It's going to get saturated and, you know, I don't think everybody needs to get on board with it, but I like the comparison you give with Grin.
8413071	8413151	Yeah.
8413431	8429322	See, now, Kickstarter, I'm not sure exactly how it works, if a project has to be fully funded or not, because that one, the guy I was referring to as the Jabba the Hutt, Reapus guy, he quoted saying that they have to make 10 grand to get money.
8429983	8432505	They have to basically, 10 grand is the bottom limit.
8432845	8438569	I've seen some Kickstarters for $500, though, so I don't think Kickstarter sets that.
8438609	8439910	I think they're setting it for their project.
8439930	8441351	Maybe it's a percentage or something, I don't know.
8441491	8441771	Maybe.
8441811	8442291	Yeah, it could be.
8442371	8444312	It could be a certain percentage, depending on how much you get.
8445653	8445893	All right.
8445933	8448554	Well, there's some more stories that somewhat tie into this.
8449394	8452555	And one of them is this interesting piece that's out there.
8453075	8457257	And this is a particular piece that was on YouTube.
8457857	8465160	And then Kotaku wrote up an article on it that basically kind of went to talking about these points about video game reviews.
8466041	8468483	Video Game Publishers See Game Reviewers As Marketing Tools
8485000	8486301	Yes, that's absolutely true.
8486321	8489043	Well, they see game reviews as marketing tools for sure.
8489143	8492466	Publishers sometimes allow positive reviews to be published before negative ones.
8492586	8493066	Absolutely.
8493386	8499651	Publishers sometimes require game reviewers to not mention certain plot or technical details in exchange for being furnished with an advanced review copy.
8499671	8500572	That is fact, yes.
8500792	8503634	Publishers might not want to advertise on an outlet that slams their game.
8504435	8505416	Well, yeah, that makes sense.
8505916	8510640	Critics are often at a loss for insightful ways of describing what they found objectionable about a game they don't like.
8513362	8515144	I can see that sometimes, yeah.
8515224	8517747	Yeah, I can too, based on the way some people react to it.
8518168	8520310	Reviews are banal checklists.
8522112	8522532	Some are.
8523894	8527277	Especially ones not written by professional gamers.
8528621	8555522	I think a lot of the ones that you see and I'm not slamming every but a lot like in the community newspapers and stuff are the press release rewarded some that I've seen game reviewers may not know that they're biased but if they knew they were biased would they tell us I'm sure that they would they have to seem unbiased I think some know they are biased personally all these positive reviews from biased reviewers lead the public into accidentally playing bad games
8558209	8559210	Thanks for watching!
8577390	8582874	And because someone, once again, it's someone's opinion, just because they like it doesn't mean you're necessarily going to like it.
8582914	8585976	You remember the Gamefly commercials and the Epic Rage?
8586157	8587618	Oh yeah, it's stupid.
8587878	8589519	That's the point they're pushing in those commercials.
8589619	8590520	Here's the last one.
8590580	8594743	Legislators are happy when this mess results in pro-American games topping the charts.
8596925	8598085	I think that's a little much.
8598386	8599566	That seems a little much.
8599586	8601108	That's the stretch bullet right there.
8601608	8602809	We need to pad this up to one more.
8602969	8603609	Okay, here goes.
8603670	8603810	Now,
8609186	8633592	I think that whole embargo thing is starting to get overboard and I would really only trust a site that refuses to sign them even if they get the reviews late like that's one thing I'm happy even though I don't have the time to play every game I don't do this for a living or whatever I can give you my honest opinion on games because we don't sign those and we don't get these games for free I mean very very rarely have we gotten them for free and
8634032	8638574	and you know we've spent our own money on them so you know we can kind of tell you from that perspective.
8638594	8641154	I've gotten like two games from publishers.
8641194	8656939	Not that I'm saying OLR is the authority or that we're somehow better than all of the rest of this but I'm just saying I like that you know because there's plenty of other podcasters out there that are in the same boat and that's why I kind of like hearing the opinion of quote unquote real people when it comes to games.
8658920	8686938	let's also kind of take a step further there was another story this week that talked about how reviews can really be kind of screwing up the industry and that is this whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores not user Metacritic scores Metacritic scores from established critics and Obsidian was going to be I mean I'm sure a lot of you heard about this story but for Fallout New Vegas Obsidian you know it wasn't Bethesda it was Obsidian that kind of did the port of it or whatever did the you know newer New Vegas part of it
8687738	8697987	they would have been given a bonus if an 85 plus score was on Metacritic so if the game got an 85 plus on Metacritic they would have got a big bonus you know what it got?
8698367	8701390	an 84 on Metacritic and so no bonus
8704159	8711303	Just the whole thing of paying or giving incentives for good reviews just totally makes me think of the government.
8711383	8720768	And also here's the other thing too is Metacritic, how exactly, first off, how exactly do they, who is an authorized person?
8720808	8723650	Who is an actual site reviewer or whatever like that?
8723930	8727352	If we put a review on our site, is it going to show up on Metacritic?
8727632	8755895	I believe it's similar to Rotten Tomatoes where you have to have so many reviews under your belt and you have to have some type of you're either a member of an association or you have some type of degree or something I don't know I haven't looked at the rules but I did look them up for Rotten Tomatoes once and it was something like that at the time which was several years ago so that leads into discussions about why are game developer bonuses based on review scores
8756952	8758152	I thought it was about the sales.
8758513	8758953	Exactly.
8759113	8762854	It should be about the sales because a game can totally get great reviews.
8763554	8767955	Mad World, for example, or... I'm trying to think.
8767995	8770876	There's a lot of niche games on... Pretty much.
8771176	8774577	Let's look at these RPGs that are coming out on the Wii.
8774597	8777638	They're getting great reviews, but they're not going to sell well.
8778279	8780879	It's just because it's a niche audience that it's reaching.
8781339	8781820	And so...
8783401	8785831	Why are they basing it on reviews?
8786172	8789044	So a game gets good reviews, it doesn't mean people are going to buy it.
8791822	8814928	and lastly some news came out this week that we already kind of knew and that was this whole it was a result of the fact I don't know if you guys heard but Giant Bomb got bought by CBS Interactive which owns GameSpot the ironic thing about that is that one of the big personalities that kind of started Giant Bomb Jeff Gerstmann well he made Giant Bomb because he had to leave GameSpot they basically sat him in a room and fired him why did they fire him
8815328	8842758	at the time a lot of people were saying it's because he gave Kane and Lynch a bad review and you know they were big sponsors of the site at the time and sure enough it came out that it wasn't specifically the Kane and Lynch review because another thing was referenced about the Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction review from Sony but basically GameSpot's editorial management basically sat him down and said that he couldn't be trusted as an editorial director
8844147	8856793	Couldn't be trusted with the people that are paying for ads on their site That's absolutely ridiculous and completely unfair Now, who is to blame at the end of the day for this whole cycle?
8856953	8857754	Who is to blame?
8858634	8860395	Corporations You
8862316	8875281	you are to blame if you've ever filled out a comment or a survey thing that said why did you buy this game review from what website if you did that you are partially to blame
8877721	8878642	I don't think I've ever done that.
8878922	8879663	I'm just saying.
8880384	8885207	I know what I'm saying it in a way that's going to catch people off guard a little bit, but I want you to really think about that.
8885568	8890412	I mean, why else do the companies feel like they can get away with this?
8891212	8896757	I think we as the users have to kind of rise up and demand more transparency.
8897097	8905824	I think we need to support sites that will not support embargoes and this stuff and not let the publishers do the talking.
8906084	8908985	It's practically the same thing as lobbying, you know.
8909525	8910246	Oh, yeah.
8910486	8916768	Or politicians who take sponsorships from major corporations.
8916928	8918769	It's the same thing.
8918949	8921970	They're basically getting paid, so of course they're going to put in a good word.
8922511	8930134	Or in the case of the politics analogy, they're going to lean their vote towards the interest of the people they're lining their pockets with.
8932609	8935835	Support independent radio websites.
8937578	8938199	I really mean it.
8939221	8941064	Because this kind of stuff is only going to continue.
8941485	8942527	And don't vote partisan.
8945831	8946151	All right.
8947332	8947992	Moving on.
8948352	8949013	Did I have anything else?
8949133	8952134	I think I got all the little pieces of that story because there was quite a bit there.
8952434	8952634	Yeah.
8953935	8954755	How about something happy?
8954835	8955756	How about something happy?
8956296	8956596	Okay.
8956716	8959958	Well, I'm sure I've made it no secret that I am a huge fan of Cracked.
8960678	8961599	I love Cracked.com.
8962379	8967400	and they actually posted an article that really made me stop and look at it that I wanted to share with everybody.
8968061	8970401	And, you know, so full credit to Cracked for this.
8970581	8972962	I'm, you know, not trying to step on toes.
8972982	8977303	So this goes to Mike Cooney, Eddie Rodriguez and Steve Hanley who wrote the article.
8978063	8978423	Shout out.
8979024	8980024	I'm just saying because it was really good.
8980384	8983385	It's six acts of real life heroism made possible by video games.
8983965	8984406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8999688	9010121	There was an autistic, it says, a Canadian teenager made the news after helping an autistic youth online who was showing serious signs of depression to the point of hitting it's suicide.
9010842	9018532	So, he didn't know where he lived, only had his gamertag, but he contacted the police and contacted the kid over Xbox Live and they talked him down.
9019301	9019521	Wow.
9020061	9022322	Just showing concern for another human being.
9023122	9026702	And... I don't... That's a good thing out of Xbox Live?
9026722	9027662	That's astounding.
9027822	9029123	Well, there's more on that, too.
9029643	9031083	His parents didn't even know.
9031863	9032103	Wow.
9032163	9034904	Someone who lived 1,500 miles away noticed.
9035784	9047686	So it's another sign, too, that you basically... I don't think in a lot of cases, you know, once your kid's out and going to school, I don't think parents really know their kids as well as they think they might, not in the ways that I think...
9049386	9050467	They can really relate to.
9050867	9053148	Not as much as somebody within their own peer group.
9053428	9053848	You know what I mean?
9054848	9057349	And I think that someone needs to be careful and look at all the signs.
9057810	9059010	You put yourself in their shoes.
9060090	9063011	And then this one I thought was really neat.
9063031	9063972	This is that Ebony game.
9065092	9066233	I know I kind of scoff at the game.
9066313	9069354	There's a guy with muscular dystrophy.
9070274	9077638	who his house caught on fire while he was playing a game and he couldn't get out safely because he had muscular dystrophy.
9077738	9078779	He was wheelchair bound.
9079739	9086603	And his friends in the game called the police department and the fire department and helped him get out of his house.
9087024	9087224	Wow.
9088024	9089065	So there's that.
9089585	9093326	This one, this is the number five on the list that I thought was pretty cool.
9094327	9098668	A guy who had been playing Medal of Modern Warfare.
9098809	9099649	Oh, never mind.
9099949	9101109	Medal of Modern Warfare?
9101129	9105291	It was the little name that they came up with, but he had actually been playing America's Army.
9105931	9106632	Oh, yeah, yeah.
9106912	9111794	I watched the medic training on that one, and it's pretty... Well, it's an army recruitment game.
9111814	9112174	That's what it is.
9112234	9113134	At the end of the day, yeah.
9113755	9116456	I mean, but he... What happened is that...
9118176	9126040	He had encountered a car crash where someone in an SUV flipped upside down and the car was spewing smoke.
9127080	9132823	And he actually used the medic training from the game to help the guy.
9132843	9138085	Basically, the person in the accident lost like two fingers and was gushing blood from his head.
9139306	9143788	And he bandaged the hand, raised it above his head to stop the bleeding and bandaged the guy's head.
9144488	9146449	And contacted EMT.
9148636	9153981	All from knowing, and he credited it to the medical training in America's Army.
9154341	9154601	Wow.
9155162	9157644	So, and then this one was actually pretty cool.
9157664	9159246	And this is a World of Warcraft one, so this one.
9159366	9160467	And he was immediately drafted.
9160847	9161247	I'm just kidding.
9161828	9165331	This one, this one hits a little close, because you'll know what I'm talking about.
9165371	9165852	A little glimped?
9166112	9166332	Okay.
9167373	9171777	A 12-year-old Norwegian boy was walking with his sister and got attacked by a moose.
9173889	9176694	Ghostcrawler promised me a moose
9192273	9193754	and he credited it to World of Warcraft.
9194574	9196435	To taunt and feign death.
9196695	9199777	He said if you've got... Well, now, hunters can't taunt.
9200157	9200797	Let me finish.
9200817	9202778	This damn kid doesn't know what he's talking about.
9202979	9203639	Let me finish.
9204579	9206460	But he said basically is that...
9208141	9229536	his brain translated it as aggro and it was an aggressive animal so he grabbed its attention because an aggressive animal is going to go to the thing making the biggest noise the biggest threat and then he said he played dead he feigned death and the moose sniffed at him nudged him and walked off left him and his sister alone
9232264	9232744	Pretty neat.
9234205	9244709	And the other ones on here, now those are like the big three for me on these because the other ones are about how they're helping stroke victims recover by improving hand-eye coordination.
9245749	9250491	There's another one here about a web browser game that people have used to discover two planets.
9252411	9253951	Let me see if I can't get the name of this called.
9254952	9259692	It's Planet Hunters, which basically teaches them to use monitor light emissions.
9260973	9265333	And it'll do a certain thing when a planet crosses through a particular star's path.
9265953	9268374	And players have discovered two planets that way.
9270174	9273995	There's another one on here about helping stroke victims recover.
9274335	9277135	One of them got really excited, but it turned out it was just Pluto.
9279756	9280176	And then...
9282452	9285114	Thank you, I'll be here all week.
9286074	9301504	They used the skills of a 14-year-old boy who invented a procedure, this is for a science fair project, of using a controller to do internal stitches where you'd have to use a robot for it.
9302405	9307048	And now you kind of have that with Kinect, if the Windows commercials are to be believed.
9307671	9312717	But it was, it said using a surgical device called an endostitch.
9313899	9317503	And it's used to sew up patients after a hysterectomy.
9318604	9322729	But he was using that same procedure, only with a video game controller.
9323130	9323250	Hmm.
9324211	9324932	for medical purposes.
9325172	9327674	But I want to go back to the first three that I listed.
9328134	9334318	Those are, instead of just applying what you know from video games, those are saving people's lives.
9334559	9344586	I mean, when you have a bear come in your thing, you're told to play dead, but he specifically said that he needed to taunt the aggro away.
9344746	9345446	From his sister, yeah.
9345466	9345607	Yeah.
9349449	9363255	I had a case when I was playing PSO where I actually got really sick and was given some advice from just a random person in there who happened to be an EMT.
9364455	9364615	Mm-hmm.
9389876	9405121	and I watched the video it's actually I've had emergency training before and it's more in depth than what I did in my first aid classes so I'm just pretty amazed that I mean what do you think of I wanted to bring this up because
9405521	9407982	People say, oh, video games make you violent.
9408062	9410263	Well, obviously, I know that that's not true.
9410343	9412284	And, you know, I've heard of some of these good things before.
9412364	9414745	There's sometimes a dark side to these MMOs.
9415225	9418826	You know, we heard about the kid kidnapped across state lines and all that.
9418966	9425369	It's nice to hear some of the good stuff, too, about how technology, I think it's more technology is saving lives.
9425589	9428270	And, you know, gaming is that technology, some of it.
9428990	9430491	So, I don't know.
9430671	9432711	How can you argue with the good news here?
9432791	9434052	I mean, it's good stuff.
9434939	9447397	I just really wish that more mainstream news sources would really focus more on advertising stuff like this instead of just finding sensationalist stories that give everybody a bad name.
9448146	9449967	Speaking of supporting independent media.
9450748	9453250	Exactly.
9454090	9455571	Wow, stutter-tastic.
9455851	9465798	This kind of thing, it's exactly the kind of thing you want to hear because it's people that are applying any kind of knowledge that's at least rooted in some kind of truth.
9467960	9469661	Yeah, they have a weird association.
9469821	9471202	I learned about it from a video game.
9471522	9472223	Big deal.
9472823	9474445	As long as you've learned.
9474565	9478348	They did something fantastic with a little bit of knowledge bestowed upon them.
9478448	9480470	You know, I actually did learn how to drive through Ridge Racer.
9483852	9499045	It's funny that you say that because when I was starting to get towards the age of learning driving, about to go to driving school, my grandpa, one of my grandpas, would give me a hard time because I would talk about driving video games.
9499105	9499526	And it's like,
9501146	9508769	I think I probably went a little bit above and beyond in a sense that I don't want to... I think I may have one time said, I don't want to drive.
9509729	9512370	Video games can't kill you, so I would rather do that instead.
9512971	9517312	But at the same time, I went in there and I wasn't scared of driving.
9519053	9519933	It wasn't new to me.
9519993	9522294	I've been in my parents' car plenty of times.
9523534	9524995	Yeah, you pick up things like this.
9525535	9525715	Great.
9525735	9525955	Great.
9550815	9557299	You can ask Ranma about that when I managed to make that turn off off the Bay Bridge to going to Treasure Island in my Lancer and drifted.
9558540	9559621	Alright, let's move on.
9559921	9561762	I'm trying to get to calls so we have some time for calls.
9562202	9562783	Loki, quickly.
9563453	9564853	Alright, I will be super quick.
9565914	9570215	So, let's talk a little bit about Peter Molino.
9570235	9574956	Well, not Peter Molino per se, but Peter Molido.
9575556	9582738	It's the parody account that's on Twitter that comes up with all these weird game ideas.
9582978	9587359	Like, for example, you can troll a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during winter.
9587759	9591800	You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses.
9591960	9593561	So similar to the OLR Dream Games.
9593881	9594801	Yeah, something like that.
9594862	9596983	Just really weird stuff.
9597103	9597803	Here's the funny thing.
9599124	9609369	Someone has convinced him that he should do a Game Jam where independent developers out there will create games based on these crazy ideas.
9610029	9611090	And that's what's going to happen.
9611210	9615452	Actually, Molly Jam 2012 is set to run, I guess, March 31st through April 1st.
9621535	9626658	and actually a few cities, San Francisco and Brighton.
9627299	9638446	Also, that has expanded to now a few more cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Melbourne and New York.
9640227	9651231	And, of course, what's even more interesting about that is Peter Molyneux is actually going to join in on this as well, now that he's got some free time.
9652312	9654113	Good for him having a sense of humor about the whole thing.
9654373	9656254	And, actually, it's kind of funny.
9656694	9663257	Some of the ideas, like, for example, there was a post by the Peter Molyneux that said,
9664217	9670722	My first mobile game will be free, but if you pay a little, then the NPCs will be extra nice and compliment you more while playing.
9671083	9674065	Peter Molina responds, that's not a bad idea, actually.
9674545	9677267	And so, you know, just like, you know, funny things like that.
9677528	9680290	And this one's another funny one.
9680730	9684293	Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment.
9684333	9688536	Your baby would act as a torch, rocking the baby intensifies the glow, etc.
9688816	9689357	You know, just like.
9690037	9693999	That just makes me think of the crying scene from Max Payne.
9695959	9707144	But the whole thing is, you know, he has these really weird ideas, but there's actually some funny ones that he came up with, like the bullying, the RPG or whatever that had bullying as, you know, the combat system or something like that.
9707624	9710845	And so they're going to make some of these things, including that rabbit one.
9710885	9712106	They actually have a video of that.
9712786	9717468	And, yeah, there's actually some people that are, you know, interested in doing that.
9722793	9725015	I'm trying to see if there's any other really big guys.
9725635	9733864	The people behind it right now, the organizers, Anna Kipnis, Brandon Sheffield, Patrick Klepek, which I think he was from Joystick.
9734865	9761367	Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Joe Kowalski, and Edward Paris so it's interesting and of course if you're interested in this you can check out well you can follow or check out Vox Games or you can follow I think they've got a website for this already let's see here
9761747	9765010	I know some people that are participating in this, so it's going to be fun.
9765671	9767292	Yeah.
9767953	9781204	Well, first off, you can check the fake Twitter account for... It's PeterMollyDeux, P-E-T-E-R-M-O-L-Y-D-E-U-X.
9782285	9786589	And they have a Google Docs page, but you can just look it up.
9786909	9787029	It's...
9789326	9790867	Game Jams Fun Time.
9791967	9792608	Fun times.
9793808	9796149	So, yeah, check it out.
9796590	9800852	And then, of course, you know, I think they're going to be adding like an actual web page and stuff for this at some point.
9802272	9802752	All right.
9802812	9804933	I got one more story for you guys.
9805054	9811637	And I'm going to make this real quick because this is something that has been going around for forever and just will not go away.
9811697	9814418	And that is that there is no new Xbox this year at E3.
9814518	9818380	I could have sworn this was already reported on, but it made the rounds on the gaming blogs again this week.
9819340	9842476	Some folks that are close to, I guess, Bloomberg are insisting that Microsoft's going to introduce a new console in 2013 It'll be at E3 next year But Bloomberg Magazine was told by David Dennis, who's a group manager of PR at Xbox 2012 is all about the Xbox 360, so stop the rumors There will be no slick new Xbox Lube until 2013 There you go
9844998	9845498	That's the final word.
9845518	9845899	Well, it makes sense.
9845919	9847239	They've got stuff to show off this year.
9847399	9848960	Next year will be when they unveil it.
9849120	9849361	All right.
9849461	9850481	We are going to open the phones.
9850561	9851242	So call now.
9851262	9855104	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9855124	9859306	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9859666	9860407	Damn, that's fast.
9860447	9861367	It's already lighting up.
9861467	9862088	We got a call.
9862708	9863649	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9863669	9864009	Who's this?
9864589	9865290	This is Shane.
9865410	9866170	Hey, you're fast.
9866190	9867811	You know when we're going to open it up.
9867851	9868171	What's up?
9868271	9868531	I know.
9868611	9871013	It's like I was given advanced warning or something.
9871033	9871633	Something like that.
9871753	9872374	What's on your mind tonight?
9872394	9873134	What do you want to talk about?
9873979	9876622	What do I normally talk about?
9877123	9892923	Mass Effect Yes, that is my second best favorite thing in the world so let's talk about that Okay, since you're pissed off that I didn't give you credit for getting me into Mass Effect which was basically that you were pouting and whining and crying and threatening not to be my friend anymore unless I would play Mass Effect
9893499	9894460	which that's a lie.
9894520	9898742	I think I just bombarded you with me talking about it.
9898962	9900703	I don't think there was pouting or crying.
9901203	9901984	There was a little bit.
9902204	9904265	You need to convince Jamie that she should play it too.
9904565	9906986	Jamie, it'll change your life.
9907267	9910048	Buy me a copy.
9910088	9910808	Me too, please.
9913770	9914210	I'm broke.
9914631	9916852	We're pressed for time tonight, so what do you want to say about Mass Effect?
9917475	9935855	well as I sit here just exiting out of Mass Effect 1 that I was just playing and in my N7 t-shirt I would probably like to say that I am on the side of the retake Mass Effect 3 movement which is give us a different ending
9936055	9936995	No, why?
9937196	9939377	You didn't go to the government, did you?
9939817	9941177	No, I'm not stupid.
9941197	9942778	I joined a Facebook group.
9942838	9946320	Well, that's activism of the 21st century.
9946620	9948421	All right, so at least you're not totally crazy.
9948461	9949501	You're in the singing crowd.
9949821	9953143	All right, so without spoiling, why is the ending pissing everybody off?
9953923	9966734	It's pretty much for the reason... Well, the good reason that it's making everybody angry is that, like you said earlier, everything you've done up until the last 10 minutes of the game does not matter based on these endings.
9968335	9970417	I don't care if it's not a happy ending.
9970938	9980406	I didn't really expect it to be happy endings, but I expect an actual ending that makes sense, not some Matrix crap or something stupid like that.
9983029	10006234	and I'm also part of the group of people that believe one of the endings that you get if you do really well with all the extra stuff in the game you get like an extra 10 seconds and that leads to this entirely different theory about all the endings and that this one that you may consider bad is actually leading up to a real ending that they have not given us yet.
10006474	10009216	And I will pay for DLC if they do it.
10009377	10012139	So what is the point of joining the Facebook group?
10012219	10012960	What do you want?
10013180	10014281	What do you want out of all this?
10014581	10017183	I want a DLC ending.
10017844	10023829	Like, I could see if somebody's not invested in the series, the ending's probably fine for them.
10024570	10030875	But seeing as how I really like everything about the story and my Shepard's journey...
10032636	10053603	they didn't end it like they kind of promised they would and I'm not going to be like I'll never buy one of your games again but I will be like I'll pay for DLC for you guys to make it right do you think that you should have to do that though do you feel like maybe you're being exploited a little bit for your money because you're so into this
10054764	10055965	No, I don't think so.
10056265	10058327	I think they just had a screw up.
10058587	10058967	That's it.
10059888	10061409	I'm reading what a sick vampire says.
10061469	10066253	I'm just ignoring it because that part doesn't matter in 1 and 2.
10066613	10075400	When you end a trilogy and they promise that everything you've done up until the point is going to shape your game and it doesn't, that's where it's stupid.
10077261	10081542	But complaining to the government over it's pretty stupid too, you gotta admit.
10081682	10084683	No, I definitely agree with that.
10084743	10087784	Now, you sure there's never going to be another Mass Effect game?
10088504	10097726	They said, again, who knows what BioWare is really thinking sometimes, but they said if they ever did another game, it would not take place after 3.
10097966	10099906	It would have to take place before or during 3.
10099946	10100006	And...
10102307	10102687	I don't know.
10102988	10110134	For a game like this, I don't understand why I'd want to play something that takes place before the Mass Effect 1 through 3.
10110854	10116479	And I definitely don't want to play something that takes place during 3 unless it's just extra DLC for 3.
10117460	10125847	So yeah, I can't see them doing a 4 that takes place after 3, especially with what the endings do right now, currently.
10125867	10126027	Right.
10126187	10127868	Alright, well, I gotta wrap up to get more calls.
10127888	10129208	Are there any other thoughts you want to get in there?
10130249	10132770	Um, I had one and then I forgot it.
10133770	10135011	Yeah, I forgot it.
10135411	10135871	Dang it.
10136031	10138012	Write it down for next week.
10139333	10139933	Alright, whatever.
10140862	10142824	By the way, Alan beat Mass Effect 1 if you didn't hear it.
10142844	10146187	I know, I talked to him on Life Journal about it.
10146367	10148729	I better let you go so we can get more calls.
10149769	10151251	Bye.
10151271	10153833	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
10153853	10155074	You're laughing over there, Jason.
10156835	10159417	Just what's happening.
10159477	10161038	Just the conversation around you.
10161078	10161639	We got another call.
10161679	10162600	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10162620	10162940	Who's this?
10163666	10164066	What's up, guys?
10164086	10165327	It's Xenocore from the OKC.
10165367	10165787	How you doing?
10165887	10167128	Hey, I'm good, Xenocore.
10167188	10169149	I had no idea about that 80s music, by the way.
10169209	10170830	Thank you for setting me straight on that.
10171370	10172011	Yeah, I know.
10172091	10174772	Once I see something, I just don't forget it, and it's stuck in my head.
10175033	10175753	Damn videos.
10176333	10176774	It's all good.
10176834	10177154	What's up?
10177214	10179795	What do we owe the phone call to tonight?
10180476	10188120	I only caught the second part of the previous caller, but as far as the ending in Mass Effect, it's just piss poor.
10188240	10189241	I mean, literally.
10189881	10192743	Bioware's written much better content than that.
10193809	10195111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10212455	10213316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10241061	10244463	Why would you pay for a product that's been trashed already?
10244864	10248526	If you give me another $10, I'll actually finish it and put it together for you.
10249047	10249287	No.
10249707	10252769	If it said some assembly required, that's the way you're selling it.
10252809	10254290	Because it worked for Bethesda.
10255611	10256192	True.
10256472	10258754	I'm not saying they're not going to make money if they do that either.
10258794	10263877	That product was so good in 1 and 2, it's almost guaranteed to make money what they'll see.
10264097	10264678	It's guaranteed.
10266091	10267392	People are already asking for it.
10267432	10268272	Give me DLC.
10268312	10269793	Just finish the story the way we want.
10270033	10270994	So they probably will.
10271014	10272895	They'll charge $10 and they'll get their money.
10273835	10274236	Interesting.
10274496	10276517	Shane is sending me a private message with this comment.
10276577	10278098	Maybe you want to respond to this.
10278138	10278478	I don't know.
10278898	10284061	He says the other thing he forgot was it's about the precedent it sets demanding DLC endings.
10284641	10288443	Also, how even though it had a terrible ending, it didn't ruin the journey or the game.
10288944	10291105	Did the ending ruin Mass Effect for you?
10293253	10297157	I was watching a roomie play it, and it guaranteed I'm not buying it in Mass Effect 3.
10298102	10298382	I see.
10298442	10300363	Okay, so you just kind of saw it through somebody else.
10300383	10300844	But that's okay.
10300884	10310289	I mean, certainly you can get... Well, I mean, I saw enough of stuff on the internet without seeing all the trailers to know that if I got to that ending... Because the game isn't that difficult.
10310769	10318233	It's not like the ending of Rygar to where getting to the ending is the feat itself because the game's so damn hard, few people actually see it.
10318453	10321995	Well, to use the Sopranos comparison again, I didn't watch the whole series.
10322055	10324637	I saw an episode or two, but even I know the ending of that sucked.
10326010	10326571	True, true.
10327451	10328753	I respect the way they did it.
10329714	10335379	And even if it's not so much the endings they provided, it's just the way they came to those endings.
10335900	10339083	The user has no, half the work you do is erased.
10339827	10342648	God, I never play video games to completion, ever, ever.
10342768	10351512	So if I beat Mass Effect 3, that's a big if, but if I beat Mass Effect 3, that in itself is going to be like a noteworthy thing for the journal, you know?
10351572	10353373	Like, I beat a video game.
10354574	10358215	Because my ADD usually kicks in 20 hours before this point.
10360356	10363397	Some point I will finish Final Fantasy XIII too, I swear.
10364818	10365218	Squirrel!
10365618	10366619	Seven in my case.
10367778	10369759	Don't finish seven, because speaking of shit endings.
10374442	10377164	SSJ100Matt says, BioWare trolled you all.
10378100	10379821	Did BioWare troll us, Xenocore?
10380181	10381702	Exactly, exactly.
10382603	10385045	I'm convinced something must have happened corporate-wise.
10385085	10387006	Maybe they ran out of time and they rushed the ending.
10387927	10391629	Something smells fishy as far as the development to why the game is the way it is.
10391729	10395712	If the DLC conspiracies is true, then EA trolled us all.
10396152	10397693	Mm-hmm.
10397713	10399274	That's not too far-fetched either.
10399955	10400235	All right.
10400475	10401996	Well, Xenocore, anything else before we let you go?
10402997	10403457	No, that's it.
10403657	10404278	Yeah, I'll take it easy.
10404298	10404838	All right, you too.
10404878	10405478	Have a good one, buddy.
10405498	10406379	All right, bye.
10407750	10411957	877-GAME-OLR username on Skype chat username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio
10415177	10416238	You're having a fun night, Rob.
10416258	10419860	I'm having like the burpiest night in the history of OLR.
10420460	10421161	What did I eat?
10421901	10425984	I had Mongolian barbecue because I took to a new place.
10426004	10429066	There is a new place downtown called Mongo Mongo.
10430226	10430847	I need to go there.
10431107	10431567	Yes, you do.
10431847	10432168	It was good.
10432468	10432788	All right.
10433528	10434209	One more call.
10434769	10435330	I got to be fast.
10435350	10436931	Hey, Sky.
10436951	10437471	How's it going?
10437511	10439052	Hey, Zaku.
10439092	10439832	You got through.
10439912	10440573	What's up, buddy?
10441252	10442453	Yeah, it's been a long time.
10442473	10445394	I don't know if I've actually called this year so far.
10445454	10447275	I may have done it in January, but yeah.
10447755	10466145	I'm just touching back on what you mentioned already with Tim Shaver and Kickstarter and just all these developers that are basically these video game shops that apparently, because of the way the business works...
10467936	10472092	Sourcing out to Kickstarter might open new avenues, but at the same time,
10473354	10484401	It breaks the mold of the way that whole video game industry has switched in the past 15 or so years.
10485002	10490526	Back in the days of NES and Super Nintendo, it wasn't really about pumping out sequels that quickly.
10490546	10495429	It was about creating games that would be memorable and that would just be pushing the envelope.
10495989	10501053	Nowadays, you have companies like Activision and to an extent EA just thinking with a short sight.
10503394	10506196	in other words taking a franchise and just milking it out
10522908	10523909	Talk about a quick turnaround.
10523929	10529096	Those are exceptions, but you also have to take in the ones that I've grown up in my childhood.
10529856	10536164	Stuff like Super Mario World, the Sonic series, even the first early titles of the PlayStation.
10536244	10542351	Those were groundbreaking in the sense that they pushed the game styles into a different direction.
10543132	10549258	Then nowadays you have companies like Activision, for example, that only live by the quarter.
10549298	10555143	They milk Call of Duty and they see it as something where they can make money in the short term.
10555323	10556404	Milking is destroyed.
10556444	10564191	This is where the bean counter perspective comes into the industry, which so far has been a fixture of it for quite a while now.
10565132	10567975	In other words, instead of actual video game developers...
10569736	10595675	brainstorming ideas you have like you have the suits for example that just do you know they have research and they have numbers in which they can create you know facts out of anything as a means of creating ideas in which they can you know they can milk milking franchises though like Guitar Hero was destroyed by the milking you know like so it hasn't always been successful the whole rhythm music game genre is pretty much on its last throes because of that
10596155	10602662	It wasn't until Guitar Hero that after it went mainstream it basically fizzled out.
10603123	10610070	Everything before that time, during when Konami still had a handle on that genre, it was
10611069	10615595	It was still pretty underground, but it wasn't going away anytime soon.
10616135	10619740	They were still sending out new titles and so forth.
10620461	10623645	But as I said, once you bring something mainstream, that's one of the...
10627089	10628470	and some vulnerabilities right there.
10629331	10634854	I have to wrap up because we're supposed to be done at 9.15 tonight but quickly, any final thoughts on this?
10636395	10650563	I'm pretty certain that the video game publishers have a cabal with the reviewers to the point where at some point the feds have to get involved thinking that you may have a case where these publishers are paying their way.
10651003	10654665	Not through official channels but under the table in terms of paying for
10655746	10661647	for reviews or any of that type that might be... I want them all drugged through the courts!
10662127	10664328	I want mud flung on them!
10664348	10677310	Sony got busted for astroturfing for the PSP a few years ago for actually posting it through a supposedly real actual user or an actual blog post that turned out to be fake.
10677350	10682651	It was mostly marketing posts without disclosing whether or not they had a...
10684059	10687783	That they were actually, you know, part Sony.
10702536	10709039	I did not mean to ignore the Twitters tonight.
10709499	10712600	Let me just quickly get through some of these at twitter.com slash OLR.
10713020	10718442	Ramaditya Knight sent us some NES soundtracks to check out, and so I'm going to check those out.
10718682	10723244	Dragon Fighter, Shatterhand, Final Mission, some pretty good picks in there.
10724525	10730448	Eric RPG sent us a link to a Kickstarter, but this is for a JRPG that looks like it could be interesting.
10730508	10734691	It's called Americana Dawn and definitely looks like kind of the old retro.
10734711	10739174	I don't want to say like Super Nintendo, but maybe a little more like PlayStation era like RPGs.
10740115	10741375	So that's pretty cool.
10741596	10744517	And for $7, you can put an NPC in the development room.
10744577	10746639	So if this looks like something you want to support, there you go.
10747259	10747499	Yeah.
10747519	10747599	Yeah.
10770959	10789559	I remember that I got an email on it this week too I guess they're still pushing it and I haven't really heard any clarifications from Atari The other one has to do with the Tiger Claw sent me Mass Effect 3 and the gay card I want to read this in more detail and probably talk about it at a later time because obviously
10791921	10816521	this is an issue I would be interested in I think some people are unfairly there's some people out there like I don't want Shepard to be gay why does Bioware have to make everything gay well you know what why does everything have to be one way or the other one thing I really like about Mass Effect is you have the freedom to do what you want or not do something hello so anyhow
10818405	10819486	I will read that more later.
10820607	10825612	SSJ100Matt sent us a link about Chinatown Fair Arcade reopening, but I think that was covered in Rapid Fire News.
10825652	10826653	Did we cover that at some point?
10826713	10827053	No.
10828114	10829215	Oh, I thought we had that linked.
10829255	10832138	All right, well, Chinatown Fair Arcade rumored reopening.
10832238	10832598	There you go.
10833219	10834460	And that's it for Twitter.
10834500	10836221	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10836281	10837863	Call me when Arcade Infinity reopens.
10838174	10838655	Yeah, right.
10839996	10842078	Talking about things that disappeared in the last couple years.
10842098	10844600	Yeah, sorry about all the closures coming to California.
10846462	10850807	We need to wrap up and get out of here for the night, but we need to get our final thoughts first.
10850847	10852208	Jason, thank you so much for being here.
10853149	10857633	And thank you, of course, for hosting our website, as you so graciously have for the past...
10858274	10858694	DarkSakura.com
10882185	10882885	Why the hell stop it?
10882965	10884086	So why do we need Kickstarter?
10884106	10887368	We have generous people like Jason who help us out with what they can help get us.
10887548	10889189	I need Kickstarter to recoup costs.
10889269	10890310	Come on, guys.
10890350	10890750	No, no, no.
10890910	10892231	All right.
10892431	10894152	So Jason, final thoughts tonight.
10894692	10895713	Kirby Superstar.
10896658	10898599	Alright, Loki, final thought tonight.
10899219	10908084	I hope there's not a size limit to Excel files because the one I'm using right now to make a editor for Grand Theft Auto maps is 65 megs now.
10908204	10911606	I think 65,535 rows is the most you can have.
10911686	10912386	That's rows.
10912526	10913807	I'm talking about file size.
10914067	10914608	Good luck with that.
10914988	10916088	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10918533	10921156	and my final thought is Cool Whip!
10922017	10922778	Yay!
10923138	10923719	Cool Whip?
10924360	10926262	Cool Whip!

10932789	10934071	We don't ask for your money.
10934571	10937674	Although maybe I'll get talked into the Kickstarter thing.
10937734	10939195	I don't know, though I kind of doubt it.
10939675	10940176	But we'll see.
10941176	10942037	I do say this, though.

10948703	10950644	This is a no embargo zone.
10951605	10953086	And we give you our honest opinions.
10953206	10954447	Actually, we did sign one.
10954507	10956189	We signed one once and we got burned by it.
10956709	10957650	It wasn't about reviews, though.
10958290	10958851	That's something else.
10958951	10959831	I'm not going to get into it now.
10959872	10960352	We're out of time.
10961010	10968509	I have an easy topic if we want to talk about that when we're not recording.
10969508	10973551	Okay, then we're going to turn off the mics and say see you next week.
10973591	10974091	We'll be back.
