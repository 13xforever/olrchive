0	19360	Tonight, March 18th, 2012, a new handheld will let you experience an old system all
19360	20520	over again.
20520	25760	Diablo 3 finally gets a release date, and one fan goes to the feds over a controversial
25760	32760	video game ending.
55760	64160	It is the show where every gamer has a voice, but I'll be guiding you over the next few
64160	65840	hours with my co-hosts.
65840	68880	First off, the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
68880	69880	How are you?
69880	70880	Hi Rob.
70880	71880	What?
71880	72880	Hi.
72880	77200	I see you're wearing a red shirt tonight.
77200	78200	Yes I am.
78200	79200	With a Star Trek logo.
79200	80200	Yes I am.
80200	81200	So you're just waiting to get shot.
81200	82200	No, it's engineering.
82200	83200	I see.
83200	84200	So you're safe.
84200	85200	Yeah.
85200	86920	No falling objects on Jamie tonight.
86920	91240	No, usually just, you know, the core will overheat and they'll have to close down engineering
91240	93520	and someone will fall into the antimatter.
93520	94520	So that won't be me.
94520	96440	But you can't mix the matter with antimatter.
96440	99120	No, you kind of do that.
99120	103520	Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki, joining us every week.
103520	104520	Hello.
104520	105520	How are you, Loki?
105520	106520	I'm fine.
106520	107520	You've got your Vita out.
107520	108520	Yes.
108520	109520	Playing Vita.
109520	114240	Well, I'm trying to have my Vita see my phone so it can tether to it.
114240	119520	So I can download some, actually no, downloading over 3G would be really fucking slow.
119520	120520	Maybe I shouldn't do that.
120520	121840	Yeah, it would be very slow.
121840	122840	Yep.
122840	123840	Never mind.
123840	124840	Skip that.
124840	125840	Yeah.
125840	126840	That's what I thought.
126840	127840	Alright.
127840	128840	We have a guest tonight.
128840	129840	You know, a lot of folks were asking, how are you going to celebrate episode number
129840	130840	450?
130840	134520	And I was like, I didn't realize that was a landmark number, but okay, 450.
134520	140060	But things worked out just really ironically and just, you know, funny things happen sometimes.
140060	143980	Where we have a guest tonight who's joining us on the program for the first time since
143980	149480	2004, but he's a name that should be familiar to all you guys.
149480	152800	It's our webmaster VX Jason XV is here tonight.
152800	153800	Hi, Jason.
153800	154800	Hi, Olarme.
154800	155800	How are you?
155800	157280	I'm exhausted.
157280	160420	Buses are doing nothing for upwards of a day is very tiring.
160420	161420	Go figure.
161420	162420	You're not much of a flyer.
162420	163420	You're a, you're a busser.
163420	164540	Not anymore, unfortunately.
164540	166840	So I get to deal with the day or multi day trips.
166840	171480	Well, I, now that they take nudies of you at the airport, I can understand another,
171480	174200	another very good reason why I decided to stop going to the airport.
174200	179280	Where your hesitation comes from, like, you know, some people want to charge for those.
179280	180960	Uh, so let's see.
180960	181960	It's been about eight years.
181960	182960	How have you been?
182960	189320	Um, I've been older, I guess, since you put it in those wonderful terms.
189320	193080	I've lived in three different States since the last time I was on the show.
193080	196960	I moved out of New Mexico to Arizona around the middle of 2000.
196960	199680	And then a couple of years later, moved out to Colorado where I've been for about the
199680	204760	last five, bought a house and things are, you know, things are progressing in the life
204760	205960	kind of way.
205960	211120	When a dark Tetsuya interviewed me, I mentioned that in the last year I've actually been a
211120	215400	part of a podcast of my own called the Ask Different Podcast, plenty of a Apple nerdiness
215400	216400	and whatnot.
216400	218280	Probably kind of similar, same extent.
218280	223120	We just talk about what's interesting and any particular newsworthy items or if we really
223120	226700	want to delve into a specific topic, we'll, we'll spend some time and talk really detailed
226700	228040	about something in particular.
228040	230760	And you have an amazingly sexy radio voice.
230760	234880	So I, I, you know, and you know, I say that with all, you know, I, I love you, but not
234880	238760	like that, you know, but you do have an amazingly sexy radio voice.
238760	242120	And uh, you know, I'm, I would think that podcast would be great to listen to you guys
242120	243120	still doing it.
243120	244120	Or did that stop?
244120	247520	We, we, we've been off for the past couple of weeks primarily because I've been on this
247520	249880	trip and then one of the other co-hosts have been sick.
249880	251200	So it hasn't been working out so well.
251200	255720	But the last episode was just posted, should have been the first week of the month or just
255720	256720	before that.
256720	261520	And it's been, it's been regular since, uh, the start of winter, at least we had a little
261520	265320	winter hiatus, but it's been regular since it's been taking its fiber.
265320	271120	I don't know if you heard, but there was a new iPad announced really San Francisco Apple
271120	275520	store was a zoo this weekend and surprisingly has nothing to do with St. Patrick's day.
275520	276960	Did they even have any left?
276960	277960	I didn't ask.
277960	281000	I, I'm not, I'm not on a spending money trip, unfortunately.
281000	282000	That's all right.
282000	284880	I, uh, I did, I was commenting on your little iPad set up though, cause you had a little
284880	287840	Bluetooth keyboard and you, you are an Apple nerd.
287840	290000	I am absolutely an Apple nerd anymore.
290000	293880	It's kind of a culture shock to come in here cause I'm surrounded with a bunch of things
293880	297000	that aren't white or silver or Chrome and slick.
297000	299320	I refuse to conform.
299320	301960	This is, this is also temporary housing too.
301960	305480	So we don't plan to stay here forever, but anyway, um, let's see.
305480	309320	So let's talk a little bit about kind of like your history here on OLR.
309320	313400	So you, the last time you were on this show, just put it in perspective, we were still
313400	319400	a show primarily about music, video games and like, you know, DDR, beat mania, Parappa,
319400	320520	all that stuff.
320520	323120	So you still play in music games?
323120	326940	Um, occasionally every once in a while, it's usually one of those things where if somebody
326940	331960	we know is over that has never heard of them before, we like to, uh, I have a homemade
331960	336180	pop and music controller, full size, you know, two, two ratio and whatnot.
336180	340040	And so we throw in one of the versions and play some hard songs and they get a kick out
340040	343520	of this loud, clacky game with an oversized controller.
343520	347280	Um, I try to keep up on the two DX console releases.
347280	352220	Unfortunately, the arcade that did have a machine nearby, uh, went to Utah in the past
352220	353220	couple of months.
353220	360080	So some of the arcade avenues have disappeared for me, but, um, I, I try not so much DDR
360080	363820	as much as other things and it's, you know, it's still interesting cause I still adore
363820	364820	the music.
364820	367600	I still listen to it any chance I get.
367600	371480	Even in the new two DXs, you forgive the music cause I, I'm, I'm kind of not a big fan of
371480	372720	where Bahmani music went.
372720	374560	It's not as good as it used to be in my opinion.
374560	378000	Video game music, music in general follows a flow with me.
378000	379980	I have to have an association with it.
379980	382920	And as of Empress, I don't have an association with it anymore.
382920	385040	So no, it's not as interesting to me.
385040	389080	There's a couple of gyms here and there, but if you ask me to pick a favorite, I would
389080	392280	probably go back to sixth, eighth style.
392280	395840	Back when it was the classics, uh, you were a moderator on DDR freak.
395840	396840	I was.
396840	401000	I think technically I might still be listed as one DDR free closed.
401000	406760	I don't know if you heard, I know I was still listed as one and I hadn't looked at the site
406760	407760	in years.
407760	409600	So highly active moderator as well.
409600	413960	Well, I mean, I even, I told them, I think it was about three years ago when I was kind
413960	417480	of saying that I'm not going to be around the site as much anymore because I just don't
417480	418480	feel relevant anymore.
418480	420680	I don't feel that I'm relevant with it anymore.
420680	425580	Um, and I, I guess I heard that that was happening and maybe I did hear that it closed down,
425580	429680	but not going to the site anymore and seeing the page means that it doesn't really, you
429680	430800	know, it's not any different to me.
430800	431800	I was going to be there to look at it.
431800	434880	I think it's still there, but the forums are all, it's cool.
434880	436920	And the forums were the last great hurrah.
436920	440800	I think that and the machine locations, which I think kind of got dusty.
440800	444180	So I don't think, you know, they're really doing pretty much all the hardcore Bemani
444180	447800	nerds as far as I know, unless there's other sites I'm not aware of are on Bemani style
447800	448800	at this point.
448800	449800	Bemani style.
449800	454680	Aaron in Japan is still very prominent and zenisivanishur is the trendy name of the week.
454680	455680	I know that.
455680	456680	No, I know that.
456680	457680	So, but they've been around a couple of years.
457680	458680	I know them.
458680	459680	Yeah.
459680	460680	So, okay.
460680	463800	Um, gosh, what else do I ask a man who hasn't been on the show in eight years?
463800	465440	Let's let's talk about eight years ago.
465440	467840	You and I went to E3 together and dear friends.
467840	468840	That's right.
468840	469840	Oh gosh.
469840	470840	Yes.
470840	471840	That first dear friends.
471840	472840	Last time I was on the show.
472840	475680	Nobu was still part of square.
475680	477600	That was, that was the night.
477600	480560	And I know I've told this story on the show on many times, but that was the night where
480560	481560	we were surprised.
481560	482560	Remember this case?
482560	486480	I don't even like you and I got tickets or I think I bought tickets and you bought one
486480	487480	or so.
487480	490120	I don't even remember how we did it, but we, you and I ended up going to this thing together
490120	495840	and we sat four and five seats down from Nobu who crossed by us multiple times to get to
495840	496840	the stage.
496840	500760	The punchline is we're sitting there in our seats where we're the very last row of the
500760	501760	orchestra section.
501760	502760	Right?
502760	503760	So, I mean, we kind of walk in there.
503760	507480	We're like, okay, we might not be front and center, but from like an acoustical standpoint,
507480	508840	we're like right in the center of the room.
508840	510840	This is going to be the best place.
510840	514200	We're not the, we're about four seats away from the very, very center of the room, but
514200	515520	we're like really close.
515520	519520	But we do notice like four seats down, the seats are blocked off with caution tape.
519520	522840	And we're just kind of thinking like, oh, okay, well, you know, these seats, uh, maybe
522840	525880	they're broken or, you know, something happened, but they don't want people sitting there for
525880	526880	whatever reason.
526880	530520	The MC something for the, uh, for the actual venue, something like that, something like
530520	531520	that.
531520	535640	So finally Nobu Imatsu comes out and the only way we know this is that he kind of, you know,
535640	539240	he peaks out and he's, he's not really dressed in a suit and tie.
539240	544240	He's dressed like, you know, in a robe, he's pretty easy to spot and just everybody stands
544240	545240	and applauds him.
545240	546240	This is before the thing even starts.
546240	549240	They'll stand and they start applauding him and like, we're standing, we're applauding
549240	550240	too.
550240	551360	We're like, oh, he's, he's walking over this way.
551360	553720	Oh, he's walking, he's walking closer to us.
553720	559880	Oh, oh my gosh, he's right in front of me and I need to move so he can get to his seat
559880	560880	that's blocked off.
560880	564960	And so that was like our, our brush with greatness right there.
564960	571240	Cause you know, obviously the man, I mean Final Fantasy was the music for so long.
571240	574820	So just kind of being able to have that as part of the experience of, oh, going to a
574820	576680	concert all about the music was amazing.
576680	580440	Believe me, I've told that story my fair share of times to a nerd that would appreciate it
580440	581440	as well too.
581440	583700	And it's funny cause that wasn't even the section that you wanted to buy tickets for
583700	584700	in the first place.
584700	587280	You wanted to be one more section up and they were completely sold out.
587280	590800	So you're like, okay, let's, let's upgrade then and not downgrade and orchestra section.
590800	592720	Yeah, let's do it.
592720	597440	I was like, well, yeah, cause at that time, a, I was 20 year old with no responsibility
597440	598440	whatsoever.
598440	601560	B, it was kind of like, you know, why not?
601560	603700	Is like how many times are they going to do a concert like this?
603700	606120	We didn't know tour or anything like that.
606120	608600	Now you and I didn't go to more friends after that.
608600	610120	More friends was not as good.
610120	613840	Sadly, they had a lot of problems with that venue, but anyway, we will, we won't dwell
613840	615640	on the negative, just the positive.
615640	617640	But that was that the only E3 you ended up going to?
617640	619720	I've only ever been to 04.
619720	623360	I don't think I've even been back in the state since 2004.
623360	626960	And again, to put it in perspective, the big thing they showed off that year was the Nintendo
626960	632000	DS, not the D, not the DSI, and Pokemon XD.
632000	633480	They had a very big corner of that.
633480	634480	I remember.
634480	635480	And how was E3?
635480	640920	Uh, Oh God, I don't even remember E3 to be completely honest that, I mean, that was one
640920	644260	of those things where I came out and it was, you know, finally putting faces to names of
644260	645260	so many people.
645260	649640	Cause it was the big, uh, the, the four of us in the room here now we're a part of it.
649640	651040	See, I flew out with DDR freaks.
651040	655920	So there was a whole bunch of people whose names I know and, uh, talked with, uh, frequently
655920	661880	I can finally be in person with, um, E3 was for, for a gamer.
661880	665960	It was fun because there was plenty of things to look at and get your hands on.
665960	668720	And G4 was still prominent back then.
668720	672960	They had the orange booth last that year, if you remember, and all the, all the college
672960	677140	kids running around interning for them and whatnot.
677140	681760	I'm trying to think of one specific thing about the show that was exciting and minus
681760	686480	the Konami booth, which is kind of a given and the fact that square had a humongous final
686480	689240	fantasy, final fantasy 11 was prominent back then.
689240	690240	Wow.
690240	691240	Wasn't even the MMO of that.
691240	692240	Wow.
692240	693240	Did not exist at that point.
693240	696040	If you can believe it, they might've been showing the early stuff about it.
696040	697040	I don't remember.
697040	698040	It was too long ago.
698040	700120	You even PVP'd at E3.
700120	702400	Oh, that was the year I won the computer.
702400	703400	Yeah.
703400	706840	The old show computer was one in a final fantasy 11 event.
706840	707840	Yes.
707840	708840	I did.
708840	709840	I won.
709840	710840	I won the thank you square for the old computer.
710840	711840	Although we don't use it anymore.
711840	712840	Let's see what was in there.
712840	715440	The gizmondo I think was still being phantom.
715440	716440	Yeah.
716440	717440	Yeah.
717440	719960	The Phantom that they, they hadn't relegated themselves to a keyboard yet, but the Phantom
719960	723760	was still very prominent there right behind Konami as a matter of fact,
723760	726960	I will never forget the experience of walking in there the first time.
726960	731480	And the very first thing I saw at E3 was Konami's booth and the big game they were doing that
731480	734800	year was silent Hill for the room.
734800	737560	That was the coolest set up I'd ever seen.
737560	738560	That wasn't that awesome.
738560	742600	And it was just kind of like, wow, it's like I'm at the state fair, but it's all about
742600	743600	video games.
743600	745640	It was a silent Hill four and metal gear solid three.
745640	746640	Wasn't it?
746640	747640	Yeah.
747640	748640	They kind of had both going on.
748640	749640	Yeah.
749640	753240	But I just remember the big set up with all the little light in a room with eight or so
753240	762520	systems and it's a room and you're in it and you're playing the room, which I still, I
762520	766160	started and speaking of this, since we're talking about that game specifically, I had
766160	769840	a little silent Hill marathon week, uh, a while ago.
769840	771920	I replayed through the first three.
771920	773040	I replayed the first one.
773040	774040	I've done that before.
774040	778420	I played two and three, started to get to four and um, I guess it worked that time cause
778420	779420	it kind of creeped me out.
779420	782900	I wasn't, uh, I couldn't actually make it through that game.
782900	787040	Just the, the pace and the ambience and whatnot got to me for some reason.
787040	789160	And I actually didn't wind up making it through that one.
789160	790740	I'll have to try again someday.
790740	792680	You know, funny we bring up silent Hill and all that.
792680	795720	Um, I don't know if you guys realized the new silent Hill game just came out this past
795720	796720	week.
796720	797720	Really?
797720	799800	It told the silent Hill downpour.
799800	800800	I did.
800800	804280	I was at fries the other day, just randomly spending time where we're walking up and down
804280	805280	looking at video games.
805280	806280	I'm like, what's the silent Hill game?
806280	807280	Oh shit.
807280	809320	They released a new silent Hill game.
809320	810960	I totally forgot about this.
810960	811960	Yeah.
811960	816740	Silent Hill downpour came out and uh, Shane is sending me private messages here apparently.
816740	818680	And this is like a tiny spoiler, but not really.
818680	819680	It's not a story.
819680	820680	Story spoiler.
820680	825960	It says that you totally get to visit Henry's room from silent Hill four as an Easter egg
825960	827880	and it's still locked from the inside.
827880	832440	So I guess they're throwing in little, little throwbacks to the other silent Hill games,
832440	836280	even though silent Hill four, the room was not supposed to be a silent Hill game when
836280	837280	it started.
837280	839340	That's why it feels so disconnected from the rest of them.
839340	844080	Silent Hill form was original silent Hill four was originally a game called the room.
844080	845080	I'm confused.
845080	846080	Not to be confused with the movie.
846080	847080	Yeah.
847080	848080	Cause that would have sucked.
848080	849920	Um, no, I'm confused with the fact that.
849920	855520	So was his room supposed to be in silent Hill, like the, like the actual room part.
855520	857760	I mean, cause I don't get it.
857760	860880	I mean, I remember there was the portals to silent Hill, but what's his room supposed
860880	861880	to be?
861880	865080	Do you know how many years it's been since I played silent Hill in the room?
865080	866080	Would it be eight by chance?
866080	868400	I would have thought that this would have stuck with you.
868400	869400	I mean, no.
869400	873480	Uh, anyhow, I'm just trying to figure out, it was all a dream.
873480	874480	It was all dream.
874480	875480	All right.
875480	878600	Uh, let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.
878600	881760	You always talk a little bit about how is your gaming week and what video games you've
881760	886400	been playing, whether it be new or whether it be eight years old, um, dark soccer.
886400	887560	Hi, how are you?
887560	889120	How was your gaming week?
889120	896360	Uh, I have another 85 and she's a hoe bag dealer.
896360	899600	Um, she, she's a hoe bag.
899600	901420	I'm dressing her as slutty as possible.
901420	902420	So you're a blood elf.
902420	903420	Yeah.
903420	904420	And wow.
904420	910800	Um, uh, of course, I honestly thought we were talking about saints row or something like
910800	911800	that at first.
911800	913680	I, I kind of fell off that.
913680	917720	I should have known better, but I, I fell off some, you know, there's a, there's a big
917720	921840	reveal coming tonight about Mr. Pandaria because the, uh, which is the next expansion panda
921840	922840	people.
922840	925840	I don't know if you've heard, but the next expansion deals with walking, talky pandas,
925840	927380	and there was a press event last week.
927380	932320	The embargo lifts at midnight tonight, so there's going to be huge information from
932320	933720	the new tomorrow.
933720	939260	We can only hope that the worlds of saints row and world of Warcraft have collided, especially
939260	944120	the fuzzy wuzzy panda bears, but there have been some early leaks.
944120	947760	Some of the, you know, when they have an NDA for a week, inevitably somebody is going to,
947760	948760	it's too hot for their hands.
948760	949760	They got to let it out.
949760	951740	So we've seen what the female pandas look like now.
951740	956240	They look like, like red pandas, although some are saying that could just be one coloring.
956240	957680	I think it's just a coloring.
957680	960980	And then, uh, some of the videos that show off, like some of the dungeons, I got to say
960980	964300	that temple, the Jade serpent looks amazing.
964300	966260	So can't wait to get in some of those new instances.
966260	967260	I looked at it.
967260	973560	I thought it was pretty cool, but, uh, I tried to play some more star mine, but I'm actually
973560	974840	stuck on the puzzle.
974840	978180	So that's really about it.
978180	982500	And I watched Scott Pilgrim again for the 50 millionth time on St Patrick's day.
982500	983500	What possessed that?
983500	984500	We were bored.
984500	985500	That's good.
985500	990600	I also learned, um, a new game is called how not to blow up the house with a pressure cooker.
990600	991600	Good idea.
991600	994360	My first time using a pressure cooker made corned beef.
994360	995360	Yeah.
995360	996360	It was epic.
996360	997360	Under pressure.
997360	998360	All right.
998360	999360	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
999360	1001240	Um, I played a few things.
1001240	1003080	I actually, it's kind of funny.
1003080	1010800	I'm thinking of going to, uh, just like dedicating a month to playing PlayStation games.
1010800	1016580	Cause I like realize I have all these games on my PS3 that I'm just not playing and not
1016580	1018520	enough trophies.
1018520	1023200	That is true trophy level is quite, quite small at this point.
1023200	1026120	Uh, but no, it's like a, you know, a little big planet too.
1026120	1027680	I have to play through that still.
1027680	1032920	I have infamous that I got from the whole fallout from the network being down, um, that
1032920	1038480	the play through, um, and I'm sure there's some other games I want to go back and play
1038480	1042880	through resistance one, two, and three actually, cause I played through one all the way and
1042880	1044360	I love resistance.
1044360	1048440	Resistance was to me when you compare resistance and halo three resistance by far way better
1048440	1049440	game.
1049440	1054680	Um, but I kinda, I want to go through two and three and play through those, but before
1054680	1059600	I get the beat of one, so anyways, so stuff I actually did play, I played, um, journey.
1059600	1060780	I bought that game.
1060780	1063280	It's amazing game, very short, but who cares?
1063280	1064920	You can play through it a bunch of times.
1064920	1066680	Um, and it's just, it's a beautiful game.
1066680	1070120	It's one of those games that like I had people over, I'm like, Hey, you got to see this game
1070120	1071760	cause it's really beautiful.
1071760	1076180	So and the big spoiler last week I was trying to hide, but it was brought to my attention
1076180	1078520	from Bobby that it's revealed in the trailer.
1078520	1084680	So oops, my bad, but it's a multiplayer game and you don't like I did, I knew nothing about
1084680	1089600	journey going into it, but when I say it's a multiplayer game, you can't talk to that.
1089600	1092440	There's no, it doesn't work like other online games.
1092440	1095280	You have one emote and that's the little chirp that you do.
1095280	1097640	You can't type, you can't talk.
1097640	1101080	You don't even know who it is that you're playing with and you might think, God, that
1101080	1102080	sounds basic.
1102080	1103080	You don't know until the end.
1103080	1106760	Well, yeah, yeah, I will show you their, their little, I keep wanting to say gamer tags,
1106760	1109960	but PSN IDs or whatever they're called at the very, very, very end of the game.
1109960	1110960	Yeah.
1110960	1113520	But until that point you have no idea who it is and you can't really communicate and
1113520	1117680	you might think, God, that seems so basic, but at the same time it's brilliant in its
1117680	1118680	simplicity.
1118680	1119680	Isn't it?
1119680	1120680	Yeah.
1120680	1123280	Because even like, why do we hate to play games online these days?
1123280	1128960	Fag, fag, fag, stop being such a fag, you play with a fag, it's noob fag.
1128960	1130780	Like that's why I can't play games online.
1130780	1133040	Like it's just, I have to mute everybody.
1133040	1136960	But the fact that Journey kind of scales it back and you have this experience or whatever
1136960	1141560	with somebody else where you communicate through this like new method of communication, the
1141560	1143120	little chirping is neat.
1143120	1147200	Anyway, I didn't mean to dominate your conversation, but I had to get that out since last week.
1147200	1149500	It was pretty cool because you don't really know what's going on.
1149500	1152880	The game reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, just like even the art style with
1152880	1157160	some of the characters that you meet later on, not trying to spoil anything, but, um,
1157160	1159200	they just reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus.
1159200	1164200	But yeah, it's a really fun game.
1164200	1168520	Really beautiful game, it does a very good job of conveying emotion, I guess, through
1168520	1170520	the whole thing.
1170520	1174760	But yeah, it's definitely worth, I think, the 15 bucks to pick it up.
1174760	1180600	I played, let's see, aside from the PlayStation 3, I played some stuff on the Vita, mainly
1180600	1185840	just I went back and played a little bit more Motorstorm RC.
1185840	1189680	Little kind of frustrated, the controls and that, because I'll be doing a perfect lap
1189680	1194440	and then I'll run into the AI character or I'll run into a wall because I can't see it
1194440	1198160	well enough because of the camera sucking.
1198160	1203720	So that's a little annoying, but I did manage to top out all my friends on the leaderboards
1203720	1207160	there, at least for all the tracks that I've played, I still haven't played through the
1207160	1208160	whole game.
1208160	1211840	And I do like how it's like, oh, this track's not unlocked yet, and you can hit it and it
1211840	1214760	says buy, and you can buy the unlock to unlock all of them.
1214760	1219700	Why would I waste my time doing that, you know, seriously?
1219700	1224080	One thing I'm noticing about the Vita is that it is moving closer and closer to Facebook
1224080	1225080	games.
1225080	1227720	In some of the games I've played, I'd say I don't like that one bit.
1227720	1230760	Like it's really like, press this button to buy it right now.
1230760	1231760	You don't have to.
1231760	1232760	Get your recharge right now.
1232760	1235320	You don't have to, and that's the best part about it.
1235320	1239000	Why would I unlock all the tracks in this game that would defeat the purpose of playing
1239000	1241160	the game if you did that?
1241160	1244560	It's like you're paying money and it's like, oh, I'm done with the game now.
1244560	1245560	So you know, whatever.
1245560	1250100	It doesn't take that long to unlock everything, you just play through the tracks.
1250100	1255240	So I did that, and you know, it's still, it's an alright game still.
1255240	1261200	Noticing that some of the tracks are starting to repeat, which is kind of okay I guess.
1261200	1262400	And now this is kind of funny.
1262400	1269160	I played the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita, except the demo for Ridge Racer on the Vita
1269160	1275960	is their E3 2011 demo that they had, which isn't really a demo at all.
1275960	1283000	It's just a demo of a, the engine, the concept, I'm not really sure what the fuck it's supposed
1283000	1284000	to be.
1284000	1288800	It's basically, it's just shots of the car, like it's panning around the car.
1288800	1294600	And if you touch the screen and drag your finger across, it sort of tweaks the music
1294600	1300240	a little bit, and if you hold the L or R buttons, it'll kind of like remix the music a bit.
1300240	1301240	And that's it.
1301240	1303760	And then like, I was like, oh okay, this is kind of neat, you know, while they're talking
1303760	1304760	about the game.
1304760	1309720	It's all, you know, the end of demo, I'm like, where's the racing?
1309720	1311760	Where the fuck is the racing?
1311760	1314120	Ridge Racer 10, showroom.
1314120	1315400	It's just, there is no fucking-
1315400	1318360	Press X to unlock the racing for only 100-
1318360	1322280	No, seriously, they're like, buy the full game, I'm like, I'm not even sure what the
1322280	1323800	full game is.
1323800	1324800	There's nothing here.
1324800	1327480	Oh, that's funny because there's nothing in the real game either.
1327480	1331120	Hold on though, to be devil's advocate, Loki, it's Ridge Racer.
1331120	1333120	You fucking know what the game is.
1333120	1336080	Like if you don't know by now, what is this, like the 10th or 11th Ridge Racer game?
1336080	1339960	If you don't know what Ridge Racer is by now, I can't fucking help you.
1339960	1341480	Well here's a spoiler, okay?
1341480	1345400	First off, the spoiler is that Ridge Racer for the Vita sucks.
1345400	1347400	Now I know that it's going to be a shock to some people-
1347400	1348400	How dare you?
1348400	1349400	It sucks.
1349400	1350520	And here's the even funnier part.
1350520	1351640	There's no new tracks in it.
1351640	1354840	They're all from Ridge Racer 7 from the PlayStation 3.
1354840	1358600	All of them, all three of them that are included with the game.
1358600	1363360	Oh, and you get another three if you purchase the game right away, you know, because you
1363360	1366400	need to have Ridge Racer, and you get another three tracks.
1366400	1372320	Or you can pay another like $7 to unlock some more tracks and cars.
1372320	1377520	Now I've heard the argument that, well, you know, really a lot of the cars that are in
1377520	1381760	these games are just kind of reskins of other cars and stuff like that with different stats
1381760	1383920	and you know, whatever.
1383920	1389160	It's not really, you know, these three cars you can upgrade and keep unlocking stuff or
1389160	1390160	whatever.
1390160	1395920	Once again, you know, we kind of talked about this last week with on disc DLC and stuff
1395920	1396920	like that.
1396920	1399320	It's the illusion of it, okay?
1399320	1406080	Now a game that has three cars versus advertising game that has 200 cars, like I think Ridge
1406080	1409480	Racer was an R4 fucking amazing game.
1409480	1413560	I'd rather have that on my Vita because that was just awesome and there was tons of tracks
1413560	1414560	and cars.
1414560	1417920	And yeah, and I understand that, you know, you can race the tracks backwards from the
1417920	1418920	get go.
1418920	1422880	Yeah, it's a stupid way to, you know, say you have double the amount of tracks that
1422880	1423880	you do.
1423880	1428560	But since you can't really, you know, have one and a half tracks in the game, you know,
1428560	1430400	they're going to have to count three full tracks.
1430400	1435000	Have you ever heard of a game that sounds so perfect for the rental market?
1435000	1437400	It's not perfect for the rental market.
1437400	1439720	It's perfect for a demo.
1439720	1441000	That's it.
1441000	1442920	That is a demo right there.
1442920	1447120	If they wanted, like, you know, to put that game out for free and then have the extra
1447120	1451000	cars, that would be, I don't think anyone would be really complaining about it, that
1451000	1454640	it has only three cars, but it's free and you get to play Ridge Racer.
1454640	1457760	And then if you want to buy additional cars, no one would balk at that.
1457760	1459880	They would, they would probably, I'd probably buy it.
1459880	1464280	I'd probably, well, I wouldn't buy it because it'd be free, but I would pay the extra, you
1464280	1468520	know, the extra money, you know, to maybe download some extra tracks and stuff like
1468520	1470040	that if it was free.
1470040	1471040	But it's not.
1471040	1473600	It costs $25, which they consider a discount.
1473600	1478000	It's not a fucking discount because there's plenty of games that are out there for $29.99,
1478000	1484360	and considering that a full game is only $10 more, or even, you know, kind of a not so
1484360	1489720	full game but it's Touch My Katamari was the same price, and I consider that a better experience,
1489720	1495200	although not by much, but at least there's actual content in there.
1495200	1496280	It's just, I don't understand.
1496280	1498520	And why was the game delayed?
1498520	1499880	It still sucks.
1499880	1501600	It still has like frame rate problems.
1501600	1503360	Weren't they doing graph, oh okay.
1503360	1506920	They weren't, yeah, they were supposedly doing graphic updates and stuff like that, it was
1506920	1509400	supposed to run better, and it still sucks.
1509400	1511040	It's like, what were you doing?
1511040	1512040	Womp womp.
1512040	1516400	You don't even have to like, I don't even know, they have all the geometry still for
1516400	1519760	the tracks because they were in Ridge Racer 7.
1519760	1521360	You didn't do anything.
1521360	1525880	Fuck, just upgrade the graphics from the PSP version, it would have been way better.
1525880	1529640	Alright, anything else you want to bitch about for your gaming week?
1529640	1535080	Uh, I played Call of Duty 4, and we're playing with some GPD mods now, which is fun, so we
1535080	1540840	have what we call Ninja Mode, or the, what is it, Ninja Games that I host because I have
1540840	1545480	the mod in my system, so when I host it, it allows us to run really fast and jump really
1545480	1549560	high and it's actually kind of fun with a few people, but then we still play legit games
1549560	1551480	and I still own all this.
1551480	1554960	Catching up on some of our comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, the
1554960	1557040	chat is talking about Journey a little bit.
1557040	1560780	Tigerclaw says, the only thing that would make Journey better would be music from Journey,
1560780	1561780	and Randy-
1561780	1563360	Wrong, you know, honestly I don't think it would.
1563360	1566540	Well hold on, because Randy piggybacks on that and says, if you play Journey while listening
1566540	1569960	to Don't Stop Believin' on loop, it totally syncs up.
1569960	1573780	Now as much as I love Journey and all Journey jokes aside, it should be noted that the soundtrack
1573780	1579740	for the game is pretty frickin' sweet, like it's a great, like, you know, ambience soundtrack.
1579740	1586240	But if you want to rock out while you play an ambient, artsy game, okay, sure, pick Journey.
1586240	1589280	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1589280	1590280	Ah, that's it.
1590280	1592320	Then let me go to Jason, since you're here tonight.
1592320	1596360	Jason, what kind of games have you been playing?
1596360	1602400	The ones where you serve customers and get money for it, by which I mean not really.
1602400	1609920	No, I've kind of been in a slump for the past month, gearing up for this trip and just kind
1609920	1612640	of working a lot.
1612640	1617000	Well now, I know you brought your 3DS with you, because our 3DS is mated when we weren't
1617000	1618920	looking and did the whole StreetPass thing.
1618920	1619920	What kind of DS game?
1619920	1622480	I don't know if you played any on the bus on the way here.
1622480	1627760	I surprisingly didn't do anything on the bus on the way here, except for sleep and occasional
1627760	1628760	music.
1628760	1633720	But for what it's worth, when I picked up my 3DS, I have the same set of games then
1633720	1635000	as I do now.
1635000	1640920	Those would be Bust A Move Universe, I think is the 3DS version.
1640920	1648760	Bust A Move, Star Fox 3D, On Green of Time 3D, and two more that I probably have never
1648760	1649760	touched because I don't...
1649760	1652320	Oh, Mario Land 3D, can't forget that one.
1652320	1655400	And at this point, probably a fifth game that I've...
1655400	1656400	Mario Kart?
1656400	1657400	Not yet.
1657400	1664440	Mario Kart, I've really wanted to, but that was right after I lost my job, so I didn't.
1664440	1665640	That's alright, don't worry about it.
1665640	1669160	I was gonna say, are you excited about the Kid Icarus game?
1669160	1670880	Let's say economy wasn't a factor.
1670880	1673520	I've never played the original Kid Icarus meaningfully.
1673520	1675120	Well, okay, here's the thing though.
1675120	1677600	When did the original Kid Icarus come out, 1984?
1677600	1682140	So it's been about 20-something years since that game came out, a damn near 30.
1682140	1687020	So you know, they're having to market this new Kid Icarus game at people who have never
1687020	1689380	played Kid Icarus, it's okay.
1689380	1692520	So does it look interesting?
1692520	1695840	I've not been looking at the news.
1695840	1700680	It's kind of funny because I haven't been nearly as connected in the last couple of
1700680	1705600	days as I have been, as I usually am when not traveling, and I've seen that everybody's
1705600	1709920	been posting links to trailers and all of the hype and whatnot surrounding it, but I
1709920	1713760	actually haven't watched the trailers.
1713760	1718000	It'll come out, I'll watch the media, right now gaming in general in the midst of all
1718000	1721120	this is kind of off my radar.
1721120	1725000	I guess there are three things that I can say I've been playing.
1725000	1733640	On the road to 200.6% in Castlevania Symphony of the Night, whenever I get completely frustrated
1733640	1739320	with grinding out those stupid little blocks that are underwater, above water in the upside
1739320	1744040	down castle, whenever I get frustrated with that, I go to Serious Sam 2 and then get frustrated
1744040	1749280	with that in about 10 minutes, if that, because all of my saves exist in the rooms where you
1749280	1751680	have to survive for as long as possible.
1751680	1756000	I got sucked into stupid YouTube today watching one of those Castlevania Symphony of the Night
1756000	1760520	long playthroughs because her classic game of the week had a long playthrough video and
1760520	1762720	you know how like when you go to, and I was looking at it on YouTube, and you know how
1762720	1765960	like when you do that, it's going to show you related videos on the side.
1765960	1769920	Well, I saw Castlevania Symphony of the Night and I was like, Ooh, I want to watch some
1769920	1770920	of that.
1770920	1774480	And I watching, watching, watching 30 minutes later.
1774480	1775480	Shit.
1775480	1776480	I need to go to the grocery store.
1776480	1780080	That's how Dan puts himself to sleep is watching long playthroughs.
1780080	1783000	There's a ton of long playthrough videos out there.
1783000	1784000	My God.
1784000	1785880	And that's exactly why he has a new one for every night.
1785880	1786880	Yeah.
1786880	1787880	And there's like a huge community out there.
1787880	1790360	He and I will just watch those instead of movies.
1790360	1791360	I'm serious.
1791360	1792360	No, that's, that's awesome.
1792360	1796240	I want to see the long playthroughs for Ridge Racer, Vita.
1796240	1799800	I'm sure after that 30 seconds, I'll be ready for some more.
1799800	1800800	Tiger Claw corrects me.
1800800	1801800	It was 1986.
1801800	1802800	All right.
1802800	1803800	My, my bad.
1803800	1805560	It's 26 years then.
1805560	1806560	It's been 86.
1806560	1807560	All right.
1807560	1812600	Uh, well, if that's all you want to share about your gaming week, then I will talk about
1812600	1813600	mine.
1813600	1817360	Although I got to admit mine isn't, I don't have a variety of games like I usually do.
1817360	1819120	I've been playing two games this week.
1819120	1820120	Two.
1820120	1821480	Bass Effect and Journey.
1821480	1822480	You're pretty close.
1822480	1824040	I, I even put Journey aside.
1824040	1826160	I meant to play it more, but I can't stop playing Journey.
1826160	1828680	I play WoW of course, cause I have a rating group.
1828680	1831400	So I have to kind of play that at a set time every week.
1831400	1834400	But when I'm not playing World of Warcraft, I'm playing Mass Effect.
1834400	1836720	Not Mass Effect 3, mind you, Mass Effect 1.
1836720	1837920	Hopefully you heard last week's show.
1837920	1841920	I'm five years late to the party and I said, I'm going to start from the very beginning.
1841920	1848580	And I just want to say, because I can do this, you know, on a podcast and you know, we don't
1848580	1850360	make any money off this show or whatever.
1850360	1853960	We don't answer to anybody but the listeners and ourselves, right?
1853960	1857360	I totally misjudged this game five years ago.
1857360	1859440	And it's something I'm sure we have all done.
1859440	1864700	You see a little bit, you, you hear a snippet of a song and, oh, that album sucks.
1864700	1867840	Or you go to a restaurant one time in the food, foods battle.
1867840	1869160	This place sucks.
1869160	1873580	I'm pretty sure in retrospect, when I saw somebody playing Mass Effect for the first
1873580	1879280	time and I even, I remember playing it a little bit myself and kind of going, this is, I think
1879280	1884180	it was when I was on one of those planets, driving that stupid car up over mountains
1884180	1889840	and running into the buildings, not on easy combat mode and getting shot the hell up by
1889840	1896760	the aliens, which is like the two parts of the game that I hear are fixed in two, especially
1896760	1898640	the car parts and all that.
1898640	1902240	And you know, now that I play Mass Effect 1 and I'm not afraid to play it on casual
1902240	1903840	mode, it doesn't bother me at all.
1903840	1907760	Like I actually really enjoy the combat and like flinging, flinging things around like
1907760	1908760	they're, you know.
1908760	1912480	I thought you were going to say flinging poo, flinging poo and so forth.
1912480	1915600	And I got to say, I am really sucked into the story too.
1915600	1919120	The story is so fucking good.
1919120	1924320	Like it's just like, it's like I'm watching an episode of Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica,
1924320	1927400	but I am choosing the outcome I want.
1927400	1930920	And like, I'm seeing so much about like, oh God, I've got to play this again because I've
1930920	1935920	got to see how it plays again when I'm a bitch, because you know, you can be the nice guy
1935920	1937960	or you can be the bitch, right?
1937960	1939840	So there's so much I want to explore.
1939840	1945480	I have, I have to admit, you know, who I think would love Mass Effect that it hasn't been
1945480	1950640	playing it, Jamie, I really think you need to give this game a chance.
1950640	1951640	I do.
1951640	1952640	I'll borrow it when you're done.
1952640	1953640	All right.
1953640	1955400	This, this, well, here's the, well, cause the whole, like, you know, I know you're not
1955400	1956400	big on controllers.
1956400	1960200	I would urge you to check out the PC one because I just think the depth of the story, cause
1960200	1966600	you like science fiction and all that stuff and I just think it's 1999, but I got it for
1966600	1968080	12 used at Dimple.
1968080	1969680	I'm thinking PC though.
1969680	1970680	Oh, PC?
1970680	1971680	Just wait for steam sales.
1971680	1972680	I'm sure.
1972680	1973680	Yeah.
1973680	1974680	It's 1999.
1974680	1975680	If anybody still has any steam coupons or anything.
1975680	1978120	Um, yeah, you never know.
1978120	1979120	But anyway.
1979120	1980120	Yeah.
1980120	1982760	But anyway, uh, I just got to say, I think you would be really into this cause I know
1982760	1986920	you like a good story and I just, just the whole fact that I think you would try to like
1986920	1989320	romance certain characters.
1989320	1990640	See what happens.
1990640	1991640	I don't know.
1991640	1995600	Just, you just, I could just see you like, I could see, like my minor Merrill obsession
1995600	1996600	for dragon age too.
1996600	1998960	Well, yeah, I could cause it was even even miles high.
1998960	2002440	I could see you talking to the guy and kind of romancing the guy, but then you'd be like,
2002440	2004360	I like this cool Darth Vader chick.
2004360	2006000	I want to romance her.
2006000	2008200	That would probably be me.
2008200	2009200	See?
2009200	2014280	So I, I, I have to say, I am surprised you're not, and Jamie, don't be afraid to set it
2014280	2015280	to casual.
2015280	2016280	You still get achievements and all that.
2016280	2018800	And then the combat isn't a big deal in the first person stuff.
2018800	2021120	I don't care as long as I don't hurt myself playing.
2021120	2022120	Yeah.
2022120	2025560	So, but anyway, uh, yeah, so I got to say that I, uh, I'm really enjoying it.
2025560	2030120	I've already bought mass effect two because I'm waiting for when I finished mass effect
2030120	2033800	one because I'm apparently not super, super, super far from the end.
2033800	2035440	I probably have about five more hours to go.
2035440	2038560	My character's level 33 or 34.
2038560	2043760	So yeah, that's, that's been my gaming week mass effect and lots of it.
2043760	2045600	Alan beat it on PC.
2045600	2046780	He just beat it today.
2046780	2050040	So I'm like dying to talk about it with him, but not until I beat it too.
2050040	2052440	So hopefully that'll come Monday or Tuesday.
2052440	2053440	We'll see.
2053440	2057440	How can you, how can you be in that close of proximity to someone and not have an ending
2057440	2058440	spoiled?
2058440	2061920	You know, what's funny cause he plays in the back room, the, the computer room.
2061920	2066560	Cause he's playing on PC and I play out here on the three 60 and so I kinda, I can see
2066560	2069840	what he's doing and I kind of look over his shoulder a little bit, but you know, I'm just
2069840	2073740	like, Oh, he's in a base or Oh, you know, he's, he's in the planet in the car or whatever.
2073740	2077280	And then, you know, he'll come out and he'll tell me, Oh, did you know if you do this,
2077280	2081440	you can do this and this and this, you know, you know, you know, in that cute way.
2081440	2083280	So all right.
2083280	2086560	So yeah, that was my gaming week, lots of mass effect.
2086560	2093920	Um, let's talk about housekeeping, visit our websites, www dot orange laundry.com of course
2093920	2097120	is our main website, which is graciously hosted by Jason.
2097120	2099520	And I should also say designed by Deke man.
2099520	2101720	He deserves a shout out to, he does great work.
2101720	2106680	Um, and in the upper right hand corner is the, uh, um, extended play box.
2106680	2111760	I almost said now playing extended play box flashback to PHP, new, right.
2111760	2114920	Hey, also what we were doing eight years ago.
2114920	2116480	And you can find the Facebook there.
2116480	2117760	You can find Google plus there.
2117760	2119720	You can find just the steam community.
2119720	2123080	If you are playing mass effect on PC and want to talk to others through steam, you can do
2123080	2124080	that.
2124080	2126560	And so a good times, all that stuff at orange launch radio.com.
2126560	2128360	All right, let's get into gaming news.
2128360	2131480	There's been been quite a bit of gaming news this week, so Loki's going to start us off
2131480	2132480	tonight.
2132480	2134220	Um, so, uh, good news.
2134220	2138880	If you're an achievement whore, they're going to raise the gamer score allotments for Xbox
2138880	2139880	live arcade titles.
2139880	2144880	Now, right now it's currently 200, but that's going to double to 400, uh, with a maximum
2144880	2150200	of 30 achievements possible instead of 20 also, uh, downloadable content.
2150200	2157480	Um, they're going to allow, I guess, um, more, uh, gamer score to be added with, um, a hundred
2157480	2164360	or I guess a hundred with up to eight achievements allowed per quarter, um, with maximum of four
2164360	2165840	packs allowed over time.
2165840	2170400	So they're going to allow you to add a lot more gamer score to all that stuff.
2170400	2174120	And this will take a place, I guess, uh, it's going to start, uh, with titles coming out
2174120	2178520	between April 1st and May 31st.
2178520	2179520	I'm kind of surprised.
2179520	2184680	This is, uh, this is such a problem that there's so many restrictions for Microsoft's.
2184680	2188560	They're not retail partners, but you know, they're still, they're still going through
2188560	2190560	the entire Microsoft process.
2190560	2193800	And it's not like, it's not like indie games can throw in achievements or anything.
2193800	2197200	Just wait until indie games are allowed to throw in achievements.
2197200	2199020	I think that will always be off limits.
2199020	2203780	I think Microsoft has tried to kind of protect the achievement system a little bit, but they
2203780	2207000	do and they don't like in some ways they do, but in some ways they've been really lazy
2207000	2211040	about it because you know, there's some games like wasn't like the avatar, avatar, last
2211040	2212040	airbender.
2212040	2213040	Yeah.
2213040	2216640	The last airbender, not the, um, uh, blue people movie, but the avatar last airbender
2216640	2220160	apparently had just easy achievements where it's like literally press X as fast as you
2220160	2222180	can get a thousand gamer score.
2222180	2224080	Like really, really.
2224080	2227760	So some of it seems to kind of slip by, but otherwise, you know, Microsoft's been very
2227760	2232340	much about like, they don't, you know, they've, they've bombed people's scores to zero when
2232340	2234720	they suspect that they're like cheating and all this stuff.
2234720	2235720	Like they're very protective of it.
2235720	2240760	It's real easy to cheat if you want to, but it's, I mean, they're going to notice.
2240760	2243240	So you just don't do that.
2243240	2246720	Hey, look, I achieved all of my achievements in about five minutes.
2246720	2251800	And if it's not by avatar, then, uh, well, I mean, you can just, you just mod your, your,
2251800	2258080	uh, you know, actual, um, your user account on your system, and then you can add games
2258080	2261420	that you don't have never played and just give yourself a thousand achievement points.
2261420	2264880	But I mean, they're going to notice that, Oh, your, your gamer score jumped by a hundred
2264880	2265880	thousand.
2265880	2267440	That's a little odd.
2267440	2268440	I will never forget.
2268440	2272000	Speaking of getting banned by, from Xbox live because of achievements and all this stuff,
2272000	2276400	I will never forget the time I was playing dance, dance revolution universe on Xbox 360
2276400	2277480	for the first time.
2277480	2279920	And I got the message from strip club DJ.
2279920	2282520	Does anybody remember that name on Xbox 360?
2282520	2285320	He was the guy that had like the most points ever.
2285320	2288800	And like, he sent me a message like, are the achievements in that game are hard to get?
2288800	2293240	Apparently I was, I had bought the game on release day and I was playing it so much that
2293240	2295720	I had more achievement points than anybody on that game at that point.
2295720	2298040	And you could see that on some of the community sites.
2298040	2300240	So he was sending me messages like how hard are the achievements?
2300240	2303760	So like, you know, asking me questions, I'll just never forget that because that struck
2303760	2304760	me as funny.
2304760	2305760	So anyhow.
2305760	2310840	Well, what do you think though about the arcade games going up to 400 points?
2310840	2316560	It's you know, in some ways it's achievements, whatever, but in other ways, you know, since
2316560	2321680	the, the downloadable games are getting more expensive, they are becoming more richer,
2321680	2322680	richer experiences.
2322680	2325000	Like it's not, it's not ports of time pilot anymore.
2325000	2326000	Yeah.
2326000	2330880	You know, we're getting games like limbo and we're getting HD remixes.
2330880	2334680	Not the time pilots, a bad game, but yeah, now we're getting, you know, other stuff and
2334680	2339760	a lot of the greatest games to come out are download braid, you know, there's the portal
2339760	2342800	was a standalone game, you know, for download and stuff.
2342800	2346660	There's so much good stuff that, you know, it kind of deserves to be bumped up a little
2346660	2347660	bit, I think.
2347660	2349880	So, all right.
2349880	2350880	So there you go.
2350880	2356960	Uh, the achievement points are going to be going up, uh, what might be going up or down?
2356960	2357960	I don't know.
2357960	2361620	Is Capcom stock depending on a street fighter cross Tekken and how this has been received
2361620	2367520	and on the three 60 not so well, as we mentioned last week on the show, a four player co-op
2367520	2372700	mode is not on the three 60 version, even though it's there in the instruction manual
2372700	2376900	and it's there in the PlayStation three version, just so you know, that's when you and a friend
2376900	2383260	go online or you and a friend or local, you go online and take on another pair of people.
2383260	2388600	And uh, it was addressed by Tomaki Ayano, the assistant producer of the game in a Capcom
2388600	2392960	unity blog statement throughout the, excuse me, throughout the development process.
2392960	2396460	There are times when new features are added and we added a lot of them.
2396460	2400480	And there are also times where we have to make tough decisions regarding things to cut.
2400480	2403800	This was one of those times this mode is supported in the PlayStation three version.
2403800	2407760	However, since we tackled that earlier and found the architecture of their system to
2407760	2410720	be more conducive to implementing it.
2410720	2415880	So at first we thought they were full of shit because you know, there's other games that
2415880	2416880	you can play co-op.
2416880	2420600	Like it wasn't the first excuse you can't go co-op and go online.
2420600	2421600	Yeah.
2421600	2426200	But now it seems like a matter of it's too, it was too hard and we had deadlines to meet
2426200	2428760	or Sony paid us a lot of money.
2428760	2429760	I don't know if it's that.
2429760	2431960	Well, I mean, you never know if stranger things have happened.
2431960	2437560	That may be true, but then you should create a second manual for the Xbox three 60 version.
2437560	2441080	Still is saying, that's just poor, you know, Hey, uh, this mode's available.
2441080	2445760	Oh, but it's not, it really seems like to me it was a deadline thing.
2445760	2449400	But it's still very poor taste, it's false advertising.
2449400	2453520	I understand that, you know, that you had to work on all that DLC that was going to
2453520	2454520	be on disc.
2454520	2457040	So, you know, that might've taken some extra time.
2457040	2460880	I would have traded kick for comp mode.
2460880	2464720	It's really stupid that that's even, you know, Oh, it was too hard.
2464720	2467240	I don't know how to program well enough.
2467240	2468760	It was so hard.
2468760	2470000	I mean, come on.
2470000	2474880	I mean, this is something that's in a lot of games saying, you know, I think halo call,
2474880	2475880	I don't know about Call of Duty.
2475880	2479680	I know Borderlands had, you know, you can do split screen and then go online and play
2479680	2481240	with other people and stuff like that.
2481240	2483440	Moral combat had it.
2483440	2484720	It's just, that's ridiculous.
2484720	2486920	Oh, well, we didn't know how to do it.
2486920	2490720	Well, I'm sure if you asked Microsoft, Hey, how do you do this?
2490720	2492560	They would have probably told you how to do it.
2492560	2497080	Speaking of Microsoft allowing and not allowing things, frankly, I thought that was pretty
2497080	2501560	much a required feature for any co-op game to be certified and released for the three
2501560	2502560	60.
2502560	2504920	Uh, no, I don't, I don't think it was.
2504920	2507720	Um, I mean, I've seen, obviously not cause that happened.
2507720	2511320	I've seen plenty of games where you don't have to have cause sometimes, you know, doing
2511320	2518160	split screen, um, not every, there's not enough screen space after you split it in half.
2518160	2524720	Um, well, what I want to know is, you know, since this is not on the show role, um, so
2524720	2527800	what's everybody think about the doubt, their whole DLC plan?
2527800	2530600	Oh, I thought I was supposed to do that here too.
2530600	2531600	That's all right.
2531600	2532600	Yeah.
2532600	2535720	The DLC plan, uh, what, 20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall, right?
2535720	2536720	Yeah.
2536720	2539720	20 bucks for all 12 characters this fall.
2539720	2544760	Um, and they're going to have costume packs as well, which I think was another $13.
2544760	2548040	I want to say it's 13 different packs for a dollar or something like that.
2548040	2553200	Well, the release about it really felt like it was trying to butter up the community.
2553200	2557760	Like they knew that there was this big backlash about it and it really read to me like, Hey
2557760	2561200	guys, it's not going to be as bad as y'all were thinking.
2561200	2564720	LOL at you thinking it was going to be five bucks each character.
2564720	2565720	We're not doing that guys.
2565720	2568200	Oh no, we're not complete assholes this time.
2568200	2570360	We're just pretty big assholes.
2570360	2575340	You know, it's just there, there's still a percentage of us that we're not completely
2575340	2577960	assholes about this stuff.
2577960	2581720	And you know, that's, that's great and all that, you know, they're saying that it's going
2581720	2587320	to be $20 for, you know, all the characters, except there's a problem.
2587320	2593360	It's not all of the characters because you do remember that even though they are PlayStation
2593360	2601240	exclusive, you know, uh, Pac-Man and bad box art or troll mega man is, um, still on the
2601240	2603040	disc for an Xbox 360.
2603040	2605720	So that means there's still going to be one more piece of download content that they're
2605720	2610360	going to have available to, uh, you know, get access to those characters.
2610360	2611360	In fact, here we go.
2611360	2614240	I'm going to pull this up right now so we can, what'd you say last week?
2614240	2617640	Like Cole is on the 360 disc, which is ironic.
2617640	2623920	No, Cole's not on the 360 disc, but the Pac-Man and, um, uh, both Pac-Man and bad box art
2623920	2625920	mega man are on the disc.
2625920	2631400	Uh, so yeah, anyways, here's what it's going to end up being, uh, April 3rd, they're going
2631400	2633720	to have alternate costumes go on sale.
2633720	2639560	Those are going to set you back a dollar each, or you can buy all of them for $13.
2639560	2642480	Um, then they're going to release some free colors.
2642480	2643480	Oh, thank you.
2643480	2646960	There were, there were some free things they were trying to look at all this shit.
2646960	2651240	You're going to get for free costumes and gem slots.
2651240	2654760	And then this is the pay stuff, you know, characters free stuff.
2654760	2655760	Yeah.
2655760	2659720	And then, uh, I guess in April, they're also going to do a free tournament support update,
2659720	2664520	and they're going to be adding some, uh, three new assist gem packs.
2664520	2669640	So they're, I guess they're going to be selling those, um, or something, I don't know, um,
2669640	2674800	which a total of, uh, 60 gems to selection pool, I guess, um, but yeah, those 12 characters
2674800	2678480	already on disc will not be unlocked until the fall.
2678480	2682400	Meanwhile, hackers are already been playing with them online.
2682400	2687560	So wait, can I go online at three 16 and suddenly I'm playing against somebody who is Blanca
2687560	2688840	or one of the locked characters.
2688840	2689840	Yeah.
2689840	2693840	They basically, what they do is they, they swap all the assets and art and stuff like
2693840	2700200	that and character data for the DLC characters and they move it to one of the regular characters
2700200	2701200	in the game.
2701200	2702200	They kind of flip flop stuff.
2702200	2705240	So, uh, but yeah, fantastic.
2705240	2706240	And job cap.
2706240	2710000	Oh, and, and, and on top of all that, you know, cause you're going to have to pay $20
2710000	2713840	for that or you know what you get by the Vita version, which is probably gonna be like 40
2713840	2714840	bucks.
2714840	2716120	So it's cheaper and has more content.
2716120	2719120	Let me read some comments from a hit stun in our chat room at chat.org.com.
2719120	2722600	He has a lot to say on this hit stun says street fighter cross tech and online kind
2722600	2723600	of sucks anyway.
2723600	2724600	I'm glad I didn't buy it.
2724600	2725920	The game is clearly unfinished.
2725920	2726920	Wait until fall.
2726920	2727920	It'll be better.
2727920	2728920	$20.
2728920	2735640	I fucking called it, um, making this an $80 game, but I'm thinking not by fall.
2735640	2736640	Wait until fall.
2736640	2737640	Yeah.
2737640	2741320	Because in the world, cause the price will drop inevitably to try and get the extra sales
2741320	2746480	for Christmas and enough updates and the Vita version is going to be out.
2746480	2750280	And I'm telling you guys it's on the disc because they're going to repackage it and
2750280	2754800	just throw in codes that will allow people to unlock the characters for the 60 bucks.
2754800	2756560	You're going to get it for free in the fall.
2756560	2757560	Here's the thing too.
2757560	2762480	Remember how they said they're not going to do like a special, um, you know, arcade edition,
2762480	2763920	gold edition, whatever.
2763920	2767200	Let's just assume that they've sold quite a few copies.
2767200	2772200	I mean, we're going to say that they're going to sell a million copies probably on, um,
2772200	2773200	on each system.
2773200	2777680	Uh, let's just say, cause that, I mean, that's a pretty safe bet considering now to that.
2777680	2779200	So the greatest hits additional come out.
2779200	2783040	They won't really say anything, but it'll include the DLC characters on disc or something
2783040	2784040	like that.
2784040	2787760	And they'll, they'll drop the price cause they've done that with like what Call of Duty
2787760	2791880	just had a rerelease for black ops and modern warfare two with the DLC or at least the first
2791880	2793880	DLC pack, um, included with it.
2793880	2797280	Now I don't think it's on disc, but it's still code with it.
2797280	2799360	And I mean, midnight club LA has done that.
2799360	2801040	I mean, there's plenty of other games that have done that.
2801040	2806720	I think mass effect, um, had DLC on the disc, uh, for, or included at least a voucher or
2806720	2811520	something like that when it was re-released, so I could see them doing this.
2811520	2816000	I'm probably just going to get the Vita version to be honest, if I get it, I don't know at
2816000	2818400	this point as a, do I need another fighting game that badly?
2818400	2819960	Yeah, maybe not.
2819960	2826320	So do you think they got it out in this state in order to allow people to prep for Evo?
2826320	2829420	Give enough people to get it set so that it can be played as a part of Evo and people
2829420	2832840	to get their strategies down and actually learn the game to participate in it?
2832840	2836160	No, I think they just released the game now, so it would make this financial quarter.
2836160	2841480	I think that's, at the end of the day, they wanted it in this fiscal year.
2841480	2845480	I think the fan community doesn't mean shit in this circumstance, it's just a convenient
2845480	2846480	perk.
2846480	2849280	I think you're right about the fiscal year thing, because really, what have they had
2849280	2850900	during this last fiscal year?
2850900	2854800	They had Dead Rising 2, um, you know, off the record in that kind of thing.
2854800	2857200	The Resident Evil 3DS game.
2857200	2859320	Yeah, but that's a 3DS game.
2859320	2865360	I mean, I don't think that's, that's like a, that's kind of niche, that's not a big
2865360	2866360	revenue for them.
2866360	2870960	Um, you know, they didn't have any Resident Evil games.
2870960	2873960	There was no Resident Evil games last year.
2873960	2875400	Was it Gold Edition last year?
2875400	2876400	No, I don't...
2876400	2877400	What system?
2877400	2881600	It was Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.
2881600	2883020	I don't know if that was last year.
2883020	2885280	That may have been last March, but that was still a re-release.
2885280	2894120	Um, I guess they had Street Fighter, oh, Marvel, um, was it Marvel vs. Capcom 3, they had that.
2894120	2898280	But still, that, I don't think that did that, I mean, it did alright, but it wasn't like
2898280	2900280	big, big, big numbers.
2900280	2901720	I don't know.
2901720	2906480	Alright, well, we'll see, um, it'll be interesting when the sales numbers come out at the end
2906480	2907480	of the month.
2907480	2908480	I'm looking forward to seeing those.
2908480	2910320	Meanwhile, let's move on with some more gaming news.
2910320	2911320	Dark Soccer.
2911320	2914680	Well, this is hopefully something a little bit happier.
2914680	2917520	In fact, I want this more than I want a Vita.
2917520	2922760	I want it more than a 3DS, because I love everything Neo Geo.
2922760	2927480	And there's a new Neo Geo portable coming out, the Neo Geo X.
2927480	2933000	And it is going to come with 20 games already built into it.
2933000	2941160	And it's a 3.5 inch LCD screen with SD card expansion, AV output, and like I said, 20
2941160	2942160	games already included.
2942160	2945360	Which I probably own most of them.
2945360	2948640	Including Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars, Cyberlip, Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury Special,
2948640	2952640	Football Frenzy, Kingdom Monsters, The Last Resort, League Bowling, Magician Lord, awesome
2952640	2957800	Metal Slug, even more awesome, Mutation Nation, NAMM 1975, Samurai Shodowns, Sengoku Super
2957800	2963040	Sidekicks, King of Fighters 94, which was the best, Ultimate Eleven, Top Players, Golf,
2963040	2964520	and World Heroes.
2964520	2967280	But when is Windjammer is going to be available for it?
2967280	2968280	Really?
2968280	2970960	Oh man, I adore that game.
2970960	2973840	Baseball Stars is the saving grace in that list for me personally.
2973840	2977560	That was a, whenever I came across a multi-cap with that in it, I was pretty happy, but Windjammer
2977560	2978560	was so fun.
2978560	2979560	You know I have that game.
2979560	2980560	The cartridge.
2980560	2982720	I heard that.
2982720	2984680	It's fun.
2984680	2991200	So they don't have a price up on it yet, but it's going to be distributed by Tomo in North
2991200	2994520	America, and that's for the limited edition.
2994520	2999360	In Europe it will be released by Blaze.
2999360	3005620	It better be cheap, because I can tell you right now, that looks just like a reskin Dingu.
3005620	3006620	Because the Dingu...
3006620	3008200	The Dingu ate my baby!
3008200	3010640	Not that, not a Dingo, a Dingu.
3010640	3015560	A Dingu is basically, it was like an emulation device, and it had all the same features and
3015560	3018320	looked exactly the same as that.
3018320	3022680	And it played Neo Geo games, of course you have to have the ROMs form, but it played
3022680	3026680	Neo Geo games and it, I swear to God, the thing is just a Dingu.
3026680	3030080	It looks exactly the same.
3030080	3032240	And the Dingus, I think they're under $100.
3032240	3035760	So if that thing is over $100, eh, not worth it.
3035760	3038680	You can make the same argument for the FC Ultras, right?
3038680	3042640	The portable, what was it, SNES, NES, and I think maybe even Genesis in a more recent
3042640	3043640	version?
3043640	3046480	If you could put a Blackberry phone on it, would it be a Dinguberry?
3046480	3051000	No one wants to put a Blackberry phone on anything.
3051000	3054980	Cue sad trombone.
3054980	3060100	And to go back to what you were saying, you're curious about the sales for Street Fighter
3060100	3066560	Cross Tekken, the first week's sales, Street Fighter Cross Tekken in the US, $240,000 on
3066560	3070280	the PS3, and $117,000 on 360.
3070280	3075040	Oh, that's interesting that it's doing so much better on PlayStation 3, I guess the
3075040	3076040	word got out about the modes.
3076040	3079760	Well, considering that the PS3 seems to be the better version with more characters in
3079760	3082960	there, and it works, and it has all these features.
3082960	3084960	Interesting, okay, alright.
3084960	3087160	I also found out something really weird just now.
3087160	3088640	Those sound like good numbers though, yes Starfire.
3088640	3089640	That I hadn't realized.
3089640	3093000	Ragnarok Online is hitting their 10th anniversary.
3093000	3094000	Wow.
3094000	3095000	Old.
3095000	3096000	And it's still going.
3096000	3097000	Just saying.
3097000	3100000	And to celebrate the 10 year anniversary, they're banning everything.
3100000	3103000	It's older than well.
3103000	3107320	I apologize because I left the room for a quick minute, but are you going to get one
3107320	3109400	of these little Neo Geos?
3109400	3110400	I don't know.
3110400	3111400	I want one.
3111400	3112400	I don't know.
3112400	3114520	It sounds like a tiny screen.
3114520	3117580	Because I mean, seriously, all of the games on there, the ones that I would want to play
3117580	3122600	are ones that I likely already own either on Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket Color, or a
3122600	3123600	Neo Geo.
3123600	3126560	3.5 inches is the same size as an iPhone.
3126560	3129880	And iPhone isn't fun to play certain games on.
3129880	3130880	Certain games.
3130880	3132240	But this won't just be a touch screen.
3132240	3133240	Big difference.
3133240	3136720	Games that are designed for the iPhone are great on the iPhone.
3136720	3141680	Games that they try to port from frickin' Playstation to the iPhone are not so great.
3141680	3147600	It's okay with some of the arcade games, like X-Men played just fine, and Espa-ga-ba-ba-ba-bluda
3147600	3151200	too.
3151200	3154520	Robot Unicorn Attack plays really, really well on the iPhone.
3154520	3155680	See, that was made for the iPhone.
3155680	3156680	The Dingo doesn't...
3156680	3157680	No it wasn't.
3157680	3158680	It was made for Flash.
3158680	3159680	Oh yeah.
3159680	3163600	It almost looks like it could be an upgraded Dingo, because the Dingo doesn't have a 3.5
3163600	3164600	inch screen.
3164600	3171000	It's only 2.8 inches LCD, but I mean, it has the video out and everything, and it looks
3171000	3172600	goddamn the same, so...
3172600	3174160	It's a Super Dingo.
3174160	3176680	It could be a Super Dingo.
3176680	3178520	Alright.
3178520	3179920	More gaming news, Loki.
3179920	3183000	Alright, let's not talk about the Dingo anymore.
3183000	3184760	Quick before I make another bad joke.
3184760	3187080	God, we don't want to do that.
3187080	3191000	Baldur's Gate is coming back, and they're doing an enhanced edition.
3191000	3194340	It's going to be coming out this summer.
3194340	3202720	And of course Baldur's Gate was produced by Wizard of the Coast, or I should say Atari
3202720	3207220	is publishing it, but it's based off the D&D stuff.
3207220	3212280	And the enhanced edition is going to be kind of like an HD remake.
3212280	3216720	They're also talking that they may be doing Baldur's Gate 2 as well, which is kind of
3216720	3218000	neat.
3218000	3227280	But yeah, not much more I guess is kind of out about it right now, but it'll be pretty
3227280	3228280	cool.
3228280	3232080	Just to put it in perspective, these are some legendary PC games, and funny enough, I believe
3232080	3235840	the original was done by Bioware to kind of bring things full circle.
3235840	3239360	I don't think they own the rights anymore, I think that's why they're getting this now,
3239360	3243800	but yeah, I'm interested.
3243800	3249020	I remember vaguely playing the old ones briefly, but I never, I didn't play them start to finish,
3249020	3251900	so I'm definitely interested in this.
3251900	3252900	Take a second look.
3252900	3253900	What about you, Loki?
3253900	3254900	Is this something you might be interested in?
3254900	3256800	I never played the original, so meh.
3256800	3258920	Nah, not interested.
3258920	3259920	Alright.
3259920	3262240	Well, maybe this is something that will interest you, Loki.
3262240	3269520	I don't know if you're a fan of Diablo, but Diablo 3 finally, finally has a date, and
3269520	3272980	in case you've been living under a rock or something, and you don't ever check Twitter
3272980	3279960	because everybody was reporting it like it was news, May 15th 2012 is the date.
3279960	3283400	Let me tell you some other things maybe you may not have caught, you know, besides just
3283400	3284800	the date news.
3284800	3290000	It is an international launch, so the game is going to be available in many different
3290000	3293000	countries all at the exact same time.
3293000	3298060	You can digitally pre-order the game now, meaning I guess you download the whole darn
3298060	3302400	thing to your computer, you can pre-purchase it now, and you'll be ready to play when the
3302400	3303400	game goes live.
3303400	3304840	I'm just asking for someone to crack that.
3304840	3307240	Well, you know, Blizzard's done this before with some of their other games.
3307240	3311860	I think they leave a few crucial pieces of the puzzle out, because, you know, before
3311860	3315840	the game unlocks, you know, the launch day, you'll get a patch that's a couple megabytes.
3315840	3320240	So I think they conveniently leave some important things out, and don't forget, Diablo 3 is
3320240	3322820	going to require that constant online connection.
3322820	3324600	Very controversial.
3324600	3326720	So maybe that's part of how they're going to keep people out of it.
3326720	3328640	That all has to be cracked.
3328640	3329640	We'll see, we'll see.
3329640	3332480	Well, it was easy enough with the Ubisoft games.
3332480	3333480	Who knows?
3333480	3334480	Who knows?
3334480	3335480	Uh...
3335480	3336480	I don't think that's a very fair comparison.
3336480	3337480	Yeah, well...
3337480	3338480	Blizzard and Ubisoft.
3338480	3339480	They're not...
3339480	3340480	Well, see, here's the thing.
3340480	3342240	Blizzard's claiming, anyway, they're not doing it for DRM.
3342240	3343820	They're doing it for the...
3343820	3347000	They don't want people cloning the items and all that, like all the item distribution
3347000	3348680	is going through the servers and all that.
3348680	3349680	I'm just saying.
3349680	3350680	All right.
3350680	3351680	We'll see.
3351680	3352680	We'll see.
3352680	3353680	I know what they're saying.
3353680	3354680	Hackers gonna hack.
3354680	3357920	So we'll see if people get into this before May 15th, but it didn't happen with Starcraft
3357920	3358920	2.
3358920	3359920	I don't know.
3359920	3361440	Is that rule 35?
3361440	3362680	If it exists, it's hacked?
3362680	3364760	Yeah, well, you know the old saying, haters gonna hate.
3364760	3366100	It's just like, hackers gonna hack.
3366100	3367900	It's the same thing.
3367900	3371740	We always talk about this company says, this device is unhackable.
3371740	3372740	Hackers gonna hack.
3372740	3373740	Huh?
3373740	3375740	Master's gonna bait.
3375740	3377560	Yes, master's gonna bait.
3377560	3378560	Dingus gonna...
3378560	3381720	All right.
3381720	3385540	By the way, if you want to get your free copy of Diablo III for signing up for the World
3385540	3387240	of Warcraft Blood Pact.
3387240	3391080	Actually, they call it something else, annual pass or something, but basically you're signing
3391080	3396100	your life away to Blizzard saying, yes, Blizzard, I will pay you penance for a full year and
3396100	3398280	you will give me a flying horse.
3398280	3401520	You will give me a beta access to panda people, pandaria.
3401520	3403320	I want to sign up.
3403320	3405160	And you get your free copy of Diablo.
3405160	3409520	Well, Dark Soccer, if you want to sign up, you got to do it before May 1st, because that's
3409520	3413760	the day the deal is done and you will not be able to do that anymore.
3413760	3420320	Also, if you feel like it, you can get the collector's edition, $99.99 for Diablo III
3420320	3421320	collector's edition.
3421320	3424360	That would only be in stores though, just so you know, because it's kind of hard to
3424360	3426280	do a online collector's edition.
3426280	3427280	Yeah.
3427280	3430600	You can't download a specially crafted USB drive through your computer.
3430600	3433800	That would be a little difficult, but you could get fairy wings for your character,
3433800	3437160	which apparently is part of the deluxe pack-in collector's edition.
3437160	3438160	There you go.
3438160	3439160	All right.
3439160	3441960	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us next in gaming news?
3441960	3447920	Well, in other news, there is a very happy news for all of us Portal 2 fans.
3447920	3452200	They won the BAFTA for the British Academy.
3452200	3454560	My God, it's been a year and it's still winning awards.
3454560	3456240	Well, they beat out Skyrim.
3456240	3458240	Skyrim got nothing.
3458240	3459240	Wow.
3459240	3460240	Yeah.
3460240	3464560	So- For you, Portal 2, you go, Portal 2, and none
3464560	3470780	for Elder Scrolls V. Well, basically, the other, yeah, the big
3470780	3477440	rivals that it had was Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, and Deus Ex.
3477440	3488960	And it won, I believe, three awards for design, for story, and it looks like game of the year.
3488960	3495340	So as far as others that won, Battlefield 3 won the public vote, so it had the game
3495340	3500320	award of 2011, and the BAFTA for online multiplayer and audio.
3500320	3502840	But that's like the people's choice award, and you know, who-
3502840	3503840	But it's still-
3503840	3504840	Who watches that?
3504840	3506440	It's still, it's pretty, well-
3506440	3507440	I'm kidding.
3507440	3508440	It is a big deal.
3508440	3513080	But Portal 2, you know, I just think it's funny that Skyrim got nothing, and Deus Ex
3513080	3515440	also got nothing, which was supposed to be a pretty good game.
3515440	3516440	Oh, yeah.
3516440	3517440	Oh, yeah.
3517440	3519160	And, oh, it only took about five seconds, and there's your joke.
3519160	3523120	Sturlok says, Skyrim took an arrow to the knee.
3523120	3527160	No, no, no.
3527160	3528160	It deserves more.
3528160	3530880	The arrow to the dinghy in about a minute if you make that joke again.
3530880	3535800	It deserves more than them.
3535800	3541920	And Acidic Vampire, now this is a great joke, Acidic Vampire asks, was the award a potato?
3541920	3544280	A potato.
3544280	3547280	So here's what won.
3547280	3554180	Batman Arkham City won for action, artistic achievement was Rayman Origins, debut game
3554180	3555760	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet-
3555760	3558240	Oh, I heard a scoff over there on Rayman Origins.
3558240	3560920	All I have to say, play that on a Vita.
3560920	3561920	My god.
3561920	3563920	It is gorgeous.
3563920	3564920	Is so-
3564920	3567440	Portal 2 and best game.
3567440	3571960	Design was Portal 2, family was LittleBigPlanet 2, game innovation LittleBigPlanet 2, mobile
3571960	3579640	and handheld was PEGL HD, go fig, online browser was Monstermind, online multiplayer Battlefield
3579640	3580980	3.
3580980	3581980	This is cool.
3581980	3587520	Music, LA Noire, and performer Mark Hamill as the Joker, which was his last time playing
3587520	3588520	the Joker.
3588520	3589520	Yes.
3589520	3590520	In Arkham City.
3590520	3595960	For sports and fitness, Connect Sports 2, for story, Portal 2, strategy, Total War Shogun
3595960	3603200	2, BAFTA wants to watch award TikTok Toys, and game award of 2011 was Battlefield 3.
3603200	3608000	At least PopCap took mobile and not something by Zynga, I don't know what the eligibility
3608000	3611200	is, but I'm fine with PEGL winning a mobile award.
3611200	3616080	Now, apparently with Valve going up to the podium so many times and making speeches,
3616080	3621040	they actually dedicated one of their speeches to Bethesda, the makers of Skyrim.
3621040	3628240	It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal, you get nothing, you lose, good day
3628240	3629240	sir.
3629240	3632320	Well that's very unsportsmanlike of them, that was a pretty rude speech.
3632320	3634320	I love Gene Wilder.
3634320	3638680	I know, we're not hating on them, before you send in the angry, Skyrim is a good game,
3638680	3642120	you should not make fun of it, I know Skyrim is a good game, it's a great game, it's a
3642120	3647120	phenomenal game, it's a buggy as fuck game, but it's good.
3647120	3652220	It's just, for me, Portal 2, oh my god it was like perfect, so I'm happy to hear it's
3652220	3655000	winning all these awards, even overseas.
3655000	3660180	Alrighty, let's travel around the world and check out some games that might win awards
3660180	3665880	next year, or maybe not, let's see what releases are coming out this week around the world.
3665880	3667040	We'll start with the US, Loki.
3667040	3672000	Absolutely, no I'm just kidding, there's actually stuff coming out this week, Ninja Gaiden 3
3672000	3678280	on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, including there's even a fancy version that's not necessarily
3678280	3687600	made by Tecmo Koei, but it's from, was it, oh man I can't remember the publisher for
3687600	3688600	it.
3688600	3694920	Anyways, it just comes with this really cheesy move sword attachment that you can swing around
3694920	3701480	with because the target audience for Ninja Gaiden is going to be someone that's interested
3701480	3705920	in crap that attaches to your move controller, or even playing with the move controller in
3705920	3706920	that game.
3706920	3712200	Because we haven't had enough projectiles breaking TVs, now we have a mock sword to
3712200	3713600	do it with.
3713600	3714600	Exactly.
3714600	3715600	Recipe.
3715600	3721540	And then, of course, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
3721540	3726760	this week as well, a game called Gogo's Crazy Bones.
3726760	3732220	I'm guessing based off of a toy, I'm not really sure.
3732220	3736520	Let's see, we also have Dirt 3 The Complete Edition, which is going to be re-released
3736520	3744440	with Dirt 3 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Armored Core 5 on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360,
3744440	3751840	Silent Hill HD Collection on PS3 and 360, Pampered, or Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets
3751840	3753840	Resort for the 3DS, oooh!
3753840	3755840	Got it pre-ordered?
3755840	3758800	No, I don't have that one pre-ordered, but let's-
3758800	3763960	Please tell me more about what it, Pampered Pets, Polly picked a pack of pickled pepper
3763960	3764960	pampered pets-
3764960	3769400	It's Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort, it's where you put sunglasses and bows on,
3769400	3770400	like, animals.
3770400	3774400	Wasn't that a really bad episode of Pokemon?
3774400	3775960	There is an audience for this.
3775960	3781360	I just want to point out, this goes back to an argument, it's convenient we have a guest
3781360	3784360	on the show who hasn't been here for about 8 years, because I'm about to do an argument
3784360	3785960	that's about 5 years old.
3785960	3793840	It astounds me that we can get Polly's peppered pickled pals and pampering game, but we can't
3793840	3794840	get President Cat.
3794840	3798400	The fuck is wrong with this country?
3798400	3802200	It's this country, and that's what the fuck wrong with it.
3802200	3803200	That's not all.
3803200	3810480	In case Paws and Claws, Pampered Pets Resort is not for you, let's ride Best of Breed 3D
3810480	3811480	for the 3DS.
3811480	3812960	That's right, it is a horse racing.
3812960	3816280	Does that come with a move attachment in your butt?
3816280	3817280	It is not.
3817280	3819720	Let's ride.
3819720	3820720	For the Kinect-
3820720	3822680	Instead of friending your butt, it'll ride your butt.
3822680	3832600	Kinect Rush, a Disney Pixar adventure on the Xbox 360, and then of course, let's see, rounding
3832600	3838880	things out, Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai for the PC, and Kid Icarus Uprising
3838880	3840800	for the 3DS.
3840800	3843080	That's it.
3843080	3846560	Let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.
3846560	3848880	On the 3DS, there's a brand new 3DS.
3848880	3852600	Okay, it's not a reskin or anything like that, it's just a new color, but Cobalt Blue will
3852600	3858080	be available from March the 22nd in Japan, so if you want Cobalt Blue, there you go.
3858080	3863280	In Hikari Shinwa, Palutena no Kagami comes out on March 22nd in Japan.
3863280	3864280	Anyone know what that is?
3864280	3865280	Huh?
3865280	3866280	Huh?
3866280	3867280	That's-
3867280	3868280	That's Kid Icarus.
3868280	3869280	That is, that's their version of Kid Icarus.
3869280	3870280	So there you go.
3870280	3873080	Apparently, there's also some 3DSs coming out in pink and white.
3873080	3877240	I think those colors already exist, but now they will have Mario 3D Land as a pack-in
3877240	3878240	game.
3878240	3881960	So those will be out very soon on the 24th in Japan as well.
3881960	3885040	Let's go over to the Vita and see what the Vita's getting this week.
3885040	3887720	Little Busters, converted edition.
3887720	3889320	Is that like Little Deviants?
3889320	3890320	No.
3890320	3893120	That's definitely not Little Deviants.
3893120	3896280	These girls look like Deviants of a different sort.
3896280	3899120	But Little Busters is, you know, another one of those anime-
3899120	3901120	Dating sim!
3901120	3903080	Yeah, probably.
3903080	3906180	And let's see, what else is coming out?
3906180	3910760	Checking quickly on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
3910760	3912200	PlayStation 3, quite a bit.
3912200	3914440	Devil May Cry HD Collection.
3914440	3919360	Fallout New Vegas, the ultimate edition, Ninja Gaiden 3, regular and collector's edition.
3919360	3926160	A-to-Teki Yugi Mugen Souls comes out this week from Compile.
3926160	3927160	Wait a minute.
3927160	3928160	Compile!
3928160	3929160	Compile's back?
3929160	3932680	Compile never went away.
3932680	3935160	Who made Guardian Legend?
3935160	3936960	Compile?
3936960	3941400	I thought they were not around anymore, because that was the reason we weren't getting a new
3941400	3942800	Guardian Legend game.
3942800	3945500	You can get- Compile made other games.
3945500	3947160	I thought they broke up years ago.
3947160	3948800	Hold on, let me do some research.
3948800	3953960	I need to know if Compile is back and making this game, which actually looks kind of cute,
3953960	3958520	because it's like anime babes, but there's definitely like these action-y sequences,
3958520	3965800	and then there's this whole little like, uh-oh, you might see my naughty bits if they weren't
3965800	3967380	covered in secret tape.
3967380	3972320	They were famed for developing shooters and puzzle games such as Alest and Puyo Puyo.
3972320	3979680	Following the bankruptcy of Compile in two- okay, that was 2002, site was up until 2007,
3979680	3986480	where it redirected to Compile Station, owned by D4 Enterprise, Inc., and, uh, company spun
3986480	3992680	off Milestone that had arcade shoot-em-ups, and Compile Heart hopes to revive the Compile
3992680	3998640	brand name with the assistance of former Compile employees like Puyo Puyo creator Mu Nhatani.
3998640	4001960	Okay, so apparently Compile has been- And they made the Spriggan game.
4001960	4006680	Compile- I've heard of Compile Heart, so Compile has been to the moon and back, so, um, okay,
4006680	4008840	now- So bankruptcy wasn't necessarily the end of
4008840	4009840	the company.
4009840	4013720	Well, can I just, just for a moment, moment say, I'd like to please compile, if you're
4013720	4019040	listening, consider, you know, it's been what, 26 years and we're getting a new Kid Icarus
4019040	4020040	game?
4020040	4021040	I think the time has come for us to get a new Guardian Legend.
4021040	4022040	We need a new Gartic.
4022040	4023040	Gartic?
4023040	4024040	They need to- Gartic 3.
4024040	4025040	You know what they need to do?
4025040	4026040	What?
4026040	4029480	They need to release Gartic and Gartic 2, because we didn't get Gartic over here.
4029480	4030480	Right, no we didn't.
4030480	4031480	We got the second one as the Guardian Legend.
4031480	4032560	That's the MSX game, right?
4032560	4037920	So they need to do, like, the Gartic special edition, and then give us Gartic 3.
4037920	4040560	Oh, amen to that.
4040560	4043440	I will drop the President- I need to bust out that MSX emulator.
4043440	4046960	I will drop the President Cat thing right now for that.
4046960	4055760	I would give, um, a square inch of my flesh, probably from my left arm, in exchange for
4055760	4057260	Gartic 3.
4057260	4060160	I'm telling you, the Guardian, I know we talk about it a lot on this show, for those of
4060160	4063720	you that haven't heard a lot of OLR in the past, the Guardian Legend is, like, the greatest
4063720	4066280	8-bit game you probably missed.
4066280	4068320	But here's, like, the other big games that they did.
4068320	4069320	They did Xanac.
4069320	4070320	Oh yeah.
4070320	4073320	Alest, which, um, I have Robo-Alest.
4073320	4080400	Gunhead, Spriggan, and there's also the big Spriggan anime too, remember?
4080400	4085280	But they did that for PC Engine, and then there was, like, um, they did a few Dungeon
4085280	4091160	Crawlers, like I said, Pio Pio, and, uh, Golvalius, do you remember that?
4091160	4097520	They also did two pinball games for the TurboGrafx-16, can you guess what they were?
4097520	4098520	No what?
4098520	4100760	Wait, Tur- Alien Crush, and Devil's Crush.
4100760	4102920	Oh shit, those are some big games.
4102920	4112800	Blazing Lasers, uh, Choplifter, Ghostbusters, um, we said Gartic, uh, Lode Runner.
4112800	4115440	And this is all Wikipedia, so you know it's true.
4115440	4123760	Well, you can, they did M.U.S.H.A., uh, Power Strike, uh, R-Type, the Sega 3 R-Type, the
4123760	4124760	Mark 3, sorry.
4124760	4127280	This could be a compile lovefest all night long, but, what?
4127280	4128280	And, Shadowrun.
4128280	4129280	Oh wow.
4129280	4130280	Compile's great.
4130280	4134760	Anyway, so compile, now that you're back together, um, we have a new project you can
4134760	4135760	get on.
4135760	4136760	Gartic.
4136760	4137760	Gartic.
4137760	4141720	Alright, uh, 360, also gets the Devil May Cry HD collection, again this is Japan, don't
4141720	4146840	forget, the Kinect Rush, Disney Pixar Adventure, Ninja Gaiden 3, Collectors, and Regulars Edition.
4146840	4148640	There you go, let's go to the UK.
4148640	4151440	Uh, send me a ticket, I wish.
4151440	4162120	Okay, as far as stuff that's out in the UK, on the 21st is Rayman 3 HD, on the 22nd we
4162120	4167760	have Angry Birds Space for iPhone, Wing Commander Saga The Darkest Dawn, and yesterday, all
4167760	4170520	of the, um, the last two being on PC.
4170520	4176840	On the 23rd, Armored Core 5, Kid Icarus Uprising, Ninja Gaiden 3, Poke Park 2, Wonders Beyond,
4176840	4183240	Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City, and Total War Shogun 2, Fall of the Samurai.
4183240	4184240	Bleh.
4184240	4186120	Oh, that's it.
4186120	4191360	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the
4191360	4195880	week, but first, some stories on new things.
4195880	4199840	Alright, um, let's talk a little bit about Kickstarter.
4199840	4203520	I know, you're probably sick and tired of hearing about Kickstarter, but, you know,
4203520	4210360	Double Fine's Kickstarter just finished, um, with 3.3 million dollars.
4210360	4212960	That's a lot of money for Kickstarter.
4212960	4213960	And for them.
4213960	4219160	Um, but yes, uh, way more than they were hoping to get with the, you know, 400,000 being the
4219160	4220160	goal.
4220160	4225800	Um, and of course, you know, they're gonna be, uh, doing a lot of extra content because
4225800	4226800	of that.
4226800	4231960	Um, and of course, you know, Schaeffer, or Tim Schaeffer was quoted saying, I don't wanna
4231960	4234920	say this is the end of the whole game industry as we know it.
4234920	4241680	It's not, it's not, um, but, you know, it's nice that they don't necessarily need publishers
4241680	4246240	to make games like this, cause honestly, who would greenlight a public, you know, an adventure
4246240	4250320	game, an old school adventure game, um, nowadays.
4250320	4253200	It's something that they don't think would sell.
4253200	4257900	But I think also maybe success of these types of games might convince publishers that these
4257900	4259960	types of games still do alright.
4259960	4261440	Just kidding.
4261440	4267240	Um, and if you're looking, if you maybe missed out on the whole funding of the Double Fine
4267240	4270720	adventure and you're still wondering, hey, where can I throw my money for an extended
4270720	4276800	pre-order on something, uh, Wasteland 2 has a Kickstarter, um, going for it now.
4276800	4283320	Now Wasteland is kind of, I would say like the inspiration for the Fallout games, um,
4283320	4291400	they were hoping to raise, um, $900,000, uh, for, you know, their game and of course already
4291400	4296720	have hit that goal and then beyond that and they still have over, um, you know, almost
4296720	4305120	a month left to go and, uh, now of course, um, they're looking to, um, you know, see
4305120	4310720	if they've got, you know, they can reach $1.5 million and they're going to add more, um,
4310720	4312600	content to the game and that kind of stuff.
4312600	4318020	Also porting it to other, um, platforms like OSX and that kind of stuff.
4318020	4322220	So, um, you can check out Kickstarter for that and some other projects.
4322220	4328580	Hopefully though not contributing to the very vague, poorly misspelled, um, MMO project
4328580	4332280	from some strange millionaire who seriously looks like a cross between Jabba the Hutt
4332280	4337080	and Repus, so, uh, maybe avoid that one.
4337080	4348240	All right, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, Kickstarter, um, is this a trend we like seeing in gaming?
4348240	4355620	Um, I mean, it's, it's, I don't see why we, why we wouldn't like it.
4355620	4360160	I don't really see what the downside is other than, you mean, it's one of those things like
4360160	4362640	if you don't want to support it, then you don't support it.
4362640	4367000	It's no one's forcing you to do, you know, put down money for it.
4367000	4371240	However, I see a couple, you know, things that are kind of wrong with it.
4371240	4376200	I mean, cause one basically Kickstarter, a lot of it, people are contributing, not necessarily
4376200	4380160	because they support a project because they want the goodies that they get from, you know,
4380160	4381160	donating.
4381160	4384260	They have different levels of money that you put down and you get different rewards based
4384260	4385260	on that.
4385260	4387120	And that's what people want to do with it.
4387120	4392440	Um, you know, I know I've only contributed to one thing so far, which is, you know, a
4392440	4396680	video project done by Freddie Wong because I love all of his videos.
4396680	4401040	But you know, I get, you know, with that a, you know, Blu-ray copy of the movie, a signed
4401040	4404040	poster by the, you know, the cast and that kind of stuff.
4404040	4408720	So there are little things that are kind of neat from it, but at the same time I just
4408720	4411160	support, you know, the guy and his work and stuff.
4411160	4415360	But some of these, you know, games, a lot of the, um, things from the Kickstarter are
4415360	4417200	like, okay, you get a copy of the game.
4417200	4422260	So it's like a guaranteed sale right there, um, or guaranteed pre-sale if you will.
4422260	4426360	But some of them are like, you know, ridiculous amounts people are contributing, like $10,000
4426360	4429080	or, um, you know, a couple hundred dollars.
4429080	4435520	There's one I saw for a, uh, it's a third edition for some, like a book called High
4435520	4438040	Score, which is talking about classic games and stuff like that.
4438040	4439360	I have that book.
4439360	4441640	And they're trying to put out a third edition of it.
4441640	4448280	And for the $250 level, you can have dinner with a bunch of these like classic game people,
4448280	4456000	everyone from Peter Molyneaux to, uh, uh, what's his name, the guy behind the Sims series.
4456000	4457000	Will Wright.
4457000	4458000	Will Wright.
4458000	4459000	Yes.
4459000	4460000	You can have dinner with him.
4460000	4462960	Um, just a bunch of really, you know, classic developers.
4462960	4465040	Shit, I'd do that just for the experience maybe.
4465040	4466040	I don't know.
4466040	4467440	I'm a little eh on Kickstarter.
4467440	4471480	Like the only things that bugged me about it is a people need to realize Kickstarter
4471480	4478880	gets 5%, which I, I re they got out of money to they, what, Hey, America's about the capitalism.
4478880	4481720	They came up with a great idea and they're taking their share.
4481720	4482880	You can't fault him for that.
4482880	4487720	But like that, you know, I personally would not like to use Kickstarter for that reason.
4487720	4491520	But the other thing that, that really bugs me is that some of the projects, and I'm not
4491520	4496600	going to name names, but one in particular that I saw in there felt really ex exploitative
4496600	4497600	to me.
4497600	4503020	Like it was just exploiting for money for things that I would argue you don't need that
4503020	4504500	kind of money for.
4504500	4509120	And this type of record was being broken like 10 times over, which props to them for having
4509120	4512760	that kind of audience that would just give and give and give and give that kind of money.
4512760	4514080	That's that's wonderful.
4514080	4522560	Um, but I just think the money would be better spent on charity, but that's me.
4522560	4525920	I just think you have to be very careful about what you're donating to and think really hard
4525920	4526920	about it.
4526920	4527920	Think really hard about it.
4527920	4531880	But Rob, I would just always thought, you know, how much better would this show be if
4531880	4533680	we had a swanky office?
4533680	4536040	Not don't go there.
4536040	4537720	Don't don't start stuff.
4537720	4542320	I mean, I could just throw one of those up and say, who wants to support me?
4542320	4543960	And but that's, but you see, here's the thing.
4543960	4548080	As much as you could do that, that's when Kickstarter starts to get a little ridiculous.
4548080	4549080	You know what I mean?
4549080	4550080	It's easy.
4550080	4551080	That's the point.
4551080	4553760	It's the, uh, it's the online equivalent of standing out on the street corner with a tin
4553760	4556560	can begging for change.
4556560	4559200	I mean, I don't think any of us want to see it turn into that.
4559200	4562720	So yeah, I mean, here's what I would think.
4562720	4568840	And granted, I think it would be kind of cool to do a Kickstarter just for funding like
4568840	4569840	merchandise.
4569840	4574120	Cause a lot of times, like, you know, if you're merchandising for like even say like our show
4574120	4578320	or something like that, it costs money to make t-shirts and stuff and whether, you know,
4578320	4581080	that way it's almost like a pre-sale for merchandise.
4581080	4587800	You know, I mean, that would be the only intent for it, but, um, I don't know, that'd be the
4587800	4588800	only thing I could see.
4588800	4594920	You know, if you want to donate the proceeds, you could do that, but, um, I mean, that's
4594920	4599360	the only, cause I mean, you're basically using, that's what people use it for anyways, is
4599360	4601720	merchandise for a lot of it.
4601720	4606400	Um, and some of which I really wish I'd gotten in on, you know, like Cards Against Humanity.
4606400	4610720	Fuck, I love that game, but I really wish I had gotten in on that Kickstarter so I can
4610720	4613440	get full set of the cards.
4613440	4614840	Have you seen Ryan's custom pack?
4614840	4616760	Have you seen the pack that we play with at home?
4616760	4618280	Uh, the custom pack?
4618280	4619280	No.
4619280	4624040	It's, we, you, you know, the fact that they release the PDF of all of the cards in the
4624040	4625040	set.
4625040	4629880	We, um, and the whole reason why they do that is because if you missed what amounts to limited
4629880	4635240	scale printing and you are particularly savvy, Ryan printed up a pack of her own and we have
4635240	4639320	a bunch of custom ones that we made for our own purposes, a couple of custom blacks, and
4639320	4643840	then everybody that we know, like everybody that we could really throw in a good joke
4643840	4647000	about has their name on a card as well.
4647000	4651560	And she's happy to, you know, pay materials and then we'll get a deck out to you.
4651560	4655160	Well, no, we, I've printed my own and we've been playing with it, but it's weird though
4655160	4656560	cause they're like little crackers.
4656560	4659700	Yeah, she didn't, the PDF is in a really nasty square.
4659700	4663840	We made them general, like, uh, like actually apples to apple side cards because she knows
4663840	4665280	how to put it together to be able to do that kind of thing.
4665280	4668180	I would have done that, but you know, at the time I was under time, I had to print them
4668180	4673180	out and cut them up during watching a Rift Tracks version of Twilight.
4673180	4677320	So I had limited amount of time, I couldn't, you know, go tweak in the PDF and stuff, but
4677320	4678320	hey, who cares?
4678320	4679960	It's, you know, they're, they're fun to play with.
4679960	4681000	But yeah, that's what I'm saying.
4681000	4683440	There's a lot of that stuff on there that's really cool.
4683440	4688040	Um, you know, they have like a really elaborate Catan board one time, it was all laser etched
4688040	4692200	wood and stuff, but it was like $300 for a full fucking set.
4692200	4696000	But yeah, there's a lot of game projects on there that are worth, you know, supporting
4696000	4700320	if that's your thing, but also, like I said, crazy guy that looks like Jabba the Hutt and
4700320	4701320	a rapist.
4701320	4706880	Um, you know, there's a bunch of people on there that maybe I shouldn't support him.
4706880	4707880	I mean, the guy had...
4707880	4709480	You also said that on Bobby's show, so...
4709480	4711080	I just want to nail it home.
4711080	4713240	He looks like Jabba the Hutt crossed with a rapist.
4713240	4716880	The OLR podcasters, podcastees have no idea what you're talking about if they didn't listen
4716880	4717880	to Bobby's show this week.
4717880	4719160	I think I mentioned it earlier.
4719160	4721960	There's a guy who won the lottery.
4721960	4728400	He won $43 million, and he wants to create an MMO created by gamers for gamers, blah
4728400	4729400	blah blah.
4729400	4731740	But the thing is, creating an MMO is really fucking hard.
4731740	4735960	This guy thinks that he can do it because he's played games for like 30 years, and,
4735960	4740520	you know, I hate to use a cliche of like, oh, he looks like a gamer, no, but I mean,
4740520	4743480	seriously, the guy looks like he just crawled out of his mom's basement.
4743480	4744480	I mean, just...
4744480	4745480	So kind.
4745480	4753520	But seriously, though, the thing about it, though, is if you look at it, there's no real
4753520	4754520	details to this.
4754520	4756560	He just keeps throwing out stuff.
4756560	4762740	Well, you will get a special mount at level one, and blah blah blah.
4762740	4765240	It's like, dude, you're talking about garbage.
4765240	4772400	I had a guy I used to deal with that had big ideas like this, and it was just like, dude,
4772400	4776200	you don't have the smarts or the means to do any of this stuff, so I think that people
4776200	4778860	are just pissing away money.
4778860	4787620	I know a lot of people are donating a dollar so that they can make fun of him on his actual
4787620	4790240	page and stuff, so I don't know.
4790240	4791560	Let me read some of the comments from chat room.
4791560	4795820	There's a lot of talk on this topic at chat.orangelandradio.com.
4795820	4797920	Tiger Claw says, C, Loki even agrees.
4797920	4799220	OLR needs a Kickstarter.
4799220	4800220	Think about it.
4800220	4803480	Better equipment, better mics, and maybe a tricaster?
4803480	4810120	Raginator says, do a Kickstarter project so we can experience OLR and 7.1 surround sound.
4810120	4816160	As nice as that is to think about, I'm going to be honest, I would feel guilty taking your
4816160	4823160	money if I couldn't guarantee that 100% of it went into improving the show directly for
4823160	4824960	you guys somehow.
4824960	4825960	And I don't know.
4825960	4829000	We'll think of ideas, I guess.
4829000	4831640	I'm sorry.
4831640	4835500	One idea I didn't think about before is the idea about funding the t-shirts or something
4835500	4838640	in advance would be a good idea, I have to admit.
4838640	4839640	So let me put it this way.
4839640	4840640	This is the one I was talking about.
4840640	4842360	It's called Your World.
4842360	4850940	It's a video game project by Elwood Bartlett, and he's got $20,000.
4850940	4852920	People are funding this already.
4852920	4858080	Of course, he's never going to hit the goal of $1.1 million, but it's fun.
4858080	4861360	People are going to throw it in, but here's some of his...
4861360	4863360	It's horribly misspelled, too.
4863360	4866160	Like here, pledge $100 or more.
4866160	4871880	Reward number one, two, and three, access to special VDOR selling items for those who
4871880	4874000	donated via Kickstarter.
4874000	4876560	Special authenticator to protect your account.
4876560	4879280	VDOR, spell check your goddamn shit.
4879280	4881280	I mean, seriously.
4881280	4882280	All right.
4882280	4883280	Other comments from chat.
4883280	4886280	Bochi Kawa says, Kickstarter really is just a way to funnel donations.
4886280	4888640	OLR would need one because of the listeners.
4888640	4892040	We are the ones that would support OLR, and we would be the ones to donate, but there's
4892040	4895640	a lot of Kickstarter projects that nobody has the slightest clue about, and someone
4895640	4899700	a couple thousand miles away would appreciate some money going to a thing they like.
4899700	4903720	Which Akdeft also kind of follows up with, we have already helped OLR before without
4903720	4904720	Kickstarter.
4904720	4905720	And that is very true.
4905720	4909540	You have to remember, remember my DIVA fit a few years ago when the computer broke?
4909540	4913760	The Orange Mountains Radio listeners sent a fucking new computer to us, and that is
4913760	4918720	like the best, one of the best thing, if not the best thing that has ever happened from
4918720	4919720	doing this show.
4919720	4924000	I mean, that just, I can't tell you how that felt to just be like, oh my God, they sent
4924000	4926560	a computer so we could continue to do the show.
4926560	4928680	It was just an amazing feeling.
4928680	4929680	Yeah.
4929680	4930680	So anyhow.
4930680	4937720	Really, all, all that we would have to do if anyone wanted to donate anything is just
4937720	4938720	set up a PayPal.
4938720	4940720	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4940720	4941720	Easy.
4941720	4942720	All right.
4942720	4947040	Last, last word on Kickstarter, anything?
4947040	4952560	I mean, I won't post a picture of the guy, I'm just saying, you know.
4952560	4953560	All right.
4953560	4954560	Uh, Jet Set Radio HD.
4954560	4955880	It didn't need anything to fund this.
4955880	4957760	Sega just finally decided to bring it out.
4957760	4958760	What a good idea.
4958760	4961520	So Jet Set Radio, everybody's been asking, what about the soundtrack?
4961520	4962760	Are we going to get to keep Rob Zombie?
4962760	4965080	Are we going to get to keep Chibomato?
4965080	4969600	The answer is no, but there's, okay, hold on.
4969600	4974700	It's not that bad because there will be about half of the tracks from the North American
4974700	4976240	version will stay in the game.
4976240	4978200	Same with the European version.
4978200	4982840	They did try to re-license the music, but of course, cost availability, some of these
4982840	4986200	labels that the music was originally on aren't even around anymore.
4986200	4988240	So it just couldn't happen.
4988240	4993400	Now all the Hideki Naganuma songs that were in the original, those stay, because those
4993400	4996180	were created for Sega, so of course those are staying.
4996180	4998680	There are a few licensed tracks that will return.
4998680	5004820	The Guitar Vader songs have been re-licensed, Electric Toothbrush, Reps, BB Rites, those
5004820	5007240	songs are coming back, and a few more.
5007240	5012720	So there will be some songs that are going to return in the Jet Set Radio HD, but Rob
5012720	5016320	Zombie, Chibomato, those songs will not be coming back.
5016320	5017420	But I still think that's pretty cool.
5017420	5021780	They got to salvage some of it, and at least it will retain that same feel.
5021780	5028600	Also don't forget, higher resolution, widescreen to play, 60 frames a second, and two analogs
5028600	5031680	sticks.
5031680	5033280	Jet Set Radio HD.
5033280	5034280	I know I'm excited.
5034280	5035280	How about you, Dark Sock?
5035280	5036280	Are you going to get this?
5036280	5040760	We might, but I'm also thinking about starting a Kickstarter for when I have a kid to see
5040760	5045200	who contributes the most money and wants to pay for the baby's name.
5045200	5048160	Oh my gosh, I don't, you can't sell that on Kickstarter.
5048160	5049160	Yes I can.
5049160	5050160	Oh no.
5050160	5052160	I can put it on eBay.
5052160	5053160	No.
5053160	5054160	Alright.
5054160	5055160	No.
5055160	5057280	Let's take a time back to when games were a lot simpler.
5057280	5058840	There was no Kickstarter.
5058840	5061160	Just blowing on the cartridge a lot.
5061160	5065040	This game sure involves blowing and sucking.
5065040	5067880	It's the classic game of the week, Dark Sakura.
5067880	5070440	It also involves farting stars.
5070440	5078920	And that is Kirby's Adventure, also known as, let's see, Hoshi no Kirby Yume no Izumi
5078920	5083200	no Monogatari, which was Kirby of the Stars, the story of the Fountain of Dreams.
5083200	5087400	Wait, if you listen really carefully, you can hear act-deaf squeaking all the way from
5087400	5088400	Mexico.
5088400	5089400	Because he loves Kirby, I know that.
5089400	5094280	I love the music, though.
5094280	5095840	This game just makes me happy.
5095840	5098080	It's a pink little puffball.
5098080	5102880	I'm so pissed off at Nintendo of America for what they do to poor Kirby.
5102880	5108120	They make him look angry in every, you get the Japanese version, Kirby's happy, hi, I'm
5108120	5109120	happy Kirby.
5109120	5112320	Anything in America comes out that's got Kirby's face on it.
5112320	5113320	Mean Kirby.
5113320	5114320	It's angsty.
5114320	5115320	It's hipster.
5115320	5120080	He was happy before he was angry.
5120080	5123520	What does he have to be angry about?
5123520	5125520	He's so cute.
5125520	5134000	So Kirby's Adventure was the second and last game that used Kirby's original design.
5134000	5137080	The first one was Kirby's Dreamland.
5137080	5139920	And also the first one that made him pink.
5139920	5143600	Because the first one he was black and white.
5143600	5146800	So yeah, this was a platformer.
5146800	5153280	It came out March 26, 1993 in Japan and came out in America on May 1, 1993 and in Europe
5153280	5155360	on December 1, 1993.
5155360	5158760	This came out when I was a junior in high school.
5158760	5163680	Actually no, I was a senior, nevermind.
5163680	5171160	Anyway, so it was super, super cute and it was actually out on, what?
5171160	5173560	Comments from chat.
5173560	5174560	Just move on.
5174560	5176560	It's not appropriate for me to repeat.
5176560	5177560	What?
5177560	5178560	No.
5178560	5179560	It's not appropriate for me to repeat.
5179560	5180560	Bitch.
5180560	5181560	Okay.
5181560	5182560	Addressed to the chatroom, not you.
5182560	5189640	So it came out on the virtual console on February 12, 2007 and in Europe on February 16, 2007
5189640	5193560	and in Japan on February 27, 2007, so we actually got it ahead of Japan.
5193560	5200800	And of course it was one of the 12 inch masterpieces that was given in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
5200800	5204320	There's also a 3D classics version on the eShop.
5204320	5210240	So basically the story, Kirby wakes up from his after lunch nap and he didn't have any
5210240	5211240	dreams.
5211240	5212240	What?
5212240	5213240	God it's awesome to be Kirby.
5213240	5214240	I'm just thinking.
5214240	5217520	He gets to take a CS to after lunch, it's great.
5217520	5222000	And he learned that King Dedede has stolen the star rod.
5222000	5223520	Fucker.
5223520	5227240	Which is the source of power to the fountain of dreams and he broke it into pieces.
5227240	5230240	So you have to go get it and you have to go to Wispy Woods.
5230240	5233000	And remember I had Kirby's Avalanche.
5233000	5234000	So when you...
5234000	5235000	Wispy Woods.
5235000	5236000	I know.
5236000	5243760	Paint Roller, Mr. Shine, Mr. Bright, Cracow, Heavy Mole and Meta Knight.
5243760	5247560	And one for himself, King Dedede had.
5247560	5251040	So basically you have to go through seven worlds, battle enemies, mini bosses, bosses
5251040	5253980	and you have to get the star rod put back together.
5253980	5256600	Now here's where it gets fun.
5256600	5257600	As we all know.
5257600	5258600	What?
5258600	5259600	Nothing.
5259600	5261640	Just this game makes me laugh.
5261640	5262640	It's cute.
5262640	5263640	It's adorable.
5263640	5267680	You're sitting over there saying names like King Dedede, he took the star rod and he broke
5267680	5268680	it up.
5268680	5273320	It's like I'm listening to a four year old describe something.
5273320	5274320	It's great.
5274320	5275320	No, I'm not.
5275320	5277080	Should I do my 12 year old girl voice?
5277080	5278080	Oh my God.
5278080	5279080	Yes please.
5279080	5282080	So anyway, the game's a platformer.
5282080	5284680	Shut up.
5284680	5289200	So you've got regular levels, a boss fight and a warp star door.
5289200	5294520	You guys, King Dedede took the star rod and broke it.
5294520	5296080	Oh noes.
5296080	5298040	You sound extra gay.
5298040	5301080	Just letting you know.
5301080	5302080	Not like a 12 year old girl.
5302080	5305400	Sorry, that was my impression of the Kony guy in the videos that are on TMZ.
5305400	5308160	Ugh, I'm so sick of that.
5308160	5315040	Anyway he can run and jump and he can attack and dodge enemies by side tackling and he
5315040	5320240	can fly by inflating himself, meaning he holds his breath until he floats into the air and
5320240	5323380	then he can basically get as high as he can.
5323380	5325240	He gets high y'all.
5325240	5326960	You gotta be high to enjoy this game.
5326960	5327960	Shut up.
5327960	5328960	This game's awesome.
5328960	5329960	Oh it is.
5329960	5330960	It is.
5330960	5331960	I'm on TV.
5331960	5332960	You need an STFU right now.
5332960	5333960	Let me finish.
5333960	5334960	But when he's flying he can't use his other abilities.
5334960	5340520	He can exhale and this puff of air after he exhales, apparently he has death breath.
5340520	5344000	Cause when he goes...
5344000	5347720	Enemies die.
5347720	5352000	And anyway, his big ability is that he can inhale.
5352000	5358320	So he sucks enemies and objects into his mouth and then it stays into his mouth until he
5358320	5364240	spits them out.
5364240	5365240	I quit.
5365240	5366240	I quit.
5366240	5367240	Bye.
5367240	5368240	No.
5368240	5369240	Let me finish.
5369240	5370240	God you people are dirty.
5370240	5372240	It's a game for six...
5372240	5373240	Look.
5373240	5377840	UFO catcher Kirby.
5377840	5380240	He's fucking fat.
5380240	5381240	He's a fat bitch.
5381240	5382240	Anyway.
5382240	5383240	But fluffy.
5383240	5390240	So anyway, he can spit them right back out and do damage or he can swallow them.
5390240	5391240	He swallows or spits.
5391240	5392240	There, I said it.
5392240	5393240	Are you happy?
5393240	5394240	Yes.
5394240	5397680	Rob is red in the face.
5397680	5401000	He is as red as my shirt, y'all.
5401000	5404000	But he can swallow them too and he copies their abilities.
5404000	5407440	Like he can spit fire if he swallows something that spits fire.
5407440	5411480	So he swallows them and absorbs their DNA a little bit?
5411480	5417420	He can also use his drop ability, but he can't inhale anything while he has a special ability.
5417420	5425560	So when he uses up the special ability, he farts a star or he poops a star.
5425560	5427760	So I like the flying bouncy star.
5427760	5428760	The special power-up.
5428760	5434660	It's just, it's so cute.
5434660	5437000	So actually I'm going to read a quote on here about the visuals.
5437000	5438000	This came from IGN.
5438000	5444080	By 1993, the programmers of the world have learned to unleash every last ounce of power
5444080	5447320	hidden inside the original Nintendo system.
5447320	5451600	Mario's Adventure was one of those late generation games and probably the best of them.
5451600	5459640	So basically this had, you know, pseudo 3D, different visual effects, it had rotation,
5459640	5463680	parallax scrolling, six megabit game, it was the largest, one of the largest games ever
5463680	5465340	came out on the NES.
5465340	5470620	And I do believe this was the last game that came out on the NES.
5470620	5471620	Next to last.
5471620	5472620	Next to last.
5472620	5473620	Wario Woods.
5473620	5474620	Wario Woods.
5474620	5475620	Yeah.
5475620	5477520	Wario Woods was in the box, by the way.
5477520	5479900	So yeah, there were different remakes.
5479900	5484920	Don't bring box into this or I'm only going to laugh harder.
5484920	5489140	Do not make me redownload the Vuvuzela app, okay?
5489140	5493860	So now this was re-released on the Game Boy Advance and it was called Kirby Nightmare
5493860	5496000	in Dreamland.
5496000	5504260	And the name that it came out as in Japan was Hoshino Kirby Yume no Izumi Deluxe, which
5504260	5509000	was Kirby of the Stars, the Fountain of Dreams deluxe block, there you go.
5509000	5513800	The Nightmare in Dreamland had cooperative two to four players, so you could play as
5513800	5516700	different colored kirpies.
5516700	5518920	It had really good reviews.
5518920	5525140	It was given a 9.5 out of 10 by EGM.
5525140	5527900	GameSpot gave it 7.3 out of 10.
5527900	5530180	So it's been- Fuck GameSpot!
5530180	5531980	I know, right?
5531980	5537860	Also, this is a little bit interesting, there's a French version of the game in Canada, which
5537860	5544660	makes this the only French-only NES released in North America.
5544660	5545660	Le Kirby.
5545660	5546660	Le Kirby.
5546660	5554260	The, um, also the soundtrack was released in Japan on July 21st, 1994, and had vocals
5554260	5559460	by Mako Miyata in the story.
5559460	5563540	This is the first game that I know of that actually has a pinball spinoff, and it was
5563540	5567620	actually my first Kirby game was Kirby's Pinball for the Game Boy.
5567620	5569260	Was that on Game Boy Basic?
5569260	5570260	Yes.
5570260	5572340	What about the Pokemon pinball game, was that on-
5572340	5573340	That wasn't before Color.
5573340	5574340	That was Game Boy Color, yes, yeah.
5574340	5580300	You know, the first pinball game that I ever played on a handheld was, or on a console,
5580300	5585260	and I'm con- including handhelds, was Gator's Revenge on the old Game Boy.
5585260	5588220	Yeah, I was gonna say, that was the first, that was my first pinball game too.
5588220	5593460	Uh, although I think I rented Pinball's Quest before, or Pinball Quest before that, but
5593460	5594460	anyway.
5594460	5595460	Pinbot was also great.
5595460	5598460	Well, one thing that was funny is that when we had a pinball party at the house, we had
5598460	5599460	a jackpot in the house.
5599460	5603260	No, we had Ride-A-Pinbot dancing up the nest with Pinbot right next to it.
5603260	5604260	Nice.
5604260	5605260	Yeah, it was pretty funny.
5605260	5606260	Um.
5606260	5607260	Okay.
5607260	5609800	We need a new, like, not to distract from Kirby and the cute music that's in the background,
5609800	5613940	but we could use, like, a great new pinball game from Nintendo, because they gave us some
5613940	5614940	awesome ones.
5614940	5618300	There was the Kirby one, even though it was PAL, but it's a second party.
5618300	5623020	Uh, there was the Metroid pinball game was great, the Pokemon pinball games were outstanding,
5623020	5624020	I love that game.
5624020	5625420	A rumble pack and a Game Boy cartridge.
5625420	5626620	Yeah, it was great.
5626620	5627620	So we need a new one.
5627620	5632220	You know what, I want that new, um, well, it's not new new anymore, but the Kirby game
5632220	5636100	that came out on, um, DS.
5636100	5637780	That's like, it's like ten Kirbys.
5637780	5638980	You can borrow it if you want.
5638980	5640300	I would love to borrow it.
5640300	5642500	It's the Kirby draw one, where you can and I have it.
5642500	5644020	Yeah, I really wanted to play that.
5644020	5645020	You can borrow it.
5645020	5646020	I ain't playing it.
5646020	5647020	Alright.
5647020	5648020	Thank you.
5648020	5649020	You're welcome.
5649020	5650020	See, something good came of all that laughter.
5650020	5651020	See?
5651020	5652020	Laughter brings healing.
5652020	5653020	Rob's no longer bright red.
5653020	5654020	Alright.
5654020	5656020	We'll have to calm down a little bit.
5656020	5657020	Alright.
5657020	5658020	Plenty more OLR to come.
5658020	5659020	We're not done yet.
5659020	5660900	We've got, uh, more news coming at you.
5660900	5664620	We're gonna talk about some really controversial things in the next half, so you wanna stick
5664620	5668020	with this and, uh, get your say in in our chat room if you're listening live.

5680020	5681020	Oh.
5681020	5682020	Just kidding.
5682020	5683020	Oh, I was gonna say.
5683020	5684020	That's news to me.
5684020	5685020	Who knows what other surprises.
5685020	5686020	It was a surprise for 450, Rob.
5686020	5688300	Who knows what other surprises Dark Soccer has in store.
5688300	5697980	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5697980	5700260	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5700260	5706940	Live on this Saturday evening, March the 18th of 2012, with the 450th episode of our show.
5706940	5709380	And we're gonna get back into some gaming news here in just a little bit.
5709380	5712980	Hope you all had a good St. Patrick's Day, those of you that, you know, decided to do
5712980	5713980	something.
5713980	5716500	I don't know if it's just because, like, I'm getting old now or whatever, but I didn't
5716500	5717620	really do anything yesterday.
5717620	5721700	Did you guys do anything to kind of celebrate, like, you know, going out to the bars and
5721700	5725180	getting blitzed was awesome when I was 21, but now, like, last night I was like, I'm
5725180	5726180	too tired.
5726180	5730020	I got woken up by bagpipes for the first time in my life, as far as I'm aware.
5730020	5731020	Oh, that's right.
5731020	5732020	Because you were in San Francisco.
5732020	5733540	You were right by the Metreon.
5733540	5734540	Yes.
5734540	5737260	There was a huge parade taking place down Market Street.
5737260	5740500	I was just right on 4th with an earshot of the Metreon.
5740500	5746140	And there were a lot of air horns, screams, bagpipes, the occasional siren, and probably
5746140	5747140	some other sounds.
5747140	5749820	I was too tired to actually parse at the time.
5749820	5752620	The only instrument that sounds like cattle being beaten to death?
5752620	5756220	Hey, now, don't hate.
5756220	5757220	I like bagpipes.
5757220	5760620	But anyway, let's talk Metreon, because you reminded me you were right by there.
5760620	5763940	Remember when the Metreon used to be, like, nerd heaven?
5763940	5768580	Remember when the Metreon actually had something more than just a movie theater in five or
5768580	5769580	six?
5769580	5771740	Did you know that the Metreon had gone through some changes?
5771740	5772740	No.
5772740	5778900	It was very surprising coming out here, because I heard of all of these, like, classic video
5778900	5783020	gaming staples that I was in the immediate vicinity of that aren't there anymore.
5783020	5787460	Pier 39 doesn't have, Mel told me what the place was called, I completely forgot what
5787460	5788460	it was all of a sudden.
5788460	5790780	I forgot what it was called, I just remembered the DDR tournament we did live from there,
5790780	5791780	and that was a good time.
5791780	5792780	Yeah, the Pier 39.
5792780	5793780	B3.
5793780	5797660	B3 was the tournament, but I don't remember the name of the arcade.
5797660	5798660	Man.
5798660	5799660	Pier 39 had a nice place.
5799660	5805380	Metreon was, as best as I understand, like, the original DDR tournament location.
5805380	5810620	When there was a, whether it did or didn't have the first US DDR arcade, it was kind
5810620	5811620	of the staple of everything.
5811620	5814500	My first DDR tournament was at the Metreon, yeah.
5814500	5815500	Yeah.
5815500	5819180	So tell me about, in Metreon, you know, this isn't just about music games, but Metreon
5819180	5823060	was the home of the Sony store, the official Sony store, for a long, long time.
5823060	5827340	So tell me about not knowing any of this, and what you felt when you walked into the
5827340	5830540	Metreon for the first time in eight years.
5830540	5831540	For the first time ever, in my case.
5831540	5832540	Oh, oh, yes.
5832540	5833540	We didn't go there.
5833540	5834540	Oh, okay.
5834540	5839900	No, the Metreon, it's, it's, I kind of expected it as soon as I looked outside, walked up
5839900	5842900	the, walked down the street towards it and saw what was going on.
5842900	5845460	There's a huge chunk of the Metreon that's just closed off, because apparently they're
5845460	5847500	renovating like well over half of it.
5847500	5851660	So you go in on the ground floor, and there was just a food court and a couple of places
5851660	5856660	there, and it directed you to the, there were ticket booths for the IMAX there, and then
5856660	5860860	there were stairs escalators in the elevator to get up there to go see a movie.
5860860	5861860	And that's...
5861860	5862860	Oh, they didn't even have the crane games?
5862860	5866060	I saw Nightmare Before Christmas there twice.
5866060	5868460	There might have been something in the movie theater, I saw a couple of machines.
5868460	5869460	It's an IMAX.
5869460	5870460	Yeah.
5870460	5873660	Well, in the, on the third floor, that's where the tilt used to be, and then, then for the
5873660	5878220	longest time, there was just nothing but crane games in the, like, space next to it.
5878220	5879220	Interesting.
5879220	5880220	That's all.
5880220	5883340	If there was anything in there, it was probably those, here, get a, get a thing of candy,
5883340	5886140	a winner every time, something ridiculously basic.
5886140	5889980	A rumor is that Target is going into Metreon, which actually, well, that actually would
5889980	5892580	be a big deal, because in San Francisco proper, there's no Target.
5892580	5896420	The closest Target is in, um, Daly City, which is a little bit south.
5896420	5899180	Anyway, uh, go to our chat, I'm at chat.orangelandtrady.com.
5899180	5900940	We have Porkchop is in our chat room tonight.
5900940	5905940	Porkchop is Irish, as in Ireland, as in staying up until three in the morning to listen to
5905940	5906940	this show.
5906940	5908540	And Porkchop says, I'm Irish, and I did nothing.
5908540	5910420	It's a gigantic mess.
5910420	5912020	I, I can't say I blame you.
5912020	5913020	I did the same thing.
5913020	5917260	Uh, Technus in our chat room says, isn't Pier 39 a tourist trap now in San Francisco?
5917260	5918260	It always was.
5918260	5919260	It always was.
5919260	5920940	Or am I thinking of something totally different?
5920940	5922420	No, it's just, it, it hasn't changed.
5922420	5926460	It always has been a giant tourist trap, but I will say this, the fresh donuts, I hope
5926460	5927460	those are still there.
5927460	5928460	Yes.
5928460	5929460	It smells the donuts.
5929460	5933260	There was that little donut bag stand, which I was very tempted to do if I hadn't eaten
5933260	5934580	just before going there.
5934580	5935580	Fucking amazing.
5935580	5936580	I probably should have done it anyways.
5936580	5938540	They smelled so good each time I walked by.
5938540	5939540	Oh God.
5939540	5940540	Oh God.
5940540	5941540	In the cookie place.
5941540	5943980	I had friends from Connecticut that wanted me to send them donuts from Pier 39.
5943980	5945820	Oh, in the chocolate place.
5945820	5948340	It's like all kinds of chocolate and it has the boost chocolate.
5948340	5949780	Did you go to the saltwater taffy store?
5949780	5951140	No, I did not.
5951140	5954820	They have- I passed through a whole bunch of stuff and stepped inside and looked at
5954820	5956660	a couple of places, but no, I didn't get in there.
5956660	5962540	My two favorite places actually is Treasure Isle, the, uh, the big Celtic store and the
5962540	5963540	sock store.
5963540	5964540	All right.
5964540	5968540	Well, we could reminisce about San Francisco and memories and when the metronome was cool
5968540	5969540	and all that.
5969540	5971860	Although it is still a good place to see movies, so I'll give it that.
5971860	5976100	Um, I know you didn't end up doing that, but the, uh, the little nature and Martin Luther
5976100	5979460	King Memorial Outdoors was actually really nice walk.
5979460	5980460	Really cool park in the back.
5980460	5985180	The weather held up enough that walking around town was, was not, you know, miserable being
5985180	5987140	rained on, being blown over, anything like that.
5987140	5989980	And that was a, it's a, it's a really nice little property in the middle there.
5989980	5991620	Moscone, Yerba Buena, and all those.
5991620	5992620	Yeah.
5992620	5993620	Yeah.
5993620	5994620	All right.
5994620	5996300	Well, let's move on back to some games, uh, as much as we can talk about the outdoors.
5996300	6001540	Let's get back to some video games with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories that,
6001540	6003140	uh, don't fit in anywhere else.
6003140	6004260	All right.
6004260	6006620	Let's talk about Ridiculous Bundles.
6006620	6013420	Um, Steel Battalion, known for, you know, it's not exactly cheap prices, um, in the
6013420	6021860	past, but they have a brand new, um, I guess it's available in Japan right now, um, for
6021860	6028900	35,000 yen or 420 US dollars, uh, via Capcom's online shop.
6028900	6037180	You can get a Steel Battalion, um, bundle that includes a backpack, um, a helmet, a
6037180	6045860	jacket, patches, uh, soundtrack to the game, and, uh, I believe an art book.
6045860	6046860	That's right.
6046860	6052140	You can dress up like the character in the game with an actual helmet and looks like
6052140	6056260	bomber jackets, um, for $400.
6056260	6061020	It's a little ridiculous, but then again, they used to have a $200 controller.
6061020	6067340	I bought Dan the full controller when it was $300 for the old one.
6067340	6070460	I mean, that's something that was kinda necessary.
6070460	6073020	It has the huge red button.
6073020	6074300	I love the eject button.
6074300	6075300	That was pretty fun.
6075300	6079060	Now, could you play the game without that controller?
6079060	6080060	I don't know.
6080060	6081060	You're the wrong guy.
6081060	6082540	Actually, I think that you could.
6082540	6085340	If you could, it was a very stripped down experience, needless to say.
6085340	6086340	Yeah.
6086340	6092780	Also, they also made, um, made, uh, mods for the full unit to make it a more compact unit.
6092780	6096460	But did they make any mods to make the compact unit as it was a huge unit, like a battle
6096460	6097460	tech booth?
6097460	6099760	We're talking about units.
6099760	6102340	By the way, you know who has two of those controllers now?
6102340	6103340	You.
6103340	6104340	Yep.
6104340	6105340	Yeah.
6105340	6110160	Uh, Skyrim's gonna be getting another update pretty soon, a 1.5 patch that's gonna add
6110160	6114700	a bunch of kill cams for things that don't have kill cams right now, including ranged
6114700	6119020	attacks, also, um, melee, or, or magic spells.
6119020	6124220	And they're gonna be adding some new melee combat, um, moves and animations as well.
6124220	6126960	So it's, uh, kind of enhancing a bunch of stuff.
6126960	6128820	More ways to decapitate people.
6128820	6129820	Hooray!
6129820	6130820	Exactly!
6130820	6131820	It sounds awesome.
6131820	6135620	And also, they're gonna be, um, you know, adding some fixes, hopefully, once again,
6135620	6143540	to that stupid blood on the ice goddamn mission or quest that I'm on that doesn't fucking
6143540	6144540	work.
6144540	6150700	So they're gonna try to fix it again, and, and props to Bethesda's blog for allowing
6150700	6154780	me to put in my age, you know how, you know, you have the age gate or whatever.
6154780	6156900	Happy 130th birthday, Loki!
6156900	6157900	I know!
6157900	6161780	Let's just, like, the 1800s, it's, like, awesome.
6161780	6168020	Uh, but yeah, so they're gonna be fixing some other bug stuff, um, as well on top of the
6168020	6169020	added features.
6169020	6172180	But hey, all that's for free!
6172180	6174660	So suck it, Capcom!
6174660	6176740	Free shit, it's awesome.
6176740	6182820	Um, and then, last but not least, uh, God of War has a demake that's available on PC,
6182820	6184220	if you wanna check it out.
6184220	6191940	It is, uh, the Bit of War, and it looks like, almost like Rygar or something, um, but, uh,
6191940	6198980	yeah, 8-bit demake, and it's available on the website armlessoctopus.com.
6198980	6202620	But really, when you think about it, if an octopus doesn't have any arms, how can it
6202620	6204620	really be an octopus?
6204620	6208220	Just saying.
6208220	6212700	I can't even put together in my head what that would make it, uh...
6212700	6216300	I mean, I can think of other, eight other things it could possibly have, but that's
6216300	6219820	just, that's just inappropriate, okay?
6219820	6220820	Inappropriate.
6220820	6221820	Alright.
6221820	6223320	That never happens here.
6223320	6224320	Moving on?
6224320	6225320	Moving on.
6225320	6228300	Um, an 8-bit MMO is set to be released.
6228300	6229300	That's actually the name of it.
6229300	6230300	8-bit MMO.
6230300	6231300	Um, kinda interesting.
6231300	6235300	It, it's, I looked at the trailer, and it struck me as kinda Minecraft-y, in that it's
6235300	6240580	very, like, create your own environment, but it's an MMO where the users create everything.
6240580	6241580	It's all user-generated.
6241580	6246220	They have what's called a grief protection system that's supposed to protect your stuff
6246220	6251060	from getting fucked up, um, so, it's under construction, you can actually play it now,
6251060	6252060	it's free.
6252060	6255140	8bitmmo.net, and some people are having a lot of fun with that.
6255140	6260540	Um, a fan-made Wing Commander game is gonna be allowed to go forward.
6260540	6263880	This is actually kind of a surprise, usually, uh, companies kinda put the clamp down on
6263880	6270020	things like this, but EA is allowing the creators of Wing Commander Saga Darkest Dawn to move
6270020	6271020	forward.
6271020	6274420	However, EA does not officially or unofficially endorse the game.
6274420	6280180	They had to clarify that, uh, they did get the lawyers and everything to sign off of
6280180	6282180	them, so that's, um, kind of shocking, but.
6282180	6286020	So unfortunately that means you're not gonna get a Wing Commander remake any time soon.
6286020	6290100	Yeah, that doesn't bode well for official Wing Commander stuff, but hey, this fan thing
6290100	6291560	sounds like it's gonna be awesome.
6291560	6293300	It's free, first off, yay!
6293300	6299940	Uh, 50 missions, 2 campaigns, 60 voice actors, I wanna be a voice actor, uh, dozens of Terran
6299940	6303420	and Kilrathi spaceships, 70 cutscenes.
6303420	6305380	It takes place after Wing Commander 3.
6305380	6308660	Uh, I'm assuming it's gonna pretend that that movie never existed.
6308660	6313740	Cause if you're a true fan, you're just gonna ignore that movie.
6313740	6316380	Who has actually seen that movie in full here?
6316380	6322420	I've seen parts, and all I remember is Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard of Scream fame.
6322420	6329860	I, I'm very ashamed to admit this, but long going far away, no, no, I've never spent a
6329860	6330860	dime on it.
6330860	6334940	Um, long going far away, it was like the weekend Fox movie or whatever.
6334940	6338220	I was having an absolutely lazy day and I can honestly say I watched the thing from
6338220	6342180	start to finish and I really wish I couldn't.
6342180	6347840	I prefer to think of Matthew Lillard from Hacker's fame.
6347840	6349020	That upgrades his status.
6349020	6352220	Just like, uh, Johnny Lee Miller who would next be seen in Dark Shadows.
6352220	6354180	It's gonna be awesome, alright.
6354180	6357740	Anyhow, which by the way, internet, stop hating on the Dark Shadows trailer.
6357740	6358740	Stop it.
6358740	6359800	It's weird.
6359800	6362460	It's weird but it's suppo- okay, if you look at it as like-
6362460	6363460	Is it Tim Burton?
6363460	6364460	I mean, cause it's-
6364460	6365460	Oh yeah, it's Tim Burton.
6365460	6366460	Okay, yeah, that makes sense then.
6366460	6370980	The old show was a little bit cheesy and it's all 70s and stuff cause it's supposed to be
6370980	6371980	like the old show.
6371980	6377620	And in the context of the fact that right now everybody's all about Twilight and shit,
6377620	6378980	it's actually really funny.
6378980	6381100	Like I just- I don't know.
6381100	6382100	People need to let it go.
6382100	6383100	Alright, anyhow.
6383100	6386500	Uh, Rhythm Party, fun game on the Xbox 360.
6386500	6390300	If you're a Bamani fan, you probably haven't heard of this, which is strange to me because
6390300	6392340	it's right up a Bamani fan's alley.
6392340	6394140	It's a great Kinect game for Bamani.
6394140	6398420	I liked it way more than I thought I would, as I said previously on the show.
6398420	6399980	And there's some more DLC.
6399980	6404100	If you are sick of the song list being too tiny, you can get three new songs this week
6404100	6406580	in Rhythm Party song pack four.
6406580	6411260	The Sunbeam by Desrow is one song.
6411260	6415140	Inside Your Mind by Limahl.
6415140	6418580	Wasn't that the band that did the Neverending Story?
6418580	6419580	Yes it was.
6419580	6421740	That was the band that did the Neverending Story.
6421740	6425140	Now in Rhythm Party with Inside Your Mind.
6425140	6428460	I don't know if that's a new song or an old song or what because I only thought they ever
6428460	6429460	did one song.
6429460	6431140	But here's the third song.
6431140	6436300	If you've ever played Bamani games ever, you know this song.
6436300	6441660	Bag by Revenge is the third song that you can now play in Rhythm Party.
6441660	6443500	Yeah, Bag, what?
6443500	6445500	You hating on Bag over there?
6445500	6447900	It's just weird.
6447900	6450100	I think it's great.
6450100	6455140	I was actually trying to see if I had a clip of Bag.
6455140	6458260	Just for the people that don't know.
6458260	6460660	Where's my old music folder?
6460660	6462580	Speaking of being woken up by bagpipes.
6462580	6463580	Right?
6463580	6467940	It's kind of appropriate for the time of year, isn't it?
6467940	6470300	Perhaps that's exactly why they chose to release it this week.
6470300	6471300	Perhaps.
6471300	6472300	Perhaps.
6472300	6473300	What 2DX game was Bag in?
6473300	6474300	There it is.
6474300	6475300	Eight.
6475300	6476300	Or nine.
6476300	6477300	Wrong.
6477300	6478300	Ah, it's hard.
6478300	6479300	Here it is.
6479300	6480300	2DX.
6480300	6481300	I'm sorry.
6481300	6484300	Imagine flailing your arms and legs to this.
6484300	6494980	Now when did this come out, because this would be totally appropriate for like yesterday.
6494980	6495980	Tuesday.
6495980	6496980	It came out Tuesday.
6496980	6498140	Ah, well then perfect.
6498140	6499380	Totally appropriate for yesterday.
6499380	6500380	Yep.
6500380	6501380	So there you go.
6501380	6502380	Actually, you have to see this though quickly.
6502380	6506580	I know this is terrible radio, but let me show the YouTube here real quick.
6506580	6510500	Because somebody actually puts together the, it's not Konami, but some fan puts together
6510500	6514940	all the DLC stuff into these videos on YouTube.
6514940	6517420	And you have to see the animations for Bag.
6517420	6518780	They will blow your mind.
6518780	6519780	Hold on.
6519780	6520780	Here's.
6520780	6521780	Wait, that's inside your mind.
6521780	6522780	Here's Bag.
6522780	6526660	Like, look at all the little dancing sheep in the background.
6526660	6530780	And then as you're dancing, little bagpipes get attached to it.
6530780	6544100	I feel like an entire Beatles album just invaded my brain complete with LSD and George Harrison's
6544100	6545420	obsession with the sitar.
6545420	6546700	I had no look at this.
6546700	6550420	I have just been schooled on my eighties pop music by Zena Core in our chat room.
6550420	6552700	I seriously had no idea ever of this.
6552700	6556160	Zena Core says, Rob Limahl is the singer.
6556160	6560460	The band was nameless as far as anyone cares.
6560460	6564220	So it was a studio band or something that I had no idea, but well, if you want to know,
6564220	6565220	oh, I closed the window.
6565220	6566220	All right.
6566220	6567220	If you want to know the song, go YouTube it.
6567220	6568220	All right.
6568220	6570420	Uh, or download, download the pack already.
6570420	6572420	Dark Sakura, rapid fire news for us.
6572420	6576700	Uh, how about some stuff if I can get back to the window.
6576700	6577700	Okay.
6577700	6578700	Thank you.
6578700	6580300	Um, Sonic four is going away.
6580300	6585700	No more episodes after episode two and everyone cheers.
6585700	6587060	Yay.
6587060	6590260	Because it wasn't very good.
6590260	6592100	But maybe volume two will be better.
6592100	6600080	So next thing, rumor Shenmue one and two HD finished going to Xbox live arcade and PSN.
6600080	6605940	It's uh, an anonymous source reported it to gamerzines saying that it was going to be,
6605940	6609940	uh, it's been completed for over a year and it's pending release, but that doesn't say
6609940	6611940	it's true.
6611940	6616280	Rumor, which is a really good album rumors.
6616280	6619040	So how about some rock band, three tracks they're coming out.
6619040	6620380	How about it?
6620380	6625500	There will be, um, two tracks for men at work that will, uh, be in the rock band music store
6625500	6629980	overkill and down under and Carlos Santana's smooth.
6629980	6634380	Ooh, that should make some people need new pants.
6634380	6636660	And then, uh, not really that song got played out.
6636660	6639940	Well, yeah, but for people who like playing pro guitar mode.
6639940	6640940	Okay.
6640940	6641940	All right.
6641940	6642940	I'll give you that.
6642940	6643940	I'll give you that.
6643940	6646300	I can't imagine that would be kind of hot.
6646300	6650180	And um, so anyway, the tracks are going to be a buck 99 and there is of course, like
6650180	6658620	I said, pro upgrade available, um, for smooth for 99 cents or 80 Microsoft points, which
6658620	6662300	is funny because actually on the way up here, I was listening to the lonely Island and the
6662300	6666340	Santana DVX song came up and that song's funny.
6666340	6667340	All right.
6667340	6669460	We're going to transition back into some longer news here.
6669460	6670780	The mailbag is coming up in a minute.
6670780	6674940	A mailbag at orange on traded.com FUs of the week and your calls soon.
6674940	6676780	Uh, no frugal question this week.
6676780	6677780	Sorry.
6677780	6679220	I I'm going to be totally honest with an out of town guest.
6679220	6682220	I forgot to do it today, so, uh, we'll bring it back next week.
6682220	6683220	Sorry about that.
6683220	6684220	Loki.
6684220	6685220	All right.
6685220	6691660	Um, let's talk a little bit about mass effect and I mean, come on.
6691660	6696700	I mean, seriously, people that are fans of mass effect, this is a little ridiculous.
6696700	6703540	Um, apparently a mass effect three fan has complained about the ending of the game, but
6703540	6707140	didn't necessarily complain to Bioware or EA.
6707140	6715060	They complained to the federal trade commission and uh, yes, apparently a Bioware form user
6715060	6724480	named El Spico, uh, went to the FTC to file a false advertising complaint at EA and also
6724480	6732300	filed a complaint with the better business Bureau and you know, his, uh, you know, reasons
6732300	6736460	for it after reading through the list of promises about the ending of the game that they made
6736460	6739020	and their advertising campaign and PR interviews.
6739020	6742500	It was clear that the product we got did not live up to those claims.
6742500	6748060	This is not something, um, I was happy to do, but after the terrible ending that there
6748060	6752580	was no way, um, there was no way that the product had been advertised to me.
6752580	6758620	Um, and the lack of any kind of response from Bioware EA to address this, I felt this is
6758620	6761420	my only recourse.
6761420	6766760	And he'll be returning his copy before the end of the 30 days, uh, three a return policy.
6766760	6776580	If the ending has not been addressed by then, fucking really, I know people are stupid.
6776580	6778940	There was another, there was more recourse for him.
6778940	6788180	I didn't like any of the prequel movies for star Wars, but did I go up to, uh, George
6788180	6794020	Lucas when I was in the same room as him and demand my money back while I was eating meatloaf
6794020	6795020	prepared by his staff?
6795020	6798580	No, no, but they totally did that on clerks.
6798580	6799580	The animated series.
6799580	6800580	It was really fun.
6800580	6801580	That was great.
6801580	6807940	I want my $8 that show totally dates that show too.
6807940	6808940	It's only $8.
6808940	6813440	Uh, as far as video games though, having there been video games in the past that have had
6813440	6817740	shitty endings, like, um, I dunno, like ghouls and ghosts or, uh, you know, I was just watching
6817740	6820940	these Zelda two adventures of link long play through today.
6820940	6822140	That kind of had a shitty ending.
6822140	6827700	If you think about it, like the curtain falls before you can see Lincoln, Zelda kissing
6827700	6830860	or embracing or whatever it is they're doing bony boning.
6830860	6835460	So yeah, but look, okay, look, look, I'm not trying to compare like mass effect to Zelda,
6835460	6838940	the adventures of link, although both are great games and I don't know the ending of
6838940	6839940	mass effect three.
6839940	6843660	I am really trying to save myself because I am experiencing the games for the first
6843660	6847560	time, but I'm kind of thinking, okay, from what I've heard about it, the thing I've
6847560	6851860	heard or the way it's been explained to me without spoiling it is that mass effect is
6851860	6854380	very much about the story decisions you make on along the way.
6854380	6857860	And if you choose to go paragon or renegade or somewhere down the middle, and it really
6857860	6861980	seems like the ending kind of doesn't fucking care about how you played the game for the
6861980	6862980	past three games.
6862980	6867540	And so it sounds like kind of that disregard there really kind of irritated people so that
6867540	6872660	I can kind of see where it's irritating, but are people really letting the last 15 minutes
6872660	6875300	just totally like ruin the entire franchise for them?
6875300	6880020	Because like, even, even if the ending at this point is like, like just fucking goat's
6880020	6885540	a man comes out and chose me as asshole, like I'm still going to be like, the rest of the
6885540	6888260	game up until that point was so fucking rad.
6888260	6892020	I would still recommend this, you know, what happens is he ends up on a roof.
6892020	6897820	He calls tech support and they tell him to jump off the building in order to wake up.
6897820	6898820	What if that was the ending?
6898820	6899820	Then you'd be really pissed.
6899820	6906740	Hey, as long as it's got some cigarettes in there, I am all good.
6906740	6911580	But you know how many movies and how many TV shows or especially TV shows like, and
6911580	6914620	one I mentioned on Bobby show before it was the sopranos, right?
6914620	6917820	The sopranos was a hugely popular show on HBO.
6917820	6919580	Lots of people love this for seven seasons.
6919580	6922260	And then the ending was really bad.
6922260	6925260	Like I don't know if you guys know about the ending, but it was just fade to black.
6925260	6927060	It's just really bad ending.
6927060	6928380	It didn't ruin the series.
6928380	6934580	At least the ending isn't commander shepherd's son driving off with a tranny.
6934580	6936780	I'm sure a lot of people don't catch that reference.
6936780	6937860	That's from nip tuck.
6937860	6944380	That's the last episode is like, what actually the last season was kind of what yes, I watched
6944380	6946620	all of that series.
6946620	6948100	I don't know why.
6948100	6952680	So I mean, sometimes, and some people would say that battle star Galactica had a terrible
6952680	6953680	ending too.
6953680	6955100	I liked the ending of battle star Galactica.
6955100	6957740	I mean, there's only so many ways you get into show like that.
6957740	6961260	I thought it was a great ending, but you know, some people don't agree with that.
6961260	6967080	So the nice thing about mass effect is that they can release something for DLC later or,
6967080	6969180	you know, I know BioWare swears up and down.
6969180	6974740	It'll be the last game, but you guys like fucking really you're going to buy that right.
6974740	6976780	Halo three was going to be the last halo game.
6976780	6979020	Remember that, you know, there's ways they can do.
6979020	6983540	And I, you know, again, even if it ended with the entire universe imploding, like God came
6983540	6987720	down and smited everybody, whatever it is, that's so terrible.
6987720	6992500	Even if that happened, there's no reason they can't do prequels side stories.
6992500	6996820	You know, the characters before they joined up with shepherd or just in another part of
6996820	7001060	the galaxy or from the enemy's perspective, there's a million things they could do with
7001060	7002060	mass effect.
7002060	7005120	Still, even if they chose to go to another developer, granted, it probably won't be as
7005120	7008220	good if it's not a BioWare game, but you never know.
7008220	7010860	Once again, though, they can't give into this kind of bullshit.
7010860	7013500	This is the ending that you guys decided on.
7013500	7018140	Obviously there is much thought to the ending of a trilogy of a game series that's been
7018140	7020180	just this massive game.
7020180	7023420	Yeah, pun intended, I guess.
7023420	7029300	But you can't just give in because some people complain about the ending to something.
7029300	7031140	You can't please everybody.
7031140	7032140	And so what?
7032140	7034380	So you hated the ending of the game.
7034380	7035940	Well, that's that.
7035940	7041700	I mean, but if you give into this, then any game that you put out, both, you know, BioWare,
7041700	7046780	any publisher, you're gonna have people there like, I don't like the ending, I'm gonna complain
7046780	7050900	to the FTC, I'm gonna complain to the better business bureau because I need you guys to
7050900	7052460	change the ending to how I want it.
7052460	7054620	Well, no, I want the ending to be like this.
7054620	7055620	Fuck that.
7055620	7056620	You know what?
7056620	7060380	If you're so bent over the ending, just write some fan fiction or something.
7060380	7062020	That's what we used to do back in the day.
7062020	7065980	If we didn't like something, we fanfic'd it.
7065980	7067180	And we liked it.
7067180	7069860	Get off my lawn.
7069860	7074820	I seem to remember not liking any of the Stargate shit TV series endings.
7074820	7075820	You know what?
7075820	7079300	I loved Stargate all up until like midway through season 8.
7079300	7082180	That was right before the Ori, wasn't it?
7082180	7083980	Yeah, it was right after the replicants.
7083980	7084980	Yeah, yeah.
7084980	7086820	But did it ruin the first seven seasons?
7086820	7089380	Well, the first seven seasons did have some pretty crappy writing.
7089380	7090380	Alright, well, bad example.
7090380	7093980	But for the most part, for the most part, I looked back on them fondly.
7093980	7100300	I mean, I own seasons 1 through 8 box sets, so I can't say I didn't like it, but I found
7100300	7104420	myself wanting to change a number of things.
7104420	7109620	I think the reason why people are really mad to kind of get here is something I said earlier.
7109620	7113140	They could fix the ending through DLC, just like they did with Fallout.
7113140	7116700	And I think people feel like, ah, you had me by the balls here with a shitty ending
7116700	7121020	and you're going to make me pay 10 bucks to get the real ending, although you all know
7121020	7124620	you're going to YouTube it.
7124620	7128300	But half of all of this outcry everybody already has anyways.
7128300	7132740	And that part of it, I can sympathize a little bit with that.
7132740	7135780	That is kind of shitty to like force me to get more DLC.
7135780	7137820	They also, they change endings all the time and stuff.
7137820	7141820	I mean, look at, you know, for example, I Am Legend.
7141820	7147460	They're changing the end of that movie because they're going to make a sequel.
7147460	7151940	So let's just assume that they kill off Shepard or something like that at the end of Mass
7151940	7152940	Effect 3.
7152940	7153940	I have to say something.
7153940	7154940	I have to say something about I Am Legend.
7154940	7157500	They changed it from the original ending anyway.
7157500	7162980	Well, I can't believe that they changed Titanic, where now the boat's not going to sink, so
7162980	7163980	that way they can make a Titanic.
7163980	7164980	What?
7164980	7165980	I'm joking.
7165980	7172740	And it transforms into a 50-foot robot, 50-foot robot.
7172740	7176460	I don't, for the record, I don't care who the spoils were because the movie's been out
7176460	7181980	forever, but in I Am Legend, it turned out that all the vampire things, which I believe
7181980	7188460	was in the book, were all sentient and trying to rescue the one that he was keeping in captivity.
7188460	7189460	Yes.
7189460	7191180	They, they, they address that.
7191180	7192460	But they didn't end it that way.
7192460	7194220	Well, they did in the director's cut.
7194220	7195220	Well, okay.
7195220	7196220	The director's cut.
7196220	7197980	See, it would make sense to take that to go with.
7197980	7200220	Ooh, great point from Tiger Claw in the chat room.
7200220	7201220	Portal had its ending changed.
7201220	7202220	Portal 1.
7202220	7203220	It didn't have its ending changed.
7203220	7205220	It had its ending extended.
7205220	7206220	Enhanced.
7206220	7208460	Well, but it was an important scene.
7208460	7213100	It was just straight-up new content and console gamers, well, you heard the news.
7213100	7214660	What the, what am I thinking?
7214660	7219820	Yeah, that wasn't, that wasn't like, oh, GLaDOS didn't actually blow up.
7219820	7220820	For the record, actually.
7220820	7221820	I'm sorry to everybody.
7221820	7222940	I just spoiled that too.
7222940	7229740	For the record, the, it was actually texted into the, as the original ending, because
7229740	7238660	you can find a, a bit of programming code for party retrieval bot, and the little model
7238660	7241380	that they used for it was actually already in the game, because if you go into third
7241380	7244820	person mode, you can actually see whatever it is that's dragging her off.
7244820	7247820	And they had, all the, all the data was programmed in.
7247820	7249660	They just didn't use it.
7249660	7254820	So going back in with DLC, they were able to use the original ending that they had mined.
7254820	7255820	Just saying.
7255820	7262620	A lot of, a lot of stuff like that, this is why I, I don't ever look at any ending as
7262620	7268340	canon until they've said, that's it, you know.
7268340	7270420	Or until the studio goes out of business.
7270420	7272060	Or at least they have no choice.
7272060	7273620	That's why I have no more cube movies.
7273620	7278960	All right, well, anyhow, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this situation because my
7278960	7282500	thing would be all like, well, if you don't buy, if you don't like it, don't buy it, but
7282500	7284980	too late, you already bought it.
7284980	7291420	And I'd like to pitch, or I should say recommend a title based on your, your joke there, Titanic
7291420	7292900	2.
7292900	7300620	There is a game coming out very soon, actually, that is, oh, what the fuck is it called?
7300620	7303140	It's Titanic something.
7303140	7308740	It's basically the maiden voyage of the Titanic 2, and you're solving a mystery because there's
7308740	7310660	a bomb on the boat.
7310660	7311660	So it's like Titanic.
7311660	7312660	Is that like Speed 2?
7312660	7316180	It's like Speed 2 and Titanic 2.
7316180	7317580	It's Titanic Mystery, that's what it was.
7317580	7318580	Does Sandra Bullock be in it again?
7318580	7321740	All right, I think it's like Titanic Mystery is the name of the game.
7321740	7322740	We NDS.
7322740	7330540	All right, anyhow, I think we need to move on with more stories, but seriously, going
7330540	7335620	to the feds to complain about the ending, like, look at your life, look at your choices.
7335620	7336780	There's other things to be mad about.
7336780	7340820	There's some people that call the SWAT team on somebody if they're beating them in Call
7340820	7346740	of Duty, so I mean, they should be lucky it's just the feds, and they call in a nuke strike
7346740	7347740	or something.
7347740	7351620	Honestly, honestly, probably, you know the response that they're going to fucking get
7351620	7358180	from the feds is going to be, yeah, we're pretty upset about it too.
7358180	7360820	That's going to be the response that they get.
7360820	7364860	It's going to be chirp, chirp, chirp.
7364860	7367140	Yeah, we fucking hated the ending too.
7367140	7370540	All right, look, moving on.
7370540	7375380	Usually this game won't have a shitty ending, but I will say the TV series from what I understand
7375380	7379780	loves to do twists and turns and has been causing some fan controversy.
7379780	7381700	I have sadly not watched any.
7381700	7384780	I have not watched the show either, but I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7384780	7388940	I'm not big on the whole zombie stuff, but again, then again, apparently I misjudged
7388940	7392260	Mass Effect all these years ago, so someday I'm going to have to sit down and watch The
7392260	7397020	Walking Dead is a show that a lot of people are really into right now, and of course,
7397020	7400500	when something gets big, there's the inevitable game that comes out, and you may or may not
7400500	7402980	remember, Telltale is the ones doing the game.
7402980	7407620	Of course, Telltale does a lot of the adventure games, the Jurassic Park, you know, the Monkey
7407620	7409060	Island reboot and all that.
7409060	7413340	So The Walking Dead will be out in great Telltale fashion on every fucking platform you can
7413340	7414340	think of.
7414340	7417380	Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, PC, Mac, iOS.
7417380	7419140	First episodes coming out in April.
7419140	7421340	There will be five episodes in total.
7421340	7426180	They will each be regularly released after the first one comes out, so I don't know if
7426180	7428740	that's one a month, one every three months, whatever that's going to be.
7428740	7430740	Uh, there you go.
7430740	7435620	Telltale, the only company that understands episodic content and does it right.
7435620	7437620	Yeah, thanks Gabe Newell.
7437620	7440900	Oh yeah, right, because the Half-Life game.
7440900	7443540	Because he harped on, episodic content is the way of the future!
7443540	7445460	I see what you did there.
7445460	7447540	Although Steam is a great place to get these games.
7447540	7450180	Very true, that's where I have Back to the Future.
7450180	7454320	Walking Dead will also be available on Facebook!
7454320	7458540	Now it's not the Telltale game, don't get that confused, but here's the deal.
7458540	7467020	The social game developer RockYou is doing the Walking Dead social game, I'm sorry, published
7467020	7470340	by RockYou, developed at Eyes Wide Games.
7470340	7475100	You're going to set up and maintain base camps, you send out scouts to scavenge for supplies,
7475100	7477000	and there's also some combat naturally.
7477000	7478000	Now you know what would be cool?
7478000	7482100	I will say, this does, in theory, this would be a great game, like if I could have a little
7482100	7486240	zombie camp, and I could send zombies to destroy Dark Sakura's people.
7486240	7487240	That would be fun.
7487240	7488240	No, you couldn't do that, you know why?
7488240	7489240	I don't play Facebook games.
7489240	7495660	I'll click on it when you're not home, when you're not watching and logged in.
7495660	7496660	No way.
7496660	7499940	Fine, then who plays like every Facebook game that's out there?
7499940	7500940	Somebody I know.
7500940	7502900	People who aren't me.
7502900	7505020	Somebody I know on Facebook.
7505020	7508100	X-Link, X-Link will be playing it.
7508100	7510220	I'll kill X-Link's zombie camp.
7510220	7515260	Alright, Shane, Shane likes the Walking Dead, he'll be curious enough to try the game, and
7515260	7517260	I will destroy his people, it will be fun.
7517260	7518260	Alright.
7518260	7524180	Yes, Porkchop, there was a Dexter game that was mostly a point-and-click adventure, and
7524180	7528900	a kind of a 3D version of an old point-and-click adventure game.
7528900	7529900	Dexter the TV show?
7529900	7530900	Yeah.
7530900	7531900	Hmm.
7531900	7532900	It was, it was, it was okay.
7532900	7535580	It had a, it could have been longer, how about that?
7535580	7536580	You know what?
7536580	7537580	More than three or four cases.
7537580	7538580	Telltale did a CSI game.
7538580	7541180	That was another thing that they did, based on the show.
7541180	7545780	I hear, now I don't really, you know, I don't even watch the show, I just didn't have a
7545780	7549380	real big interest in the CSI game, but I hear it wasn't bad, so.
7549380	7550380	How old was it?
7550380	7551380	Wasn't that like, six?
7551380	7552380	Probably about five years ago.
7552380	7554700	I mean, the show's been on for what, nine years now?
7554700	7558500	I seem to remember that X-Play, or perhaps even Extended Play at the time, reviewed it
7558500	7562780	and said that it was not quite as polished as it should have been for such a, such an
7562780	7563820	investigative game.
7563820	7566060	I think I'm thinking about the same thing, I might be wrong.
7566060	7569020	Yes, but we can't always trust reviews, as we're gonna learn later in the show, that's
7569020	7570020	for sure.
7570020	7571020	Alright.
7571020	7574580	One thing we can trust is your emails, I think.
7574580	7578740	Every week you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungerated.com, and DarkSakura dives
7578740	7581820	in or sends her zombie squad in, to pull out the emails.
7581820	7583260	Eugh, sticky.
7583260	7584900	And read them here on the show.
7584900	7585900	It's a little sticky!
7585900	7588420	Mailbag at orangelaungerated.com.
7588420	7589420	That's not email.
7589420	7593380	Ugh, well, it would help if it would actually let me read it.
7593380	7595580	Ugh, come on.
7595580	7598580	Well, we'll just listen to that.
7598580	7599580	There we go!
7599580	7600580	Now it's working.
7600580	7601580	Now it's working.
7601580	7604260	Well, no, it wasn't letting me get to the screen, so whatever.
7604260	7605260	No problems.
7605260	7606260	Pfft.
7606260	7607260	Bitch.
7607260	7611820	So, um, greetings, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7611820	7615980	I know that you just added a new show segment, and I've been thinking of a new segment for
7615980	7617060	a while now.
7617060	7621500	I'm the guy who isn't keen on cursing, so in order to balance out the eff-us of the
7621500	7625260	week, what about the love-us of the week?
7625260	7626260	I'll start.
7626260	7631500	I have a big love-u to people who are genuinely friendly during disc golf games, and want
7631500	7633180	to help you become a better player.
7633180	7637860	Another example from Loki would be, would sound something like, a big love-u to Nintendo
7637860	7641980	for always going out on a limb to create new and exciting IPs without rehashing anything
7641980	7642980	prior.
7642980	7643980	This one he has for me.
7643980	7644980	Okay.
7644980	7648580	A big love-u to World of Warcraft for rainbow unicorns that make me feel shiny.
7648580	7654260	Rob, I have a love-u to all the podcasters who take the time to leave us good reviews
7654260	7656300	on iTunes and for listening to us every week.
7656300	7658740	I'm gonna verp from all the cuteness.
7658740	7661740	Your loyal turtle and fairly serious turtle.
7661740	7665380	We have done a thank you, I think is what we called it, but we have kind of done a thank
7665380	7666380	you of the week.
7666380	7674460	Um, you know, when we're feeling charitable, but it happens once in a great while, but
7674460	7680460	I do say a genuine love-u or thank-u to everybody that leaves us nice reviews on iTunes.
7680460	7687500	When I'm truly not in a pissy mood, I do nice things, you know, but I'm female.
7687500	7688500	I don't care.
7688500	7689500	I didn't even have to say it.
7689500	7690500	All right.
7690500	7697500	We are full of loving stuff for the two and a half hours.
7697500	7698500	Okay.
7698500	7701500	Um, this is from Rob.
7701500	7705700	The fabled art of video game exhibit at the Smithsonian is now open.
7705700	7711300	I haven't gone yet because all of the opening day talks were booked before I checked.
7711300	7715440	It is running during Otacon if people want to make the drive from Baltimore to DC.
7715440	7720700	In Baltimore, I like to take the Metro from I-95 in Greenbelt, Maryland rather than try
7720700	7722900	and park downtown.
7722900	7724540	If I lived there, I knew what that meant.
7724540	7727280	Oh, I think he's just giving people directions.
7727280	7731060	They have all these funny terms for roads out there that I've just like the greenbelt.
7731060	7733860	You don't, what's that?
7733860	7735860	He attached the letter from the Smithsonian.
7735860	7736860	Nice.
7736860	7738860	It says open now through September 30th.
7738860	7742520	It felt like this day would never come, but it finally did in the art of video games exhibition
7742520	7743520	is open to the public.
7743520	7747380	I hope you can make it to see the show in person, but if not, check out the photos of
7747380	7749500	the final installation on Flickr.
7749500	7751440	I actually really love to see that.
7751440	7755380	That's what it's Washington DC where it's the Smithsonian or derp.
7755380	7756380	Yeah, right.
7756380	7760680	Um, you know, you step out on the line and you see the, I didn't have like a traveling
7760680	7764980	Smithsonian dick that sits sticking out of the ground made of marble.
7764980	7767180	I've been to the Smithsonian before many years ago.
7767180	7768180	I was 17 years old.
7768180	7769180	You know what the big exhibit was?
7769180	7770180	You know what?
7770180	7773100	So was I, but you know what the big exhibit was the year I was there.
7773100	7778900	Uh, the Enola Gay, they had the actual plane, you know, that was used in world war two and
7778900	7781420	all that was very, very strange.
7781420	7783540	Did you say world of war two?
7783540	7784540	I said world war two.
7784540	7785540	I'm pretty sure.
7785540	7786540	All right.
7786540	7788420	Then I said world of war two and I meant to say world war two.
7788420	7789420	Anyhow.
7789420	7794700	Well, to finish, um, on here, it says, uh, one of the best parts of the exhibit exhibition
7794700	7798500	in my opinion is the interviews with video game artists, designers, developers, musicians,
7798500	7799500	writers, and scholars.
7799500	7801380	Um, yeah, that's pretty much the rest of it.
7801380	7802820	So yeah, pretty cool.
7802820	7808420	I, um, I don't have the link to, uh, the flicker on here, so I would suggest seeing if you
7808420	7810340	can find it.
7810340	7812220	And last email if you're ready.
7812220	7816780	Well, not into sports games and not interested in the canceled Ubisoft game.
7816780	7823820	For some reason, the pronunciation of Adidas, how you, you said Adidas.
7823820	7825300	The rest of the world says Adidas.
7825300	7826300	Adidas.
7826300	7828100	I've, I've, I've said Adidas before.
7828100	7829100	Okay.
7829100	7830420	Well, he said it sounded odd.
7830420	7832620	I'm more used to Adidas myself.
7832620	7834100	Where does the other pronunciation come from?
7834100	7835100	I'm sure I've heard of it.
7835100	7836100	Heard it that way before.
7836100	7840300	That comes from Robert M. Adidas was when they would call it was what the corn song
7840300	7841300	was called.
7841300	7842300	Yes.
7842300	7843300	All day.
7843300	7850980	I dream about, all right, forget it.
7850980	7855060	Like that's the one like rage metal song I'm going to admit to liking here on the show.
7855060	7858240	But yes, I used to have a college radio show back in the day and we'd play stuff like that.
7858240	7860860	So we, and the song was called Adidas.
7860860	7861980	Like that's how you pronounce it.
7861980	7865300	So now whenever I see that, like I can't help, but say it that way.
7865300	7869500	Even though I know everybody says the company is Adidas, but consider it a funny pun.
7869500	7873300	I don't know.
7873300	7874300	That's audible blinking.
7874300	7876100	You never heard the corn song.
7876100	7878980	I don't like corn.
7878980	7881580	Not even in a tortilla.
7881580	7882580	Actually I'm allergic to corn.
7882580	7883700	Did you know that?
7883700	7884700	Are you really?
7884700	7885700	No, I didn't.
7885700	7886700	I am allergic to corn.
7886700	7887700	I can have it.
7887700	7890100	The more processed it is, the easier I have a time having it, but pure corn will make
7890100	7892260	my lips swell and my throat itch.
7892260	7893260	All right.
7893260	7894260	Is that it for emails?
7894260	7895260	Yes.
7895260	7896340	Little known fact, everybody.
7896340	7898180	Now you know something about me.
7898180	7902460	Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.
7902460	7905980	I might say this name wrong here since I love pronouncing things wrong here on the show.
7905980	7910980	Delighter, Delitter, Delighter in our chat room says all day I dream about sex song of
7910980	7913500	my life.
7913500	7916420	You and every man and a lot of women too.
7916420	7917420	So there you go.
7917420	7918420	All right.
7918420	7921340	Time's nothing.
7921340	7922340	All right.
7922340	7926220	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7926220	7928900	Or if you want, the thank yous of the week.
7928900	7929900	Fuck that.
7929900	7938500	I mean, poo, poopy poo poo.
7938500	7945220	My FU goes towards, um, I'm still going to include daylight savings time as being involved
7945220	7950300	with this FU, but it goes for this crazy ass insomnia I've been having.
7950300	7953600	And then when I do fall asleep, of course I can't wake up in the morning.
7953600	7957940	I have been sleeping on average until noon.
7957940	7959060	Not on purpose.
7959060	7962340	If I don't set an alarm, I just won't wake up.
7962340	7964100	And Dan had to wake me up.
7964100	7969660	And then I found out that I was just really, I've just been really, really tired.
7969660	7971780	Just haven't been feeling great.
7971780	7974780	And even doing my yoga this morning didn't help.
7974780	7976740	Today has just been a day of exhaustion.
7976740	7983700	However, I would like to give a thank you to the SF Market on Florin Road in South Sac,
7983700	7987260	which is usually a very scary part of town, but I found something wonderful and delightful
7987260	7988260	there.
7988260	7994460	Apart from mochi and salt and a chocolate salt pokey.
7994460	7997580	They had Cafe Du Monde chicory coffee.
7997580	8002660	The only other place I've purchased this before was in New Orleans at the Cafe Du Monde.
8002660	8005260	So it just made me really homesick.
8005260	8009660	And the weather here today, the weird ass weather we've been having, reminds me of Alabama.
8009660	8010660	So I've been doubly homesick.
8010660	8015420	I really, really, really want to get back to Alabama and visit everybody before, you
8015420	8018700	know, everything blooms and the humid hits.
8018700	8020700	Very sad.
8020700	8021700	Loki.
8021700	8030340	Uh, I guess, uh, fuck you to the people, or I should say, I think it's the California
8030340	8035980	Transportation Department or something like that for not painting lines on the freeway
8035980	8037660	and scratching out.
8037660	8039820	There's like four sets of scratched out lines.
8039820	8042300	I don't know where the fuck the lanes are 50 on the way here.
8042300	8043300	Huh?
8043300	8044300	Oh my God.
8044300	8045300	In the rain.
8045300	8046300	It makes all the other lines transparent.
8046300	8050740	It's just like, I don't know where the fucking lanes are because they're just going and they
8050740	8051740	don't go straight.
8051740	8056860	Yeah, it's doing it on 82 where they're doing repaving on 80.
8056860	8061900	And when we had that really bad rain on Friday night, and I'm saying bad for California because
8061900	8063260	people in California don't know how to drive.
8063260	8064260	I know.
8064260	8065260	I know.
8065260	8071300	Um, coming from South Sac all the way on, um, from 99 to 80 was just torture.
8071300	8072780	So yeah, I, I get ya.
8072780	8075140	It's just like, I'm like, am I in the lane?
8075140	8076980	Which, which lines did I follow?
8076980	8077980	It's just ridiculous.
8077980	8078980	So fuck that.
8078980	8083460	Um, Jason, our guest, do you have anything you want to give angst to?
8083460	8088820	F you to California weather this weekend, this is a shitty weekend to visit.
8088820	8089820	I'm so sorry.
8089820	8091940	It's been, it's been rainy.
8091940	8094020	We drove through Hale on the way up here.
8094020	8095540	It's been windy as all hell.
8095540	8098540	It's been a, it's not fucking sunshine and beaches.
8098540	8100640	I left Alabama weather.
8100640	8102860	I left nice Colorado weather.
8102860	8106120	Like it was literally just cleaning up the day that I got on the bus and it's kind of
8106120	8109540	been miserable since we got here, including the actual bus trip out here.
8109540	8114420	Other than that, F you to the screens and God only knows what other sounds at all hours
8114420	8116420	of the night in downtown San Francisco.
8116420	8120860	I'm probably never going to get used to that, but you know, that's, that's pretty much it.
8120860	8121860	All right.
8121860	8125380	I will, I will indulge the email from earlier and I will start off tonight with a thank
8125380	8126380	you.
8126380	8131380	I would like to say thank you to the tortilla lady at Denio's farmers market because the
8131380	8133620	pumpkin tortillas are amazing.
8133620	8134620	So thank you.
8134620	8135620	Thank you.
8135620	8136620	Tortilla lady.
8136620	8142860	F you to the pistachio dude, because your pistachios kind of tastes like vinegar.
8142860	8143860	Serious stuff, guys.
8143860	8144860	Serious stuff.
8144860	8145860	All right.
8145860	8146860	Um, more gaming news.
8146860	8148780	Your calls are just a little bit away.
8148780	8150340	One eight seven seven game OLR, but not yet.
8150340	8151820	We still have some news, some big news.
8151820	8152820	Loki.
8152820	8153820	All right.
8153820	8159300	Let's uh, let's talk a little bit about, um, this kind of ties in a little bit with the
8159300	8162140	whole kickstart thing, but we'll get to that obsidian man.
8162140	8167500	They cannot catch a break this week, um, or even like it looks like the past year, but
8167500	8168780	let's start off with obsidian.
8168780	8172860	They've been hit with some layoffs and of course obsidian's working on the South Park
8172860	8176100	RPG that's going to be coming out, um, later this year.
8176100	8182660	They also worked out on a fallout new Vegas, so, um, and apparently they have had to let
8182660	8190960	go and they've, um, lost approximately 20 to 30 people and, um, they also have another
8190960	8192580	project canceled.
8192580	8196380	This time is supposed to be for a future next gen system, uh, which I believe is the new
8196380	8198580	Xbox system.
8198580	8205020	And uh, also I guess, um, you know, there are some people that let go of one that started,
8205020	8210620	uh, the day before and one that, you know, started the week before.
8210620	8215060	And um, so yeah, that, that kind of sucks.
8215060	8222100	Um, also they've had, uh, an Xbox Live Arcade title that they were working on, um, a new
8222100	8230100	original IP, uh, that has been put on hold as well and, uh, that kind of sucks.
8230100	8236180	Um, the other thing too, which, um, I didn't see, well, I think we'll get to it a little
8236180	8242340	bit later, but, um, they, uh, they may be going to a Kickstarter actually.
8242340	8243340	It's kind of cool.
8243340	8249300	There was this opinion piece that was written on Kotaku and it was kind of interesting talking
8249300	8253860	about Kickstarter and the fact that, you know, some of these studios just can't catch a break
8253860	8257840	because of all this publisher bullshit, whether the publisher's, you know, not greenlighting
8257840	8263100	something because it's a genre, like an old genre that they don't think is viable anymore,
8263100	8267780	or if it's just, you know, kind of this really experimental type of game or that kind of
8267780	8272140	stuff where that they can actually cut out the publishers if they go to Kickstarter and
8272140	8273580	get their projects funded.
8273580	8278580	Not only will it kind of get funded by Kickstarter, but the, especially lately with, like, these,
8278580	8283660	you know, Tim Schafer stuff and the whole, uh, Wasteland 2 thing, that, you know, it
8283660	8288160	gets a lot of press and people get, you know, you know, behind it, plus, you know, a lot
8288160	8293880	of this, you know, independent games, a lot of them are getting a lot of indie coverage
8293880	8298300	and, like, grassroots, you know, efforts through Facebook and Twitter and, you know, those
8298300	8302820	get picked up by, you know, the gaming blogs and whatnot.
8302820	8307700	So it's kind of interesting and, um, so I wonder if we will see a lot of people turning
8307700	8314500	to Kickstarter, especially some of these companies that are, like, can you imagine, like, if
8314500	8319380	Grin, for example, started some Kickstarters for different projects that they were working
8319380	8322580	on that would have been, well, I don't, obviously-
8322580	8324900	Oh, that new Strider game we talked about a couple weeks ago.
8324900	8329900	It's a silly Strider, but, you know, they could go to Kickstarter to, um, get some of
8329900	8334540	the stuff, well, I don't know if they would be able to pull out a Strider, but, um, you
8334540	8339420	know, make some really awesome games and maybe they would have been able to do some of that
8339420	8340420	stuff.
8340420	8344700	You know, it kind of sucks that they're working on a lot of good stuff, but, um, so yeah,
8344700	8349100	that's one good thing, I guess, that Kickstarter can provide is, you know, an avenue for some
8349100	8353660	of these game genres that publishers think are dead.
8353660	8355660	I love SSJ100Matt's idea in the chatroom.
8355660	8359200	We should do a list list of what Kickstarter game funds we would give money to.
8359200	8361980	We should have- we will do that in a future episode.
8361980	8367420	So, um, you kind of two different directions there, um, Obsidian, I want to start there,
8367420	8371620	um, good news or bad news for the South Park game, like, I was looking forward to it and
8371620	8375300	now I'm kind of like, uh-oh, I mean, hopefully it's far along in development where these
8375300	8376300	won't matter.
8376300	8379140	I don't think it's- I would think that they have a bigger team than 20 or 30 people working
8379140	8383420	on it, and it's not just programmers or developers and that, you know, it's not just programmers,
8383420	8384820	but it's just, like, kind of across the board.
8384820	8390860	They're just making cuts at the company, um, and I think we may touch on why they might
8390860	8395820	be making cuts on that stuff in a little bit, but, uh, it's just, you know, they have to
8395820	8397700	trim the fat, I guess.
8397700	8403540	Um, Kickstarter, um, again, kind of like we were saying earlier, there's just- there's
8403540	8407140	a lot I worry about with Kickstarter where it's just gonna be too much, it's gonna get
8407140	8411700	saturated and, you know, I don't think everybody needs to get on board with it, but I like
8411700	8413460	the comparison you give with the grand.
8413460	8417460	See, now, Kickstarter, I'm not sure exactly how it works, if it has- a project has to
8417460	8422860	be fully funded or not, because that one, the guy I was referring to as the Jabba the
8422860	8429980	Hutt Reapus guy, um, he quoted saying that they have to make 10 grand to get money.
8429980	8432740	They have to basically- 10 grand is the bottom limit.
8432740	8437980	I've seen some Kickstarters for $500, though, so I think it's just- I don't think Kickstarter
8437980	8438980	sets that.
8438980	8439980	I think they're setting it for their project.
8439980	8441660	Maybe it's a percentage or something, I don't know.
8441660	8442660	It could be.
8442660	8443660	Yeah, it could be.
8443660	8445660	It could be a certain percentage, depending on how much you get.
8445660	8450500	Alright, well, there's some more stories that somewhat tie into this, and one of them is
8450500	8457900	this interesting piece that's out there, and this is a particular piece that was on YouTube,
8457900	8463240	and then Kotaku wrote up an article on it that basically kind of went to talking about
8463240	8468700	these points about video game reviews, and the whole video just kind of, you know, it's
8468700	8473100	a lot of the stuff I think we've kind of heard before about the reviews are bought, basically.
8473100	8477620	I did watch the whole thing, and a lot of- I think there's some of their facts are straight,
8477620	8479860	some of them are kind of eh, you know.
8479860	8482000	Let me go through some of these bullets here.
8482000	8484940	Video game publishers see game reviewers as marketing tools.
8484940	8486260	Yes, that's absolutely true.
8486260	8489560	Well, they see game reviews as marketing tools, for sure.
8489560	8493060	Publishers sometimes allow positive reviews to be published before negative ones.
8493060	8494060	Absolutely.
8494060	8497300	Publishers sometimes require game reviewers to not mention certain plot or technical details
8497300	8499780	in exchange for being furnished with an advanced review copy.
8499780	8501140	That is fact, yes.
8501140	8503980	Publishers might not want to advertise on an outlet that slams their game.
8503980	8506160	Well, yeah, that makes sense.
8506160	8509660	Critics are often at a loss for insightful ways of describing what they found objectionable
8509660	8513540	about a game they don't like.
8513540	8515260	I can see that sometimes, yeah.
8515260	8518660	Yeah, I can too, based on the way some people react to it.
8518660	8521620	Reviews are banal checklists.
8521620	8523540	I think some are.
8523540	8528540	Especially ones not written by professional gamers.
8528540	8532700	I think a lot of the ones that you see, and I'm not slamming every, but a lot like in
8532700	8539020	the community newspapers and stuff, are the press release reworded.
8539020	8541420	Some that I've seen.
8541420	8544800	Game reviewers may not know that they're biased, but if they knew they were biased, would they
8544800	8546980	tell us?
8546980	8548980	I'm sure that they would, they have to seem unbiased.
8548980	8551420	I think some know they are biased, personally.
8551420	8554820	All these positive reviews from biased reviewers lead the public into accidentally playing
8554820	8559140	bad games.
8559140	8564620	Playing bad games or buying bad games, I think is, you know, I mean, so what?
8564620	8568620	If you play a bad game, it's not like you can, you know, contract herpes or something
8568620	8569620	like that.
8569620	8572100	I mean, I don't see, it's like, oh my God, I played a horrible game.
8572100	8574020	I need to, like, hide in the corner.
8574020	8575020	I mean, who cares?
8575020	8576460	So you play a bad game.
8576460	8577460	Brain herpes.
8577460	8581500	I mean, because someone, once again, it's someone's opinion, just because they like
8581500	8582940	it, doesn't mean you're necessarily gonna like it.
8582940	8586020	You remember the Gamefly commercials and the Epic Rage?
8586020	8587540	Oh yeah, it's stupid.
8587540	8589700	That's the point they're pushing in those commercials.
8589700	8591060	Here's the last one.
8591060	8596740	Legislators are happy when this mess results in pro-American games topping the charts.
8596740	8598420	I think that's a little much.
8598420	8599700	That seems a little much.
8599700	8601180	That's the stretch bullet right there.
8601180	8602900	That's the, we need to pad this up to one more.
8602900	8603900	Okay, here goes.
8603900	8604900	No, no.
8604900	8613980	Um, now, I, I think that whole embargo thing is starting to get overboard.
8613980	8618560	And I would really only trust a site that refuses to sign them, even if they get the
8618560	8619560	reviews late.
8619560	8622860	Like, that's one thing I'm happy, even though I don't have the time to play every game,
8622860	8626440	I don't do this for a living or whatever, I can give you my honest opinion on games
8626440	8632100	because we don't sign those, and we don't get these games for free, I mean, very, very
8632100	8634180	rarely have we gotten them for free.
8634180	8637820	And you know, we've spent our own money on them, so, you know, we can kind of tell you
8637820	8638820	from that perspective.
8638820	8641340	Got like two games from publishers.
8641340	8645260	Not that I'm saying OLR is the authority or that we're somehow better than all of the
8645260	8648340	rest of this, but I'm just saying, I like that, you know, because there's plenty of
8648340	8652260	other podcasters out there that are in the same boat, and that's why I kind of like hearing
8652260	8659100	the opinion of quote-unquote real people when it comes to games.
8659100	8660640	Let's also kind of take a step further.
8660640	8664460	There was another story this week that talked about how reviews can really be kind of screwing
8664460	8671100	up the industry, and that is this whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores.
8671100	8675460	Not user Metacritic scores, Metacritic scores from established critics.
8675460	8678780	And Obsidian was going to be, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you heard about this story,
8678780	8682460	but for Fallout New Vegas, Obsidian, you know, it wasn't Bethesda, it was Obsidian that kind
8682460	8687380	of did the port of it or whatever, did the, you know, newer, New Vegas part of it.
8687380	8693340	They would have been given a bonus if an 85 plus score was on Metacritic.
8693340	8697380	So if the game got an 85 plus on Metacritic, they would have got a big bonus.
8697380	8698380	You know what it got?
8698380	8704300	An 84 on Metacritic, and so no bonus.
8704300	8710740	Just the whole thing of paying or giving incentives for good reviews just totally makes me think
8710740	8711740	of the government.
8711740	8717320	And also, here's the other thing too, is Metacritic, how exactly, first off, how exactly do they
8717320	8720820	... who is an authorized person?
8720820	8723940	Who is an actual, like, site reviewer or whatever like that?
8723940	8727420	If we put a review on our site, is it gonna show up on Metacritic?
8727420	8733540	I believe it's similar to Rotten Tomatoes where you have to have so many reviews under
8733540	8739940	your belt and you have to have some type of... you're either a member of an association
8739940	8741420	or you have some type of degree or something.
8741420	8744420	I don't know, I haven't looked at the rules, but I did look them up for Rotten Tomatoes
8744420	8748380	once and it was something like that at the time, which was several years ago.
8748380	8756820	So that leads into discussions about why are game developer bonuses based on review scores?
8756820	8758460	I thought it was about the sales.
8758460	8759460	Exactly.
8759460	8763560	It should be about the sales because a game can totally get great reviews.
8763560	8769580	Mad World, for example, or... I'm trying to think, there's a lot of niche games on
8769580	8770580	... pretty much.
8770580	8774640	Okay, let's look at these RPGs that are coming out on the Wii.
8774640	8778300	They're getting great reviews, but they're not gonna sell well.
8778300	8781380	It's just because it's a niche audience that it's reaching.
8781380	8786180	And so why are they basing it on reviews?
8786180	8787620	So a game gets good reviews.
8787620	8791860	It doesn't mean people are gonna buy it.
8791860	8796540	And lastly, some news came out this week that we already kinda knew and that was this whole
8796540	8799820	... it was a result of the fact, I don't know if you guys heard, but Giant Bomb got bought
8799820	8802620	by CBS Interactive, which owns GameSpot.
8802620	8806860	The ironic thing about that is that one of the big personalities that kinda started Giant
8806860	8811920	Bomb, Jeff Gerstmann, well, he made Giant Bomb because he had to leave GameSpot.
8811920	8814020	They basically sat him in a room and fired him.
8814020	8815340	Why did they fire him?
8815340	8819140	At the time, a lot of people were saying it's because he gave Kane & Lynch a bad review
8819140	8822380	and they were big sponsors of the site at the time.
8822380	8828080	And sure enough, it came out that it wasn't specifically the Kane & Lynch review because
8828080	8833620	another thing was referenced about the Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction review
8833620	8834860	from Sony.
8834860	8840740	But basically GameSpot's editorial management basically sat him down and said that he couldn't
8840740	8844300	be trusted as an editorial director.
8844300	8849000	Couldn't be trusted with the people that are paying for ads on their site.
8849000	8852780	That's absolutely ridiculous and completely unfair.
8852780	8856940	Now, who is to blame at the end of the day for this whole cycle?
8856940	8858940	Who is to blame?
8858940	8860820	Corporations.
8860820	8862380	You.
8862380	8864140	You are to blame.
8864140	8870060	If you've ever filled out a comment or a survey thing that said, why did you buy this game?
8870060	8872060	Review from what website?
8872060	8877380	If you did that, you are partially to blame.
8877380	8878380	Think about it.
8878380	8879380	I don't think I've ever done that.
8879380	8880380	I'm just saying.
8880380	8883780	I know what I'm saying it in a way that's gonna catch people off guard a little bit,
8883780	8885440	but I want you to really think about that.
8885440	8891060	I mean, why else do the companies feel like they can get away with this?
8891060	8896860	I think we as the users have to kind of rise up and demand more transparency.
8896860	8904220	I think we need to support sites that will not support embargoes and this stuff and not
8904220	8906140	let the publishers do the talking.
8906140	8907140	It's the same.
8907140	8909460	It's practically the same thing as lobbying, you know.
8909460	8910460	Oh yeah.
8910460	8918500	Or politicians who take, you know, sponsorships from major corporations, it's the same thing.
8918500	8922500	You know, they're basically getting paid, so of course they're gonna put in a good word.
8922500	8928060	Or in the case of, you know, the politics analogy, they're gonna lean their vote towards
8928060	8931620	the interest of the people they're paying their, you know, lining their pockets.
8931620	8937500	So support independent radio websites.
8937500	8941540	I really mean it, because this kind of stuff's only going to continue.
8941540	8944060	And don't vote partisan.
8944060	8947580	All right.
8947580	8948580	Moving on.
8948580	8949580	Did I have anything else?
8949580	8952540	I think I got all the little pieces of that story, because there was quite a bit there.
8952540	8953540	Yeah.
8953540	8954540	So.
8954540	8955540	How about something happy?
8955540	8956540	How about something happy?
8956540	8957540	Okay.
8957540	8960420	Well, I'm sure I've made it no secret that I am a huge fan of Cracked.
8960420	8962500	I love Cracked.com.
8962500	8966580	And they actually posted an article that really made me stop and look at it that I wanted
8966580	8967580	to share with everybody.
8967580	8970620	And, you know, so full credit to Cracked for this.
8970620	8975420	I'm, you know, not trying to step on toes, so this goes to Mike Cooney, Eddie Rodriguez,
8975420	8977980	and Steve Hanley, who wrote the article.
8977980	8978980	Shout out.
8978980	8980460	I'm just saying, because it was really good.
8980460	8984100	It's six acts of real-life heroism made possible by video games.
8984100	8985100	So I'm just gonna go over it real quick.
8985100	8986100	Okay.
8986100	8987100	And then I'd like to get everyone's thoughts on it.
8987100	8988100	Mm-hmm.
8988100	8989100	Okay.
8989100	8992820	And really, it's actually the first three on the list that really stuck with me.
8992820	8999820	There was the one where online gamers saved a guy from killing himself.
8999820	9004460	There was an autistic, it says, a Canadian teenager made the news after helping an autistic
9004460	9010900	youth online who was showing serious signs of depression to the point of hinting at suicide.
9010900	9015500	So he didn't know where he lived, only had his gammer tag, but he contacted the police
9015500	9019620	and contacted the kid over Xbox Live and they talked him down.
9019620	9020620	Wow.
9020620	9023300	He was showing concern for another human being.
9023300	9026860	I don't, that's a good thing out of Xbox Live?
9026860	9027860	That's astounding.
9027860	9029700	Well, there's more on that, too.
9029700	9031380	His parents didn't even know.
9031380	9032380	Wow.
9032380	9034980	Someone who lived 1,500 miles away noticed.
9034980	9041500	So it's another sign, too, that you basically, I don't think in a lot of cases, once your
9041500	9044700	kid's out and going to school, I don't think parents really know their kids as well as
9044700	9051100	they think they might, not in the ways that I think they can really relate to, not as
9051100	9054920	much as somebody within their own peer group, you know what I mean?
9054920	9057860	And I think that someone needs to be careful and look at all the signs.
9057860	9060180	You put yourself in their shoes.
9060180	9063100	And then this one now, this one I thought was really neat.
9063100	9064100	This is that Evony game.
9064100	9071140	I know, I kind of scoff at the game, but there's a guy with muscular dystrophy who, his house
9071140	9076540	caught on fire while he was playing a game, and he couldn't get out safely because he
9076540	9079860	had muscular dystrophy, it was wheelchair-bound.
9079860	9085840	And his friends in the game called the police department and the fire department and helped
9085840	9087460	him get out of his house.
9087460	9088460	Wow.
9088460	9089700	So there's that.
9089700	9094220	This one, this is the number five on the list that I thought was pretty cool.
9094220	9099820	A guy who had been playing Medal of Modern War, oh, never mind, they just-
9099820	9100820	Medal of Modern Warfare?
9100820	9104980	It was a little name that they came up with, but he had actually been playing America's
9104980	9105980	Army.
9105980	9106980	Which-
9106980	9107980	Oh, yeah, yeah.
9107980	9110020	I watched the medic training on that one, and it's pretty-
9110020	9113660	Well, it's an army recruitment game at the end of the day, yeah.
9113660	9122660	I mean, but he, what happened is that he had encountered a car crash where someone in an
9122660	9129340	SUV flipped upside down and the car was spewing smoke, and he actually used the medic training
9129340	9136580	from the game to help the guy, basically the person in the accident lost like two fingers
9136580	9141540	and was gushing blood from his head, and he bandaged the hand, raised it above his head
9141540	9143420	to stop the bleeding, and bandaged the guy's head-
9143420	9144740	Oh, my God.
9144740	9153660	And contacted EMT, all from knowing, and he credited it to the medical training in America's
9153660	9154660	Army.
9154660	9155660	Wow.
9155660	9158740	So, and then this one was actually pretty cool, and this is a World of Warcraft one,
9158740	9159740	so this one-
9159740	9160740	And he was immediately drafted.
9160740	9161740	I'm just kidding.
9161740	9165300	This one, this one hits a little close, because you'll know what I'm talking about.
9165300	9166300	A little glimped?
9166300	9167300	Okay.
9167300	9172220	A 12-year-old Norwegian boy was walking with his sister and got attacked by a moose.
9172220	9175220	Yeah, a moose once bit my sister.
9175220	9177420	Ghost crawler promised me a moose.
9177420	9178420	Okay.
9178420	9184700	His sister was 10, and the moose started to charge him, male moose probably in season,
9184700	9192300	and so the little boy taunted the moose away from his sister and played dead.
9192300	9194620	And he credited it to World of Warcraft.
9194620	9196700	To taunt and feign death.
9196700	9197700	He said, if you've got-
9197700	9199820	Well, now, hunters can't taunt.
9199820	9200820	Let me finish.
9200820	9203020	This damn kid doesn't know what he's talking about.
9203020	9205020	Let me finish.
9205020	9213540	But he said basically is that his brain translated it as aggro, and it was an aggressive animal,
9213540	9217940	so he grabbed his attention, because an aggressive animal is going to go to the thing making
9217940	9220620	the biggest noise, the biggest threat.
9220620	9227300	And then he said he played dead, he feigned death, and the moose sniffed at him, nudged
9227300	9232420	him, and walked off, left him and his sister alone.
9232420	9233420	Pretty neat.
9233420	9237780	And the other ones on here, now those are like the big three for me on these, because
9237780	9243900	the other ones are about how they're helping stroke victims recover by improving hand-eye
9243900	9245900	coordination.
9245900	9249860	There's another one here about a web browser game that people have used to discover two
9249860	9255100	planets that's- Let me see if I can't get the name of this called.
9255100	9261860	It's Planet Hunters, which basically chooses them to monitor light emissions, and it'll
9261860	9267180	do a certain thing when a planet crosses through a particular star's path, and players have
9267180	9270340	discovered two planets that way.
9270340	9273820	There's another one on here about helping stroke victims recover.
9273820	9279860	One of them got really excited, but it turned out it was just Bluto.
9279860	9286100	And then- Thank you, I'll be here all week.
9286100	9292740	They used the skills of a 14-year-old boy who invented a procedure, this is for a science
9292740	9300740	fair project, of using a controller to do internal stitches, where you'd have to use
9300740	9302420	a robot for it.
9302420	9307780	And now you kind of have that with Kinect, if the Windows commercials are to be believed.
9307780	9316140	But it was using a surgical device called an endostitch, and it's used to sew up patients
9316140	9324240	after a hysterectomy, but he was using that same procedure only with a video game controller
9324240	9325240	for medical purposes.
9325240	9328260	But I want to go back to the first three that I listed.
9328260	9333940	Those are, instead of just applying what you know from video games, those are saving people's
9333940	9334940	lives.
9334940	9341140	I mean, when you have a bear come in your thing, you're told to play dead, but he specifically
9341140	9344780	said that he needed to taunt the aggro away.
9344780	9345780	From his sister, yeah.
9345780	9354600	And, you know, I've run into, like, I had a case when I was playing PSO, where I actually
9354600	9362140	got really sick and was given some advice from just a random person in there who happened
9362140	9365020	to be an EMT.
9365020	9368660	And it took care of me from being nauseous, I didn't have to go to the hospital.
9368660	9373100	I think I told you about that, like, yeah.
9373100	9376460	You know, I've had plenty of friends that were going through really hard times that
9376460	9380740	just, you know, being friends with them online has kind of kept their head above water so
9380740	9382660	that they have a support network.
9382660	9388300	You know, but the one that really struck me was the guy getting the, you know, the medical
9388300	9389300	training.
9389300	9394740	And I watched the video, it's actually, I've had emergency training before, and it's more
9394740	9399460	in depth than what I did in my first aid classes.
9399460	9404500	So I'm just pretty amazed at that, I mean, what do you think of, I wanted to bring this
9404500	9408140	up because people say, oh, video games make you violent, meh.
9408140	9411300	Well, obviously, I know that that's not true, and, you know, I've heard of some of these
9411300	9412860	good things before.
9412860	9415260	There's sometimes a dark side to these MMOs.
9415260	9419040	You know, we heard about the, you know, kidnapped across state lines and all that.
9419040	9423340	It's nice to hear some of the good stuff, too, about how technology, I think it's more
9423340	9429020	technology is saving lives, and, you know, gaming is that technology, some of it.
9429020	9432780	So I don't know, how can you argue with the good news here?
9432780	9434660	I mean, it's good stuff.
9434660	9443340	I just really wish that more, like, more mainstream news sources would really focus more on advertising
9443340	9448140	stuff like this instead of just finding sensationalist stories that give everybody a bad name.
9448140	9450380	Speaking of supporting independent media.
9450380	9451380	Exactly.
9451380	9455900	Yeah, and this is, wow, stutter-tastic.
9455900	9460760	This kind of thing, it's exactly the kind of thing you want to hear, because it's people
9460760	9467020	that are applying any kind of knowledge that's at least rooted in some kind of truth.
9467020	9469660	It's such, yeah, they have a weird association.
9469660	9471620	I learned about it from a video game.
9471620	9472620	Big deal.
9472620	9473620	As long as you've learned.
9473620	9474620	Good for them.
9474620	9478220	They did something fantastic with a little bit of knowledge bestowed upon them.
9478220	9480900	You know, I actually did learn how to drive through Ridge Racer.
9480900	9482140	No, big-
9482140	9488700	And it's funny that you say that, because when I was starting to get towards the age
9488700	9495220	of learning driving, about to go to driving school, my grandpa, one of my grandpas, would
9495220	9499140	give me a hard time because I would talk about driving video games.
9499140	9505380	And it's like, I think I probably went a little bit above and beyond in a sense that I don't
9505380	9510220	want to, I think I may have one time said, I don't want to drive, you know, video games
9510220	9513100	can't kill you, so I would rather do that instead.
9513100	9517540	But at the same time, it's like, I went in there and I wasn't scared of driving.
9517540	9519980	I wasn't, it wasn't new to me.
9519980	9523060	I've been in my parents' car plenty of times.
9523060	9525380	Yeah, you pick up things like this.
9525380	9526380	Well, great.
9526380	9529860	My whole thing was that I always had problems cornering because I was learning how to drive
9529860	9534900	in a boat pretty much, you know, an older large vehicle.
9534900	9539020	And it was, because you know how wonky the original Ridge Racer steering was and how
9539020	9541580	you had to be super careful with your cornering.
9541580	9547020	It was while playing that game that it clicked in my head what I was doing wrong in the car.
9547020	9548500	And I never had a problem cornering.
9548500	9549500	Never.
9549500	9550500	All right.
9550500	9554500	Well, you can ask Ron about that when I managed to make that turn off off the Bay Bridge to
9554500	9557500	going to Treasure Island in my Lancer and drifted.
9557500	9559180	Ah, all right.
9559180	9560180	Let's move on.
9560180	9561180	I'm trying to get to call.
9561180	9562180	So we have some time for calls.
9562180	9563180	Loki quickly.
9563180	9564180	All right.
9564180	9565980	I will be super quick.
9565980	9569980	So let's talk a little bit about Peter Molyneux.
9569980	9575640	Well, not Peter Molyneux per se, but Peter Moly-doe.
9575640	9582060	It's the parody account that's on Twitter that comes up with all these weird like game
9582060	9583060	ideas.
9583060	9587800	Like for example, you control a mystical rabbit at a bus stop during winter.
9587800	9591980	You must find as many creative ways as possible to make people miss their buses.
9591980	9593740	So similar to the OLR dream games.
9593740	9594960	Yeah, something like that.
9594960	9597220	Just really weird stuff.
9597220	9599340	Here's the funny thing.
9599340	9604620	Someone has convinced him that he should do a game jam where independent developers out
9604620	9610120	there will create games based on these crazy ideas.
9610120	9611460	And that's what's going to happen.
9611460	9620220	Actually going to Moly Jam 2012 is set to run, I guess, March 31st and or through April
9620220	9621220	1st.
9621220	9630740	And actually a few cities, San Francisco and Brighton also that has expanded to now a few
9630740	9640300	more cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle, Montreal and Melbourne and New York.
9640300	9647380	And of course, what's even more interesting about that is Peter Molyneux is actually going
9647380	9649820	to join in on this as well.
9649820	9652380	Now that he's got some free time.
9652380	9654460	Good for him having a sense of humor about the whole thing.
9654460	9658260	And he's actually, it's kind of funny, is some of the ideas like for example, there
9658260	9665700	is a post by the Peter Molyneux that he's all, my first mobile game will be free, but
9665700	9671140	if you pay a little, then the NPCs will be extra nice and compliment you more while playing.
9671140	9674140	Peter Molyneux responds, that's not a bad idea actually.
9674140	9677620	And so, you know, just like, you know, funny things like that.
9677620	9680740	And this one's another funny one.
9680740	9684380	Imagine carrying a radioactive baby in a pitch black environment.
9684380	9688860	Your baby would act as a torch, rocking the baby intensifies the glow, et cetera.
9688860	9696060	You know, just like, that just makes me think of the crying scene for Max Payne.
9696060	9699520	But the whole thing is, you know, he has these really weird ideas, but there's actually some
9699520	9704340	funny ones that he came up with like the bullying, the RPG or whatever that had bullying as,
9704340	9707620	you know, the combat system or something like that.
9707620	9711300	And so they're gonna make some of these things, including that rabbit one, they actually have
9711300	9712880	a video of that.
9712880	9719460	And yeah, there's actually some people that are, you know, interested in doing that.
9719460	9724580	They're saying that, I guess they're, I'm trying to see if there's any other really
9724580	9725580	big guys.
9725580	9730820	The people behind it right now, the organizers, Anna Kipleness, Brandon Sheffield, Patrick
9730820	9741140	Klepec, which I think he was from Joystiq, Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, Joe Kowalski, and
9741140	9744380	Edward Paris.
9744380	9751420	So it's interesting, and of course, if you're interested in this, you can check out, well,
9751420	9757400	you can follow, or check out Vox Games, or you can follow, I think they've got a website
9757400	9761660	for this already, let's see here.
9761660	9765380	I know some people that are participating in this, so it's gonna be fun.
9765380	9782420	Yeah, well, first off, you can check the fake Twitter account for, it's Peter Molydeux,
9782420	9792060	and they have a Google Docs page, but you can just look it up, it's Game Jams Fun Time,
9792060	9793860	Fun Times.
9793860	9798700	So yeah, check it out, and then of course, you know, I think they're gonna be adding
9798700	9801500	like an actual webpage and stuff for this at some point.
9801500	9806940	Alright, I got one more story for you guys, and I'm gonna make this real quick, because
9806940	9811880	this is something that has been going around for forever, and just will not go away, and
9811880	9814460	that is that there is no new Xbox this year at E3.
9814460	9817540	I could've sworn this was already reported on, but it made the rounds on the gaming blogs
9817540	9819420	again this week.
9819420	9823920	Some folks that are close to, I guess, Bloomberg, are insisting that Microsoft's gonna introduce
9823920	9826660	a new console in 2013.
9826660	9832840	It'll be at E3 next year, but Bloomberg Magazine was told by David Dennis, who's a group manager
9832840	9840120	of PR at Xbox, 2012 is all about the Xbox 360, so stop the rumors, there will be no
9840120	9842740	slick new Xbox lube until 2013.
9842740	9845160	There you go.
9845160	9846160	That's the final word.
9846160	9848300	Well it makes sense, they've got stuff to show off this year, next year will be when
9848300	9849300	they unveil it.
9849300	9853500	Alright, we are gonna open the phones, so call now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username
9853500	9858200	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, again that's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is
9858200	9862900	OrangeLoungeRadio, and damn that's fast, it's already lighting up, we got a call, hi you're
9862900	9864660	on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9864660	9865660	This is Shane.
9865660	9868180	Hey, you're fast, you like know when we're gonna open it up, what's up?
9868180	9871060	I know, it's like I was given advanced warning or something.
9871060	9874100	Something like that, well what's on your mind tonight, what do you wanna talk about?
9874100	9877260	What do I normally talk about?
9877260	9878260	Mass Effect.
9878260	9883380	Yes, that is my second best favorite thing in the world, so let's talk about that.
9883380	9887140	Okay, since you're pissed off that I didn't give you credit for getting me into Mass Effect,
9887140	9890780	which was basically that you were pouting and whining and crying and threatening not
9890780	9893540	to be my friend anymore unless I would play Mass Effect.
9893540	9899260	Which that's a lie, I think I just bombarded you with me talking about it, I don't think
9899260	9901220	there was pouting or crying.
9901220	9902220	There was a little bit.
9902220	9904580	You need to convince Jamie that she should play it too.
9904580	9907300	Jamie, it's gonna, it'll change your life.
9907300	9909740	Buy me a copy.
9909740	9910740	We're all poor.
9910740	9911740	Me too please.
9911740	9912740	I'm broke.
9912740	9917540	Alright, we're pressed for time tonight, so what do you wanna say about Mass Effect?
9917540	9922620	Well as I sit here just exiting out of Mass Effect 1 that I was just playing, and in
9922620	9932740	my N7 t-shirt, I would probably like to say that I am on the side of the retake Mass Effect
9932740	9936220	3 movement, which is give us a different ending.
9936220	9937220	Oh, why?
9937220	9939580	You didn't go to the government, did you?
9939580	9943220	No, I'm not stupid, I joined a Facebook group.
9943220	9946260	Well, that's activism of the 21st century.
9946260	9950140	Alright, so at least you're not totally crazy, you're in the same crowd.
9950140	9954020	So without spoiling, why is the ending pissing everybody off?
9954020	9959020	It's pretty much for the reason, well, the good reason that it's making everybody angry
9959020	9964100	is that, like you said earlier, everything you've done up until the last 10 minutes of
9964100	9968180	the game does not matter based on these endings.
9968180	9970820	I don't care if it's not a happy ending.
9970820	9976820	I didn't really expect it to be happy endings, but I expect an actual ending that makes sense,
9976820	9983180	not some Matrix crap or something stupid like that.
9983180	9990740	And I'm also part of the group of people that believe one of the endings that you get, if
9990740	9995060	you do really well with all the extra stuff in the game, you get like an extra 10 seconds,
9995060	10000860	and that leads to this entirely different theory about all the endings and that this
10000860	10005300	one that you may consider bad is actually leading up to a real ending that they have
10005300	10006540	not given us yet.
10006540	10009400	And I will pay for DLC if they do it.
10009400	10012340	So what is the point of joining the Facebook group?
10012340	10013340	What do you want?
10013340	10014460	What do you want out of all this?
10014460	10017940	I want a DLC ending.
10017940	10023300	Like I could see if somebody is not invested in the series, the endings are probably fine
10023300	10024820	for them.
10024820	10032660	But seeing as how I really like everything about the story and my Shepard's journey,
10032660	10036780	they didn't end it like they kind of promised they would.
10036780	10041900	And I'm not going to be like, I'll never buy one of your games again, but I will be like,
10041900	10046800	I'll pay for DLC for you guys to make it right.
10046800	10048660	Do you think that you should have to do that though?
10048660	10052940	Do you feel like maybe you're being exploited a little bit for your money because you're
10052940	10053940	so into this?
10053940	10056200	No, I don't think so.
10056200	10058740	I think they just had a screw up.
10058740	10059740	That's it.
10059740	10064260	And I'm reading what a SIG vampire says, I'm just ignoring it because it doesn't, that
10064260	10069020	part doesn't matter in one and two and when you end a trilogy and they promise that everything
10069020	10074740	you've done up until the point is going to shape your game and it doesn't, that's where
10074740	10077340	it's stupid.
10077340	10081700	But complaining to the government over it's pretty stupid too, you got to admit.
10081700	10084780	No, I definitely agree with that.
10084780	10088520	Now you sure, you sure there's never going to be another Mass Effect game?
10088520	10094340	They said, again, you know, who knows what Bioware is really thinking sometimes, but
10094340	10098180	they said if they ever did another game, it would not take place after three, you'd have
10098180	10101180	to take place before or during three.
10101180	10107460	And I don't know for a game like this, I don't understand why I'd want to play something
10107460	10111680	that takes place before the Mass Effect one through three and that definitely don't want
10111680	10117540	to play something that takes place during three unless it's just extra DLC for three.
10117540	10123680	So yeah, I can't see them doing a four that takes place after three, especially with what
10123680	10125740	the endings do right now, currently.
10125740	10128940	All right, well I got to wrap up to get more calls or any other thoughts you want to get
10128940	10129940	in there?
10129940	10133260	Um, I had one and then I forgot it.
10133260	10135300	Yeah, I forgot it.
10135300	10136300	All right.
10136300	10137300	That's right.
10137300	10138300	Right.
10138300	10139300	You forget.
10139300	10140300	All right.
10140300	10141300	Whatever.
10141300	10142300	All right.
10142300	10143300	By the way, Alan beat Mass Effect one if you didn't hear it.
10143300	10146460	I know I talked to him on life journal about it already on it.
10146460	10147460	All right.
10147460	10148460	Yeah.
10148460	10149460	I better let you go.
10149460	10150460	So we get more calls.
10150460	10151460	All right.
10151460	10152460	Bye.
10152460	10153460	One eight seven seven game.
10153460	10154460	OLR or username on Skype is orange launch radio.
10154460	10155460	You're laughing over there.
10155460	10156460	Jason.
10156460	10159580	Oh, just the, just, just the, just what's happening.
10159580	10160580	Just the conversation around you.
10160580	10161580	Right.
10161580	10162580	All right.
10162580	10163580	We got another call.
10163580	10164580	Hi.
10164580	10165580	You're on orange launch radio.
10165580	10166580	Who's this?
10166580	10167580	What up guys?
10167580	10168580	It's cynical for me.
10168580	10169580	Okay.
10169580	10170580	See how you doing?
10170580	10171580	Hey, I'm good.
10171580	10172580	Xenocore.
10172580	10173580	I had no idea about that.
10173580	10174580	Eighties music, by the way.
10174580	10175580	Thank you for sending me straight on that.
10175580	10176580	Yeah, no.
10176580	10177580	Oh, good.
10177580	10178580	What's up?
10178580	10179580	What's uh, what do we have the phone?
10179580	10180580	Oh, the phone call to tonight.
10180580	10186060	I only caught the second part of the previous caller, but, uh, as far as the, the ending
10186060	10188180	and mass effect, it's, it's just piss poor.
10188180	10193340	I mean, literally Bioware has written much better content than that.
10193340	10197580	Uh, again, trying to keep it spoiler free cause I'm, I'm making my way there, but what
10197580	10201060	is it about the ending that's so irritating is it, would you say it's kind of the same
10201060	10204580	thing that's been brought up before that no matter what you do, you're kind of getting
10204580	10206220	the same shit at the end?
10206220	10213700	True, but they could've even covered it by not giving you the actual choice just by picking
10213700	10217940	something that you did in the past and it would auto pick that choice when you got to
10217940	10218940	the end.
10218940	10222900	So it actually, something you did had some sway over what happened, but the way they
10222900	10224060	did it, it was all erased.
10224060	10228860	It was all used for filler and considering the quality of writing that Bioware usually
10228860	10233640	puts out, surely their writers are a little bit better and coming up with summation better
10233640	10234780	than that.
10234780	10239540	So are you into the DLC conspiracy where you're getting something real, but for a low, low
10239540	10241100	price of $10?
10241100	10244900	Why would you pay for a product that's been trashed already?
10244900	10248860	If you give me another 10 bucks, I'll actually finish it and put it together for you.
10248860	10253060	No, if it said some assembly required, that's the way you're selling it.
10253060	10254060	Cause it worked for Bethesda.
10254060	10258900	Well true, I mean, I'm not saying they're not going to make money if they do that either.
10258900	10264160	That product was so good in one and two, it's almost guaranteed to make money with the DLC.
10264160	10265160	It's guaranteed.
10265160	10269220	I mean, people are already asking for it, like, give me DLC, just finish the story the
10269220	10270220	way we want.
10270220	10273380	So they probably will, they'll charge 10 bucks and they'll get their money.
10273380	10277380	Interesting, Shane is sending me a private message with this comment, maybe you want
10277380	10278900	to respond to this, I don't know.
10278900	10283780	He says the other thing he forgot was, it's about the precedent it sets demanding DLC
10283780	10284780	endings.
10284780	10289060	Also, how even though it had a terrible ending, it didn't ruin the journey or the game.
10289060	10293100	Did the ending ruin Mass Effect for you?
10293100	10297700	I was watching a roomie play it, and it guaranteed I'm not buying it in a Mass Effect 3.
10297700	10301340	I see, okay, so you just kind of saw it through somebody else, but that's okay, I mean, certainly
10301340	10302340	you can get Mass Effect 3.
10302340	10305840	Well, I mean, I saw enough of stuff on the internet without seeing all the trailers to
10305840	10311200	know that if I got to that ending, because the game isn't that difficult, it's not like
10311200	10315960	the ending of Rygar to where getting to the ending is the feat itself because the game's
10315960	10318460	so damn hard, few people actually see it.
10318460	10322340	Well, to use the Sopranos comparison again, I didn't watch the whole series, I saw an
10322340	10325620	episode or two, but even I know the ending of that sucked.
10325620	10332260	True, true, I respect the way they did it, and even if, it's not so much the endings
10332260	10337900	they provided, it's just the way they came to those endings, the user has no, half the
10337900	10339420	work you do is erased.
10339420	10344420	God, I never play video games to completion, ever, ever, so if I beat Mass Effect 3, that's
10344420	10349460	a big if, but if I beat Mass Effect 3, that in itself is going to be like a noteworthy
10349460	10356260	thing for the journal, you know, like, I beat a video game, because my ADD usually kicks
10356260	10360500	in 20 hours before this point.
10360500	10363820	Some point I will finish Final Fantasy 13 too, I swear.
10363820	10364820	Squirrels!
10364820	10366860	Seven, in my case.
10366860	10375140	Oh, but I don't finish seven, because speaking of shit endings, alright, hey, SSJ100 Matt
10375140	10380220	says Bioware trolled you all, did Bioware troll us, Xenocore?
10380220	10385320	Exactly, exactly, I'm convinced something must have happened corporate wise, maybe they
10385320	10390180	ran out of time and they rushed the ending, or something smells fishy as far as the development
10390180	10391740	to why the game is the way it is.
10391740	10397860	If the DLC conspiracies is true, then EA trolled us all.
10397860	10399740	That's not too far fetched either, so.
10399740	10402540	Alright, well Xenocore, anything else before we let you go?
10402540	10404380	No, that's it, y'all take it easy.
10404380	10406940	Alright you two, have a good one buddy.
10406940	10407940	Alright, bye.
10407940	10415060	877 game OLR, username on Skype, chat, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10415060	10416060	What is that?
10416060	10417060	You're having a fun night, Rob!
10417060	10421780	I'm having like the burpiest night in the history of OLR, this is, what did I eat?
10421780	10426860	I had, I had Mongolian BBQ, because I took, I took to a new place, there is a new place
10426860	10428860	downtown called MongoMongo.
10428860	10430940	I need to go there.
10430940	10431940	Yes you do.
10431940	10432940	It was good.
10432940	10433940	Alright.
10433940	10434940	Let's take a call.
10434940	10435940	I gotta be fast.
10435940	10436940	Hey.
10436940	10437940	Hey Sky, how's it going?
10437940	10438940	It's Legend Zaku here.
10438940	10440020	Hey Zaku, you got through.
10440020	10441020	What's up buddy?
10441020	10445300	Yeah, it's been a long time, I don't know if I've actually called this year so far,
10445300	10450620	I may have done it in January, but yeah, I'm just like touching back on what you know,
10450620	10455120	what you mentioned already with like Tim Shaver and Kickstarter and just like all these, all
10455120	10461700	these devel, all these like pop, developers that are basically, yeah these uh, these video
10461700	10468220	game shops that apparently, because of the way the business works, that you know, sourcing
10468220	10475000	out to Kickstarter might, it might open new avenues, but at the same time, it's, it breaks
10475000	10480140	the mold of the way that whole business has, you know, publisher, the whole video game
10480140	10484580	industry has like switched in the past 15 or so years.
10484580	10489820	Like back in the days of NES and Super Nintendo, it wasn't really about like pumping out sequels
10489820	10494320	that quickly, it was about creating like games that would be memorable and that would just
10494320	10496020	be pushing the envelope.
10496020	10501880	Nowadays you have companies like Activision and to an extent EA just short, just thinking
10501880	10502880	with a short sight.
10502880	10503880	Well, hold on, hold on.
10503880	10506340	In other words, taking a franchise and just milking it out.
10506340	10509060	You want to know one interesting thing I read today that I didn't realize?
10509060	10511180	Like thank you Wikipedia, I learned something new today.
10511180	10515440	You know, even though I wouldn't say this is necessarily an example of milking it out,
10515440	10520180	it's certainly Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link on the Nintendo Entertainment System,
10520180	10521660	nine months after the original.
10521660	10523780	I mean, talk about a quick turnaround.
10523780	10526820	Well, I mean, those are exceptions, but you also have to take in the ones that, you know,
10526820	10532100	the ones that have grown up in my childhood, you know, stuff like Super Mario World, the
10532100	10533100	Sonic series.
10533100	10534100	In Japan, by the way.
10534100	10536460	Even the first early titles of the PlayStation.
10536460	10540200	Those were like groundbreaking in the sense that they, they push, you know, they push
10540200	10543240	the game styles into a different direction.
10543240	10547060	Then you have like, then nowadays you have companies like Activision, for example, that
10547060	10548460	only live by the quarter.
10548460	10553620	Like, you know, they milk Call of Duty and they see that as something where they can,
10553620	10555620	you know, make money in the short term.
10555620	10556620	Milking is destroyed.
10556620	10561100	This is where the bean counter perspective comes into the industry, which so far has
10561100	10564380	been a fixture of it for quite a while now.
10564380	10570260	So, you know, in other words, instead of like actual video game developers, you know, brainstorming
10570260	10574740	ideas, you have like, you have the suits, for example, that just do, you know, they
10574740	10578900	have research and they have numbers in which they can create, you know, facts out of anything
10578900	10583740	as a means of creating ideas in which they can, you know, they can milk.
10583740	10588500	Milking franchises, though, like, as like Guitar Hero was destroyed by the milking,
10588500	10591060	you know, like, so it hasn't always been successful.
10591060	10595340	The whole video, the whole rhythm music game genre is pretty much on its last throws because
10595340	10596340	of that.
10596340	10601060	It wasn't until Guitar Hero that it, you know, after it went mainstream, it basically fizzled
10601060	10602060	out.
10602060	10608420	Like, this is like everything before that time, like during when Konami still had a
10608420	10614900	handle on that genre, it was still pretty underground, but it wasn't going away any
10614900	10615900	time soon.
10615900	10619220	You know, they were still milking out, I mean, they were still sending out new titles and
10619220	10620220	so forth.
10620220	10625500	But, as I said, once you bring something mainstream, that's one of the, you know, it's one of
10625500	10628540	the vulnerabilities right there.
10628540	10629540	Alright.
10629540	10632740	I have to wrap up, I have to wrap up because we're supposed to be done at 9.15 tonight,
10632740	10636260	but quickly, any like final thoughts on this?
10636260	10641140	I'm pretty certain that the video game publishers have like a cabal with the reviewers to the
10641140	10646980	point where, at some point, the feds have to get involved, thinking that you may have
10646980	10652460	like a case where these publishers are paying their way, not through like official channels,
10652460	10659580	but under the table in terms of a paying for like reviews or any of that type that might
10659580	10660580	be...
10660580	10661900	I want them all dragged through the courts!
10661900	10664020	I want mud flung on them!
10664020	10669580	Sony got busted for astroturfing for the PSP a few years ago, for actually like posting
10669580	10675620	it through another, through a supposedly, you know, real actual user, or an actual blog
10675620	10681700	post that turned out to be fake, it was mostly, you know, marketing posts without disclosing
10681700	10687820	whether or not they had like a, that they were actually, you know, part Sony.
10687820	10688820	Alright.
10688820	10689820	I gotta wrap up.
10689820	10690820	Thank you so much, Zaku.
10690820	10691820	Have a good one.
10691820	10692820	Have a good one too.
10692820	10693820	Later.
10693820	10697820	Sorry, I couldn't give him more time, but I'm supposed to be wrapped up by now.
10697820	10701180	Thank you guys so much for getting, those of you that were able to call through on Skype
10701180	10702180	tonight.
10702180	10706740	If you didn't get through, I'm very sorry, but do send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
10706740	10710940	I did not mean to ignore the Twitters tonight, let me just quickly get through some of these
10710940	10717140	at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Ramaditya Knight sent us some NES soundtracks to check out,
10717140	10718660	and so I'm gonna check those out.
10718660	10724420	Dragon Fighter, Shatterhand, Final Mission, some pretty good picks in there.
10724420	10729820	Eric RPG sent us a link to a Kickstarter, but this is for a JRPG that looks like it
10729820	10730820	could be interesting.
10730820	10734660	It's called Americana Dawn, and definitely looks like kind of the old retro.
10734660	10738420	I don't want to say like Super Nintendo, but maybe a little more like PlayStation era,
10738420	10740140	like RPGs.
10740140	10744620	So that's pretty cool, and for $7 you can put an NPC in the development room.
10744620	10747580	So if this looks like something you want to support, there you go.
10747580	10750780	They've raised well over half of what they're supposed to get.
10750780	10754400	They're only trying to get $2,700, so that's pretty cool.
10754400	10756980	So good luck with that.
10756980	10758320	Tiger Claw sent us a few links.
10758320	10761180	I'm not gonna be able to super duper have time to get into these.
10761180	10762980	One of these is about the Pong Developer Challenge.
10762980	10766380	I actually think we touched on this last week because there was some controversy about this
10766380	10773180	whole thing, about how the rights were being sold over to Atari, but I got an email on
10773180	10777100	it this week too, so I guess they're still pushing it, and I haven't really heard any
10777100	10779120	clarifications from Atari.
10779120	10784860	The other one has to do with the Tiger Claw sent me Mass Effect 3 and the Gay card.
10784860	10792020	I want to read this in more detail and probably talk about it at a later time, because obviously
10792020	10794060	this is an issue I would be interested in.
10794060	10799980	I think some people are unfairly, there's some people out there like, I don't want Shepherd
10799980	10800980	to be gay.
10800980	10803620	Why does Bioware have to make everything gay?
10803620	10804620	Well you know what?
10804620	10806820	Why does everything have to be one way or the other?
10806820	10810940	One thing I really like about Mass Effect is you have the freedom to do what you want
10810940	10812860	or not do something.
10812860	10813860	Hello?
10813860	10814860	So.
10814860	10815860	Anyhow.
10815860	10820100	I will read that more later.
10820100	10824660	SJ100Matt sent us a link about Chinatown Fair Arcade reopening, but I think that was covered
10824660	10825660	in Rapid Fire News.
10825660	10827020	Did we cover that at some point?
10827020	10828020	No.
10828020	10829340	Oh, I thought we had that linked.
10829340	10833300	All right, well, Chinatown Fair Arcade rumored reopening, there you go.
10833300	10836340	And that's it for Twitter, twitter.com slash olr.
10836340	10837980	Call me when Arcade Infinity reopens.
10837980	10838980	Yeah, right?
10838980	10842020	Talking about things that disappeared in the last couple years.
10842020	10846460	Yeah, sorry about all the closures coming to California.
10846460	10850540	We need to wrap up and get out of here for the night, but we need to get our final thoughts
10850540	10851540	first.
10851540	10853180	Jason, thank you so much for being here.
10853180	10857180	And thank you, of course, for hosting our website, as you so graciously have, for the
10857180	10860300	past probably about eight years that you've been doing the website.
10860300	10861300	Thank you.
10861300	10862720	You know, I really, really appreciate that.
10862720	10867180	And I don't think the listeners understand, without you, there wouldn't be fucking web
10867180	10868920	space to download shows.
10868920	10873340	There would be a place, you know, Live 365 or something like that to go to, but outside
10873340	10874340	of it.
10874340	10875340	No, no, no.
10875340	10876340	Oh, the horror, the horror.
10876340	10879140	It's kind of medium to listen, but beyond that, you know, I do what I can.
10879140	10882980	I've enjoyed the ride, and why the hell stop it?
10882980	10884080	So why do we need Kickstarter?
10884080	10886960	We have generous people like Jason who help us out with what they can, you know, help
10886960	10887960	get us.
10887960	10889300	I need Kickstarter to recoup costs.
10889300	10890300	Come on, guys.
10890300	10891300	No, no, no, no.
10891300	10892300	All right.
10892300	10894660	So, Jason, final thoughts tonight?
10894660	10895660	Kirby Superstar.
10895660	10899100	All right, Loki, final thoughts tonight?
10899100	10904260	I hope there's not a size limit to Excel files, because the one I'm using right now to make
10904260	10908060	a editor for Grand Theft Auto Maps is 65 megs now.
10908060	10911780	I think 65,535 rows is the most you can have.
10911780	10912780	That's rows.
10912780	10913780	I'm talking about file size.
10913780	10914780	Oh, good luck with that.
10914780	10918540	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
10918540	10921580	And my final thought is Cool Whip.
10921580	10922580	Yay!
10922580	10923580	Cool Whip.
10923580	10924580	Yes, Cool Whip.
10924580	10925580	Cool Whip.
10925580	10926580	All right.
10926580	10930060	Thank you, guys, so much for downloading and listening live to our program.
10930060	10931300	We really appreciate it.
10931300	10932780	You know we do it for free.
10932780	10937660	We don't ask for your money, although maybe I'll get talked into the Kickstarter thing.
10937660	10938660	I don't know, though.
10938660	10939660	I kind of doubt it.
10939660	10941020	But we'll see.
10941020	10942100	I do say this, though.
10942100	10946100	If you enjoy what you've heard, please tell somebody about the show.
10946100	10947400	Help spread the word.
10947400	10949300	Help grow our community.
10949300	10953020	This is a no embargo zone, and we give you our honest opinions.
10953020	10954020	Actually, we did sign one.
10954020	10956660	We signed one once, and we got burned by it.
10956660	10958340	It wasn't about reviews, though.
10958340	10959340	That's something else.
10959340	10960340	I'm not going to get into it now.
10960340	10961340	We're out of time.
10961340	10968980	It's an easy topic if we want to talk about that while we're not recording.
10968980	10969980	Okay, then.
10969980	10973620	We're going to turn off the mics and say, see you next week.
10973620	10974620	We'll be back.
10974620	10977860	Thank you, guys, very much for tuning in and supporting the show.
10977860	10978860	We love you guys.
