13912	24749	Tonight, June 3rd, 2012, rumored new Wii U functionality is revealed, details emerge on the next Skyrim expansion, and Apple answers rumors about an Apple console.
31553	38937	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39337	43259	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.
43419	46481	First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46821	48262	Yo, dog, what up?
48362	49063	How you doing?
51345	52145	I'm full of curry.
53106	54487	Hurry, hurry, hurry.
54647	55628	Get your rice and curry.
55668	56569	It was really good.
56629	57930	It was Thai, not Indian.
58010	58431	Thank you.
58591	59772	Nerds out there will know that song.
59832	60072	All right.
60172	63254	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
63755	63975	Hi.
64295	64996	How are you doing, Loki?
65336	66177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
86158	103212	But we're actually taping here on Thursday, May the 31st So a little disclaimer before we get into the news too much tonight Especially with all the E3 stuff starting to come out Things may have changed between the night we taped this and the night you guys hear it Why did we do that this week?
103332	112740	Well, as I mentioned on last week's show, I'm going to be out of town Therefore the OLR studio will be closed that night And Loki really wants a night to sit at home and play Minecraft all night uninterrupted
113979	114299	IDDQD IDDQD
141927	142788	I don't die.
143128	147049	But it's really for the poor programming of the game.
147770	155853	For example, the future updates and stuff, when you're digging underground, you know if there's lava one brick away from where you're digging.
156454	157534	You don't in this game.
157874	160795	So you're digging and all of a sudden, oh crap, lava, killing me.
160976	165017	Yeah, the first tip I got about playing Minecraft is never dig straight down.
165437	166638	Well, I wasn't digging straight down.
166738	168339	I was digging straight forward.
169447	171857	and then all of a sudden I hit a block in Lava Flow.
171938	172379	Dead.
172580	174388	I was like, thanks.
175976	178878	All right, anyhow, we'll talk more about our gaming weeks in a little bit.
205652	208373	Loki, you still took the time off from work so you can kind of watch it, right?
208513	210574	I didn't take any time off work, but I'll still be watching it.
212174	215215	But technically it's related to your job so you can kind of get away with it.
216055	217436	Yeah, because I'm awesome like that.
217916	219617	I kind of think that my work is more interesting.
220836	225338	Well, this year especially, you know, I'm feeling a little eh about E3 this year.
225358	226859	I mean, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.
227259	230421	And to go into it with low expectations is probably a good place to be.
230541	234823	But, you know, I think Bobby put it best.
234863	238745	Bobby Blackwolf, of course, the man who you hear before us on Sunday nights at VOG Network.
239825	244387	He said, you know, if I had to miss my first E3 in, I think he said it was...
245968	248270	Why do you think the bar is so low this year?
248310	251592	There is the Wii U. Is excitement really that low about Wii U or what?
266496	270723	I don't think the Wii U is doing enough different to make it like, ooh, wow.
271024	273107	It's not like the graphics are like, whoa, that much better.
273368	277414	Or, whoa, this is a totally new technology way of controlling things.
277615	278196	It's basically...
278703	287327	Hey, look, we made a big DS minus a D. But isn't this a good place for Nintendo to be, though?
287567	289628	I mean, I know that sounds really weird.
290228	301254	Nobody likes the negative buzz, and obviously E3 kind of left them with a very meh feeling, a lot of people walking out of the Wii U. But, I mean, when the bar is low, they really have the potential to...
301914	304436	For a whole year, they'll be on the cutting edge.
321693	332698	And even still, you know, even those new systems, you remember the very first, you know, games that were coming out on the, you know, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 just kind of looked like up-res PlayStation 2 and Xbox games.
333018	340102	So, it's not always, you know, the biggest, best looking, well, definitely never the best looking games at launch.
340282	342323	It's just, you know, ways after that.
343323	357672	Alright, so quickly, I know we kind of talked about this a little more in depth a couple weeks ago, so I don't want to dwell on this topic too long, but since this is our last chance before E3 officially hits and the press conferences start, what are your final predictions out of E3?
357872	359233	One prediction each for the big three.
359733	361734	What are your final big predictions out of E3?
362675	362995	Loki?
363115	363735	Or DarkSakura?
365236	366477	I'll be asleep when they're made.
369859	372661	Well, let me ask you, DarkSakura, do you have any interest in Wii U at all?
373519	374439	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
399966	408229	because when you say you're apathetic and you don't care it makes me think that Nintendo's just not doing anything to excite you that there's nothing that's happening there that you go oh this is new and fascinating
408735	409916	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
433431	435092	I'm not really excited about it.
435212	439015	I'm not going to be excited until I actually sit down and see it.
439876	444239	And granted, I feel somewhat similar, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.
444339	448482	I'm really hoping there's that one game that I gotta have.
448842	449382	But we'll see.
450043	451364	Loki, predictions for the big three?
453560	461342	I don't really know what Nintendo's... Just based on what they've rumored to be coming out in the new Mario game, New Super Mario Bros.
461402	467004	Me, which I think is what it's supposed to be.
467044	468604	Seriously, that does not appeal to me at all.
468744	469504	New Super Mario Bros.
469524	470404	didn't ever appeal to me.
470424	474125	I mean, I understand... Well, the one with the DS was pretty cool.
474986	476066	And then the Wii one came out.
476466	477746	And then number two's coming out.
477866	479147	And they all look the same.
479447	480907	It's just, I don't care.
482751	486534	I wish it would do something innovative.
488135	494479	Take one of those franchises like Mario or Zelda and do a little Big Planet thing with it.
494940	497762	Have this fucking amazing level editor with it.
498682	502506	You can even make it like an old 16-bit Zelda.
503006	503387	Do that.
503687	508712	Re-release that and have this fucking amazing level editor where you can share it online and stuff like that.
509072	511315	I'm going to bring you back because this isn't a prediction.
511375	512015	This is wank.
513597	515819	This is what you want to see.
515899	517100	This isn't what you're going to see.
517641	520463	I'm prepared to be completely underwhelmed by Nintendo.
520483	521224	That's my prediction.
524532	527213	They'll talk about all this wonderful stuff that the Wii U can do.
527674	534356	And it'll be just these stupid games that... Hey, look, it's WWE 13, but with this extra feature.
534996	538798	Oh, hey, look, it's Darksiders 2, but this extra feature.
538978	544280	Oh, hey, look, it's Batman Arkham City that came out last year, but it has this extra feature.
545000	545880	I don't fucking care.
545900	549422	That's not gonna make me... I'm not buying another console because it has a cool gimmick.
550703	552525	I want something that's going to be a little bit different.
553126	555789	The Wii was very different than what was out there on the market.
556169	557411	That's why I was interested in it.
558332	562858	And it was completely boring later on because there was nothing really good for it.
563659	565261	Nothing I really needed to have.
565523	566725	How about Microsoft and Sony?
581924	586628	I'm hoping we'll see... They'll probably announce their TV thing.
587168	590971	The whole initiative where they're going to have some sort of IPTV.
591091	591772	That'd be kind of nice.
592332	595735	Because all these little apps that they have that are tied to your cable.
596035	597517	Hey, you can have the Xfinity app.
598657	601720	Oh, but you have to have Xfinity in order to actually view any of the content on there.
601780	602260	Well, fuck.
602400	602821	You know what?
602921	603902	I can do that on my PC.
604042	604982	Why do I need your stupid...
607144	608765	It says very useless for me.
609305	612728	If it's something like, hey, you pay for Xbox Live and you get TV content with that.
614049	614349	Awesome.
614789	614889	Cool.
614909	616130	Now I don't have to pay for cable.
617031	620673	Of course, cable doesn't want you to do that, but we'll see.
621153	626057	And then for PlayStation, Sony, I mean, I don't know.
626337	629379	It's really, it kind of, it's going back to what we were saying before.
629439	630239	It's very meh.
630279	631780	There's nothing I'm really expecting.
632301	632801	That's the thing.
632841	635083	It's nothing like, oh, I can't wait to hear from,
636138	638200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
655680	658042	Gravity Rush I hear is kind of okay.
658062	659323	There's a demo out for Gravity Rush.
659343	662324	There's a demo out for both, but I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet.
663065	666347	I mean, I hear it's okay, but it's not like, woo, gotta have that.
666407	669989	Resistance was one of those things I was like, ooh, first-person shooter, that might be really cool.
670790	671950	And I hear it's just kind of meh.
672351	674752	So I'm like, well, crap.
675593	677954	Now I have to wait until the fall for some good games to come out.
679315	681957	And we're back to the 3DS again, where it's just like...
682637	683398	Well, crap.
683458	686162	You know, I gotta wait until the fall for some good games to come out.
686742	688505	It's like, am I gonna have to sell this system too?
689686	690687	Alright, I'll go real quick.
691208	696215	I think Nintendo obviously is gonna be very heavy on the Wii U and the 3DS.
696235	696255	I...
698297	702980	This may just be the fanboy wanking me, but I kind of think they're going to drop F-Zero on us and I'm going to have to get one.
703220	705402	I think that's what's going to ultimately happen.
706443	712547	And I think there'll be something kind of cool where that little tablet's going to have the map and kind of like the racer's cockpit or something.
712967	717250	And maybe something like being able to use power-ups and stuff will be all on the little touch screen.
717650	720432	And then the HD screen will be nothing but gorgeousness.
721132	726536	Again, possible fan wank, but there are rumors that that could be the big one that's being dropped.
726616	727817	So I'm just going to remain hopeful.
729619	744916	I really hope this is Nintendo's chance to finally prove that they get online and I think they are going to show that they get online finally but no more so than say Sony you know it's not going to be like oh my god Nintendo's the must have online so I think they'll do about as well as Sony
746877	747617	Microsoft.
748398	751419	I really don't know what they can do to impress me at this point.
751800	756462	Especially if they are going to be hedging their bets on two big first person shooters which usually aren't my kind of game.
757303	758644	I don't know what to think.
759464	760725	I want to see new franchises.
761085	762025	I really do too.
763506	766268	I want something to be on Kinect that's interesting.
766608	770150	There was that whole Gladiator game they showed last year that we never really heard anything about again.
770930	773632	I imagine they're going to show more of that this year but I'm not
774112	774913	It's Fable of Journey.
774933	776414	It's going to be their big Kinect game.
777534	778715	It's not on rails!
779275	780536	Well, you know what?
780596	783938	Again, a great example of where the bar is really effing low.
784439	786020	And here's a chance to blow me away.
786120	786620	So maybe.
786860	787080	Maybe.
787100	788541	Because I liked Fable 2.
789302	791003	I don't think there's ever going to be another good Fable.
791536	791936	We'll see.
792736	795597	I'd be willing to bet Rise isn't going to come out for this console.
797438	800659	The other thing I want to say about Microsoft, though, is I still think Windows 8.
801119	803980	I think Windows 8 gets dropped at some point during the conference.
804040	806941	It's Microsoft's big push at the end of the year as a company.
807241	808141	That whole synergy.
808381	810862	There's going to be something with your Xbox and Windows 8.
811122	811602	Just wait.
811863	812943	Oh, fantastic.
813363	813543	Yep.
814383	816284	I was watching a video of that interface today.
816964	825047	Granted, there are things that they've made improvements to, but that fucking Metro desktop is... That is all optional, right?
825167	826727	I don't have to use that, right?
826787	827287	I don't know.
827367	827908	Question mark?
828208	829728	It replaces the start menu.
830008	830488	Oh, boy.
830608	830909	All right.
832089	832469	Sony.
832809	837351	You know, Sony is so unpredictable, and yet I think is really predictable.
837391	839071	I mean, obviously, you're going to have the God of War.
839451	844753	You're going to have probably more hints of The Last Guardian and the PlayStation fighting game, but at the same time...
845013	846335	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
862697	870183	and I think there will still be, of course, more Vita and I'm hoping for more Vita, PlayStation 3 kind of, you know, togetherness.
871024	872064	So, we'll see.
872525	877949	There's that, what was that dungeon crawler game that never ended up coming out with the Vita's launch?
877969	879611	I don't remember what it's called now.
879631	880291	Vaporware the game?
880331	882033	No, something, it's like Diablo but not
882333	883575	They showed that off last year.
883595	884656	I imagine more of that.
884836	887639	They had the one that was at launch, the Ubisoft title that ties in.
887659	888400	No, no, no, no.
888420	888941	I'm not talking about that.
888961	890342	No, I know what you're talking about, the Sony one.
890803	891784	I don't remember what the hell it's called.
891804	892745	It's not Sorcery either.
892765	893606	That came out and that's the Vita.
893626	894046	No, it's not Sorcery.
894086	895107	No, I know what you're talking about.
895127	895348	Yeah.
895488	898311	Because they just were talking about like, oh, hey, where's that game?
898331	898551	Yeah.
899332	900293	I don't know.
920526	923447	I mean, there's some pretty cool ideas that they have for new franchises.
923567	924528	Remember Cameo?
925488	926409	The launch title for the 360?
927269	929630	That was really cool looking when they showed it off at E3.
930111	934953	It was okay when it came out, but it could have been a good sequel, huh?
935273	937534	It could have been a good title.
937574	942557	That type of game was pretty cool and not something that really the Xbox has from Microsoft.
942757	945978	They don't have that type of platforming like a Ratchet and Clank or something.
946379	948660	They need something like that.
950120	950541	All righty.
950861	953642	I'm going to move on here and start to get into tonight's news.
953842	958545	Just to kind of wrap things up, though, again, hopefully we're all pleasantly surprised.
958585	961647	I know we're feeling kind of eh about this year's E3.
963508	974334	I really hope it gets people buzzed because this Christmas could be quite a disaster for video games in general if there's not anything to get excited about.
974554	975235	That could be bad.
975575	976375	Here's one thing, though.
976556	981659	If the video game market could live through a recession, I don't know that it's going to have a problem.
981900	988465	Well, but if this year is bad, that could have a real impact on the Sony Microsoft consoles next year.
988545	990566	Oh, please, Grand Theft Auto for October.
990786	992327	Please, Grand Theft Auto for October.
992608	992968	We'll see.
993188	994589	You know, actually, what is that?
994609	996010	The Lego City stories.
996290	997171	Still want to hear about that.
998312	1001354	That actually might sell me a Wii U. Maybe.
1001895	1002175	Maybe.
1002984	1005006	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1022262	1027646	Also, by the time you guys hear this, the full VOGnetwork.com website should have launched.
1028507	1032389	I have to think what tense to use here.
1032729	1039294	So, since you guys are hearing this Sunday, we had a special on Friday talking about the future of the network.
1039714	1045378	I don't want to repeat it here because it's like 95% a go right now, but there is a chance it could be delayed to the 8th.
1045498	1046259	We will has had.
1046579	1048140	Yes, you will has had by this point.
1048581	1053365	My hope is, though, by the time you guys are hearing this, the full VOGnetwork.com website did, in fact, launch.
1053765	1057508	So check it out and just... It's going to be awesome.
1057528	1062372	There were unicorns and rainbows and... I don't know about unicorns, but there may be rainbows.
1062752	1067836	There was definitely a unicorn on the test site, but I think that's being removed for the full... There were sheep.
1068157	1068897	That was interesting.
1068917	1069318	There were sheep.
1070629	1070889	DarkSakura
1098884	1100285	All the E3 talk got me sidetracked.
1100305	1101546	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1102226	1103507	We've only had half a week, too.
1104707	1109450	I played... Actually, Dan got the new Arkham City expansion.
1110230	1111591	The Harley Quinn's Revenge.
1111871	1112792	Oh yeah, that looked really neat.
1112852	1117434	I watched about half of it and then I had to go to bed because I had taken NyQuil and I was like...
1119237	1120798	You play a lot of it as Robin.
1123039	1129241	As much as I liked Harley Quinn's voice actor, she gets really annoying after a while, so whatever.
1132182	1139284	Also, for fans of certain little Easter eggs that were found in the game before, you're going to get pissed off.
1139744	1140325	So, just saying.
1141545	1142365	Don't get your hopes up.
1142565	1142825	Okay.
1144787	1146709	I already know exactly what it's gotta be, alright.
1148571	1157561	So anyway, I played, I had this really good streak in Fractal, which I love that fucking game.
1157841	1159162	Fractal is so fun.
1160084	1164508	And I had a really good streak and then I got pissed off at the game again and stopped playing.
1165429	1178674	So, um, then I played like some WoW and played some Star Trek Online only to find out that they completely redid your skills and it's stupid.
1178694	1182755	So I'm like, I don't have my kick-ass bomb skills anymore.
1182775	1185697	Don't you hate that when you leave an MMO and then you come back and they change everything?
1186057	1186497	Yeah.
1186697	1186797	Ugh.
1188507	1193814	But apparently, like, some of the stuff I have, my legacy items are pretty good, so.
1193835	1194335	Oh, that's good.
1194415	1198461	I'm still the, the, I'm still an Admiral piloting a Defiant.
1198669	1200251	Are you still playing with all the Scottish people?
1200551	1201172	I weren't on.
1201572	1203835	Only a couple people were on and they weren't the Scotsmen.
1203995	1204776	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
1205898	1206899	They're apparently all still there.
1206959	1208541	They're just there at weird times.
1209442	1209842	Probably.
1210503	1210783	All right.
1211004	1211945	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1212145	1212966	I played Minecraft.
1213547	1214528	Of course you did.
1215068	1216230	I played lots of Minecraft.
1217932	1218773	I built a giant pig.
1221075	1223216	Oh, God, I saw the pictures on your Twitter.
1223636	1228918	When you say you built a giant pig, you must have found the pixel layout somewhere online.
1228938	1230518	There is a guide online.
1230858	1231478	Oh, my gosh.
1232339	1234099	I love, it was like a hollow pig.
1234139	1235380	You could climb up the ladder.
1235400	1236560	Yeah, you can climb up the ladder into it.
1236680	1237120	It's a house.
1237360	1238521	You live in its butt.
1238701	1239261	You can live inside.
1239461	1240982	And guess, actually, here's the best part.
1241002	1243142	It's like the dinosaurs in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.
1243202	1244763	Remember when they go to watch the sunrise?
1245123	1246384	You can live in a pig's ass.
1264118	1264478	I don't know.
1264598	1265999	I just thought that would be fun.
1266019	1267099	I'm like, what do I want to build next?
1267119	1267920	I'll build a giant pig.
1268120	1268881	That thing is scary.
1269021	1272483	Because I'll be running through and then I'll look at when I'll see this pig.
1273403	1276245	And it's just like, it's always there staring at you.
1276345	1277986	Hey, hey, hey, I have a question for you.
1278587	1280388	Can you make a slide?
1280488	1282929	Because you could totally make a tongue slide for your pig.
1284190	1285591	You can make a water slide.
1286161	1288562	You can make, you should make a drooling pig water slide.
1288582	1290363	Are you going to make a water slide out of its bum?
1290383	1291223	Because that's kind of gross.
1291323	1291583	No.
1291643	1293364	Do it in its mouth so it can be the drooling pig.
1293424	1304308	I'm not making, I thought about making, see, I was going to have that pig and I was going to have, like, another pig that I reskin, like, you know, to make it all evil looking, like with glowing eyes and fire and, like, spikes.
1304348	1305088	Darth Pig.
1305108	1306108	Darth Pig.
1306188	1309170	Da, da, da, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink.
1310810	1314273	It was funny, though, because all the pigs keep wandering around the giant pig.
1314313	1316154	It's like they're worshipping the idol.
1319116	1320117	Wow.
1320297	1322058	All hail our bacon-y god!
1323559	1328983	But yeah, and another thing, too, Rob, since we're on the same map.
1329283	1330864	You know I started a new map, actually.
1330884	1331164	What?!
1331985	1333806	Yeah, I'm on seed OLR.
1333866	1335267	I'm not on seed VOG anymore.
1335467	1336308	I got sick of VOG.
1337208	1338549	I'm sick of OLR, too, actually.
1338969	1341071	You need to go back to VOG, because you know why?
1341091	1352739	Because if you go to the bottom, was it the bottom, the southwestern portion of the map, there's this giant hole that goes straight into the ground with a waterfall in it and stuff, and it's pretty awesome inside there.
1353059	1353460	That's cool.
1354440	1355021	You know what you need to do?
1355041	1357122	You need to put a video on YouTube of your giant pig.
1357182	1358983	Once I'm done.
1363130	1370835	Well, I'm going to have... I've already... I'm planning on making a giant roller coaster ride thing or possibly... Oh, my God.
1371215	1373236	They even have water slides that you can make.
1373256	1375797	You can make a water slide thing with jumps and all this cool stuff.
1375837	1377618	What has happened just three months ago?
1377918	1380219	I should go find a clip from this show just three months ago.
1380300	1381160	Minecraft?
1381220	1381620	What the hell?
1381820	1383001	Why do people play Minecraft?
1383041	1384122	I don't get this game.
1384222	1385182	Or just ask DarkSakura.
1385322	1386763	Hey, DarkSakura, what do you think of Minecraft?
1388499	1392140	Yeah, and then Loki in the meantime, I'm gonna make a fucking Minecraft theme park!
1392180	1392701	Woo!
1393681	1394461	You know what, though?
1394741	1400744	As soon as somebody either pays for me to have an account or gets it to me for free somehow... Just play the demo.
1401744	1402804	No, I don't like demos.
1402824	1404165	I'll pay for you to quit complaining.
1406038	1407759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1433928	1439836	Remember back when I had the volume and the little thing said give me a dollar?
1440637	1441819	People did send me dollars.
1442740	1443421	A couple people.
1443761	1444783	Someone sent me a $2 bill.
1445003	1446886	Kickstarter to buy Jamie Minecraft.
1446906	1448027	This was before Kickstarter.
1448047	1449029	They should be paying me.
1449861	1450382	Alright, anyhow.
1450462	1451823	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1451883	1452825	I played a little bit of Call of Duty.
1452865	1456970	We actually played a Kill Confirmed game with just the three of us, so that was fun.
1458391	1462817	We just don't play a lot of Call of Duty anymore because everyone's really busy and my co-worker's out for a couple weeks.
1464779	1466341	So I get more Minecraft time then.
1468663	1470505	But, yeah, I started getting bored, though.
1470605	1474007	Like, because I'm like, well, I don't know really what else to do in here.
1474788	1476169	You know, and so, I don't know.
1476209	1476569	We'll see.
1476849	1478951	So, I may actually go start a new seed at some point.
1479011	1480292	But, I don't know.
1480312	1482033	How's the old R seed?
1482133	1483154	Not that great, actually.
1483214	1484895	But then again, I haven't explored the entire map.
1485035	1488898	But I can tell you, the underground really annoys the hell out of me.
1488938	1493762	And there's some weird... There's like... Okay, if you want, like, just this gigantic mountain...
1495043	1501992	I would almost play it just to see how different it is.
1502172	1508740	There's some seeds I've seen that are really crazy, like just valleys inside of a mountain with lava and water and all sorts of...
1509381	1521950	Well, whenever we get those VOG forums that may or may not be there I have no idea what the crap you guys are talking about You should share some of your awesome seeds for Minecraft Alright, look, let's move on What seed?
1521970	1537261	You tell it what word you give it You can give it random numbers and letters You give it a word and you can make a world that uses that as the seed But the good thing about that is that if I use capital V, capital O, capital G and he uses the same thing, we have the same world essentially
1538121	1540242	Even though it's kind of randomized, if that makes sense.
1541582	1546923	I'm just thinking of Final Fantasy VIII now, where there were seed members in their gardens.
1546963	1547723	No, no.
1547943	1548803	All right, My Gaming Week.
1549844	1556265	Honestly, I've been working on the website, not as much as Bobby has, but I still have been working on that quite a bit this week, so I haven't had a whole lot of time to game.
1556705	1559466	When I have gamed, I've played a little bit of Warcraft.
1559746	1562527	Shane and I have been running some dungeons to get heirlooms for the monks.
1562807	1564327	We will inevitably roll in the expansion.
1565127	1568310	and otherwise I checked out the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer expansion.
1569571	1571452	Is it the Rebellion Pack or was that the last one?
1571572	1572073	I don't know.
1573053	1573614	Recruit Pack.
1573634	1574835	Something war related.
1574915	1583341	Another freaking multiplayer pack came out this week and it adds the two male Quarians, the two Cerberus defectors and the two Vorcha.
1584702	1586523	Dang, people are already unlocking shit.
1586963	1592865	I went into a random and I already was playing with a male Corian, which was kind of neat to just kind of see one running around.
1594025	1595366	And I got to play on one of the new maps.
1595826	1596926	So there are two new maps.
1597146	1601028	One of them is, I think it's Thessia was the one I was playing on because it's based off that one.
1601048	1604789	Well, I don't want to spoil it because it's staged near the end of the game, but something big happens there.
1605669	1624499	so I was yeah I was having a good time on that map and apparently there's a new type of credit game too on the third sixth and tenth wave you have to do something different than just killing everybody it's either like hit the four beacons or upload all the data now there's a new one that's kind of like fetch it and bring it back
1625359	1649606	so and it's kind of like Murderball where the person who's carrying it walks really slow and is more vulnerable to attack so I kind of like that they're doing different things with it you know Mass Effect good times after finally having played the entire fucking trilogy up to this point it's kind of nice to be current and get to experience a lot of this Mass Effect hubble when it's current so that part's cool all right now we can do gaming news right yes all right let's do it
1650066	1650487	Or The Phantom
1668499	1668679	SnakeOil
1691263	1691643	Forget it.
1712932	1713412	Thanks for watching!
1724079	1728001	to coexist with regular stuff like renting titles or stuff like that.
1728061	1731782	But it's never going to be you just play.
1732002	1736264	Until it's the holodeck, there will always be a need for another console.
1736544	1738725	Or until it will suck your dick.
1739105	1739905	Let's be real.
1740546	1745888	The console either has to be the holodeck or if they build the console that sucks your dick, then they don't need anything else.
1745908	1746308	Well, I lose out.
1746928	1747188	What?
1747368	1748369	Well, I'm losing out there.
1748649	1749289	Well, now, now, now.
1749929	1750950	It'll be the holodeck.
1750990	1752150	You can demand whores in the holodeck.
1752170	1753511	It'll be an inverter for women.
1754231	1757535	But I'm just saying, though, there's never... In terms of the vacuum attachment.
1758676	1765002	There's never... Well, even when those, you know, even the blowjob machine and the holodeck come out, they're going to need to make improvements to that.
1765022	1767145	There's always going to be improvements done to everything.
1768586	1769207	That's true.
1769547	1771249	It would be too bad if you get a glitchy hoe.
1772270	1774732	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
1774892	1776214	Let it go, let it go, let it go.
1777910	1780895	No, female attachment, not the male attachment.
1782938	1783378	Bad.
1783398	1783959	Anyways, so...
1787190	1788870	Yeah, I mean, it could be interesting.
1790591	1792791	I guess we'll have to wait and see what's going on there.
1793291	1798453	I'm sure that announcement next week will be in the works if they are going to do something like that.
1799633	1800673	It makes a lot of sense.
1801233	1802054	It doesn't make a lot of sense.
1802094	1814116	I mean, they could do a lot of different... I mean, I don't think it's going to be only that because another thing that they considered, at least Sony did, was making it online only.
1814136	1815777	Yeah.
1816577	1841693	yeah think about this though real quick if they do adopt like a cloud gaming thing then they can have all the fucking control you know what I mean think about it because when it's in there they get all of the fucking control like they could release like a beta game or something that you could play for like an hour and then it's like pulled you know it's like and then the advertisements right in the middle of it and there's nothing you can do about it like that part of it's kind of
1842914	1843634	Interesting to me.
1843794	1846935	Yeah, they could do that, and then everybody else doesn't do that, and then no one plays it.
1849136	1851656	So, I don't know.
1851756	1862259	But, yeah, basically they ultimately rejected the idea of a download-only console because they remembered, hey, we released something called the PlayStation Portable Go, and that sucked.
1863279	1865980	So they decided not to do that instead.
1867080	1867921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1889324	1892687	Or even better, it's like Sony puts out online-only consoles.
1892927	1895690	Servers for online console are being throttled.
1895770	1897631	No one can play anything on their console.
1898672	1899373	Fantastic.
1899853	1903496	But if you buy the special Xfinity version, then it won't count against your cap.
1905238	1907039	Comcast subsidized two-year agreement.
1907079	1907600	I'm telling you.
1907620	1910302	I mean, seriously, if it goes online-only, hey, guess what?
1910943	1912004	Guess what, console makers?
1912684	1914005	Here's a little fact for you.
1915140	1916001	Thanks for watching!
1930680	1937302	Well, it's funny you bring up PC games because Diablo 3 is one of the big PC games, of course, in the world right now.
1937722	1942183	And as you know, they've been having quite a few issues, especially launch day was really bad.
1942543	1948805	It got a little better for a little bit, but just within the past couple days before we're taping this show, apparently there's been more error 37s.
1949185	1951326	The auction house has been delayed and so on.
1951726	1955767	Well, one country is taking this shit seriously and it's Korea.
1956167	1958068	They take their Diablo series, they take all their Blizzard games seriously.
1958108	1961350	Man, I knew that those WoW subscriptions were expensive, but man, that they're collecting souls now, that's just ridiculous.
1961410	1961650	Stop it.
1979858	1986602	Blizzard apparently refused to refund Diablo 3 to Korean players who should have been eligible after consumer complaints.
1987022	1992825	The FTC thinks that Blizzard is violating Korean law on electronic commerce and commercial contracts.
1992845	1996827	They're trying to gather evidence and so forth related to this raid.
1997107	2002049	Korean players are frustrated with the server issues happening in Diablo 3 and asking for refunds.
2002129	2004590	Blizzard denied it saying contract terms.
2004691	2005431	You know that whole little...
2008192	2016214	The FTC is considering these terms to not be good to the player base, as you can imagine.
2016614	2020095	Quote, we have received many complaints from Diablo 3 users.
2020515	2026437	So, just like people here complain to the government, it's happening in Korea too, and they raided the office.
2026537	2030518	Well, I always have a problem with those contracts, if you will, anyways, because...
2031098	2033559	I'm not presenting that contract before I purchase the item.
2033699	2038661	It's like I get this sprung upon me once I open the box and try and install and play the game.
2039221	2041502	At that point, it's like, too fucking late.
2041562	2042082	Ha ha.
2042182	2044063	You either agree to this or you get nothing.
2045123	2058628	Now, one very interesting note I want to share is according to the Korea Times, the FTC is investigating if Blizzard should be liable for its ill preparation in regards to player traffic.
2060006	2083580	I don't know if I've ever heard anything like that before that's interesting basically that Blizzard could be responsible for not being prepared for how big their game was going to be I don't know why but I find that fucking fascinating and I think that they should be liable because they had a beta they knew how much traffic was going to be in there and they need to have enough servers and they didn't I mean come on
2084693	2085995	You need to expect the worst case scenario.
2086015	2087116	You need to have those extra servers.
2087136	2087997	Stop trying to cut costs.
2102230	2102911	Because you know what?
2103111	2105613	He didn't have to make this an online only fucking game.
2106153	2106853	That's your fault.
2107754	2121084	Now, you know, looking ahead here, if something were to happen, and let's say the game gets pulled in Korea or something, it's not actually the worst case scenario for Blizzard because the real money auction house already doesn't exist in Asia.
2121424	2123306	And I believe that was also because of Korea.
2123326	2124046	I wouldn't let them do it.
2124566	2128810	So, it's still one to watch though.
2128830	2130271	This is kind of unprecedented.
2130951	2134072	So I'm very curious to see what comes of this.
2134772	2141335	If anything, this could also just be, you know, for headlines and, you know, to let everybody know we are not messing around, people.
2141975	2144396	This could just end up being a big slap on the wrist and negative press.
2144576	2144876	Who knows?
2146236	2147537	There's no such thing as negative press.
2147977	2148677	There's only press.
2149957	2150858	Interesting way to look at it.
2151938	2152658	Well, it's true.
2152678	2154359	What about press with a negative slant?
2155139	2156420	What about Lee press on nails?
2156880	2156920	Ew.
2157040	2157100	Ew.
2159082	2160963	Tacky in more ways than one.
2162644	2166406	Well, speaking of tacky, Konami, bitches.
2167827	2174831	So, how many of us were led to believe that the Silent Hill HD collection was a port?
2176091	2179713	That they were porting and then reskinning and redoing voices and stuff?
2179853	2181414	Up to the part with the fog?
2181674	2182695	Yeah, I kind of thought that.
2183175	2187218	Well, it was actually not ported from the final version of the game.
2187318	2191241	It was ported from incomplete source code.
2191481	2197406	They actually lost the source codes for the Silent Hill games.
2198206	2201889	The missing source code parts were replaced with frog DNA.
2203010	2204351	And that's how they got Jurassic Park.
2205751	2210554	Well, here is what the producer, Tom Hewlett, had to say.
2230587	2235010	So it looks like they just were working with what was left over.
2235430	2240153	It was sort of like what you do when you've got leftover spaghetti, but you don't have enough to make a full meal out of it.
2240593	2243355	So you make a sandwich or something out of your spaghetti.
2243835	2244876	A spaghetti sandwich.
2244896	2245336	I've done it.
2245496	2245856	Wow.
2246076	2246837	I was in college.
2247237	2248398	You know what, ladies and gentlemen?
2248478	2254881	I don't think any other gaming podcast in the history of ever would compare Silent Hill HD to a spaghetti sandwich, but there you go.
2254901	2255462	They're both terrible.
2257623	2258984	I don't know, spaghetti sandwiches.
2259244	2263467	Cold spaghetti sandwich on sourdough bread is actually okay.
2264207	2265348	Just saying, just saying.
2266068	2267769	It's kind of like a sloppy joe with noodles.
2267869	2269550	Subway sells meatball sandwiches.
2269570	2271251	They're not very good either.
2271311	2278055	I was going to say, though, that's why we had all the issues because they used frog DNA instead of fog DNA.
2278075	2280517	There's no fog in there because they didn't use the right DNA.
2280957	2283298	Uh-uh-uh, you didn't say the magic word.
2283658	2284379	Uh-uh-uh.
2287150	2293113	Well, the other thing, the other quote in here was saying, and this is actually pretty funny, I'm going to read this, okay.
2293833	2304217	A lot of issues such as textures and sound had to be taken out of the compiled game, and that brings with it a host of unique issues, especially when taken on top of the tricky coding workarounds at play in the original games.
2304637	2306978	We certainly had our hands full, I think at one point Heather was blue.
2310060	2312861	La la la la la la la la la la la la.
2313444	2317029	Well, if you can't cut it, then don't make the game.
2319832	2323938	But there's deadlines and investors and stuff.
2325520	2326321	Angry internets.
2327648	2338038	I mean, if people have decompiled the release versions of the games, why couldn't they just do the same thing?
2338058	2348488	Well, I look at shit like that Sonic HD that outdid Sonic 4 Episode 1, and I kind of go, they did it without the original source code.
2349308	2349629	Yeah.
2351028	2357191	or wasn't the Streets of Rage HD collection done with completely original programming?
2357871	2360533	Yeah, there was that fan one, yeah.
2360613	2362133	Those are all both 2D stuff.
2362854	2367076	And once again, this wasn't necessarily something that they needed to make.
2367496	2368716	They had put these games out before.
2370580	2371621	Why did they feel compelled?
2371701	2372281	Oh, I know, money.
2372441	2373602	Because they wanted a quick buck.
2373722	2376144	I'm glad I didn't buy it, honestly.
2376304	2378405	Where did they put the source code?
2378465	2381468	You would think that kind of stuff goes in a vault somewhere.
2381488	2384149	Akira Yamaoka smuggled it out in his butt.
2384970	2385610	Clearly.
2386531	2388272	He left Konami and took it with him.
2389333	2393496	I guess a drive could get demagnetized or something, but how do you lose source code?
2393556	2395898	That's why you make backups.
2395918	2396258	Backups.
2396838	2398201	I bet someone could find it on eBay.
2398221	2399603	Did you check behind the couch?
2399924	2400785	I'm going to look online.
2401226	2402568	Silent Hill Source Code.
2403189	2403950	Alright, moving on.
2404211	2410301	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for games coming to a store near you that are hopefully finished.
2411843	2412544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2433402	2439855	And then, of course, Madagascar 3, tying in the new movie that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and DS.
2445262	2447744	The new play control stuff is being re-released.
2448004	2453569	We've got the Mario Power Tennis on the Wii, which is a port of the GameCube game.
2453629	2457933	And then Pikmin 2, because Pikmin 2 never came out over here for some reason.
2458513	2463658	One of those, oh hey, we localized this game, but oh, we forgot to release it in the other territory.
2463678	2466380	That whole new play control thing, right?
2467261	2468382	Well, yeah, it came out in 2009.
2468422	2469603	We should put out a game on the Wii.
2469623	2469703	Yeah.
2472452	2473453	No, it's seriously.
2473753	2477556	Hey, you know that the Wii is just like a GameCube.
2477596	2481359	We could take GameCube games and we'll add the Wii controls to it.
2482260	2486484	Yes, you kind of have to add the Wii controls to it because there are no GameCube controls.
2486924	2492368	In fact, that's actually a guarantee on some of the new consoles because there's no GameCube controller ports.
2493149	2494570	Or backwards compatibility anymore.
2495511	2496532	Or backwards compatibility, yes.
2496752	2497212	Very true.
2497232	2498654	Oh, oh, oh.
2501283	2506450	And if you're a Sims 3 fan, Jamie... I lost count.
2506490	2509313	Sims 3 Katy Perry Sweet Treats Pack.
2509553	2511776	More Katy Perry!
2512016	2513578	Just in time for the movie.
2513659	2515921	I have actually officially stopped playing Sims 3.
2517782	2527492	Because they never, every time they would release it, they would never work out how to get it to not have the crappy slowdown issue with your add-ons and stuff.
2527552	2529034	You know what this calls for?
2529615	2531416	Katy Perry Simlish music!
2531677	2532458	That was a good video.
2545891	2547733	It actually is a cute little video.
2549756	2550277	She's not in it.
2550317	2550857	Oh, I forget it.
2551418	2552319	I need to stop shading.
2552900	2557366	Alright, and that's, I kid you not, that's literally it.
2557686	2563974	Unless you count Max Payne 3, which technically for us is coming out tomorrow, but it would have been out on Friday.
2565215	2583412	Alright, on PC Let's travel to Japan and check out the release dates over there Not a whole lot to get excited about but there's a couple games here and there On the PlayStation 3, Tokyo Jungle comes out this week and I'm not sure exactly what this game is Sounds like a zombie game Fucking amazing is what it is
2583892	2584132	Is it?
2584252	2585133	It is awesome.
2585173	2586234	Let's see the description here.
2586314	2588295	Humans disappeared from Tokyo all of a sudden.
2588435	2589596	Oh, so it's like 28 days later.
2589676	2590177	And you play.
2590297	2592458	Leaving the animals to fend for themselves.
2592498	2592738	Yes.
2593079	2596081	Play the game as various animals in this apocalyptic scene.
2596421	2598923	Learn to hunt, gather, and mark territory.
2599343	2601044	P. Game of the year.
2601144	2601865	No, I'm serious.
2601905	2602845	This is fucking amazing.
2602865	2603686	You need to watch this.
2603726	2604246	You play by P?
2604266	2604607	Right now.
2605607	2605927	Okay.
2606228	2608069	I will watch this right now if it will look good.
2608089	2608769	This is Africa good.
2608789	2609930	I'm rubbing up on buildings.
2610971	2611671	Africa good.
2611792	2612252	Africa good.
2613018	2614379	Well, where is it?
2615380	2618163	Just type the game's title on the YouTube, you'll find it.
2618443	2619144	Tokyo Jungle.
2619204	2620025	Where did you hear about this?
2621206	2622668	From them talking about Tokyo Jungle.
2622748	2623569	Is this coming out here?
2623969	2625891	No, but at least I don't think it is.
2626171	2626892	It very well could.
2627593	2636501	I posted actually a thing on Twitter about it because they were talking about dogs and stuff like that, palmerians.
2637582	2638503	You get to be a Pomeranian?
2638523	2640604	Yes, you can be a Pomeranian.
2640644	2641705	This is a stinking ad.
2641725	2642305	I don't know.
2642345	2643006	Let's wait for this.
2643146	2646388	Buy me 30 seconds.
2646468	2647428	They have Pomeranians.
2647448	2648449	They have wolves.
2648509	2651531	You can play as horses, cows.
2652311	2653632	And they have different rabbits.
2653752	2654412	Can you be a fox?
2654812	2655953	I think you could be a fox.
2655973	2656533	You might be able to.
2656653	2659434	And then, the best part about it is you unlock costumes for them.
2659474	2661995	So you can get an elephant in roller skates and you can dress them up.
2662595	2663875	I need this game.
2663915	2665736	It's a ridiculous looking game.
2665796	2667797	I mean, it's just... I need this game.
2667817	2668217	It's just crazy.
2668257	2670118	Anyways, so now... Here we go.
2670458	2671358	Alright, Tokyo Jungle.
2673259	2674079	And it's by Sony.
2674919	2676120	Or published by Sony.
2677860	2678740	Oh, it's Japan Studio.
2678760	2679121	Okay.
2682142	2682782	Krispies!
2683712	2684672	How many freaking publishers?
2684692	2684952	Okay.
2687973	2689613	Okay, so we just see like an abandoned city.
2690293	2690914	Tokyo.
2692194	2693454	Tokyo.
2694994	2695795	Dog.
2695815	2697575	That wasn't a dog.
2697595	2698915	That was like a panther person.
2703796	2705497	This is really terrible radio, y'all.
2706437	2707737	I'm trying to remember.
2707917	2710118	There was Akotaku.
2710158	2710998	I think it was today.
2711058	2712238	There was a video on there.
2713120	2723379	Tokyo Jungle Come on, kick into gear, show me the peeing I want to see some dogs peeing
2723931	2728414	Lions, Bulldogs, Gazelles, and Beagles
2753570	2754191	Giraffes.
2756293	2757153	The hell game.
2757554	2758074	Cow.
2760256	2764200	Dude, I want to fight between panda bears killing each other.
2764440	2766001	That was a brown bear and a panda bear.
2766022	2767243	That's pandemonium.
2767283	2769545	Chickies and piggies.
2769705	2771166	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2771186	2773969	Did we see those two dogs were about to mount each other?
2774709	2774950	Okay.
2776297	2777739	Where the fuck is this game?
2779882	2781664	I will import this shit if I have to.
2781744	2782686	This looks astounding.
2782726	2783607	This looks amazing.
2784428	2786110	Are they going to show this at E3 next week?
2786130	2787031	I don't know.
2787372	2788253	That would be hilarious.
2788293	2790456	Rob, let's get this game since there's no region coding.
2791657	2795859	Animal Dance, Animal Dance, Animal Dance.
2795899	2797539	Like they could set the trailer to that music.
2797559	2798439	It would be amazing.
2798479	2799720	No, you know what they should set it to?
2800000	2801220	What?
2801360	2803401	Gilda Radner, Let's Talk Geordie to the Animals.
2803841	2806562	This is the new President Cat as far as I'm concerned.
2806602	2807423	Let's face it, y'all.
2807783	2808863	President Cat ain't happening.
2808883	2810164	Now I want Tokyo Jungle.
2810184	2811384	I posted a link on my Twitter.
2811704	2812265	It was today.
2812605	2813066	All right.
2813866	2817931	The story is like in Tokyo, little dogs are the king of the jungle.
2817991	2823056	And it's basically talking about it's the commercial, I guess, I think, for the game.
2823817	2825418	But yeah, it's seriously awesome.
2825458	2825699	All right.
2825779	2829523	So, yeah, that is now one to kind of keep your eye on is Tokyo Jungle.
2829663	2830003	I want.
2830183	2830664	Oh, man.
2832173	2833874	Watch, that'll be like... Bring that to the Vita.
2834074	2840196	That'll be in the corner of the Sony booth somewhere, like some poor intern doesn't even know anything about the game and has to show it.
2841177	2841697	Oh my gosh.
2841757	2842397	Africa.
2843338	2843638	Africa.
2844318	2845559	That's what Africa should have been.
2846479	2847820	That was Africa with killing.
2848320	2849841	Tokyo Jungle.
2851181	2859189	on the PlayStation Vita, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny, and a Hello Kitty game, Hello Kitty Toeiso Block Crash 5.
2860070	2860891	But let's be real.
2860971	2864315	You're all waiting for June 14th when Persona 4 comes out on the Vita.
2864375	2866157	Let's just be real right there.
2866217	2866597	Exactly.
2868299	2871142	Moving on, lastly, to the Xbox 360.
2872663	2874885	No, nothing until Lollipop Chainsaw on the 14th.
2875306	2876327	I want to play that.
2876687	2877628	It does look pretty awesome, huh?
2877908	2878989	All right, let's move on to the UK.
2880511	2883834	On June 5th, Madagascar 3 is a video game.
2884675	2886957	I was having to do my... I should do my riff-raff voice.
2888358	2889780	Master... No.
2889800	2890981	Master...
2891201	2917750	on June 6th we have Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown and June 8th Dungeon Bowl which I have no idea what it's about but hey it's got a neat name Chair of Swords for PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 I'm sorry Game of Boring I mean Thrones Chair of Swords and Rayman Origins Chair of Swords alright just a few more stories for you guys I did see one cool thing having to do with that show what?
2918050	2919491	the doctor sitting on the throne what?
2920251	2923576	Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
2923656	2924438	But first, Loki.
2924718	2928043	So, there are a couple of court cases resolved themselves this week.
2929565	2932630	Epic has one lawsuit against Silicon Knights.
2933151	2935855	As you may remember, Silicon Knights was complaining that...
2936201	2951763	Unreal Engine is too hard to program and that's why two humans sucked it wasn't because we can't make a good game um and they lost so um they owe now 4.45 million dollars to Epic and um
2953393	2962176	Yeah, of course, they are disappointed with the outcome, Silicon Knights, and they're going to appeal because it can never end.
2963617	2976021	And then finally, Activision is also expected back in court again because Judge has okayed, no doubt, to continue their lawsuit for their appearance in Band Hero.
2976041	2978842	You may remember that they claimed the agreement...
2979382	2983765	was that they would sing their songs as their characters because they have themselves in the game.
2983845	2988968	However, you can sing anybody's songs with anybody's characters and so some people took offense to that.
2989808	2993290	And so now they apparently can file their lawsuit.
2994971	3000014	I keep feeling like every few months we hear that that lawsuit has slowly progressed.
3000074	3001895	Slowly.
3002095	3003636	It was originally filed in 2009.
3003716	3005076	It's been a long time.
3006117	3007218	Our justice system at work.
3008382	3010865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3029565	3031606	Most of this sounds plausible.
3031746	3034067	Here's the latest features in the latest dev kit.
3034847	3039789	Video chat available, but it must be from the main menu of the system, not while playing a game.
3040369	3041769	That seems plausible.
3042550	3046391	Voice commands available.
3046891	3049732	Facial recognition similar to the Xbox Kinect.
3050410	3053512	Ability to share achievements with friends by sending videos or screenshots with drawings on them.
3075694	3076554	That would be pretty cool.
3076734	3082157	That could make the internet a lot more fun, if you think about it.
3082437	3084557	The TTP possibilities with that are quite quick.
3085058	3088059	Yeah, so that could... Achievement, penis!
3090180	3100064	Imagine that the game, like, you know, right up to you getting the achievement actually takes a video, not just of, like, your feet in game, but also, like, video of your face, like Burnout.
3100384	3102685	You remember that Burnout game that would, like, show video of you?
3102765	3103665	Basically, it's Pikura.
3104886	3105706	This could be interesting.
3107587	3108727	Other interesting one.
3109027	3110507	I want to know if you think this is plausible.
3111027	3113208	Watch a friend play online.
3115128	3121029	Well, they kind of have that with spectating, but not all games support that like on Xbox 360, so maybe.
3122129	3122489	Why not?
3122529	3127750	It would definitely see the technologies there and people are doing it with, you know, Ustream and Twitch TV and all this stuff.
3128330	3130771	People are just sitting there watching other people play games.
3131491	3132071	It would be cool.
3132191	3132411	I mean...
3136526	3141913	Multitasking Keep a text or video walkthrough open from the site while playing the game.
3142274	3143656	Swap back and forth as needed.
3151065	3177405	um you can't like have the internet and your game going because those are two different applications but you can have your game going and then you can like I don't there's not a lot you can do with the game suspended I don't think because you really like if you launch anything else it says you can go look at your friends list on the 3ds notifications that's about anything the Vita I know you can because you can like open stuff and as long as you're not trying to run two games at the same time
3178385	3179326	I can see that it's possible.
3179346	3182527	Also, with the other screen, maybe have a walkthrough on there.
3182887	3183268	Could be.
3183988	3196274	So, hey, if this is all true, especially kind of like the video screenshot drawing stuff, that's the kind of stuff that I would like Nintendo to surprise us with that would make me go, oh, okay, maybe they do get online.
3197014	3197554	So we'll see.
3198114	3201356	Of course, this could just all be fan wank and come visit my website.
3201926	3207049	Well, and the other thing, too, is I don't know how much of this they would actually be talking about at E3, you know what I mean?
3207069	3209731	That's a lot of bullet points for stuff.
3209811	3215154	Oh, well, I think all that would come to light in the press announcements or the behind the scenes.
3215174	3220177	I'm like, it's not going to be at the keynote, but you'd see it behind the scenes.
3220217	3226080	A lot of that stuff tends to come out of interviews and stuff and sites going in asking the questions, is this true, is this true?
3226501	3228722	You know, and some of the stuff they read on the internet, so...
3230031	3235919	Alright, well, enough of all this newfangled Wii U drawing penises on your achievement stuff.
3235959	3238943	Let's go back to a time when games were a little bit simpler.
3239424	3242968	Take a trip down memory lane with a classic game of the week.
3243830	3246894	DarkSakura's gonna step into the vault and pull out one game that she thinks, hey!
3248075	3250458	Play this or GTFO.
3250978	3252840	We didn't have GTFO when I was little.
3252941	3254142	It was get off my lawn.
3254883	3256725	Here it is, your classic game of the week.
3257225	3258126	It's Guitar Freaks.
3259027	3259888	Wow.
3260609	3263252	It is a music game by Konami where you use a guitar.
3263712	3266956	That should just be all that you need to know, but let's go a bit further than that.
3268557	3271821	Basically, it's mostly rock and J-pop.
3273703	3286876	Seriously, even every source that you look at is going to say, oh, that's what led to Guitar Hero, even though they tried to deny it in my living room that it was because of guitar freaks.
3287739	3292163	Now it's on its 19th version, Guitar Freaks V8, which came out March 28th, 2011.
3294365	3307418	And it is said to be the final release of Guitar Freaks V. There will be a spin-off Guitar Freaks XG, actually, well there was one, that came out in Japanese arcades on March 10th, 2010.
3307678	3311742	It had two more buttons added to the fret bar instead of the three.
3312363	3316415	and there is a sequel called Guitar Freaks XG2 that came out on March 9th, 2011.
3319534	3323457	So the controller looks kind of like a Fender Jazzmaster or a Fender Mustang.
3323477	3325818	It has three buttons, red, green, and blue.
3326638	3337385	And it has a pick lever so that you also have a knob that you can use as an effector.
3338286	3341508	And it'll add chorus and delay effects to your guitar.
3342388	3345470	Anyway, so it really plays a lot like...
3347131	3365966	A reverse poppin' music, or reverse Beatmania 2DX, where everything scrolls very DDR style, you know, from bottom to top, except it uses the bars, and you have to use your strum lever while you hold the appropriate colored button.
3366586	3372511	And you can pull your bar back when you see a little guitar flashing on the screen, and you get a wailing bonus.
3373371	3383135	and in some cases you even have hidden things that you can play that will populate this new, I'm glad you picked that song because that's like one of the best songs ever.
3384035	3390557	It'll populate a, what's the word I'm thinking of?
3391157	3396139	Oh yeah, a new series of items to play on the screen.
3397220	3399660	I was actually very distracted because Rob picked fire.
3399680	3400781	You should play a little bit of that.
3403991	3404311	Cool!
3404331	3410676	My husband and I would pull the crap out of this song.
3410696	3416120	So anyway, basically your life is powered by your- Wait a minute.
3416601	3419603	This is somebody who edited Fire to be the Mega Man song.
3419643	3420464	That's not the song.
3421364	3424127	No, but I meant- That's not the song.
3426707	3428208	That actually is kind of rad, though.
3428628	3430490	Yeah, well, I knew it sounded wrong, but I like it.
3430510	3431750	All right, let me find the real fire.
3431770	3433271	Find the real fire, because real fire is good.
3434432	3436353	Although it sounds very MIDI-like.
3436374	3437794	That is pretty awesome.
3437814	3438855	There's the right one.
3441357	3442217	Yeah, this is it.
3444879	3445780	This is the full version.
3445800	3448221	That's fine.
3448241	3453485	Let me get to where the guitar is.
3453745	3454045	I like the...
3459013	3461555	I can totally hear where somebody heard the Mega Man song in that though.
3461595	3461895	Yeah.
3462916	3468319	Anyway, your scoring depends on how accurate you are with hitting the key.
3468940	3471421	You have perfect, great, good, poor, and miss.
3471661	3475484	Ratings of poor and miss will deplete your groove gauge.
3475684	3477926	Perfect and great will replenish it.
3478646	3483770	If your groove gauge is empty completely, you fail and the game is over.
3483790	3487232	Depending on how the cabinet is set up, you have one to five songs.
3489261	3490062	Session Link Super Session
3508880	3509941	I miss this so much.
3540342	3543466	I could not tell you this far after.
3543486	3546651	The one that had the really cool drum beat.
3549154	3550676	Right on Time?
3550837	3552018	Right on Time, that was it.
3552379	3552779	Wow.
3553100	3554001	We would always play Right on Time.
3554021	3555022	That's amazing that you remember that.
3556247	3556767	Thank you, Rob.
3576017	3579619	This is right on time.
3579639	3585902	The drum, when you play this in the medium mode, was just like constant.
3585962	3587383	I could do it for a while.
3587523	3590224	And remember those calluses I had on my hands from playing the damn drum?
3590425	3593546	Because we would buy our own drumsticks and use our own drumsticks.
3596748	3603952	But as far as the different versions of them, I don't even know if I have time to list them all because there's so many.
3604492	3605052	Yeah, let's not.
3605793	3607054	Well, I'll put it this way.
3607294	3607814	Fuck tons.
3607894	3608815	We've been everything.
3608975	3613397	We've had regular mixes up to 11th, and then there was an 8th mix power-up version.
3614878	3628026	We've had V2, V3, V4, Rock X Rock, or Rock Cross Rock, V5 Rock to Infinity, V6 Blazing, XG, V7, XG2 Groove to Live,
3629186	3657328	V8, XG3 that came out February 2012 Guitar Freaks V4 and V2 Infinity that were looks like European releases so there's just been all kinds of different versions and also for the Drum Mania ones over in other countries they were called Percussion Freaks just saying so that's it I still was waiting for Sax Maniacs
3658470	3658851	Someday.
3659111	3659732	Don't give up hope.
3660332	3662034	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
3662074	3665478	Guitar Freaks, originally in the arcade, but eventually on the PlayStation in Japan.
3666419	3668121	And it's in the collection.
3668161	3675049	Clearly part of the inspiration for Guitar Hero, because again, Red Octane, who funded the original Guitar Hero, used to make... Denied it in my kitchen.
3675249	3676711	Used to make...
3678064	3685569	and those controllers for Guitar Freaks, which had five buttons on them at one point, which Guitar Freaks never had five buttons.
3685649	3687690	And everybody was like, why are they putting out five button controllers?
3688271	3689531	XG has it now.
3690252	3690532	All right.
3691453	3694134	Anyhow, we were going to go right into rapid fire news.
3694194	3698297	I think in light of the power outage a couple weeks ago, I think I should save what we've done so far.
3698377	3699938	So let's do a quick in studio break.
3699958	3702780	We'll be right back with more Orange Launch Radio right after this.
3709119	3711781	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
3711901	3717105	Not live on this June the 3rd of 2012, but it's a radio trick.
3717145	3720227	We're taping on May 31st, a few days beforehand.
3720267	3725131	But thanks to those of you that showed up to chat along with the show anyway at vognetwork.com.
3725171	3728874	And we will be back live next week, June the 10th of 2012.
3729814	3732536	And podcast folks, hey, you got another show this week, so...
3733417	3733878	Enjoy!
3733998	3740026	Even though it'll be a little bit shorter tonight because we're missing the live interaction and just since it's earlier in the week there's not as much to talk about.
3740066	3746034	But hey, we do still have plenty of news including tonight's rapid fire news which Loki's going to start us off with.
3746550	3756013	Yes, there was a new Ratchet & Clank game announced that will also be, well actually it's only going to be released on the PlayStation Network, kind of like what they did with the second Ratchet & Clank game.
3757814	3762175	Or no, there's like a middle Ratchet & Clank game, like the second and the third one was out on the consoles.
3763156	3767637	But it's Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault and it's coming this fall.
3768458	3772579	All those Ratchet & Clank games have kind of suggestive names, don't they?
3773775	3776276	Ratchet and Clank Future Quest for Booty Did they find the booty?
3788573	3789234	They probably did.
3790795	3798539	Of course, it's been rumored for a while that Battlefield 3 is going to try to pull Call of Duty Elite and come out with their own service.
3799200	3799900	And they have.
3800281	3802762	It actually leaked out and then they finally announced it.
3804323	3804803	Actually, no.
3804883	3813469	I believe it leaked out and they... I don't know if they've confirmed it or whatever, but what ended up happening is there's this Battlefield 3 Premium...
3814169	3821555	It's going to cost you $50 and includes five themed expansion packs, some of which have already been announced, and actually one that's already out.
3822356	3825938	Back to Karkland, which was a pre-order bonus if you bought the game.
3826679	3835026	Then, of course, the Close Quarters DLC, which I think is out, or it's coming out next week on June 4th.
3836126	3843029	Then they have Armored Kill, Aftermath, and Endgame are the next three as well.
3843749	3852753	And apparently you're going to get exclusive weapons and also two weeks access early to said packs as well of other unique endgame items if you pay $50.
3855057	3874919	I don't know, it seems like they're trying to copy what they're doing with Call of Duty Elite and of course they weren't going to want to do that because if it works, if the shoe fits they made quite a bit of money but originally it came out on the European PlayStation Network store and then got pulled but once it's on the internet that's right, screenshots alright
3875419	3883065	Well, moving on, if you want to get some good games and do some good, there's always the Humble Indie Bundle available at HumbleBundle.com.
3883105	3888408	And you know, every time one of these bundles comes out, the internet blows up with, best one yet.
3888789	3893012	Well, the fifth one, Humble Indie Bundle 5, was just announced today, and guess what?
3893712	3894853	Best one yet.
3894873	3895474	I already bought it.
3895534	3896575	Like, for real.
3896795	3897916	Like, okay, here's the deal.
3898316	3904842	Psychonauts, Limbo, Super Brothers, Sword & Sorcery, EP, and Amnesia are all available.
3905282	3912788	And if you pay above the average price, you get Bastion, which, you know, there's tons of great games.
3912828	3914610	Every single one of those games is something.
3914650	3916432	Got it for $5.60 to get Bastion.
3916912	3918653	I'm sure that the average price is way higher.
3918694	3920315	I've already got most of those.
3920495	3922236	Yeah, I know, I have amnesia, but you know what?
3922977	3936145	It's not just about being able to get the games cheap, but that you are doing some good because the money doesn't just go to the developers, but it goes to, if you want, again, you get to choose how you divvy up the money, it goes to the Humble Indie Bundle or Child's Play Charity EFF.
3936446	3944351	So if you want, you can plunk down 15 bucks, give it all to Child's Play Charity and say to everybody else, none for you, bye, and that's how you divvy up the money.
3944751	3947532	Right now, as of the taping of the show, the minimum is $7.51.
3947692	3952133	I imagine that's going to climb closer to $10 by the time... It's still worth it.
3952153	3952933	It's still worth it.
3953293	3955614	Shit, these games together, easily worth $60.
3958255	3961376	Honestly, the price of a regular retail game?
3962816	3963216	Why not?
3964077	3969338	So, if you're feeling charitable or shit, you just want some good games, head over to HumbleBundle.com.
3969378	3972159	Again, it's been out for one day.
3973217	3974378	Already up to 187,100.
3974979	3978683	This number's just climbing.
3978703	3980625	46, 8, 50, just keeps climbing.
3980905	3983688	I imagine by the time Sunday rolls around, they'll easily be at a half million.
3984549	3984770	Easily.
3984910	3985070	Easy.
3986485	4007237	so Humble Indie Bundle 5 we kind of mentioned this already earlier in the show but if you missed it Game Informer magazine is teasing in the shadows a new Gears of War apparently to be on the July issue of their magazine obviously if this is you know what it is it could be Gears of War 4 it could be a Gears of War spin-off game it's a prequel
4007817	4009438	So just like pre-Gears of War.
4009679	4010339	It's a prequel.
4010379	4011200	Gears of Battle.
4011380	4015143	It's a prequel because of spoilers regarding the main characters.
4015423	4016664	I see, okay.
4017705	4020707	There cannot be a sequel with the main character.
4020907	4022609	Whoever said it had to be the main character?
4023469	4028913	Look, in one of the Mass Effect games, they kill Shepard and bring him back.
4028934	4031856	And that's not a spoiler because that's in the very beginning of the game, Mass Effect 2.
4032336	4034358	So anything is possible, you know?
4036099	4038641	I always love when people say, oh, no, they can't do it.
4038882	4039522	It's a prequel.
4040403	4041384	Time travel and shit.
4041404	4042225	They can do whatever they want.
4042265	4043906	Look what they did with Star Trek, for fuck's sake.
4043966	4044767	It's another Gears of War game.
4044787	4048150	They found a way to maybe bring Khan back, although they swear up and down it's not going to happen.
4048290	4048630	Whatever.
4048650	4049771	It's another Gears of War game.
4050091	4050312	All right.
4050332	4054916	Well, whatever it is, it's coming soon, as in E3 soon.
4055516	4055696	All right.
4055716	4055997	Moving on.
4056017	4056477	Dark Sakura.
4058519	4058799	Yeah.
4059380	4059980	Some more stuff.
4060020	4060881	How about Spy Hunter?
4062028	4065973	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Well, I was playing that on my iPad, actually.
4066713	4067274	The Spy Hunter.
4067955	4070137	Which the control sucks, because it's no steering wheel.
4070157	4071239	You have to tilt your iPad.
4073240	4077302	Well, basically it's a reboot on the handhelds.
4077402	4081224	It's basically super spy racing type game.
4083125	4089169	Basically you are the spy and you have to go catch bad guys.
4090349	4093511	And you do that in a fast vehicle and you destroy enemy vehicles.
4094091	4103033	Your car is called the G6155 Interceptor, which is supposed to transform from a supercar to offer an assault vehicle to a speedboat.
4103773	4108774	So you can go hunt and capture those nasty, nasty spies.
4109114	4111954	But the real question is, did they license the theme from Peter Gunn?
4111994	4113134	Because if not, forget it.
4113734	4120095	They have the theme in a remix dubstep of the... Dubstep is evil.
4120175	4123076	Wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba.
4123638	4127561	It's being done by Warner Brothers Interactive.
4129322	4133084	It's supposed to be on 3DS and PS Vita in the fall.
4133124	4135666	What do Dubstep and Downtown Julie Brown have in common?
4136226	4136766	Wubba Wubba.
4136786	4137627	Wubba Wubba Wubba!
4139272	4145258	So Capcom has registered a trademark for a potential game called Remember Me.
4146859	4153666	We don't really know anything else about that except that it was filed on May 22nd this year in both the US and Europe.
4154247	4156148	So maybe this will be something at E3?
4156329	4156749	Who knows?
4157129	4157550	Who cares?
4159036	4162297	It could be the subtitle to another game too, right?
4163397	4166278	It may not necessarily be a standalone game.
4166858	4167158	Maybe.
4168919	4175560	Remember me, the sensible Capcom that put out regular games that were fun and people liked buying them and we didn't have download content that was on disc?
4176060	4177761	Remember me, sensible Capcom?
4178341	4179261	Well, I'm gone forever.
4180401	4185183	And now it's time for a joke that nobody but maybe two of our listeners will get.
4185883	4186143	Remember!
4192152	4194675	Actually, you know what I was distracted by, Rob?
4195817	4199141	A story about this guy eating his roommate's brain and heart.
4199741	4203446	Ew, that's like that grody old... Have you read about all that crap coming out of Canada?
4203846	4206289	That doesn't happen in Canada.
4206309	4210494	The guy eating faces in Florida, but if I lived in Florida, I'd probably go crazy too.
4211095	4211475	DarkSakura.com
4232404	4234125	People, stop being ridiculous.
4234185	4236005	Oh, that guy in Canada got caught finally?
4236566	4237006	No, no.
4237806	4248270	This guy named Alexander Kinyua ate his roommate's heart and brain and his dad found him with the head and hands in a bucket in his basement.
4249011	4249831	His dad turned him in.
4250131	4259477	Do not Google that guy who they want in Canada because you'll read all these stories about he didn't just do fucked up things to humans and you will get mad.
4259737	4260738	You will get mad.
4261358	4262379	Allegedly.
4262419	4263280	I have to say allegedly.
4263320	4268403	But there's a guy in Japan who killed a couple of women and ate them and now he's a celebrity and does tours.
4268963	4269284	What?
4270244	4270685	Serious?
4271125	4272226	In no evidence.
4272306	4273047	It's gone.
4273107	4276169	He wrote... That sounds like the plot of Natural Born Killers.
4276209	4276990	Did you ever see that?
4277170	4277410	No.
4277671	4279332	That was Robert Downey Jr.
4279372	4280513	back when he was on drugs.
4280533	4281434	I'll find the guy's name.
4282074	4287499	But he did it like 30 years ago, and now he goes around doing tours about what it's like to eat people.
4288220	4288380	Ugh.
4290341	4292503	That totally sounds like the plot to Natural Born Killers.
4292543	4293024	All right, anyhow...
4294426	4294967	Moving on.
4295067	4296789	I need some happiness and cheerfulness.
4296890	4298171	So let's look at video games.
4298271	4298632	Loki.
4298832	4299333	I got his name.
4299974	4300555	No, I don't want it.
4300575	4302397	His name is Issei Sagawa.
4302417	4302898	Send it back.
4304352	4307413	You know, there's nothing more happier and cheerful than Doom 3.
4308954	4314496	Doom 3 is getting the HD treatment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4315356	4324120	And not only are you getting Doom 3 with HD graphics, extra levels, 3D support, they even have head-mounted display support, which...
4325543	4328966	I'm not really sure there's that many head-mounted displays out there.
4329627	4333951	I know that apparently John Carmack made one, and it had duct tape on it.
4333971	4334452	Here's the thing.
4334552	4335793	John Carmack has one.
4336614	4337935	So that's why it's in the game.
4337955	4338656	So, yeah.
4338736	4339677	So he's supporting it.
4341218	4345482	And, yeah, Doom 1 and 2 are also included, and it's supposed to be out this fall.
4346063	4347724	So that's kind of cool, I guess.
4347925	4348225	I mean...
4349746	4351427	Here's another awesome question.
4351687	4352628	Why Doom 3?
4354169	4361874	Because... Just because maybe it was kind of over... I don't want to say it was overlooked, but it certainly didn't have that same cultural grab that the first two did.
4362694	4365396	Well, Doom 3 because they are a new game.
4365436	4366637	Rage Bombed.
4368758	4369438	Why not Quake 3?
4369519	4370019	That's...
4371384	4375026	Well, Quake 3 was Quake... It's basically Quake Live now.
4375046	4379108	Yeah, Quake Live, which I think they... Don't they have Quake 3 on Xbox Live Arcade?
4379188	4380189	They do, you're right, they do.
4381490	4382330	I actually have it.
4382590	4387393	And technically they were releasing Quake... Well, they actually are releasing Quake 4 again.
4387433	4387773	Really?
4387873	4388954	Quake 4 wasn't very good.
4389014	4389674	On Xbox 360.
4389714	4391395	That was one of the launch titles for 360, remember that?
4391475	4398759	Yeah, and here's the thing I want to kind of know about it, though, is remember, the launch title, and hopefully you can find Dirt Cheap now, it...
4400380	4404044	The game wasn't very good, but it came with Quake 2 on another disc.
4404064	4404805	Which was good.
4404825	4407167	That's right.
4407447	4410330	The even-numbered Quakes, it's like the opposite of Star Trek.
4410390	4412172	The even-numbered Quakes are not very good.
4412574	4414515	Quake 2 was pretty good.
4414635	4415516	Quake 3 was great.
4416096	4419538	Compared to 1 and 3, 3 was the best.
4419998	4420899	Asky Quake, Rob.
4421799	4422680	It's only going to be $20.
4422760	4424061	It's supposed to be coming out in two weeks.
4425602	4427943	Or you can buy one of the original copies for $5 and get it now.
4431485	4431825	Alright.
4433225	4437647	Well, if you're not into first-person shooters, maybe you're into first-person role-playing games.
4437747	4440527	And one of the biggest ones out there right now is Skyrim.
4440567	4441087	And guess what?
4441227	4443848	Finally, an expansion coming.
4444088	4447169	We don't know exactly when yet, but we do finally have a title.
4447449	4452570	This is one of those pre-E3 leaks where the companies try to get a jump on all that press coverage.
4452630	4455211	It's going to be, you know, because everybody's fighting for time during E3 week.
4455971	4457472	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4486228	4486889	Uh, what is this?
4487229	4492854	Uh, you can turn into a bunch of bats, so there's a vampire theme going on, which was already in the game, right?
4492874	4497539	You can already be a vampire, but this actually shows, like, you can transform into, like, a giant bat thing and, like, fly.
4497919	4500601	Like, kind of a really weird... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, bat thing.
4500982	4502803	Yeah, bat thing.
4502984	4503304	I don't know.
4503956	4504857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4528133	4551968	30 days later is when the rest of us can play it because Microsoft basically sold their soul to get this and so can you in the expansion to Skyrim because Microsoft gives it up better I like the little castle on fire the little dark castle looking thing it's like the little obsidian portal in Minecraft but prettier
4554425	4556867	Loki, you played way more Skyrim than I did.
4556907	4557987	What's your interest level in this?
4558648	4559588	I'm interested in it.
4560128	4564811	I'm not as excited as before, you know, because I was like, oh, I'm going to get whatever expansion they put out.
4565111	4566612	But, like, it has to do with vampires.
4566632	4568513	I haven't really done anything with vampires.
4568553	4572856	I've been just trying to make sure I don't turn into a vampire because it's lame.
4574236	4577578	Not because of Twilight, but I just don't want to be a vampire or a werewolf in the game.
4577718	4579079	I like that horse that was on fire.
4579399	4580220	I like that map.
4580240	4580320	Yeah.
4581080	4581780	But we'll see.
4581800	4582841	What's glowing like Tron?
4582981	4584541	Oh, I think that was the Elder Scrolls.
4584922	4585022	Oh.
4586302	4586802	You know what, though?
4586822	4589523	When you said that you were interested in that, it totally made me think of Alucard.
4590724	4591624	I'm interested in this.
4591704	4594765	That is kind of, it does look like you can play as Alucard in this.
4594785	4595525	That would be cool.
4595605	4597646	I would play Skyrim if I could be Alucard.
4597706	4598386	I just wish.
4598526	4599827	You can name your character Alucard.
4600547	4606391	I mean, it would be really impossible for them to add it later on because it's such a rewrite of code.
4606411	4617698	But I just want, you know, I know they have Skyrim, or not Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, which is really weird because it gets lamer and lamer each update that they put out on it.
4617798	4622281	It's like every update that there is for it, I get less and less interested in this game.
4623461	4625442	But I really wish there was just like co-op.
4625462	4629425	Like four-player co-op in Skyrim would be fucking awesome.
4629445	4629525	Yeah.
4632432	4632792	All right.
4633413	4639158	Well, this is the part of the show where we'd move into the mailbag segment, except there's no emails tonight.
4639298	4642121	So instead, we're going to plug and say, email us.
4642661	4646665	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us.
4646905	4648206	And we'll read your email next week.
4648306	4653331	Surely, with E3 going on, there's going to be something that makes you want to email us and have your voice heard.
4653371	4654932	So mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4655072	4656073	And don't call them Shirley.
4657174	4660136	Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week.
4660677	4662458	Lack of email makes us angsty.
4678389	4681571	Um, my FU goes to this continuously not having a voice.
4682391	4683872	So yeah, boo.
4685874	4686154	Loki?
4687955	4689877	F you to the fact that I can't go to E3.
4689917	4692299	I kind of miss going to E3 each year.
4692620	4696243	It's been a couple years now that I haven't been able to go.
4697464	4700727	Even if it is a lame E3, I still like going and playing the stuff.
4701207	4704990	And my boss and his boss get to go.
4707232	4708333	They go to meetings.
4708433	4710775	It's like, so where did you go check out at E3?
4710895	4712377	Oh, we didn't even go on the show floor.
4713015	4714075	Thanks for watching!
4730962	4732543	Like, what was it, last year?
4732563	4734404	I'm trying to think what they saw last year.
4735524	4736705	It was something very lame.
4737005	4737966	I don't even remember what it was.
4738306	4740167	It may have been Bethesda.
4741327	4744509	But yeah, it's just, they waste time there.
4745586	4748710	We would like to display our new game, Cat Butthole.
4749110	4749470	No, no, no.
4749591	4750271	I do take that back.
4750512	4751072	It is their fault.
4751112	4751693	Because you know why?
4751833	4753815	Because they only go down for like one or two days.
4754096	4756799	They miss a day or two of the time there.
4756839	4758841	I'm like, what the fuck?
4758941	4760963	You could be hitting the show for... But here's the thing.
4761144	4762765	They don't fucking care and his boss...
4766451	4767051	I'm sorry, Loki.
4767071	4767652	Maybe next year.
4767772	4768312	Maybe next year.
4771534	4774796	F you to just too much to do and not enough time to do it.
4774856	4777057	And F you to the fact that I kind of bring that on myself.
4778177	4780118	So, F you to that.
4780299	4782600	That's what you get for procrastinating.
4782700	4784001	It's not even procrastinating.
4784041	4787202	It's just maybe I don't know how to say no.
4788403	4789443	And maybe I need to learn.
4789824	4792465	That has nothing to do with this program or VOG or anything like that.
4792525	4795427	It's just other things in life that maybe I need to just say
4796127	4799808	Maybe it's time to stop because I'm just too damn busy.
4800328	4801508	Rob, look at me.
4802428	4804049	It is possible to say no.
4804309	4805569	I say it to you all the time.
4805689	4806069	Bitch.
4807249	4807569	No.
4809930	4810230	All right.
4811430	4813411	Anyhow, that's it for the FU of the Week.
4813451	4816751	Let's get into a few more stories for you guys before we say goodnight.
4816831	4818892	Loki.
4819212	4824513	There's always a rumor that there's going to be an announcement of a redesign of the 3DS.
4825513	4828895	But it's actually looking like it may actually happen this year.
4829296	4834059	And the reason behind that is Amazon has stopped carrying the 3DS.
4834919	4840303	Not necessarily that they've stopped selling it, but they themselves have stopped selling it on the website.
4840383	4847648	It's only available through third-party providers, because you know anybody can go on Amazon and sell stuff.
4848148	4850930	But there's actually stuff that's sold directly by Amazon.
4851770	4871404	that's in the US region not only that but in Japan they also have stopped having the 3DS available so why do you think they've stopped selling the 3DS maybe because there's another 3DS coming out did somebody report the original 3DS is flawed to Amazon and they stopped selling it that could have happened too maybe
4871923	4873724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4903628	4927928	so it's interesting the other thing is the thoughts are that there's a rumor that they're going to announce Monster Hunter for the 3DS coming this E3 as well for the North American region alright I mean there's going to be a redesign it's just when I think it could be this holiday
4930422	4940849	Uh, this is pretty shitty, is, uh, rumors and fakeness all over the interwebs, and, uh, I, I, I did want to bring it up, though, because there was a part of me that went, well, what if?
4941710	4952237	Square Enix announced what's gonna be at their booth, that part's not a lie, and what I thought was interesting, was completely missing from that list, was Final Fantasy Versus XIII, because it's like, shouldn't that fucking game be out by now?
4952677	4955279	Like, how long has that been in development, and we've, you know, whatever.
4955979	4959043	So the thought out there is, well, maybe it's like a secret.
4959143	4963788	Maybe something's happening with it, and they're going to show it at one of the conferences or something.
4963828	4972419	So this crazy-ass rumor came out, complete with fake footage, that Final Fantasy Versus XIII was renamed to Final Fantasy XV.
4974120	4975941	To be fair, that part I'd actually believe.
4976001	4977822	I know a lot of people poo-pooing that idea.
4978243	4979183	I'd actually believe that.
4979203	4981585	I still don't understand how they tie with each other anyway.
4981605	4982825	You know what I'd believe more?
4983125	4986387	That they renamed Final Fantasy Versus XIII to Final Fantasy XIV.
4986507	4990029	What do you mean there was already a... Just shh, shh.
4990610	4992071	But there's already a Final Fantasy XIV.
4992191	4992471	Shh.
4995655	5004580	Anyhow, apparently the game was going to be coming to the Wii U. Now, I guess it's because of the footage.
5004900	5008882	I didn't even watch the footage, but I'm looking at it here, this one-minute clip here.
5009442	5009943	Oh, God.
5010623	5013285	You can just tell that that's an overlaid thing.
5014305	5022529	But apparently people are watching this footage or whatever, and then you see the logo for Final Fantasy XV, and yeah, it doesn't look too convincing.
5022549	5023270	Yeah.
5026877	5030258	But it did kind of make me stop and go, well, why couldn't it be on the Wii U?
5031499	5033319	I mean, the Wii U is supposed to be getting all this other stuff.
5034920	5035360	Here's why.
5035820	5043623	They wouldn't put it only on the Wii U. It's because... Well, to be fair, it was PlayStation 3 and Wii U. Like, somebody took out the Xbox logo and put the Wii U logo.
5046151	5046812	They're not going to do that.
5047092	5047592	I mean, come on.
5047952	5050954	They know that they need to make money on this stuff.
5050994	5060880	They're not going to cut out the Xbox just because of the Wii U. I mean, they sold plenty of copies of Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2 on the Xbox.
5061360	5062281	They're not going to ignore that.
5062301	5066343	And XIV was cut for totally different reasons that had to do with the Xbox Live infrastructure.
5066984	5073848	Rules that were bent for Final Fantasy XI, Microsoft would not bend on again because XI didn't do that well on Xbox.
5073868	5073948	Yeah.
5074170	5075992	So, they're not going to do that.
5076453	5076833	I'm sorry.
5077194	5085183	If it's anything going to be for the Wii U, or even like, it's always been their own game that's been kind of lame on the Wii.
5085604	5090170	So, I think if there's anything on the Wii U, it's going to be another lame Crystal Chronicles game.
5091971	5092271	Same.
5092491	5093051	You never know.
5093071	5104113	If that whole Wii U being similar to the Game Boy Advance linking to the GameCube, there was that Final Fantasy game that was specifically for that setup, so it would be very easy to make a sequel to that.
5104233	5111275	I just don't see them doing... I don't see them coming out with... Because I've seen rumors... Of course, everybody's making up fucking rumors.
5111935	5116116	There's a rumor I read, and I didn't even open the page because it just looks stupid.
5116436	5117196	They're talking about...
5118616	5119957	Oh, Kingdom Hearts Remix.
5120017	5123941	It's going to have all these different characters and stuff from all these games and it's only going to be on the Wii.
5123961	5125162	I'm like, no, it's not.
5125202	5126323	They're not going to do that.
5126363	5128225	Could Square be withholding Kingdom Hearts 3?
5129066	5129706	Can I wish?
5130066	5130667	Can I wish?
5132529	5133610	If wishes were fishes.
5134130	5135912	They've got plenty of stuff that they're working on right now.
5136332	5139195	If wishes and musts were buckets of... Damn it.
5139275	5142738	If wishes and musts were clusters of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola.
5143544	5143764	DarkSakura
5155410	5157051	Well, it is official.
5157291	5162713	According to Tim Cook with Apple, they don't really care about doing consoles.
5162773	5164434	They're not interested in doing it right now.
5164914	5167655	Maybe someday, but not now.
5169096	5172477	Basically, they're cool with the little iOS games.
5172518	5173078	That's cool.
5173658	5175279	In fact, he says customers love games.
5175339	5177720	It just makes me think of bitches love games, you know.
5178620	5189411	but he goes on record saying I'm not interested in being in the console business and what is thought of as traditional gaming but Apple is a big player today and things in the future will only make that bigger
5190905	5197690	Well, if the rumor's true that they're building their own TVs and shit, then they can just take the iPad, iPhone stuff over to the TV.
5197710	5199772	It prints money.
5199852	5202394	It's just not console in the traditional sense, that's all.
5202474	5203815	But you can't deny it.
5203935	5205356	Apple's a player in gaming right now.
5205396	5208138	They're probably thinking that they're beyond consoles anyway.
5209099	5211101	We're bigger than consoles, really.
5213422	5217686	I mean, Smurfs Village just puts that Gears of War to shame.
5219767	5221949	They really don't need it.
5222289	5223490	To be honest, they don't need it.
5223510	5225292	I don't want to see Apple do a console.
5225332	5228694	What they're doing right now is challenging the industry enough, I think.
5229174	5231836	Especially Nintendo, the handheld market.
5231896	5239282	You can't deny that the iPhones and iPads are breathing a lot of heat on not just the Vita, but the 3DS.
5240202	5244726	To the point where shareholders are calling on Nintendo to put Mario on the iPhone.
5245745	5246385	Please don't.
5246705	5247305	That'd be terrible.
5248146	5251046	I actually agree it would be terrible because the touch controls just wouldn't work.
5251066	5254847	For the record, on a whim, I got Mega Man 2 on the iPhone.
5254867	5255947	It is fucking terrible.
5256027	5256588	It is ass.
5257188	5260088	It is the stuff that comes from the stuff that comes out of an ass.
5260669	5266350	You know what they could do, though, on the iPhone that would work is like a Zelda game like they have on the 3DS.
5266390	5267690	It was all stylus control.
5268450	5268751	Oh, yeah.
5268771	5269111	It worked.
5270051	5270491	It might work.
5271260	5273261	But it still sucks.
5292648	5305956	It is a guitar pee urinal that basically has like little strum bars in it and a big fret bar coming out of the top that you can pee in it and then you can actually get a code to download your pee song later.
5306676	5310338	You know what's sad is that is the second time we've talked about pee-based games in a month.
5310859	5311959	That's why I brought it up.
5312079	5313240	I weep for our society.
5313260	5317463	There's apparently a video up of what guitar pee sounds like.
5318303	5318864	No thank you.
5319164	5319484	Yeah.
5320078	5323161	Yeah, I do have a few things I was just going to cover real quick.
5323641	5327285	So someone supported Super Road Blaster to the SNES.
5327685	5338275	Now, Super Road Blaster, or I should say Road Blaster, which was a 1985 Laserdisc arcade game with animations, like a full motion video thing, like Dragon's Lair or something like that.
5339615	5352480	He's actually created a ROM file that's 6,320 megabits, although when you compare that with the largest SNES cartridge, which is only 48 megabits, it's a little impossible to run without special software.
5352660	5362143	You can actually get a SD2 SNES SD card adapter that will allow you to run the game on a physical SNES, and it actually works.
5362563	5363803	You can download the ROM, which is 118 megs.
5365624	5365964	Only?
5366204	5368065	Well, for a Super Nintendo ROM, that's huge.
5368426	5368986	Right.
5369526	5371807	And it plays a full motion video and everything.
5371848	5372488	It's pretty amazing.
5372548	5375650	So that cartridge back in the day probably would have cost about $900.
5375910	5376050	Yeah.
5376070	5383274	It would have cost about as much as the... And it would have had to be in like a super gigantic box.
5384134	5385516	Neo Geo CD Projekt Red Cyberpunk
5402617	5403418	I do have a late tweet.
5403578	5404618	We got a tweet just now.
5405359	5408901	Or I should say an hour ago, but that was while we were in the middle of the show.
5409242	5414685	So here's a question from Osfer who sent a legit question for the show tonight, so we need to entertain it here.
5415406	5423651	Osfer tweets us at twitter.com slash OLR asking, tweet for the show, what is a game that frustrated you like no other?
5425052	5428415	A game that frustrated you like no other.
5428955	5430216	Puzzle and Desu was one.
5431257	5431697	Why is that?
5432247	5434329	Just because some of the puzzles get really hard and fast.
5435369	5436710	I mean, it's just a pain.
5436930	5454003	And then, um... Shoot, it's something that actually... Well, Fractal, actually, for a little while was getting me super frustrated because I'm on the part now where you have splits in weird places and it'll, like, completely mess up your trying to get your blooms.
5454503	5455964	So it's pretty fucked up.
5456745	5460367	And a few games with puzzles in them.
5460387	5461188	A few puzzles...
5462654	5464094	For me, Super Meat Boy.
5464214	5465015	Let me put it this way.
5465235	5469956	Alan used to ask me to play Super Meat Boy because he used to giggle when I would get really frustrated with the game.
5470136	5471697	It was some type of satisfaction for him.
5471757	5473597	So definitely Super Meat Boy.
5473637	5476678	But that's the whole point of that game is to get frustrated and want to throw the controller.
5477038	5477298	Loki?
5478959	5479859	V, V, V, V.
5480868	5481649	Oh, God, yes.
5482290	5482951	Oh, my God.
5483552	5483852	You know what?
5483973	5488439	Here's the thing is I played that game without downloading it on Steam, and then I just now downloaded it on Steam.
5488479	5489560	I can't import my save.
5490722	5492845	I'm like, fuck that.
5492905	5493606	Womp, womp.
5493646	5496530	You can actually copy it directly out of the save folder.
5496790	5500072	I hope so, because I am not fucking doing that again.
5500292	5501253	I did that with my games.
5501853	5505135	On the 3DS, I'm just stuck in one level that I'm never going to get past.
5505175	5508056	It's when that little asshole is following you and you can't get him killed either.
5509617	5517062	I finished all that, but I have one more little shiny object thing to get, and it's just like, no.
5518082	5519083	No, I'm not doing it.
5519103	5519403	I quit.
5520043	5520363	I'm done.
5520383	5520684	I quit.
5521044	5521564	I don't care.
5521944	5522204	All right.
5522565	5523225	There's the tweet.
5523685	5523905	Sorry.
5523945	5524746	Any other stories, Loki?
5525792	5534765	Yeah, Retro City Rampage, speaking of Super Meat Boy, has this cool little trailer that they put out for a game within the game called Virtual Meat Boy.
5535045	5538490	It's done like Virtual Boy, but you're playing as Meat Boy.
5538871	5539392	Oh, that's awesome.
5539452	5541234	And you also get to play as Meat Boy in the game, too.
5542015	5545637	and it has 3D with like the red blue glasses if you want to.
5545877	5551999	That's funny because Super Meat Boy kind of had those throwback stages like there was the NES stages and there was a Game Boy stage.
5553220	5554860	A Virtual Boy stage makes a lot of sense.
5554880	5555841	That's kind of funny actually.
5555881	5557041	So yeah, that's pretty awesome.
5557541	5560983	And then the last thing I was going to mention real quick, well, actually two things.
5561363	5576646	Nintendo's patented a new kind of input device for the 3DS it's a vibrating stylus it's going to allow you to have some sort of haptic feedback for stuff based on the position I guess of where the stylus is compared to the camera
5577046	5577246	TTP V
5596013	5602278	And then the last one was kind of in the line of why the fuck did they make this?
5604380	5612447	CTA, a company that makes accessories, and I think they made that thing for, was it Connected Ventures?
5612467	5613308	Remember the raft?
5614208	5615428	That was completely pointless.
5615448	5616068	Oh, God, yes.
5616088	5617129	Because it was just a raft.
5617229	5618049	Oh, my God, yes.
5618089	5618909	That shit was amazing.
5618929	5621470	They have done themselves one more.
5621890	5627871	They have made an inflatable go-kart that you can sit in and play.
5628191	5628831	Yes.
5629151	5630551	I heard of this already, I thought.
5630571	5632772	The 3DS Mario Kart 7 game.
5633332	5634472	Oh, for the 3DS now.
5635032	5638533	A giant inflatable kart for your portable console.
5638773	5642934	You put your 3DS within this little steering wheel thing.
5644821	5645561	Why would you spend $40?
5645901	5649243	You don't need to pretend that you're in a cart.
5649523	5650143	Why not?
5651063	5652044	Because it's stupid.
5652124	5653464	It's just so stupid.
5655305	5655805	That's it.
5655885	5656285	I'm done.
5656866	5657206	Alright.
5657886	5664629	Well, that's going to bring us to the close of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
5665169	5666430	DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight.
5666590	5667170	Your final thoughts.
5671361	5684791	Loki, your final thought tonight my final thought is hey, there's pictures of the E3 show floor I'm sad, I can't go I'm sad that you're sad no leaks
5685652	5711312	my final thought is I really want to just thank everybody who's worked really hard on VOGnetwork.com especially Bobby's been doing a heck of a lot of the coding and all that fun stuff but you know and again I can't say too much because I don't know if the Friday thing happened for sure or not yet at this point but just some of the people that are doing some other work behind the scenes who I'll congratulate more specifically later on I just really want to thank you all for your work I'd like to thank the Academy and yay VOG
