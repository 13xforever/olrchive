0	21080	Tonight, June 3, 2012, rumored new Wii U functionality is revealed, details emerge on the next Skyrim
21080	31640	expansion, and Apple answers rumors about an Apple console.
31640	35160	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35160	39360	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39360	43640	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next couple hours with my co-hosts.
43640	46760	First off, the one, the only, Dark Soccer, Jamie Summers.
46760	48400	Yo, dog, what up?
48400	49880	How you doin'?
49880	53120	Um, I'm full of curry.
53120	55520	Hurry hurry hurry, get your rice and curry.
55520	56520	It was really good.
56520	58480	It was Thai, not Indian, thank you.
58480	59800	Nerds out there will know that song.
59800	63520	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
63520	64520	Hi.
64520	65520	How are you doing, Loki?
65520	66520	I'm doing fine.
66520	67520	Alright.
67520	69520	Now, tonight's a little bit different of a show.
69520	75080	Usually I would introduce our chat room at vognetwork.com, but unfortunately we, well,
75080	80480	I mean, fortunately and unfortunately we are taping in advance of Sunday night, so if you're
80480	84660	listening to this live on Sunday night at the VOG Network, congrats, you're hearing the
84660	91080	premiere of this episode, but we're actually taping here on Thursday, May the 31st.
91080	94200	So a little disclaimer before we get into the news too much tonight, especially with
94200	99480	all the E3 stuff starting to come out, things may have changed between the night we taped
99480	101800	this and the night you guys hear it.
101800	103280	Why did we do that this week?
103280	106880	Well, as I mentioned on last week's show, I'm going to be out of town, therefore the
106880	110880	OLR studio will be closed that night and Loki really wants a night to sit at home and play
110880	112800	Minecraft all night uninterrupted.
112800	117400	Well, it's not uninterrupted, but it'll be longer than a few hours.
117400	118400	There you go.
118400	119960	So Minecraft all day Sunday.
119960	122280	My God, it's getting bad.
122280	126280	You were telling me before the show, just now you've cheated even worse in Minecraft
126280	127280	360, right?
127280	129000	I wouldn't even really consider it cheating.
129000	132400	Exploiting, stretching the limits of the rules.
132400	136400	It is cheating, but I mean, really when you think about it, it's just, I've basically
136400	137400	enabled God mode.
137400	144760	I've rigged it so that the health is so high that I don't die, but it's really, it's for
144760	149440	the poor programming of the game because like for example, the future updates and stuff,
149440	154120	when you're digging underground, you know, if there's lava, you know, one brick away
154120	157920	from where you're digging, you don't in this game.
157920	160880	So you're digging all of a sudden, Oh crap, lava killing me.
160880	164920	Yeah, the first tip I got about playing Minecraft is never dig straight down.
164920	166640	Well, I wasn't digging straight down.
166640	172520	I was digging straight forward and then all of a sudden I hit a block and lava flow dead.
172520	174520	I was like, thanks.
174520	176280	All right.
176280	180600	Anyhow, we'll talk more about our gaming weeks in a little bit, but first, as I mentioned,
180600	182920	we are getting into E3 week.
182920	187760	Finally it's uh, it's here a little strange E3 for us here at orange launch radio this
187760	188760	year.
188760	192040	And you know, as I'm sure a lot of you guys know, E3 kind of scaled back on the amount
192040	196480	of people they invite and OLR is not exactly on the guest list anymore.
196480	199880	So um, you know, we're just trying to make the best of it and uh, I'm going to Disneyland
199880	200880	instead.
200880	201880	LOL.
201880	205680	Uh, but I think a Loki dark soccer, you guys may or may not be watching it at home.
205680	208240	Loki, you still took the time off from work, so you kind of watch it, right?
208240	212200	I didn't take any time off work, but I'll still be watching it.
212200	215640	But technically it's related to your job so you can kind of get away with it.
215640	216640	Yeah.
216640	217640	And because I'm awesome like that.
217640	220120	I kind of think that my work is more interesting.
220120	225360	Well, this year especially, you know, I, I'm, I'm feeling a little eh about E3 this year.
225360	229120	I mean, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and to go into it with low expectations is
229120	230720	probably a good place to be.
230720	236600	But you know, um, I think Bobby put it best, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, the man who you
236600	239160	hear before us on Sunday nights at VOG network.
239160	247180	Um, he said, you know, if I had to miss my first E3 in, I think he said it was 16 years
247180	248180	I think.
248180	249180	15, 16 years.
249180	250680	I probably got that wrong.
250680	253560	Um, it, this is probably a good one to miss.
253560	256800	Why do you think the bar is so low this year?
256800	259320	I mean, we do have a new, I mean, everybody's saying, well, there's no new consoles.
259320	260320	Well, there is.
260320	261560	I mean, there is the Wii U.
261560	265880	I mean, is, is excitement really that low about Wii U or what?
265880	270400	I don't think the Wii U is doing enough different to make it like, Ooh, wow.
270400	273360	It's not like the graphics are like, Whoa, that much better.
273360	277640	Or you know, Whoa, this is a totally new technology, you know, way of controlling things.
277640	285200	It's basically, Hey, look, we took, we made a big DS minus other minus a D.
285200	287480	But isn't this a good place for Nintendo to be though?
287480	289540	I mean, I know that sounds really weird.
289540	294300	Like you, you know, nobody likes the negative buzz and obviously E3 kind of left them with
294300	298740	a very meh feeling, a lot of people walking out of the Wii U, but I mean, when the bar
298740	303280	is low, they really have the potential to exceed expectations.
303280	304280	True.
304280	307880	And well, with what they're doing right now, the technology seems to be more familiar to
307880	308880	the developers.
308880	313640	So they're able to port stuff over that, you know, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are getting.
313640	317920	I don't know how that's going to look when the new systems come out, but you know, that's
317920	319160	still a ways off.
319160	321720	For a whole year, they'll be on the cutting edge.
321720	325880	And even still, you know, even those new systems, you remember the very first, you know, games
325880	330100	are coming out in the, you know, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 just kind of look like
330100	337160	a Brezzed PlayStation 2 and Xbox games, so it's not always, you know, the biggest, best
337160	341720	looking, well definitely never the best looking games at launch, it's just, you know, ways
341720	342720	after that.
342720	343720	All right.
343720	347680	So quickly, I know we kind of talked about this a little more in depth a couple weeks
347680	351240	ago, so I don't want to dwell on this topic too long, but since this is our last chance
351240	356860	before E3 officially hits and the press conferences start, what are your final predictions out
356860	357860	of E3?
357860	359760	One prediction each for the big three.
359760	362200	What are your final big predictions out of E3?
362200	363200	Loki?
363200	364200	Or Dark Sakura?
364200	367480	Um, that I'll be asleep when they're made.
367480	373560	Do you, well let me ask you, Darkside, do you have any interest in Wii U at all?
373560	374560	Not really.
374560	375560	Why not?
375560	376560	I don't know.
376560	383280	I mean, really, I'm just, my apathy is kind of overwhelming about it because I'm, I mean,
383280	386660	we'll probably get one, I guess.
386660	394220	It's just, I'm really getting to the point that a lot of big hype about stuff just makes
394220	396080	me not care.
396080	397920	I don't, I don't want to speculate.
397920	400080	I just want to see it when it's out.
400080	402880	Because when you say you're apathetic and you don't care, it makes me think that Nintendo's
402880	406140	just not doing anything to excite you, that there's nothing that's happening there that
406140	408360	you go, oh, this is new and fascinating.
408360	409660	They're really not.
409660	412900	The technology isn't anything new.
412900	414480	We've got touchscreen stuff.
414480	415480	We've got tablets.
415480	420920	You know, using a tablet, they've had that interactivity from a handheld before when
420920	426680	they had the game link with the GBA.
426680	428880	So it's nothing really new.
428880	433280	It's them just saying, oh, well, we're making a part of the Wii now.
433280	434760	I'm not really excited about it.
434760	439920	I don't, I'm not going to be excited until I actually sit down and see it.
439920	444600	And granted, I feel somewhat similar, but I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised.
444600	450040	I'm really hoping there's that one game that I've got to have, but we'll see.
450040	453460	Loki, predictions for the big three?
453460	458360	I don't really know what Nintendo's, just based on what they've rumored to be coming
458360	462840	out in the new Mario game, New Super Mario Bros. me, which I think is what it's supposed
462840	463840	to be.
463840	468720	I was just like, I'm, seriously, that does not appeal to me at all.
468720	470400	New Super Mario Bros. didn't ever appeal to me.
470400	471400	I mean, I understand.
471400	477240	Well, one of the DS was pretty cool, and then the Wii one came out, and then number two's
477240	479480	coming out, and they all look the same.
479480	482680	It's just, I don't care.
482680	489420	I wish, I don't know, I wish it would do something innovative, like take one of those franchises
489420	494680	like Mario or Zelda and do like a little big planet thing with it.
494680	499240	You know, have this fucking amazing level editor with it and just, you could even make
499240	505440	it like an old, you know, the 16-bit Zelda, like do that, re-release that and have this
505440	508840	fucking amazing level editor where you can share it online and stuff like that.
508840	513720	I'm gonna bring you back, because this isn't a prediction, this is wank.
513720	517440	This is what you want to see, this isn't what you're gonna see.
517440	524640	I'm prepared to be completely underwhelmed by Nintendo, that's my prediction, that they'll
524640	528960	talk about all this wonderful stuff that the Wii U can do, and it'll be just these stupid
528960	536680	games that, hey look, it's WWE 13, but with this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Darksiders
536680	542560	2, but this extra feature, oh hey look, it's Batman Arkham City that came out last year,
542560	544840	but it has this extra feature.
544840	548280	I don't fucking care, that's not gonna make me, I'm not buying another console because
548280	550200	it has a cool gimmick.
550200	553120	I mean, I want something that's gonna be a little bit different.
553120	557120	The Wii was very different than what was out there on the market, that's why I was interested
557120	562320	in it, and it was completely boring later on, because there was nothing really good
562320	563840	for it.
563840	565560	Nothing I really needed to have.
565560	568320	How about Microsoft and Sony?
568320	573180	Microsoft, I'm waiting for a lot of announcements from them, because they really don't know
573180	577200	a whole ton of what's coming out, and obviously they're gonna talk about the new Gears of
577200	581740	War game, which really don't care about that.
581740	589120	I'm hoping we'll see, they'll probably announce their TV thing, the whole initiative where
589120	593720	they're gonna have some sort of IPTV, that'd be kinda nice, because all these little apps
593720	598920	that they have that are tied to your cable, hey you can have the Xfinity app, oh but you
598920	602480	have to have Xfinity in order to actually view any of the content on there, well fuck,
602480	607200	you know what, I can do that on my PC, why do I need your stupid app?
607200	609320	It's very useless for me.
609320	614760	If it's something like, hey you pay for Xbox Live and you get TV content with that, awesome,
614760	620040	cool then I don't have to pay for cable, of course cable doesn't want you to do that,
620040	621040	but we'll see.
621040	628400	And then for PlayStation, Sony, I mean, I don't know, it's really, it kinda, it's going
628400	632440	back to what we were saying before, it's very meh, there's nothing I'm really expecting,
632440	638680	that's the thing, it's nothing like, oh I can't wait to hear about this, I just don't
638680	643560	think anything's gonna happen, I mean, I would like to, I'm predicting that they'll talk
643560	647840	about new Vita titles, because I gotta tell you right now, the two that I was looking
647840	655360	forward to, Resistance and Gravity Rush, Resistance apparently is pretty terrible, and that's
655360	659440	not good, Gravity Rush I hear is kind of okay, there's a demo out for Gravity Rush, there's
659440	663760	a demo out for both, but I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet, but I hear, I mean
663760	667360	I hear it's okay, but it's not like, woo, gotta have that, Resistance was one of those
667360	671120	things, I was like, ooh, first person shooter, that might be really cool, and then here it's
671120	676920	just kinda meh, and so, I'm like, well crap, now I have to wait until the fall for some
676920	682720	good games to come out, and we're back to the 3DS again, where it's just like, well
682720	686840	crap, you know, I gotta wait until the fall for some good games to come out, it's like,
686840	688720	am I gonna have to sell this system too?
688720	695560	Alright, I'll go real quick, I think Nintendo, I obviously, is gonna be very heavy on the
695560	700680	Wii U and the 3DS, I, this may just be the fanboy wank in me, but I kinda think they're
700680	704280	gonna drop F-Zero on us, and I'm gonna have to get one, I think that's, I think that's
704280	708080	what's gonna ultimately happen, and I think there'll be something kinda cool where that
708080	713000	little tablet's gonna have like the map, and kinda like the racer's cockpit or something,
713000	716360	and maybe something like being able to use like power-ups and stuff will be all on the
716360	721400	little touch screen, and then the HD screen will be nothing but gorgeousness, you know,
721400	725920	and possible fan wank, but I just, there are rumors that that could be the big one that's
725920	731400	being dropped, so I'm just gonna remain hopeful, I really hope this is Nintendo's chance to
731400	736680	finally prove that they get online, and I think they are gonna show that they get online
736680	741800	finally, but no more so than say Sony, you know, it's not gonna be like, oh my god, Nintendo's
741800	747000	the must-have online, so I think they'll do about as well as Sony.
747000	752200	Microsoft, I really don't know what they can do to impress me at this point, especially
752200	755560	if they are gonna be hedging their bets on two big first-person shooters, which usually
755560	759360	aren't my kinda game, I don't know what to think.
759360	760920	I wanna see new franchises.
760920	766920	I really do too, and I want something to be on Kinect that's interesting, there was that
766920	770200	whole gladiator game they showed last year that we never really heard anything about
770200	773960	again, and I imagine they're gonna show more of that this year, but I'm not, mmm.
773960	779360	It's Fable, The Journey is gonna be their big Kinect game, it's not on Rails!
779360	784520	Well, you know what, again, and a great example of where the bar is really effing low, and
784520	788840	here's a chance to blow me away, so maybe, maybe, cause I liked Fable 2.
788840	791600	I don't think there's ever gonna be another good Fable.
791600	792600	We'll see.
792600	797440	I think only the bet rises and you come out for this console.
797440	801760	The other thing I wanna say about Microsoft though is I still think Windows 8, I think
801760	805040	Windows 8 gets dropped at some point during the conference, it's Microsoft's big push
805040	809560	at the end of the year, as a company, that whole synergy, there's gonna be something
809560	811200	with your Xbox and Windows 8.
811200	812200	Just wait.
812200	813200	Ooh, fantastic!
813200	814200	Yep.
814200	815200	Exactly.
815200	818640	I was watching a video of that interface today, and granted, there are things that they've
818640	823840	made improvements to, but that fuckin' Metro desktop is...
823840	825080	That is all optional, right?
825080	826720	I don't have to use that, right?
826720	827720	I don't know.
827720	828720	Question mark?
828720	829720	Oh boy.
829720	830720	That replaces the start menu.
830720	831720	Oh boy, alright.
831720	832840	Um, Sony.
832840	837960	You know, Sony is so unpredictable, and yet, I think is really predictable, I mean, obviously
837960	842480	you're gonna have the God of War, you're gonna have probably more hints of the Last Guardian
842480	846960	and the PlayStation fighting game, but at the same time, I feel like last year we thought
846960	852140	we knew everything Sony was gonna do, and they did kinda have a lot of surprises still.
852140	858040	So I have faith that Sony could still shock us with something, but I just, you know, I'm
858040	861200	hoping again it's that game I haven't seen yet.
861200	866160	So I, and I think there will still be, of course, more Vita, and I'm hoping for more
866160	871080	Vita, PlayStation 3 kinda, you know, togetherness.
871080	872640	So we'll see.
872640	877360	There is that, what was that dungeon crawler game that never ended up coming out with the
877360	878360	Vita's launch?
878360	879360	I don't remember what it's called now.
879360	880360	Paperware the game?
880360	881360	No, something...
881360	882360	I know what you're talking about.
882360	883360	It's like Diablo, but not...
883360	884360	They showed that off last year, I imagine more of that.
884360	887840	Well they had, they had the one that was at launch, the Ubisoft title that ties in, I
887840	888840	think.
888840	889840	No, no, no, no, I'm not talking about that.
889840	890840	No, I know what you're talking about, the Sony one.
890840	891840	I don't remember what the hell it's called.
891840	892840	It's not Sorcery either.
892840	893840	No, it's not Sorcery.
893840	894840	That's the Vita.
894840	895840	No, I know what you're talking about.
895840	896840	Yeah.
896840	898520	Because they just were talking about like, oh hey, where's that game?
898520	900420	And yeah, I don't know.
900420	905960	But again, I'm hoping it's not just, you know, I mean, again, last year, despite, I think
905960	909560	there was a leak a couple weeks in advance, but otherwise that Twisted Metal game kinda,
909560	910960	you know, was a surprise.
910960	914560	You know, I'm hoping for some surprises, but we'll, we'll see.
914560	915560	Anyhow.
915560	916700	New franchises.
916700	918200	That's all I'm saying.
918200	920120	Each one should come out with a new franchise.
920120	923560	I mean, there's, there's some pretty cool ideas that they have for new franchises, like
923560	927360	remember Cameo, the launch title for the 360?
927360	930820	That was like really cool looking when they showed it off at E3, and it was okay when
930820	935280	it came out, but it could have been a good sequel, huh?
935280	937440	It could have been a good title.
937440	941520	Like that, that type of game was pretty cool and not something that really the Xbox has
941520	942520	from Microsoft.
942520	946400	They don't have that type of platforming, like a Ratchet and Clank or something.
946400	950160	They need something like that.
950160	954400	Alrighty I'm gonna move on here and start to get into tonight's news just to kinda wrap
954400	955400	things up though.
955400	958320	Again, hopefully, hopefully we're all pleasantly surprised.
958320	963160	I know we're feeling kinda eh about this year's E3.
963160	969960	I really hope it gets people buzzed because this Christmas could be quite a disaster for
969960	974320	video games in general if, you know, there's not anything to get excited about.
974320	975640	That could be bad.
975640	976640	Here's one thing though.
976640	981080	If the video game market could live through a recession, I don't know that it's gonna
981080	982080	have a problem.
982080	987920	Well, but if this year is bad, that could have a real impact on the Sony Microsoft consoles
987920	988920	next year.
988920	989920	Oh please.
989920	990920	Grand Theft Auto for October.
990920	992640	Please Grand Theft Auto for October.
992640	993640	We'll see.
993640	994640	You know, actually, what was that?
994640	996360	The Lego City stories.
996360	998400	Still wanna hear about that.
998400	1001800	That actually would, might sell me a Wii U.
1001800	1002800	Maybe.
1002800	1006760	Alright, I'm gonna get into some housekeeping real quick here.
1006760	1010040	First off, again, I wanna plug the live show even though we're taped tonight.
1010040	1015000	We will be back next week, June 10th, to talk about everything that happened at E3.
1015000	1020120	And that'll be available at vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right
1020120	1022040	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
1022040	1028000	Also, by the time you guys hear this, the full vognetwork.com website should have launched.
1028000	1032740	We had, or we're having, I have to think what tense to use here.
1032740	1038140	So, since you guys are hearing this Sunday, we had a special on Friday talking about the
1038140	1039600	future of the network.
1039600	1044200	I don't wanna repeat it here because it's like 95% ago right now, but there is a chance
1044200	1045480	it could be delayed to the 8th.
1045480	1046480	We will has had.
1046480	1048560	Yes, you will has had by this point.
1048560	1052240	My hope is, though, by the time you guys are hearing this, the full vognetwork.com website
1052240	1057920	did in fact launch, so check it out, and just, it's gonna be awesome.
1057920	1061680	There were unicorns and rainbows and- I don't know about unicorns, but there may
1061680	1062780	be rainbows.
1062780	1066000	There was definitely a unicorn on the test site, but I think that's being removed for
1066000	1067240	the full.
1067240	1068240	There were sheep.
1068240	1069240	That was interesting.
1069240	1070240	There were sheep.
1070240	1072240	Oh, did you see that?
1072240	1074520	I saw that.
1074520	1075520	That was my graphic design.
1075520	1076800	There were sheep and men in underwear.
1076800	1084300	All right, anyhow, vognetwork.com should be live 24-7 now as well, and a full website
1084300	1085300	for you guys to see.
1085300	1086300	So, that'll be fun.
1086300	1088920	All right, anyhow, moving on.
1088920	1091840	Let's talk about the news.
1091840	1093560	Loki, why don't you start us off?
1093560	1094560	And no gaming week?
1094560	1095560	Oh, shit.
1095560	1097520	Yeah, we should talk about our gaming weeks, huh?
1097520	1098520	Dark soccer.
1098520	1100360	All the E3 talk got me sidetracked.
1100360	1102240	Dark soccer, how was your gaming week?
1102240	1104400	We've only had half a week, too.
1104400	1111440	I played- actually, Dan got the new Arkham City expansion, the Harley Quinn's Revenge.
1111440	1112760	Oh, yeah, that looked really neat.
1112760	1116880	I watched about half of it, and then I had to go to bed, because I had taken NyQuil,
1116880	1119260	and I was like, ugh.
1119260	1126460	You play a lot of it as Robin, and as much as I liked Harley Quinn's voice actor, she
1126460	1131680	gets really annoying after a while, so whatever.
1131680	1138400	And also, for fans of certain little Easter eggs that were found in the game before, you
1138400	1139400	can get pissed off.
1139400	1140400	So, just saying.
1140400	1144720	Don't get your hopes up, wah.
1144720	1146400	I already know exactly what it's got to be.
1146400	1147400	All right.
1147400	1148400	Yeah.
1148400	1157480	So, anyway, I played- I had this really good streak in Fractal, which I love that fucking
1157480	1158480	game.
1158480	1163120	Fractal is so fun, and I had a really good streak, and then I got pissed off at the game
1163120	1165520	again and stopped playing.
1165520	1172800	So then I played some WoW, and played some Star Trek Online, only to find out that they
1172800	1181660	completely redid your skills, and it's stupid, so I'm like, ugh, I don't have my kickass
1181660	1182660	bomb skills anymore.
1182660	1186680	Don't you hate that when you leave an MMO and then you come back and they change everything?
1186680	1188680	Yeah.
1188680	1193800	But apparently, like, some of the stuff I have, my legacy items, are pretty good, so.
1193800	1194800	Oh, that's good.
1194800	1198680	I'm still an admiral piloting a Defiant.
1198680	1200400	Are you still playing with all the Scottish people?
1200400	1203560	They weren't on, only a couple people were on, and they weren't the Scotsmen.
1203560	1205960	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
1205960	1208800	They're apparently all still there, they're just there at weird times.
1208800	1209800	Probably.
1209800	1210800	All right.
1210800	1212000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1212000	1213000	I played Minecraft.
1213000	1215000	Of course you did!
1215000	1217840	I played lots of Minecraft.
1217840	1219320	I built a giant pig.
1219320	1223680	Oh, God, I saw the pictures on your Twitter.
1223680	1229080	When you say you built a giant pig, you must have found the pixel layout somewhere online.
1229080	1230800	There's a guide online.
1230800	1232120	Oh my gosh.
1232120	1234160	I love, it was like a hollow pig.
1234160	1235160	You could climb up the ladder.
1235160	1236720	Yeah, you can climb up the ladder into it.
1236720	1237720	It's a house.
1237720	1238720	You can live in its butt.
1238720	1239720	You can live inside.
1239720	1240720	And guess, actually, here's the best part.
1240720	1243400	It's like the dinosaurs in Pee Wee's Big Adventure.
1243400	1245160	Remember when they go to watch the sunrise?
1245160	1246540	You can live in a pig's ass.
1246540	1250740	You can live inside the pig, and not only that, near its ass, because it's on the inside
1250740	1252200	of its ass, there's a chest.
1252200	1253200	What's inside the chest?
1253200	1254200	Pork chops!
1254200	1255200	Yes!
1255200	1256200	Yes!
1256200	1258000	The pork chops are in there.
1258000	1261280	Oh, dog, I heard you like pigs, so I put pig in your pig.
1261280	1262280	Exactly.
1262280	1263280	So you could be a pig.
1263280	1264280	I don't know.
1264280	1266280	I just thought that would be fun.
1266280	1267280	What do I want to build next?
1267280	1268280	I'll build a giant pig.
1268280	1271880	That thing is scary, because I'll be running through, and then I'll look out the window
1271880	1273480	and see this pig.
1273480	1276360	And it's just like, it's always there, staring at you.
1276360	1278680	Hey, hey, hey, I have a question for you.
1278680	1284220	Can you make a slide, because you could totally make a tongue slide for your pig?
1284220	1286880	You can make a water slide.
1286880	1288400	You should make a drooling pig water slide.
1288400	1291160	Are you going to make a water slide out of its bum, because that's kind of gross.
1291160	1292160	No.
1292160	1294080	Do it in its mouth so it can be the drooling pig.
1294080	1297280	I thought about making, see, I was going to have that pig, and I was going to have another
1297280	1304000	pig to re-skin, to make it all evil looking, with glowing eyes and fire, and spikes sticking
1304000	1305000	up.
1305000	1306000	Darth Pig!
1306000	1307000	Darth Pig!
1307000	1310800	Oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink!
1310800	1314360	It was funny, though, because all the pigs keep wandering around the giant pig.
1314360	1317200	It's like they're worshipping the idol.
1317200	1318200	Wow.
1318200	1323620	All hail our bacony god!
1323620	1328520	But yeah, and another thing, too, Robson, since we're on the same map.
1328520	1329520	If you go to...
1329520	1331920	You know I started a new map, actually, a long time ago.
1331920	1332920	What?!
1332920	1333920	Yeah, I'm on seed OLR.
1333920	1335400	I'm not on seed VoG anymore.
1335400	1336400	I got sick of VoG.
1336400	1338400	But I'm sick of OLR, too.
1338400	1341240	You need to go back to VoG, because you know why?
1341240	1348280	Because if you go to the bottom, the southwestern portion of the map, there's this giant hole
1348280	1351720	that goes straight into the ground with a waterfall in it and stuff, and it's pretty
1351720	1353160	awesome inside there.
1353160	1354460	That's cool.
1354460	1355460	You know what you need to do?
1355460	1357680	You need to put a video on YouTube of your giant pig.
1357680	1359680	Once I'm done.
1359680	1363200	Da, da, da, da, da, da!
1363200	1364880	Well I'm going to have...
1364880	1365880	I've already...
1365880	1369600	I'm planning on making a giant rollercoaster ride thing, or possibly...
1369600	1370600	Oh my god!
1370600	1373280	They even have water slides that you can make.
1373280	1375880	You can make a water slide thing with jumps and all this cool stuff.
1375880	1377800	What has happened just three months ago?
1377800	1380440	I should go find a clip from this show just three months ago.
1380440	1381440	Minecraft?
1381440	1382440	What the hell?
1382440	1383440	Why do people play Minecraft?
1383440	1384440	I don't get this game.
1384440	1385440	Or just ask Dark Sakura.
1385440	1388440	Hey, Dark Sakura, what do you think of Minecraft?
1388440	1393720	Yeah, and then Loki in the meantime, I'm going to make a fucking Minecraft theme park, woo!
1393720	1394720	You know what, though?
1394720	1399860	As soon as somebody either pays for me to have an account or gets it to me for free
1399860	1400860	somehow.
1400860	1401860	Let's play the demo.
1401860	1402860	No, I don't like demos.
1402860	1406120	I'll pay for you to quit complaining.
1406120	1407600	Hold on, I think I have a dollar.
1407600	1408600	Hold on.
1408600	1409600	Here, hold on.
1409600	1410600	Let me just dig in my pocket.
1410600	1413560	I'll take that dollar too, and I'll stop complaining for five seconds.
1413560	1417640	Here, alright, I'm putting one dollar, this is a great radio show, here's my dollar, and
1417640	1422280	I'm putting it in the Dark Sakura Quit Your Bitchin' and Buy Minecraft Fund.
1422280	1423280	There it is.
1423280	1424280	I have a dollar.
1424280	1425280	Pinkberry!
1425280	1426280	Here, take your dollar.
1426280	1427280	I don't want your dirty money.
1427280	1428280	No.
1428280	1434160	That is the most non-Jewish thing you've ever done.
1434160	1440800	Remember back when I popped up the volume, and the little thing said, give me a dollar?
1440800	1442640	People did send me dollars.
1442640	1443640	A couple people.
1443640	1445080	Someone sent me a two dollar bill.
1445080	1446800	Kickstarter to buy Jamie Minecraft.
1446800	1449160	This was before Kickstarter, they should be paying me.
1449160	1451600	Alright, anyhow, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1451600	1454720	I played a little bit of Call of Duty, we actually played a Kill Confirmed game with
1454720	1458040	just the three of us, so that was fun.
1458040	1461720	We just don't play a lot of Call of Duty anymore, because everyone's really busy and my coworker's
1461720	1464760	out for a couple weeks, and it's just...
1464760	1468720	So I get more Minecraft time then.
1468720	1472600	But yeah, I started getting bored though, because I'm like, well, I don't know really
1472600	1476840	what else to do in here, and so I don't know, we'll see.
1476840	1482160	So I may actually go start a new seed at some point, but I don't know, how's the old RC?
1482160	1485240	Not that great, actually, but then again I haven't explored the entire map, but I can
1485240	1490120	tell you, the underground really annoys the hell out of me, and there's some weird...
1490120	1494880	There's like, okay, if you want like just this gigantic mountain where the bottom half
1494880	1499480	is all cave and it's the weirdest thing, it's available on that map.
1499480	1502280	I would almost play it just to see how different it is.
1502280	1506720	There's some seeds I've seen that are really crazy, like just valleys inside of a mountain
1506720	1509440	with lava and water and all sorts of strange stuff.
1509440	1512880	Well whenever we get those VoG forums that may or may not be there, when you hear this...
1512880	1515360	I have no idea what the crap you guys are talking about.
1515360	1517680	You should share some of your awesome seeds for Minecraft.
1517680	1519800	All right, look, let's move on.
1519800	1520800	What seed?
1520800	1521800	Like what...
1521800	1526600	You tell it what word you give it, you can give it random numbers and letters or capital,
1526600	1530920	you know, you give it a word and you can make a world that uses that as the seed.
1530920	1534800	But the good thing about that is that like if I use capital V, capital O, capital G,
1534800	1539240	and he uses the same thing, we have the same world essentially, even though it's kind of
1539240	1541380	randomized, if that makes sense.
1541380	1547000	I'm just thinking of Final Fantasy VIII now, where there were seed members in their gardens.
1547000	1548000	No, no.
1548000	1549360	All right, my gaming week.
1549360	1553800	Honestly, I've been working on the website, not as much as Bobby has, but I still have
1553800	1556760	been working on that quite a bit this week, so I haven't had a whole lot of time to game.
1556760	1559920	When I have gamed, I've played a little bit of Warcraft.
1559920	1563420	Shane and I have been running some dungeons to get heirlooms for the monks, we will inevitably
1563420	1565220	roll in the expansion.
1565220	1569760	And otherwise, I checked out the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer expansion, the... is it the
1569760	1571520	Rebellion Pack, or was that the last one?
1571520	1572520	I don't know.
1572520	1573520	Yeah, I remember.
1573520	1574520	Oh, Recruit...
1574520	1575520	Something war-related.
1575520	1579600	Another freaking multiplayer pack came out this week, and it adds the two male Quarians,
1579600	1583920	the two Cerberus defectors, and the two Vortia.
1583920	1586520	And dang, people are already unlocking shit.
1586520	1591400	I went into a random, and I already was playing with a male Quarian, which was kind of neat,
1591400	1592960	to just kind of see one running around.
1592960	1595880	And I got to play on one of the new maps.
1595880	1599400	So there are two new maps, one of them is, I think it's Thessia was the one I was playing
1599400	1602840	on, because it's based off that one, well I don't want to spoil it because it's staged
1602840	1605680	near the end of the game, but something big happens there.
1605680	1610520	So I was, yeah, I was having a good time on that map, and apparently there's a new type
1610520	1613060	of credit game, too.
1613060	1616840	On the third, sixth, and tenth wave, you have to do something different than just killing
1616840	1617840	everybody.
1617840	1621760	It's either like, hit the four beacons, or upload all the data.
1621760	1625360	Now there's a new one that's kind of like, fetch it and bring it back.
1625360	1629560	So, and it's kind of like Murderball, where the person who's carrying it walks really
1629560	1633000	slow, and is more vulnerable to attack, so I kind of like that they're doing different
1633000	1634000	things with it.
1634000	1636360	You know, Mass Effect, good times.
1636360	1640140	After finally having played the entire fucking trilogy up to this point, it's kind of nice
1640140	1644120	to be current, and get to experience a lot of this Mass Effect hub-a-loo when it's current,
1644120	1645680	so that part's cool.
1645680	1648080	All right, now we can do gaming news, right?
1648080	1649080	Yes.
1649080	1650080	All right, let's do it.
1650080	1656760	All right, let's talk a little bit about rumors, and apparently Sony is rumored to be looking
1656760	1663320	to buy a cloud gaming service, whether it's going to be Gaikai or OnLive.
1663320	1665000	The thought, though, is it's probably going to be-
1665000	1668600	Or the Phantom.
1668600	1672600	Well you have to have a cloud gaming service first, you can't just say, hey, we've got
1672600	1676780	this cloud gaming service, it's behind that wall over there, but trust us, it's there.
1676780	1679560	This giant E3 booth we have.
1679560	1681520	It works great.
1681520	1683320	Seriously.
1683320	1684320	It's awesome.
1684320	1685320	Yeah, our first game-
1685320	1686320	Take our word for it.
1686320	1687320	We can't show it to you, it's awesome.
1687320	1691280	Our first game coming out for it's called Snake Oil.
1691280	1692280	Forget it.
1692280	1693280	Yeah.
1693280	1701080	So, and I guess the speculation also kind of goes along with what Gaikai was saying
1701080	1705960	about E3, saying that, you know what, there may not be new consoles, because if you think
1705960	1713520	about it, if the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 adapt cloud gaming, there really doesn't need
1713520	1717400	to be a new console, because they just upgrade the stuff that's on the server side.
1717400	1719600	Oh, they'll always find a way to sell you something.
1719600	1721320	It's never going to happen, people.
1721320	1722320	It's never going to happen.
1722320	1728560	It may happen to coexist with regular stuff like renting titles or stuff like that, but
1728560	1731560	it's never going to be, you just-
1731560	1736520	Until it's the holodeck, there will always be a need for another console.
1736520	1740520	Or, Intella will suck your dick, let's be real.
1740520	1745400	The console either has to be the holodeck, or if they build the console, then they don't
1745400	1746400	need anything else.
1746400	1747400	If I lose out-
1747400	1748400	What?
1748400	1749400	Well, I'm losing out there.
1749400	1750400	Well, no, no, no.
1750400	1751400	It'll be the holodeck.
1751400	1752400	You can demand horizontal holodeck.
1752400	1753720	They'll be an inverter for women.
1753720	1755880	But I'm just saying, though, there's never-
1755880	1758820	It comes with a vacuum attachment.
1758820	1763560	There's never- Well, even when the blowjob machine and the holodeck come out, they're
1763560	1765100	going to need to make improvements to that.
1765100	1768720	There's always going to be improvements done to everything.
1768720	1769720	That's true.
1769720	1771640	It would be too bad if you get a glitchy hoe.
1771640	1774920	Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
1774920	1775920	Let it go.
1775920	1776920	Let it go.
1776920	1777920	Let it go.
1777920	1778920	No!
1778920	1779920	Female attachment!
1779920	1781920	Not the male attachment.
1781920	1782920	Bad.
1782920	1783920	Anyways.
1783920	1790520	So, yeah, I mean, it could be interesting.
1790520	1792920	I guess we'll have to wait and see what's going on there.
1792920	1797840	I'm sure that announcement next week will be in the works if they are going to do something
1797840	1799640	like that.
1799640	1801240	It makes a lot of sense.
1801240	1802240	It doesn't make a lot of sense.
1802240	1807160	I mean, they could do a lot of different- I mean, I don't think it's going to be only
1807160	1808160	that.
1808160	1813920	Because, you know, another thing that they can consider, at least Sony did, was making
1813920	1814920	it online only.
1814920	1815920	Yeah.
1815920	1819040	Think about this, though, real quick.
1819040	1824720	If they do adopt, like, a cloud gaming thing, then they can have all the fucking control.
1824720	1825720	You know what I mean?
1825720	1826720	Think about it.
1826720	1828880	Because when it's in there, they get all of the fucking control.
1828880	1833240	Like, they could release, like, a beta game or something that you could play for, like,
1833240	1834760	an hour, and then it's, like, pulled.
1834760	1835760	You know?
1835760	1838560	And then the advertisement's right in the middle of it, and there's nothing you can
1838560	1839560	do about it.
1839560	1843720	Like, that part of it's kind of interesting to me.
1843720	1846800	Yeah, they could do that, and then everybody else doesn't do that, and then no one plays
1846800	1847800	it.
1847800	1851800	So, um, I don't know.
1851800	1857040	But yeah, basically they ultimately rejected the idea of a download-only console because
1857040	1861320	they remembered, hey, we released something called the PlayStation Portable Go, and that
1861320	1863280	sucked.
1863280	1867240	So they didn't, they decided not to do that instead.
1867240	1869960	Maybe we're just not ready for online-only yet.
1869960	1871720	That's, that's probably true.
1871720	1876800	I mean, especially when, you know, you can't, it would look really stupid to have one article
1876800	1882720	come out about Sony PlayStation 4 to be online-only right next to the article that comes out and
1882720	1887800	says Comcast finally firms up their plan on how to enforce their bandwidth caps and starting
1887800	1889300	at 300 gigs.
1889300	1890300	Or even better.
1890300	1893320	It's like Sony puts out online-only consoles.
1893320	1895740	Servers for online console are being throttled.
1895740	1898640	No one can play anything on their console.
1898640	1899880	Fantastic.
1899880	1905360	But if you buy the special Xfinity version, then it won't count against your cap.
1905360	1906960	Comcast subsidized two-year agreement.
1906960	1907960	I'm telling you.
1907960	1911000	I mean, seriously, if it goes online-only, hey, guess what?
1911000	1912000	Guess what, console makers?
1912000	1915160	Here's a little, little fact for you.
1915160	1917360	You know we don't have to buy consoles.
1917360	1921920	You know there are things called PCs that are open platforms that, oh my god, there's
1921920	1923600	not these fucking restrictions on.
1923600	1927240	I mean, they may be on certain games, but guess what, we don't play those games.
1927240	1930120	So no one's forcing us to buy these consoles.
1930120	1936000	Well, it's funny you bring up PC games because Diablo III is one of the big PC games, of
1936000	1937740	course, in the world right now.
1937740	1940480	And as you know, they've been having quite a few issues.
1940480	1942520	You know, especially launch day was really bad.
1942520	1946160	It got a little better for a little bit, but just within the past couple days before we're
1946160	1947160	taping this show.
1947160	1950840	Unfortunately, there's been more Error 37s, the auction house has been delayed, and so
1950840	1951840	on.
1951840	1956160	Well, one country is taking this shit seriously, and it's Korea.
1956160	1957560	The Korean Federal Trade Commission-
1957560	1960780	They take their Diablo series, they take all their Blizzard games seriously.
1960780	1966520	Like when I say seriously, like no joke, the Federal Trade Commission in Korea raided Blizzard's
1966520	1968840	Seoul office earlier this week.
1968840	1971360	That's, you know, South Korea.
1971360	1972360	Because of consumer claims-
1972360	1977740	And those WoW subscriptions were expensive, but man, that they're collecting souls now?
1977740	1978740	That's just ridiculous.
1978740	1979740	Stop it.
1979740	1984720	Uh, Blizzard apparently refused to refund Diablo III to Korean players who should have
1984720	1987040	been eligible after consumer complaints.
1987040	1992440	The FTC thinks that Blizzard is violating Korean law on electronic commerce and commercial
1992440	1993440	contracts.
1993440	1997280	They're trying to gather evidence and so forth related to this raid.
1997280	2001300	Korean players are frustrated with the server issues happening in Diablo III and asking
2001300	2002300	for refunds.
2002300	2004680	The user denied it, saying contract terms.
2004680	2008040	You know that whole little thing that you scroll through real quick and agree to play
2008040	2009040	the game?
2009040	2010040	Yeah, that's contract.
2010040	2015760	Um, the FTC is considering these terms to not be good to the player base, as you can
2015760	2016760	imagine.
2016760	2020520	Quote, we have received many complaints from Diablo III users.
2020520	2025720	So just like people here complain to the government, it's happening in Korea too, and they raided
2025720	2026720	the office.
2026720	2031600	Well, I always have a problem with those contracts, if you will, anyways, because I'm not presented
2031600	2033700	that contract before I purchase the item.
2033700	2038120	It's like, I get this sprung upon me once I open the box and try and install and play
2038120	2039120	the game.
2039120	2043600	At that point, it's like, too fucking late, haha, you either agree to this or you get
2043600	2044600	nothing.
2044600	2051240	Um, now, one very interesting note I want to share is, according to the Korea Times,
2051240	2057500	the FTC is investigating if Blizzard should be liable for its ill preparation in regards
2057500	2059880	to player traffic.
2059880	2062880	I don't know if I've ever heard anything like that before.
2062880	2063880	That's interesting.
2063880	2069520	Basically, that Blizzard could be responsible for not being prepared for how big their game
2069520	2071520	was going to be.
2071520	2074880	I don't know why, but I find that fucking fascinating.
2074880	2079200	And I think that they should be liable, because they had a beta, they knew how much traffic
2079200	2082840	was going to be in there, and they need to have enough servers, and they didn't.
2082840	2084740	I mean, come on.
2084740	2088360	You're telling me that you don't realize how many copies of your game are out there?
2088360	2091720	You know how many copies you printed, and you're just assuming that not everyone's going
2091720	2093280	to be online at the same time.
2093280	2095280	Which was a dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb thing to do.
2095280	2097680	You need to expect the worst case scenario.
2097680	2099520	You need to have those extra servers.
2099520	2101040	Stop trying to cut costs.
2101040	2106240	Because, you know what, you didn't have to make this an online only fucking game.
2106240	2107760	That's your fault.
2107760	2112880	Now, um, you know, looking ahead here, if something were to happen, and let's say the
2112880	2117800	game gets pulled in Korea or something, it's not actually the worst case scenario for Blizzard,
2117800	2122000	because the real money auction house already doesn't exist in Asia, and I believe that
2122000	2123160	was also because of Korea.
2123160	2124520	I wouldn't let them do it.
2124520	2128840	So, um, it's still one to watch, though.
2128840	2130940	This is kind of unprecedented.
2130940	2134720	So I'm very curious to see what comes of this.
2134720	2138480	If anything, this could also just be, you know, for headlines, and, you know, to let
2138480	2141960	everybody know we are not messing around, people.
2141960	2144520	This could just end up being a big slap on the wrist and negative press.
2144520	2145520	Who knows?
2145520	2148120	There's no such thing as negative press.
2148120	2150240	There's only press.
2150240	2151240	Interesting way to look at it.
2151240	2152240	Well, it's true.
2152240	2153240	I know.
2153240	2155240	What about press with a negative slant?
2155240	2156240	What about Lee press-on-nails?
2156240	2157240	Ew.
2157240	2158240	Tacky.
2158240	2162240	In more ways than one.
2162240	2171920	Well, speaking of tacky, Konami, bitches, so, how many of us were led to believe that
2171920	2176280	the Silent Hill HD Collection was a port?
2176280	2179880	They were porting and then rescanning and redoing voices and stuff.
2179880	2181320	Up to the part with the fog?
2181320	2183120	Yeah, I kind of thought that.
2183120	2187320	Well, it was actually not ported from the final version of the game.
2187320	2191520	It was ported from incomplete source code.
2191520	2198240	They actually lost the source codes for the Silent Hill games.
2198240	2204080	The missing source code parts were replaced with frog DNA, and that's how they got Jurassic
2204080	2205080	Park.
2205080	2211420	Well, here is what the producer Tom Hewlett had to say.
2211420	2215880	We got all the source code that Konami had on file, which in turn wasn't the final release
2215880	2217220	of the games.
2217220	2224140	So during the debug, we didn't just have to deal with the expected porting bugs, but also
2224140	2228320	had to squash some bugs that the original team obviously removed prior to release that
2228320	2230640	we had never seen before.
2230640	2235400	So it looks like they just were working with what was left over.
2235400	2238680	It was sort of like what you do when you've got left over spaghetti, but you don't have
2238680	2240640	enough to make a full meal out of it.
2240640	2243720	So you like make a sandwich or something out of your spaghetti.
2243720	2244840	A spaghetti sandwich?
2244840	2245840	I've done it.
2245840	2246840	Wow.
2246840	2247840	I was in college.
2247840	2248840	You know what, ladies and gentlemen?
2248840	2252360	I don't think any other gaming podcast in the history of ever would compare Silent Hill
2252360	2254960	HD to a spaghetti sandwich, but there you go.
2254960	2257560	They're both terrible.
2257560	2258560	I don't know.
2258560	2259560	Spaghetti sandwiches.
2259560	2263480	Cold spaghetti sandwich on sourdough bread is actually okay.
2263480	2265120	Just saying, just saying.
2265120	2267960	It's like kind of like a sloppy joe with noodles.
2267960	2269520	Subway sells meatball sandwiches.
2269520	2270520	That's the other half.
2270520	2271520	They're not very good either.
2271520	2274240	I was going to say, though, that that's the problem.
2274240	2277640	That's why we had all the issues, because they used frog DNA instead of fog DNA.
2277640	2281920	You know, there's no fog in there because they didn't use the right DNA.
2281920	2287240	You didn't say the magic word, uh, uh, uh.
2287240	2291400	Well, the other thing, the other quote in here was saying, um, and this is actually
2291400	2292400	pretty funny.
2292400	2293400	I'm going to read this.
2293400	2294400	Okay.
2294400	2297280	A lot of issues such as textures and sound had to be taken out of the compiled game.
2297280	2302060	And that brings with it a host of unique issues, especially when taken on top of the tricky
2302060	2304240	coding workarounds that play in the original games.
2304240	2305680	We certainly had our hands full.
2305680	2310080	I think at one point Heather was blue.
2310080	2315000	La la la la la la la la la la killing pyramid had wrong game.
2315000	2319900	Well, if you can't cut it, then don't make the game.
2319900	2325360	But there's deadlines and investors and stuff.
2325360	2326600	Angry internets.
2326600	2334880	I mean, if, if people have decompiled, because you know, people have decompiled the, um,
2334880	2338080	release versions of the games, why couldn't they just do the same thing?
2338080	2345720	Well I look at shit like that Sonic HD that like outdid Sonic for episode one and I kind
2345720	2349080	of go, they did it without the original source code.
2349080	2350080	Yeah.
2350080	2351080	No.
2351080	2352080	All right.
2352080	2357280	This street, wasn't the streets of rage HD collection done with completely original programming?
2357280	2358280	Uh, yeah.
2358280	2359280	There was that fan one.
2359280	2360280	Yeah.
2360280	2361280	Yeah.
2361280	2362640	So those are all both like 2d stuff.
2362640	2367200	And then once again, this wasn't necessarily something that they needed to make.
2367200	2370640	They had put these games out before.
2370640	2371640	Why did they feel compelled?
2371640	2375560	Oh, I know money because they wanted quick, but we're also, I'm glad I didn't buy it.
2375560	2378320	We're honestly, where did they put the source code?
2378320	2386560	Like you would think that kind of stuff goes, uh, smuggled it out in his butt, clearly.
2386560	2391280	He left Konami and took it with him or, I mean, I guess a drive could get demagnetized
2391280	2393760	or something, but I mean, how do you lose source code?
2393760	2397240	That's why you make back ups.
2397240	2398240	Someone could find it on eBay.
2398240	2399840	Did you check behind the couch?
2399840	2401080	I'm going to look online.
2401080	2402680	Silent Hill source code.
2402680	2403680	All right.
2403680	2404680	Moving on.
2404680	2408240	Let's travel around the world and check out some, uh, release dates for games coming to
2408240	2411080	a store near you that are hopefully finished.
2411080	2413360	Well, there's never a guarantee anymore.
2413360	2418860	I mean, considering that, you know, the amount of patches and stuff that we get, but this
2418860	2420360	week we've gotten a few things.
2420360	2427480	Um, nothing terribly exciting, starting off with, uh, inversion on PlayStation 3 and Xbox
2427480	2428480	360.
2428480	2433520	It's like a third person shooter, but you can manipulate gravity.
2433520	2439640	And then of course Madagascar 3, tying in the new movie that's on PlayStation 3, Xbox
2439640	2443600	360, Wii, 3DS and DS.
2443600	2447440	Um, the new play control stuff is being re-released.
2447440	2453640	We've got the Mario Power Tennis on the Wii, which is a port of the GameCube game.
2453640	2458520	And then Pikmin 2, because Pikmin 2 never came out over here for some reason.
2458520	2462960	One of those, oh hey, we localized this game, but oh, we forgot to release it in the other
2462960	2463960	territory.
2463960	2466440	That whole new play control thing, right?
2466440	2470000	It just, well yeah, it came out like a couple in 2009.
2470000	2471840	We should put out a game on the Wii.
2471840	2475160	No, it's, it's seriously, hey, hey.
2475160	2477560	You know that the Wii's just like a GameCube.
2477560	2481880	We could take GameCube games and we'll add the Wii controls to it.
2481880	2486440	Yes, you kind of have to add the Wii controls to it because there are no GameCube controls.
2486440	2491320	In fact, that's actually a guarantee on some of the new consoles because there's no GameCube
2491320	2493120	controller ports.
2493120	2495440	Or backwards compatibility anymore.
2495440	2497560	Or backwards compatibility, yes, very true.
2497560	2505680	Um, so there's a, oh, oh, oh, and if you're a Sims 3 fan, Jamie.
2505680	2506680	I lost count.
2506680	2509640	The Sims 3 Katy Perry Sweet Treats pack.
2509640	2510640	Ew!
2510640	2512200	Mark Katy Perry!
2512200	2513520	Just in time for the movie.
2513520	2518040	I have actually officially stopped playing Sims 3.
2518040	2523560	Because they never, every time they would release it, they would never work out how
2523560	2527600	to get it to not have the crappy slowdown issue with your add-ons and stuff.
2527600	2529640	You know what this calls for?
2529640	2531240	Katy Perry Simlish music!
2531240	2533240	That was a good video.
2533240	2541120	That sounds about the same.
2541120	2545920	I honestly can't tell it's different.
2545920	2549800	It actually is a cute little video.
2549800	2551360	She's not a, oh, I forget it.
2551360	2552360	I need to stop shading.
2552360	2557840	Alright, and that's, I kid you not, that's literally it.
2557840	2562000	Unless you count Max Payne 3, which, you know, technically for us is coming out tomorrow,
2562000	2565200	but it would have been out on Friday, yeah.
2565200	2566200	Alright.
2566200	2567200	On PC.
2567200	2571160	Let's travel to Japan and check out the release dates over there.
2571160	2574280	Not a whole lot to get excited about, but there's a couple games here and there.
2574280	2580160	On the Playstation 3, Tokyo Jungle comes out this week, and I'm not sure exactly what this
2580160	2581160	game is.
2581160	2582640	It sounds like a zombie game.
2582640	2583880	Fucking amazing is what it is.
2583880	2584880	Is it?
2584880	2585880	It is awesome.
2585880	2586880	Let's see, the description here.
2586880	2590640	Humans disappeared from Tokyo all of a sudden, oh, so it's like 28 days later, leaving the
2590640	2593160	animals to fend for themselves.
2593160	2596480	Play the game as various animals in this apocalyptic scene.
2596480	2598480	Learn to hunt, gather, and mark territory?
2598480	2599480	Pee.
2599480	2600480	Game of the year!
2600480	2602840	No, I'm serious, this is fucking amazing.
2602840	2603840	You need to watch this.
2603840	2604840	You play by pee?
2604840	2605840	Right now.
2605840	2608560	Okay, I will watch this right now if it will load properly.
2608560	2611200	This is Africa good.
2611200	2612200	Africa good.
2612200	2613200	Africa.
2613200	2614200	Well, where is it?
2614200	2618280	Just type in YouTube, just type the game's title into YouTube, you'll find it.
2618280	2619280	Hey, Tokyo Jungle.
2619280	2621300	Where did you hear about this?
2621300	2622520	From them talking about Tokyo Jungle.
2622520	2623920	Is this coming out here?
2623920	2626000	No, but at least I don't think it is.
2626000	2627440	It very well could.
2627440	2632480	I posted actually a thing on Twitter about it, because they were talking about, you know,
2632480	2637620	like dogs and stuff like that, you know, pomeranes.
2637620	2638620	You get to be a pomeranian?
2638620	2639620	Yes, you can be a pomerane.
2639620	2640620	Oh.
2640620	2641620	This is a stinkin' add-on.
2641620	2642620	Let's wait for this.
2642620	2643620	Boo.
2643620	2644620	Buy me 30 seconds.
2644620	2649680	So anyways, yeah, they have pomeranians, they have like wolves you can play as, like, you
2649680	2653280	know, horses, cows, and they have different rabbits.
2653280	2654720	Can you be a fox?
2654720	2656720	I think you can be a fox, you might be able to.
2656720	2660320	And then, the best part about it is you unlock costumes for them, so you can get an elephant
2660320	2662940	and roller skates, and you can dress them up.
2662940	2667120	But it's a ridiculous looking game, I mean, it's just...
2667120	2668120	I need this game.
2668120	2669120	It's just crazy.
2669120	2670120	Okay, anyways, so now...
2670120	2671120	Here we go.
2671120	2672120	All right, Tokyo Jungle.
2672120	2674960	It is by Sony.
2674960	2676560	Or published by Sony.
2676560	2680560	Oh, it's Japan Studio, okay.
2680560	2681560	Crispies!
2681560	2685480	How many freakin' publishers...
2685480	2686480	Okay.
2686480	2690640	Okay, so we just see, like, an abandoned city.
2690640	2691640	Tokyo.
2691640	2692640	Tokyo.
2692640	2693640	Dog.
2693640	2703880	I wasn't a dog, I was, like, a panther person.
2703880	2706400	This is really terrible radio, y'all.
2706400	2711160	I'm trying to remember, there was Akotaku, there was it, and I think it was today, there
2711160	2713080	was a video on there.
2713080	2714080	Tokyo Jungle.
2714080	2719160	All right, now it should be, come on, kick into gear, show me the peeing.
2719160	2723920	I want to see some dogs peeing.
2723920	2727920	Lions, and bulldogs, and gazelles, and beagles.
2727920	2728920	Wow, you're...
2728920	2732080	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck was that?
2732080	2734960	It was a dog in a freakin' sumo outfit.
2734960	2736160	No, that was, like, a...
2736160	2738560	That looked like a Native American dress thing.
2738560	2740760	No, look at the big rope behind it, see?
2740760	2741760	It's got, um...
2741760	2742760	Oh, it is.
2742760	2743760	Those are, uh, from Shinto shrines.
2743760	2744760	Shrines.
2744760	2745760	That's, like...
2745760	2747200	Actually, it's just like an Ainu, look at the robe.
2747200	2749360	He's like the Lion King, but a dog.
2749360	2751320	He's the Doggin King.
2751320	2752320	Giraffes.
2752320	2754320	The hell game.
2754320	2755320	Cow.
2755320	2758840	Dude, I want to be...
2758840	2762600	I want to fight between...
2762600	2764120	Panda bears killing each other.
2764120	2766120	That was a brown bear and a panda bear.
2766120	2767120	That's pandemonium.
2767120	2768120	Chicken, chickies, and piggies.
2768120	2771120	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2771120	2772120	Did we see...
2772120	2775040	Those two dogs were about to mount each other.
2775040	2776400	Okay.
2776400	2779720	Where the fuck is this game?
2779720	2781760	I will import this shit if I have to.
2781760	2782760	This looks astoun...
2782760	2783760	This looks amazing.
2783760	2786200	Are they going to show this at E3 next week?
2786200	2787200	I don't know.
2787200	2788200	That would be hilarious.
2788200	2791800	Rob, let's get this game, since there's no region coding.
2791800	2793040	Animal dance.
2793040	2794040	Animal dance.
2794040	2795360	Da da da da da da da da.
2795360	2796360	Animal dance.
2796360	2797360	Like, they could set the trailer to that music.
2797360	2798360	It would be amazing.
2798360	2800360	No, you know what they should set it to?
2800360	2801360	What?
2801360	2802360	Um, Gilda Radner.
2802360	2803920	Let's talk Geordi to the animals.
2803920	2806680	This is the new President Cat, as far as I'm concerned.
2806680	2807680	Let's face it, y'all.
2807680	2808680	President Cat ain't happening.
2808680	2809680	Now, I want Tokyo Jungle.
2809680	2811640	I posted a link on my Twitter.
2811640	2812640	It was today.
2812640	2813640	All right.
2813640	2819320	The story is, like, in Tokyo, little dogs are the king of the jungle, and it's basically
2819320	2820880	talking about...
2820880	2823840	It's the commercial, I guess, I think, for the game.
2823840	2825320	But yeah, it's seriously awesome.
2825320	2826320	All right.
2826320	2829520	So yeah, that is now one to kind of keep your eye on, is Tokyo Jungle.
2829520	2830520	I want...
2830520	2831520	Oh, man.
2831520	2832520	Watch.
2832520	2833520	That'll be like...
2833520	2834520	Oh, Vida.
2834520	2838360	That'll be in the corner of the Sony booth somewhere, like, some poor intern doesn't
2838360	2842440	even know anything about the game and has to show it, and it's just, oh, my gosh.
2842440	2843440	Africa.
2843440	2844440	Africa.
2844440	2846520	But that's what Africa should have been.
2846520	2848520	That was Africa with killing.
2848520	2849520	Tokyo.
2849520	2851160	Tokyo Jungle.
2851160	2856480	On the PlayStation Vida, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny, and a Hello Kitty game.
2856480	2861040	Hello Kitty Tohiso Block Crash 5, but let's be real.
2861040	2864480	You're all waiting for June 14th when Persona 4 comes out on the Vida.
2864480	2868480	Let's just be real right there, exactly.
2868480	2872080	Moving on, lastly, to the Xbox 360.
2872080	2875160	No, nothing until Lollipop Chainsaw on the 14th.
2875160	2876680	I want to play that.
2876680	2877680	It does look pretty awesome, huh?
2877680	2880480	All right, let's move on to the UK.
2880480	2884560	On June 5th, Madagascar 3, the video game.
2884560	2885720	I was having to do my...
2885720	2887720	I should do my riff raff voice.
2887720	2888720	Master...
2888720	2889720	No.
2889720	2897920	On June 6th, we have Virtual Fighter V Final Showdown, and June 8th, Dungeon Bowl, which
2897920	2901320	I have no idea what it's about, but hey, it's got a neat name.
2901320	2904320	Chair of Swords for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
2904320	2905320	I'm sorry.
2905320	2906320	Game of Boring.
2906320	2907920	I mean, Thrones.
2907920	2909520	Chair of Swords.
2909520	2911520	And Rayman Origins.
2911520	2912520	Chair of Swords.
2912520	2914520	All right, just a few more stories for you guys.
2914520	2917560	I did see one cool thing having to do with that show.
2917560	2918560	What?
2918560	2920360	We're sitting on the throne.
2920360	2923720	Just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
2923720	2924760	But first, Loki.
2924760	2929440	So there are a couple court cases resolved themselves this week.
2929440	2932640	Epic has one lawsuit against Silicon Knights.
2932640	2938400	As you may remember, Silicon Knights was complaining that Unreal Engine is too hard to program
2938400	2939400	in.
2939400	2940400	That's why two humans sucked.
2940400	2945520	It wasn't because we can't make a good game.
2945520	2946520	And they lost.
2946520	2954040	So they owe now $4.45 million to Epic, and yeah.
2954040	2959320	Of course, they are disappointed with the outcome, Silicon Knights, and they're going
2959320	2963640	to appeal, because it can never end.
2963640	2969960	And then finally, Activision is also expected back in court again, because Judge has okayed,
2969960	2976040	no doubt, to continue their lawsuit for their appearance in Band Hero.
2976040	2981320	You may remember that they claimed the agreement was that they would sing their songs as their
2981320	2984080	characters, because they have themselves in the game.
2984080	2988160	However, you can sing anybody's songs with anybody's characters, and so some people took
2988160	2989840	offense to that.
2989840	2994880	And so now they apparently can file their lawsuit.
2994880	3000040	I keep feeling like every few months we hear that that lawsuit has slowly progressed.
3000040	3003760	Well, I mean, dude, it was originally filed in 2009.
3003760	3006120	It's been a long time.
3006120	3008480	Our justice system at work.
3008480	3011280	Moving on, the Wii U.
3011280	3013840	More rumors just ahead of E3.
3013840	3016720	Any day now we'll see if this is true or not, but why not?
3016720	3022560	We'll engage these rumors, because it's from NeoGaf, so clearly it's true.
3022560	3023600	But hey, you never know.
3023600	3024600	You never know.
3024600	3027480	Some people laughed at some of the things we've posted before, and they ended up being
3027480	3029000	true, so who knows?
3029000	3031440	Plus, most of this sounds plausible.
3031440	3035120	So here's the latest features in the latest dev kit.
3035120	3039320	Video chat available, but it must be from the main menu of the system, not while playing
3039320	3040440	a game.
3040440	3042440	That seems plausible.
3042440	3046000	Voice commands available.
3046000	3047000	Why not?
3047000	3049800	Facial recognition, similar to the Xbox Kinect.
3049800	3054480	I don't know how well that works, even on the Kinect, and it's something I never use.
3054480	3059080	And they can technically do it on the DSi and all that, so I mean, yeah, it'll be there,
3059080	3061960	but it's not going to have a point.
3061960	3064600	The ability to suspend games, similar to the 3DS.
3064600	3067560	That'd be cool, and I don't see why not, because they can do that on the Vita, too.
3067560	3069320	Yeah, duh to that.
3069320	3074520	Ability to share achievements with friends by sending videos or screenshots with drawings
3074520	3075520	on them.
3075520	3077800	That would be pretty cool.
3077800	3082360	That could make the internet a lot more fun, if you think about it.
3082360	3085000	The TTP possibilities with that are quite quick.
3085000	3086760	Yeah, so that could-
3086760	3087760	Achievement, penis!
3087760	3095840	Imagine that the game, right up to you getting the achievement, actually takes a video, not
3095840	3099480	just of your feeding game, but also video of your face.
3099480	3100480	Like Burnout.
3100480	3102720	You remember that Burnout game that would show video of you?
3102720	3104920	So basically it's Pikura.
3104920	3107680	This could be interesting.
3107680	3111200	Other interesting one, I want to know if you think this is plausible.
3111200	3115240	Watch a friend play online.
3115240	3118880	Well they kind of have that with spectating, but not all games support that, like on Xbox
3118880	3122120	360, so maybe.
3122120	3123120	Why not?
3123120	3126280	It would definitely seem the technology's there, and people are doing it with Ustream
3126280	3128520	and Twitch TV and all this stuff.
3128520	3131000	People are just sitting there watching other people play games.
3131000	3135000	It would be cool, I mean, I don't know, maybe.
3135000	3136000	It'd be interesting.
3136000	3137480	And lastly, multitasking.
3137480	3142120	For example, keep a text or video walkthrough open from the site while playing the game.
3142120	3143880	Swap back and forth as needed.
3143880	3148120	Can't you do that already with the, well you can on the Vita, I don't remember if you can
3148120	3149120	do that on the 3DS.
3149120	3151520	You sort of can.
3151520	3155480	You can't like have the internet and your game going.
3155480	3159240	Because those are two different applications, but you can have your game going and then
3159240	3164600	you can like, I don't, there's not a lot you can do with the game suspended, I don't think.
3164600	3169280	Because you really, like if you launch anything else, it says, you can go look at your friends
3169280	3170280	list.
3170280	3171280	On the 3DS.
3171280	3172280	And your notifications.
3172280	3173280	That's about it.
3173280	3174280	You can.
3174280	3176920	Because you can like open stuff, as long as you're not trying to run two games at the
3176920	3177920	same time.
3177920	3182000	I can see that it's possible, also with the other screen, maybe, you know, have a walkthrough
3182000	3183000	on there.
3183000	3184000	Could be.
3184000	3189360	So I, hey, if this is all true, especially kind of like the video screenshot drawing
3189360	3193280	stuff, that's the kind of stuff that I would like Nintendo to surprise us with.
3193280	3197060	That would make me go, oh okay, maybe they do get online.
3197060	3198120	So we'll see.
3198120	3201200	Of course this could just all be fan wank and come visit my website.
3201200	3204440	Well, and the other thing too, is I don't know how much of this they would actually
3204440	3207160	be talking about at E3, you know what I mean?
3207160	3209440	That's a lot of bullet points for stuff.
3209440	3215080	Oh well, I think all that would come to light in the press announcements or the behind the
3215080	3220160	scenes, like it's not gonna be at the keynote, but it would, you'd see it behind the scenes.
3220160	3225160	A lot of that stuff tends to come out of interviews and stuff and sites going in asking the questions,
3225160	3226520	is this true, is this true?
3226520	3228640	You know, and some of the stuff they read on the internet.
3228640	3229640	So.
3229640	3235600	Alright, well, enough of all this new fangled Wii U drawing penises on your achievement
3235600	3239480	stuff, let's go back to a time when games were a little bit simpler.
3239480	3243880	Take a trip down memory lane with a classic game of the week.
3243880	3248600	Dark Soccer's gonna step into the vault and pull out one game that she thinks, hey, play
3248600	3249600	this.
3249600	3250600	Or GTFO.
3250600	3254920	We didn't have GTFO when I was little, it was get off my lawn.
3254920	3257240	Here it is, your classic game of the week.
3257240	3263800	It's Guitar Freaks, wow, is a music game by Konami where you use a guitar.
3263800	3268920	That should just be all there is to know, but let's go a bit further than that.
3268920	3272680	Basically it's mostly rock and J-pop.
3272680	3280680	It's seriously, even every source that you look at is gonna say, oh, that's what led
3280680	3285300	to Guitar Hero, even though they tried to deny it in my living room that it was because
3285300	3287720	of Guitar Freaks.
3287720	3294400	Now it's on its 19th version, Guitar Freaks V8, which came out March 28th, 2011.
3294400	3300080	And it is said to be the final release of Guitar Freaks V.
3300080	3305480	There will be a spinoff, Guitar Freaks XG, actually, well, there was one that came out
3305480	3308800	in Japanese arcades on March 10th, 2010.
3308800	3312400	Add two more buttons, add it to the fret bar instead of the three.
3312400	3319560	And there is a sequel called Guitar Freaks XG2 that came out March 9th, 2011.
3319560	3323560	So the controller looks kind of like a Fender Jazzmaster or a Fender Mustang.
3323560	3326760	It has three buttons, red, green, and blue.
3326760	3338440	And it has a pick lever so that you also have a knob that you can use as an effector and
3338440	3342480	it'll add like chorus and delay effects to your guitar.
3342480	3354920	Anyway, so it really plays a lot like a reverse pop music or reverse BeatMania 2DX where everything
3354920	3360560	scrolls very DDR style, you know, from bottom to top, except it uses the bars and you have
3360560	3366600	to use your strum lever while you hold the appropriate colored button.
3366600	3370960	And you can pull your bar back when you see a little guitar flashing on the screen and
3370960	3373400	you get a wailing bonus.
3373400	3379480	And in some cases you even have hidden things that you can play that will populate this
3379480	3384000	new, I'm glad you picked that song because that's like one of the best songs ever.
3384000	3395480	It'll populate a, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh yeah, a new series of items to play
3395480	3397080	on the screen.
3397080	3400320	I was actually very distracted because Rob picked Fire, you should play a little bit
3400320	3401320	of that.
3401320	3402320	Cool.
3402320	3410880	My husband and I would play the crap out of this song.
3410880	3415240	So anyway, basically your life is powered by your...
3415240	3419880	Wait a minute, this is somebody who edited Fire to be the Mega Man song, that's not the
3419880	3420880	song.
3420880	3424880	No, but I meant, that's not the song.
3424880	3428280	That actually is kind of rad though.
3428280	3430640	Yeah, well I knew it sounded wrong, but I like it.
3430640	3431640	Alright, let me find the real Fire.
3431640	3434560	Find the real Fire, because real Fire is good.
3434560	3436480	Although it sounds very MIDI like.
3436480	3437480	That is pretty awesome.
3437480	3441400	See there's the right one.
3441400	3443400	Yeah this is it.
3443400	3446480	This is the full version.
3446480	3448280	That's fine.
3448280	3453680	Let me get to where the guitar is.
3453680	3458960	I like the...
3458960	3462120	I can totally hear where somebody heard the Mega Man song in that though.
3462120	3463120	Yeah.
3463120	3468960	Anyway, your scoring depends on how accurate you are with hitting low key.
3468960	3472560	You have perfect, great, good, poor, and miss.
3472560	3477520	Ratings of poor and miss will deplete your group gauge, perfect and great will replenish
3477520	3478520	it.
3478520	3484160	If your group gauge is empty completely, you fail, and the game is over.
3484160	3490320	Um, to determine how the cabinet is set up, you have one to five songs, and you can earn
3490320	3496040	additional songs in some versions of the game like a bonus.
3496040	3502280	You also have session link, which would hook up the Guitar Freaks with the Dramania, and
3502280	3505380	basically you have like a little band set up.
3505380	3508760	But back in the day, we had Super Session.
3508760	3510240	I miss this so much.
3510240	3511880	So do I.
3511880	3517000	There were only two versions of Guitar Freaks and Dramania that had Super Session.
3517000	3522320	It hooked up with the Keyboard Mania third mix, and that worked with Guitar Freaks fifth
3522320	3527000	Dramania fourth, and Guitar Freaks sixth Dramania fifth.
3527000	3531520	And you only have like a handful of songs that you could play on the Super Session,
3531520	3533840	but they were freaking cool.
3533840	3541040	Like um, what was the one that we would always, always play that was um, I could not tell
3541040	3543680	you of this, this far after.
3543680	3552320	The one that had a really cool drum beat um, Right On Time, that was it.
3552320	3553320	Wow.
3553320	3554320	We would always play Right On Time.
3554320	3555320	That's amazing, you remember that.
3555320	3559800	I actually just listened to that song the other day, but I had the Japanese version
3559800	3561520	of it, so anyway.
3561520	3566400	Um, so yeah, there's something like over 500 songs available for Guitar Freaks because
3566400	3571200	there's been so many versions, thank you Rob.
3571200	3584880	And uh, this is Right On Time, the drum, when you play this in the uh, medium mode, it was
3584880	3585880	just like constant.
3585880	3589800	I could do it for a while, and remember those calluses I had on my hands from playing the
3589800	3594640	damn drum, because we would buy our own drumsticks, and use our own drumsticks.
3594640	3601800	Um, but um, as far as the different versions of them, I don't even know if I have time
3601800	3603880	to list them all because there's so many.
3603880	3605200	Yeah, let's not.
3605200	3607400	Well, I'll put it this way.
3607400	3608400	Fuck tons.
3608400	3612200	We've been everything, we've had regular mixes up to 11th, and then there was an 8th mix
3612200	3623680	of power-up versions, we've had V2, V3, V4, Rock X Rock, or Rock X Cross Rock, V5, Rock
3623680	3633840	to Infinity, V6 Blazing, XG, V7, XG2, Groove to Live, V8, XG3 that came out February 2012,
3633840	3642560	Guitar Freaks V4 and V2 Infinity that were, um, uh, looks like, uh, European releases.
3642560	3648280	So there's just been all kinds of different versions, and also, um, for, uh, the Drummania
3648280	3654280	ones over in, um, other countries they were called Percussion Freaks, just saying.
3654280	3655280	So that's it.
3655280	3657560	I still was waiting for Sax Maniacs.
3657560	3658560	Someday.
3658560	3659560	Someday.
3659560	3660560	Don't give up hope.
3660560	3662280	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
3662280	3666520	Guitar Freaks, originally in the arcade, but eventually on the Playstation in Japan.
3666520	3671760	And uh, clearly part of the inspiration for Guitar Hero, because again, Red Octane, who
3671760	3680080	funded the original Guitar Hero, used to make, used to make, uh, those controllers for Guitar
3680080	3685120	Freaks, which had five buttons on them at one point, which Guitar Freaks never had five
3685120	3688280	buttons, and everybody was like, why are they putting out five button controllers?
3688280	3690520	XG has it now, ew.
3690520	3691520	Alright.
3691520	3695800	Anyhow, um, we were gonna go right into rapid fire news, I think in light of the power outage
3695800	3698960	a couple weeks ago, I think I should save what we've done so far, so let's do a quick
3698960	3709200	in-studio break, we'll be right back with more Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
3709200	3715360	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, not live, on this June the 3rd of 2012, but
3715360	3721200	psst, it's a radio trick, we're taping on May 31st a few days beforehand, but uh, thanks
3721200	3725280	to those of you that showed up to chat along with the show anyway at vognetwork.com, and
3725280	3731560	we will be back live next week, June the 10th of 2012, and podcast folks, hey, you got another
3731560	3735760	show this week, so, enjoy, even though it'll be a little bit shorter tonight, because we're
3735760	3739320	missing the live interaction, and just, since it's earlier in the week, there's not as much
3739320	3744720	to talk about, but hey, we do still have plenty of news, including tonight's rapid fire news,
3744720	3746360	which Loki's gonna start us off with.
3746360	3751840	Yes, there is a new Ratchet & Clank game announced, it will also be, well actually, it's only
3751840	3755160	gonna be released on the Playstation Network, kind of like what they did with the second
3755160	3760880	Ratchet & Clank game, or no, there's like a middle Ratchet & Clank game, like the second
3760880	3766240	and the third one was out on the consoles, but it's Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault,
3766240	3768500	and it's coming this fall.
3768500	3773000	All those Ratchet & Clank games have kind of suggestive names, don't they?
3773000	3778120	Yeah, I mean, the last one that was released only on the Playstation Network was Ratchet
3778120	3786200	& Clank Future Quest for Booty, so, I don't know, but yeah, it looks interesting, if you're
3786200	3787200	a Ratchet.
3787200	3788600	Did they find the booty?
3788600	3795080	They probably did, of course, it's been rumored for a while that Battlefield 3 is gonna try
3795080	3800600	to pull Call of Duty Elite and come out with their own service, and they have, it actually
3800600	3805760	leaked out, and then they finally announced it, well actually, no, I believe it leaked
3805760	3811040	out and they, I don't know if they've confirmed it or whatever, but what ended up happening
3811040	3816560	is there's this Battlefield 3 premium service, it's gonna cost you 50 bucks, and includes
3816560	3820280	five themed expansion packs, some of which have already been announced, and actually
3820280	3825560	one that's already out, back to Carcland, which was a pre-order bonus if you bought
3825560	3832320	the game, and then of course the Close Quarters DLC, which I think is out, or it's coming
3832320	3839180	out, no, it's coming out next week, on June 4th, and then they have, let's see, Armored
3839180	3844480	Kill, Aftermath, and Endgame are the next three as well, and apparently you're gonna
3844480	3851480	get exclusive weapons and also two weeks access early to said packs as well of other unique
3851480	3854960	in-game items if you pay 50 bucks.
3854960	3858360	I don't know, it seems like they're trying to copy what they're doing with Call of the
3858360	3861680	Elite, and of course they're gonna want to do that because, if it works, if the shoe
3861680	3866920	fits, they made quite a bit of money, but originally it came out, it was on the European
3866920	3872280	PlayStation Network store, and then it got pulled, but, you know, once it's on the internet,
3872280	3878160	that's right, screenshots, so, alright, well moving on, if you want to get some good games
3878160	3882760	and do some good, there's always the Humble Indie Bundle available at HumbleBundle.com,
3882760	3887560	and you know, every time one of these bundles comes out, the internet blows up with, best
3887560	3892960	one yet, well, the fifth one, Humble Indie Bundle 5, was just announced today, and guess
3892960	3899720	what, best one yet, I already bought it, like for real, like, okay, here's the deal, Psychonauts,
3899720	3905720	Limbo, Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery, EP, and Amnesia are all available, and if you
3905720	3912560	pay above the average price, you get Bastion, which, you know, all, there's tons of great
3912560	3915240	games, every single one of those games is something, got it for five dollars and sixty
3915240	3919840	cents to get Bastion, I'm sure that the average price is way higher, I've already got most
3919840	3924560	of those, yeah, I know, I have Amnesia, but you know what, it's not just about being able
3924560	3928340	to get the games cheap, but that you are doing some good, because the money doesn't just
3928340	3932120	go to the developers, but it goes to, if you want, again, you get to choose how you divvy
3932120	3936720	up the money, it goes to the Humble Indie Bundle, or Child's Play Charity EFF, so if
3936720	3940580	you want, you can plunk down fifteen bucks, give it all to Child's Play Charity, and say
3940580	3944880	to everybody else, none for you, buy, and that's how, you know, you divvy up the money.
3944880	3948480	Right now, as of the taping of the show, the minimum is seven dollars and fifty-one cents,
3948480	3953640	I imagine that's gonna climb closer to ten bucks by the time, it's still worth it, shit,
3953640	3961320	these games together, easily worth sixty, for, honestly, the price of a regular retail
3961320	3967320	game, why not? So, if you're feeling charitable, or shit, you just want some good games, head
3967320	3974000	over to HumbleBundle.com, again, it's been, it's been out for one day, already up to one
3974000	3977720	hundred and eighty-seven thousand, one hundred and, this number's just climbing, forty-six,
3977720	3982940	eight, fifty, just keeps climbing, I imagine by the time Sunday rolls around, they'll easily
3982940	3988900	be at a half million. Easily. Easy. So, Humble Indie Bundle 5. Uh, we kinda mentioned this
3988900	3993680	already earlier in the show, but, if you missed it, Game Informer Magazine is teasing, in
3993680	3999960	the shadows, a new Gears of War, apparently to be on the July issue of their magazine,
3999960	4004760	obviously, if this is, you know, what it is, it could be Gears of War 4, it could be a
4004760	4010360	Gears of War spin-off game, it's a prequel, so, just like pre-Gears of War. It's a prequel,
4010360	4015720	Gears of Battle. It's a prequel because of spoilers regarding the main characters, so.
4015720	4020400	I see, okay. There, there, there cannot be a sequel with the main character. Well, that,
4020400	4024280	it doesn't, whoever said it had to be the main character, it could be the main, look,
4024280	4029040	in one of the Mass Effect games, it's Phoenix, they kill Shepard and bring him back, and
4029040	4032360	that's not a spoiler because that's in the very beginning of the game, Mass Effect 2,
4032360	4038360	so anything is possible, you know? I always love when people say, oh no, they can't do
4038360	4042440	it, it's a prequel. Time travel and shit, they can do whatever they want, look what
4042440	4044600	they did with Star Trek, for fuck's sake. It's another Gears of War game. They found
4044600	4048680	a way to maybe bring Con back, although they swear up and down it's not gonna happen. Whatever,
4048680	4054640	it's another Gears of War game. Alright, well whatever it is, it's coming soon, as in E3
4054640	4062040	soon. Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura. Um, yeah. Some more stuff, how about Spy Hunter?
4062040	4064760	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Well, I was playing that
4064760	4070040	on my iPad, actually, the Spy Hunter, which, the control sucks, because it's no steering
4070040	4077460	wheel, you have to tilt your iPad. Well, um, basically it's a reboot on the handhelds,
4077460	4088000	it's basically super spy racing type game. Ooh. Um, basically you are the, uh, the spy,
4088000	4092720	and you have to go catch bad guys. And you do that in a fast vehicle, and you destroy
4092720	4100080	enemy vehicles. Your car is called the G-6155 Interceptor, which is, uh, supposed to transform
4100080	4106320	from a supercar to offer an assault vehicle to a speedboat. So, you can, uh, go hunt and
4106320	4111120	capture those nasty, nasty spies. But the real question is, did they license the theme
4111120	4116440	from Peter Gunn, because if not, forget it. Uh, they have the theme in the, um, a remix
4116440	4122880	dubstep of the, oh god. Dubstep is evil. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
4122880	4128820	doo doo doo doo doo. Anyways, Bingdom by Warner Brothers Interactive, um, and, uh, yeah. It's
4128820	4134720	supposed to be on 3DS and PS Vita in the fall. You know. What do dubstep and downtown Julie
4134720	4142200	Brown have in common. Wubba wubba. Wubba wubba wubba! So Capcom has registered a trademark
4142200	4148320	for a potential game called Remember Me. We don't really know anything else about that
4148320	4154520	except that it was filed on May 22nd this year, in both the US and Europe. So maybe
4154520	4161360	this will be something at E3? Who knows? Who cares? It could be the subtitle to another
4161360	4169440	game too, right? It may not necessarily be a standalone game. Maybe. Remember Me, the
4169440	4173240	sensible Capcom, they put out regular games that were fun and people liked buying them
4173240	4178480	and we didn't have download content that was on disk. Remember Me, sensible Capcom? Well,
4178480	4184640	I'm gone forever. And now it's time for a joke that nobody but maybe two of our listeners
4184640	4197840	will get. Actually, you know what I was distracted by, Rob? A story about this guy eating his
4197840	4202160	roommate's brain and heart. Ew, that's like that grody old, have you read about all that
4202160	4207920	crap coming out of Canada? That doesn't happen in Canada. The guy eating faces in Florida,
4207920	4213080	but if I lived in Florida I'd probably go crazy too. What is wrong with humanity right
4213080	4217440	now? This guy was in Maryland, I think he was too close to the capitol. Is it the moon?
4217440	4222640	Is it that big moon going on causing people to eat people's faces? Well, it's always something
4222640	4230080	like that. Asteroid, moon, virus, Wednesday, I don't know, it causes zombies. But the guy
4230080	4235200	was turned in actually by his dad. People stop being ridiculous. Oh, that guy in Canada
4235200	4241800	got caught finally? No, no, this guy named Alexander Kinyua ate his roommate's heart
4241800	4249200	and brain and his dad found him with the head and hands in a bucket in his basement. His
4249200	4255080	dad turned him in. Do not Google that guy who they want in Canada because you'll read
4255080	4258560	all these stories about it. He didn't just do fucked up things to humans and you will
4258560	4264800	get mad. You will get mad. Allegedly, I have to say allegedly. But there was a guy in Japan
4264800	4269800	who killed a couple of women and ate them and now he's a celebrity and does tours. What?
4269800	4275600	Serious. And no evidence. It's gone. He wrote. That sounds like the plot of natural born
4275600	4280520	killers. Did you ever see that? No, that was Robert Downey Jr. back when he was on drugs.
4280520	4285800	I'll find the guy's name. But he he he did it like 30 years ago and now he like goes
4285800	4291320	around doing tours about what it's like to eat people. That's totally sounds like the
4291320	4296920	plot to natural born killers. All right. Ayo. Moving on. I need some happiness and cheerfulness.
4296920	4300920	So let's look at video games. Loki. I got his name. No, I don't want it. His name is
4300920	4306960	Issei Sagawa. Send it back. You know, there's nothing more happier and cheerful than Doom
4306960	4316300	3. Doom 3 is getting the HD treatment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. And not only
4316300	4322760	are you getting Doom 3 with HD graphics, extra levels, 3D support. They even have head mounted
4322760	4328840	display support, which I'm not really sure there's that many head mounted displays out
4328840	4334040	there. I know that apparently John Carmack made one and it had duct tape on it. Here's
4334040	4339640	the thing. John Carmack has one. So that's why it's in the game. Oh, yeah. So he's supporting
4339640	4346560	it. And yeah, Doom one and two are also included and it's supposed to be out this fall. So
4346560	4355000	that's kind of cool, I guess. I mean, here's another awesome question. Why Doom 3? Because
4355000	4358440	just because maybe it was kind of over, I don't want to say it was overlooked, but it
4358440	4364040	certainly didn't have that same cultural grab that the first two did. Well, Doom 3, because
4364040	4374080	they are new game rage bombed. Why not Quake 3? Well, Quake 3 was Quake. It's basically
4374080	4379200	Quake Live now. Yeah, Quake Live, which I think, don't they have Quake 3 on Xbox Live Arcade?
4379200	4383800	They do, you're right, they do. I actually have it. And technically they're releasing
4383800	4388560	Quake, well they actually are releasing Quake 4 again. Really? Quake 4 wasn't very good.
4388560	4392600	On Xbox 360. That was one of the launch titles for 360, remember that? Yeah, here's the thing
4392600	4397600	I want to kind of know about it though, is remember, the launch title, and hopefully
4397600	4401720	you can find it dirt cheap now, it, I mean the game wasn't very good, but it came with
4401720	4409080	Quake 2 on another disc. Which was good. That's right. The even, the even numbered Quakes,
4409080	4413000	it's like the opposite of Star Trek, the even numbered Quakes are not very good. Quake 2
4413000	4418840	was pretty good. It wasn't a fan. Quake 3 was great. Compared to 1 and 3, I mean 3 was
4418840	4423320	like the best. Ascii Quake, Rob. It's only gonna be 20 bucks, it's supposed to be coming
4423320	4426840	out in like two weeks. Well that's pretty awesome. Or you can buy one of the original
4426840	4434600	copies for probably like 5 bucks, and get it now. Alright. Well if you're not into first
4434600	4438580	person shooters, maybe you're into first person role playing games, and one of the biggest
4438580	4444320	ones out there right now is Skyrim, and guess what, finally an expansion coming, we don't
4444320	4449760	know exactly when yet, but we do finally have a title. This is one of those like, pre-E3
4449760	4453080	leaks where the companies try to get a jump on all that press coverage that's gonna be,
4453080	4457780	you know, cause everybody's fighting for time during E3 week. Like literally, I mean things
4457780	4461200	get brutal during E3 week, like literally there's invites out there that are telling
4461200	4466700	people, hey cancel your meeting and come to our booth. Like, really? That's how desperate
4466700	4472360	people are to get seen at E3. So some people get the jump on it. So Bethesda leaked the
4472360	4477840	trailer for Skyrim Dawnguard, the expansion, a little bit early. And you know there's a
4477840	4482100	whole trailer out there that doesn't really say a whole lot except that there's gonna
4482100	4486800	be a crossbow weapon, which we kinda already knew from some of the patch things. What is
4486800	4492120	this? You can turn into a bunch of bats, so there's a vampire theme going on, which was
4492120	4494440	already in the game, right? You can already be a vampire, but this actually shows like
4494440	4499120	you can transform into like a giant bat thing and like fly, like kind of a really weird
4499120	4504480	No no no no no no no bat thing. You know, bat thing, I don't know. You know, once again
4504480	4507840	though the graphics, you know, look pretty good cause it's all in the, you know, Skyrim
4507840	4512720	engine which looked good to begin with. Here's the somewhat bummer, if you were playing this
4512720	4517360	on the Playstation 3 like I was or the PC like Alan was, you're shit out of luck cause
4517360	4523820	this is coming to the Xbox 360 first for 1600 Microsoft points, that's 20 bucks in real
4523820	4530920	money soon, as in this summer soon. 30 days later is when the rest of us can play it because
4530920	4539400	Microsoft basically sold their soul to get this and so can you in the expansion to Skyrim.
4539400	4544920	Because Microsoft gives it up better. So, I like the little castle on fire, the little
4544920	4551520	like dark castle looking thing. It's like the little obsidian portal in Minecraft, but
4551520	4557800	prettier. Uh, Loki, you played way more Skyrim than I did, what's your interest level in
4557800	4563120	this? I'm interested in it, um, I'm not as excited as before, you know, cause I was like
4563120	4566640	oh I'm gonna get whatever expansion they put out, but like it has to do with vampires.
4566640	4569760	I haven't really done anything with vampires, I've been just trying to make sure I don't
4569760	4575640	turn into a vampire because it's lame. Um, not because of Twilight, but I just don't
4575640	4579320	want to be a vampire or a werewolf in the game. I like that horse that was on fire though.
4579320	4585040	I like that map. But, we'll see. That glowing electron. Oh I think that was the Elder Scrolls.
4585040	4588560	Um, you know what though, when you said that you were interested in that it totally made
4588560	4593680	me think of Alucard. I'm interested in this. That is kinda, it does look like you can play
4593680	4597720	as Alucard in this. That would be cool. I would play Skyrim if I could be Alucard. I
4597720	4602320	just wish. You can name your character Alucard. I mean, it would be really impossible for
4602320	4608880	them to add it later on cause it's such a rewrite of code, but I just want, you know,
4608880	4614120	I know that they have Skyrim, or not Skyrim, Elder Scrolls Online, which is really weird
4614120	4619000	because it gets lamer and lamer each update that they put out on it. It's like every update
4619000	4624200	that there is for it, I get less and less interested in this game. But, I really wish
4624200	4630400	there was just like co-op. Like four player co-op in Skyrim would be fucking awesome.
4630400	4636280	Alright. Well, this is the part of the show where we'd move into the mailbag segment,
4636280	4643200	except there's no emails tonight. So, instead we're gonna plug and say, email us! Mailbag
4643200	4649360	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us. And we'll read your email next week. Shirley,
4649360	4652760	with E3 going on, there's gonna be something that makes you want to email us and have your
4652760	4657600	voice heard. So, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. And don't call them Shirley. Alright, let's
4657600	4680480	get into the FUs of the week. Lack of email makes us angsty. Um, my FD goes to this continuously
4680480	4690040	not having a voice. So, yeah. Boo. Loki? Um, FU to the fact that I can't go to E3. I kind
4690040	4695760	of miss going to E3 each year. It's been a couple years now that I haven't been able
4695760	4701800	to go. Even if it is a lame E3, I still like going and playing this stuff. And my co-worker,
4701800	4709080	well not my co-worker, my boss and his boss get to go. They go to meetings. It's like,
4709080	4713360	so what did you go check out at E3? Oh, we didn't even go on the show floor. The fuck
4713360	4718720	are you doing there then? Oh, I'm going to meetings. Oh, because you can't have meetings.
4718720	4725440	To be fair. I understand. It is business. No, okay, no. I understand. It's business.
4725440	4729600	But then they go through like, oh, we went through a couple of booth walkthroughs of
4729600	4735600	like, like what was it? Last year. I'm trying to think of what they saw last year. It was
4735600	4741440	something very lame. I don't even remember what it was. It may have been Bethesda. But
4741440	4748440	yeah, it's just, they waste time there. We would like to display our new game cat butthole.
4748440	4752320	No, no, no. I do take that back. It is their fault because you know why? Because they only
4752320	4758200	go down for like one or two days. They miss a day or two of the time there and like, what
4758200	4761760	the fuck? You could be hitting the show floor. But here's the thing. They don't fucking care
4761760	4772920	and his boss. I'm sorry. Look, maybe next year, maybe next year. Um, I F you to just
4772920	4776240	too much to do and not enough time to do it and F you to the fact that I kind of bring
4776240	4783120	that on myself. So F you to that. That's what you get for procrastinating. It's not even
4783120	4788960	procrastinating. It's just maybe, maybe I don't know how to say no. And maybe I need
4788960	4792560	to learn that has nothing to do with this program or vog or anything like that. It's
4792560	4798000	just other things in life that maybe I need to just say, maybe it's time to stop because
4798000	4808280	I'm just too damn busy. So what? It is possible to say no. I say it to you all the time. No.
4808280	4814900	All right. Anyhow, that's it for the F you to the week. Let's get into a few more stories
4814900	4820680	for you guys before we say good night. Loki. Um, there's rumor that, well, there's always
4820680	4826200	a rumor that there's going to be an announcement of an, a redesign of the three ds, but, um,
4826200	4830480	it's actually looking like that it may actually happen this year. Um, and the reason behind
4830480	4836140	that is Amazon has stopped carrying the three ds. Um, not necessarily that they've stopped
4836140	4841040	selling it, but they themselves have stopped selling it on the website. It's only available
4841040	4846360	through third party. Um, you know, providing like, cause you know, like any, anybody can
4846360	4852020	go on Amazon sell stuff, but there's actually stuff that's sold directly by Amazon and that's
4852020	4858220	in the U S region. Not only that, but in Japan they also have stopped, um, having the three
4858220	4863800	ds available. So why do you think they've stopped selling the three ds? Maybe because
4863800	4868560	there's another three ds coming out. Did somebody report the original three ds is flawed to
4868560	4873700	Amazon and they stopped selling it. That could have happened too. Maybe. No. So I, well,
4873700	4877940	what about the new color? I know that's crazy, but weren't they going to discontinue like
4877940	4881020	blue or something because of the new color pan. They just continue. I'm talking about
4881020	4887780	all colors, every single color in the U S right now. It will maybe not purple, but everything
4887780	4895340	Aqua blue, Pearl, pink, um, Cosmo, black and flame red are all being shipped. Um, never
4895340	4900100	fulfilled by Amazon. In other words, you know, they were doing the shipping, but not sold
4900100	4909300	by Amazon. Um, so it's interesting. Um, the other thing is, you know, there, the thoughts
4909300	4914020	are that there's a rumor that they're going to announce monster Hunter for, um, the three
4914020	4923540	ds coming, you know, this E3 as well for the North American region. All right. I mean,
4923540	4931420	there's going to be a redesign. It's just when I think it could be this holiday. Uh,
4931420	4937860	this is pretty shitty is a rumors and fakeness all over the interwebs. And, uh, I, I, I did
4937860	4941860	want to bring it up though because there was a part of me that went, well, what if square
4941860	4945900	Unix announced what's going to be at their booth? That part's not a lie. And what I thought
4945900	4949780	was interesting was completely missing from that list was final fantasy versus 13 because
4949780	4953660	it's like, shouldn't that fucking game be out by now? Like how long has that been in
4953660	4958160	development and we've, you know, whatever. So the thought out there is, well, maybe it's
4958160	4962540	like a secret. Maybe something's happening with it and they're going to show it at one
4962540	4967940	of the conferences or something. So this crazy ass rumor came out complete with fake footage
4967940	4975060	that final fantasy versus 13 was renamed to final fantasy 15 to be fair. That part I'd
4975060	4979100	actually believe. I know a lot of people poo pooing that idea. I'd actually believe that.
4979100	4983020	I still don't understand how they tie with each other. And you know what? I believe more
4983020	4987980	that they renamed final fantasy versus 13 to final fantasy 14. What do you mean there
4987980	4998220	was already a, just shh, but there's already a file fancy for shh. Anyhow, uh, it's just,
4998220	5003380	and apparently the game was going to be coming to the Wii U. Now people, and I guess it's
5003380	5007460	because of the footage was, I didn't even watch the footage, but I'm looking at it here.
5007460	5014340	This like one minute clip here. Oh God, you can just tell that that's an overlaid thing.
5014340	5017220	But apparently, you know, people are watching this footage or whatever, and then you see
5017220	5027300	the logo for final fantasy 15 and yeah, it doesn't look too convincing. Um, but it did
5027300	5032220	kind of make me stop and go, well, why couldn't it be on the Wii U? I mean the Wii U is supposed
5032220	5037540	to be getting all this other stuff. Here's why they wouldn't put it all only on the Wii
5037540	5041740	U. It's because we're supposed to be fair with PlayStation three and Wii U like somebody
5041740	5047340	took out the Xbox logo and put the Wii U logo. They're not going to do that. I mean, come
5047340	5051380	on. They know, they know that they need to make money on this stuff. They're not going
5051380	5057180	to cut out the Xbox just because the Wii U, I mean they're, they, they sold plenty of
5057180	5061660	copies of, you know, final fantasy 13 and 13 two on the Xbox that they're not going
5061660	5065540	to ignore that 14 was cut for totally different reasons that had to do with the Xbox live
5065540	5070900	infrastructure rules that were bent from final fantasy 11. Microsoft would not bend on again
5070900	5076820	because 11 didn't do that well on Xbox. So it, I, they're not going to do that. I'm sorry
5076820	5082940	if it's anything going to be for the Wii U or even like it's always been their own game
5082940	5087340	that's been kind of lame on the Wii. So I think if there's anything on the Wii U, it's
5087340	5094540	going to be another lame Crystal Chronicles game. Same. You never know. Well that if that
5094540	5098700	whole Wii U being similar to the Game Boy Advance linking to the GameCube, there was
5098700	5103300	that final fantasy game that was specifically for that setup. So it'd be very easy to make
5103300	5108060	a sequel to that. Just don't see them doing, I don't, I don't see them coming out with,
5108060	5112020	cause I've seen like rumors, of course, everybody's making up fucking rumors. I mean, there's,
5112020	5116780	there's a rumor I read and even open the page because it just looks stupid. They're talking
5116780	5121820	about, oh, Kingdom Hearts remix. It's going to have all these different characters and
5121820	5125220	stuff from all these games. It's only going to be on the Wii. I'm like, no, it's not.
5125220	5130080	They're not going to do that. Could Square be withholding Kingdom Hearts 3? Can I wish?
5130080	5136260	Can I wish? They've got, they've got plenty of stuff that they're working on right now.
5136260	5140760	If wishes and musts were buckets of, or no, damn it. If wishes and musts were clusters
5140760	5145620	of nuts, we'd all have a bowl of granola. I screwed that up the first time. Sorry. It's
5145620	5150900	a tongue twister. All right, one more story for you guys and then we'll get to the end
5150900	5155740	of the show cause there's no Skypline tonight cause we're not live, but Dark Saga. Well,
5155740	5162100	it is official according to Tim Cook with Apple. Um, they don't really care about doing
5162100	5167780	consoles. They're not interested in doing it right now. Maybe someday, but not now.
5167780	5173420	They're, I mean, basically they're cool with the little, uh, IOS games. That's cool. In
5173420	5178100	fact, he says customers love games and this makes me think of bitches love games, you
5178100	5182780	know, but, um, he goes on a record saying, I'm not interested in being in the console
5182780	5187420	business and what is thought of as traditional gaming, but Apple is a big player today and
5187420	5193000	things in the future will only make that bigger. Well, if the rumor is true that they're building
5193000	5197980	their own TVs and shit, then they can just take the iPad, iPhone stuff over to the TV.
5197980	5202980	That's their money. It's just not console in the traditional sense. That's all. But
5202980	5206320	you can't deny it. Apple's a player in gaming right now. They're probably thinking that
5206320	5213980	they're beyond consoles anyway, so we're bigger than console. Really? Yeah. I mean, Smurfs
5213980	5221140	village just, you know, puts that gears award a shame. They just, they really don't need
5221140	5225380	it. I mean this, to be honest, they don't need, I don't want to see Apple do a console.
5225380	5229500	What they're doing right now is challenging the industry enough. I think, you know, especially
5229500	5234660	Nintendo, the handheld market, they are, you can't deny that the iPhones and iPads are
5234660	5241340	breathing a lot of heat on not just the Vita, but the, you know, three DS to the point where
5241340	5247780	shareholders are calling on Nintendo to put Mario on the iPhone, which is, don't be terrible.
5247780	5252420	I actually agree. It would be terrible cause the touch controls just wouldn't work. On
5252420	5258740	a whim. I got mega man two on the iPhone. It is ass. It is the stuff that comes from
5258740	5262660	the stuff comes out of an ass. You know what they could do though on the iPhone that would
5262660	5267500	work is, um, like a Zelda game, like they have on the three. Yes. It was all stylist
5267500	5275220	control. Oh yeah. It worked. It might work, but it's still side. All right, well that
5275220	5279140	brings us to the end of the show. I checked Twitter earlier and nothing was sent today
5279140	5283380	and uh, we don't have the Skype line cause we're not live. So that really brings us to
5283380	5286460	the end of the show. I will ask Loki if there was anything we didn't cover tonight that
5286460	5290420	he wanted to talk about last minute stories or dark soccer. Oh, you do have one. All right.
5290420	5298860	Guitar P. It is a guitar P urinal that basically has like little strum bars in it and a big
5298860	5303420	fret bar coming out of the top that you can pee in it and then you can actually get a
5303420	5308460	code to download your piece on later. You know what's sad is that as a second time we've
5308460	5312700	talked about P based games in a month. I, that's why I brought it up. I weep for our
5312700	5320220	society is apparently a video up of what guitar P sounds like. No thank you. Yeah. Um, yeah,
5320220	5324740	I do have a few things I was just going to cover real quick. So someone supported super
5324740	5331580	road blaster to the SNES now super road blaster. Um, or I should say a road blaster, which
5331580	5337540	was a 1985 laser disc arcade game with animations like full motion video thing like a dragon's
5337540	5344180	layer or something like that. Um, he's actually created a rom file. That's 6,320 megabits.
5344180	5349720	Although when you compare that with the largest SMES cartridge, which is like 48 megabits,
5349720	5353780	it's a little impossible to run without special software. Um, you can actually get a card
5353780	5361180	or SD, um, to SNES, uh, SD card adapter. They'll allow you to run the game on a physical SNES
5361180	5366420	and it actually, it works and you can download the rom, which is 118 megs over it. Well,
5366420	5371900	for a super Nintendo rom, that's huge. Um, and uh, it plays a full motion video and everything.
5371900	5375740	It's pretty amazing. So that cartridge back in the day probably would have cost about
5375740	5384780	$900. Yeah. It would have had to be like a super gigantic box. It would be the size of
5384780	5391860	a constantly the size of the super NAS basically. Um, so they have that, uh, CD project red.
5391860	5396820	Um, they announced a cyberpunk, um, which is going to be based off the pen and paper
5396820	5401820	game. And I'm all about, you know, RPGs are like, you know, the cyberpunk stuff. So that
5401820	5405980	looks pretty cool. I do have a late tweet. We got a tweet just now, uh, or I should say
5405980	5409900	an hour ago, but that was, uh, while we were in the middle of the show. So here's a question
5409900	5415260	from Oscar who sent a legit question for the show tonight. So we need to entertain it here.
5415260	5422260	Oscar tweets us at twitter.com slash O L R asking tweet for the show. What is a game that frustrated
5422260	5431300	you like no other, a game that frustrated you like no other puzzle and Dessu was one.
5431300	5436260	Why is that? Just cause some of the puzzles get really hard and fast. I mean, it was just
5436260	5442220	a pain. And then, um, shoot at something that actually will fractal actually for a little
5442220	5447820	while was getting me super frustrated because, um, I'm on the part now where you have splits
5447820	5454540	in weird places and um, it'll like completely mess up. You're trying to get your blooms.
5454540	5463460	So it's pretty fucked up. And a few, um, games with puzzles in them, few puzzles. For me,
5463460	5467380	super meat boy, let me put it this way. Alan used to like ask me to play super meat boy
5467380	5470380	cause he used to giggle when I would get really frustrated with the game. Like it was some
5470380	5474540	type of satisfaction for him. So, uh, definitely super meat boy. But that's the whole point
5474540	5479960	of that game is to get frustrated and want to throw the controller. Loki. Um, VVVVV.
5479960	5485920	Oh God. Yes. Oh my God. I know what the, here's the thing is I played that game without downloading
5485920	5492180	on steam and then I just now download it on steam. I can't import my safe. I'm like, fuck
5492180	5497980	that. You can actually copy it, copy it directly out of the safe folder. I hope so. Cause I
5497980	5499980	Not fucking doing that again
5500900	5505000	On the on the 3ds. I'm just stuck in one level that I'm never gonna get past
5505000	5507900	It's when that little asshole is following you and you can't get him killed either
5508700	5515600	I finished all that but I have one more like little shiny object thing to get and it's just like
5516460	5519280	No, I'm no I'm not doing it quit
5520060	5524740	Quit I don't care all right. There's the tweet. Sorry any other stories Loki
5524740	5530940	um yeah retro city rampage speaking of super meat boy has this cool little trailer that they put out for a
5531380	5538380	Game within the game called the virtual meat boy. It's done like virtual the virtual boy, but you're playing as meat boy
5538380	5539380	Oh, that's awesome
5539380	5541260	And you also get to play as me boy in the game, too
5541260	5546540	And it has 3d with like the red red blue glasses if you wanted that's funny because
5547020	5551920	Super meat boy kind of had those throwback stages like there was the NES stages, and there was a gameboy stage
5551920	5556720	I a virtual boy stage makes a lot of sense. That's kind of funny actually yeah, that's pretty awesome
5556720	5560760	And then the last thing I was gonna mention real quick well actually two things
5561280	5565760	Nintendo's patented a new kind of input device for the 3ds. It's a vibrating stylus
5566040	5569960	It's gonna allow you to have some sort of haptic feedback for
5570920	5573760	stuff based on the position I guess of
5574360	5580520	Where the stylus is the camera? I guess the vibrating stylus has changed things around you know usually
5580520	5582520	We have a saying on the show called
5582760	5589360	TTP whenever there's a new piece of hardware coming out, and that's time to penis, but I think this one's gonna be time to but
5590760	5592760	TTB
5593800	5599560	Maybe boob or V and then the last last one was kind of in the line of
5600080	5602520	Why the fuck did they make this CTA did?
5603320	5605320	our CTA
5605960	5609020	Company that makes accessories, and I think they've made they made that
5609020	5610100	I
5610100	5613140	Think for was it a connect adventures member the raft
5613780	5619360	That is completely poor. Oh god. Yes, it was just a raft. Oh my god. Yes, that's amazing. They have done
5620300	5622980	Themselves one more they have made an inflatable
5623940	5626820	Go kart that you can sit in and yes
5626820	5632620	I can play the I heard of this already 3ds Mario Kart 7 game
5632620	5638500	Oh for the 3ds now a giant inflatable cart for your portable console
5638500	5641260	But you put your 3ds within this little like
5641820	5643820	Steering wheel thing it's like why?
5644380	5649940	Why would you spend $40 you don't need to pretend that you're in a cart? It's not
5651460	5653460	Stupid it's just so stupid
5654900	5658020	That's awesome. I'm done all right well
5658020	5661080	That's gonna bring us to the close of another episode of orange lounge radio
5661080	5670240	But not until we go around and get everybody's final thought dark soccer. We'll start with you tonight your final thought
